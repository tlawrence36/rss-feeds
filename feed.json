      "A proposed 100,000-seater arena would surpass Wembley as the biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "Under the plans, the 20-time English champion said it would build next to its iconic Old Trafford ground, likely meaning it would not need to relocate during the construction process.",
      "\u201cOur current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport,\u201d part owner Jim Ratcliffe said. \u201cBy building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford, while creating a truly state-of-the-art stadium that transforms the fan experience only footsteps from our historic home.\u201d",

      "The trial was upended by revelations that ammunition was brought into the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office by a man who said it could be related to Hutchins\u2019 killing.

      "She also presided over the child molestation cases of former teacher Gary Gregor, and the trial of Jeannine Jaramillo, who killed a police officer and retired firefighter during a wrong-way crash while attempting to evade law enforcement.",
      "Marlowe Sommer's term was set to expire in 2028. A judicial nominating commission will consider applicants for the vacancy and recommend to the governor for an appointment to serve the remainder of the term."

      "Not making the top of the bill, but very much in vogue and likely to draw huge crowds, is Charli XCX, who will perform on the Other Stage on the Saturday night. Last week, the singer behind the \u201cBrat summer\" phenomenon, won five Brit awards.",
      "The word \u201cbrat,\u201d used by the singer as the title of her sixth studio album, was declared word of the year by Collins Dictionary. For those not in the know, it's been defined as \u201ccharacterized by a confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude.\u201d",

      "Last month, a London judge ruled that the band cannot be held personally liable for losses of a Malaysian music festival that was shut down by authorities after lead singer Healy kissed a male bandmate on stage. The organizers of the Good Vibes Festival were claiming 1.9 million pounds ($2.4 million) in losses after Healy criticized the country\u2019s anti-homosexuality laws and then kissed bassist Ross MacDonald at the Kuala Lumpur show in July 2023.",
      "Footage of the kiss sparked a backlash in the predominantly Muslim country, where homosexuality is a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning. Some LGBTQ+ groups also criticized the band for endangering its community and disrupting the work of activists pushing for change.",
      "There will be more acts named over the coming weeks and those who haven't got tickets yet will be able to do so in a resale. As always, the festival, which was first held in 1970, was sold out quickly despite the ticket price \u2014 nearly 380 pounds ($490) each.",
      "While the price may be fixed, the mid-summer weather isn't. As always, the hopes of everyone going are the same: Please, no mudbath!"

      "Research by the charity English Heritage suggests it may have found a portrait of England's shortest-reigning queen Lady Jane Grey",
      "LONDON -- A painting that has gone on public display Friday could be the only portrait of England's shortest-reigning queen, Lady Jane Grey, painted during her lifetime, according to the conservation group English Heritage.",
      "It said there is \u201ccompelling\u201d evidence to suggest that the portrait, on loan from a private collection, shows Jane, who was no older than 17 when she became queen for just nine days in the summer of 1553.",
      "One of England's most tragic regal figures, she was executed at the Tower of London in 1554. Jane was a devout Protestant at a time of religious upheaval, the ultimate innocent victim of the chicanery of the Tudor court in the chaotic aftermath of Henry VIII\u2019s reign.",
      "She is perhaps best-known from Paul Delaroche\u2019s painting, \u201cThe Execution of Lady Jane Grey,\u201d which hangs in the National Gallery in central London. Jane, who may have been as young as 16, is shown blindfolded as an executioner with an axe waits to behead her.",
      "But that painting, like the few others that purport to show Jane, all date from after her death.",
      "Now, English Heritage says a Tudor-era work could be a \u201clive\u201d painting of Jane. The portrait, along with six others, will hang at Wrest Park, a country estate west of London managed by English Heritage, and which incidentally is the location of many scenes of Netflix's steamy period drama \"Bridgerton.\"",
      "The charity worked with the Courtauld Institute of Art and scientist Ian Tyers, who specializes in dendrochronology, or the dating of tree rings. It said there is enough evidence to raise the question: \"Could this mysterious portrait be Lady Jane Grey?\"",
      "Among the evidence presented, English Heritage said the tree-dating points to the wooden panel having been constructed between 1539 and around 1571 \u2014 Jane is believed to have been born in 1536 or 1537 and was executed in early 1554. It also said the back of the panel displays a merchant or cargo mark, identical to one used on a royal portrait of King Edward VI, who, in an ultimately tragic turn, anointed his first cousin once removed as his successor.",
      "It also noted a \u201cstriking change\" in the eyes of the sitter to the left rather than the right and that at some point, the eyes, mouth and ears were deliberately scratched out. In addition, it said the sitter was likely wearing a more elaborate costume.",
      "Rachel Turnbull, English Heritage\u2019s Senior Collections Conservator, said the evidence points to the possibility that \u201cwe are looking at the shadows of a once more royal portrait of Lady Jane Grey, toned down into subdued, Protestant martyrdom after her death.\u201d",
      "Jane was bright, reportedly spoke multiple languages and a big fan of Plato. But it was her commitment to Protestantism that interested Edward VI.",
      "Edward VI, the only surviving son of Henry VIII, was the first monarch to be raised a Protestant after his father split from Rome in order to divorce his first wife Catherine of Aragon. His mother was Henry's third wife, Jane Seymour, who Lady Jane was named after.",
      "On being informed in 1553 that he was terminally ill, the 15-year-old Edward wanted to bypass his older sisters Mary and Elizabeth, and named Lady Jane his heir to prevent the realm reverting to Catholicism.",
      "On July 10, Jane became queen but was deposed nine days later after her support melted away in the wake of an uprising by Mary's supporters. Jane was subsequently convicted of treason and sentenced to death."

      "The Connecticut Supreme Court has upheld the murder conviction of a man found guilty of killing his wife in 2015, in a case that drew widespread attention because of evidence from the victim's Fitbit exercise activity tracker",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- Despite finding \u201cimproprieties\u201d were committed by a prosecutor, the Connecticut Supreme Court on Monday upheld the murder conviction of a man found guilty of killing his wife in a case that drew wide attention because the victim's Fitbit exercise tracker contradicted his statements to police.",
      "The justices ruled in a 6-0 decision that Richard Dabate was not deprived of a fair trial because of four missteps by the prosecutor they called \u201ctroubling,\u201d including referring to one of Connecticut's most notorious crimes while cross-examining the man.",
      "Dabate, 48, was convicted of murder and other charges in the fatal shooting of Connie Dabate, 39, at the couple's home in Ellington two days before Christmas in 2015 while their two young sons were in school. He's serving a 65-year prison sentence.",
      "Prosecutors said Dabate wanted his wife dead, in part, because he had a yearslong affair with another woman who was pregnant at the time of the killing and later gave birth to their child.",
      "Dabate staged a phony crime scene, including tying himself up loosely with zip ties and stabbing himself with a box cutter, and told police an unknown intruder in camouflage broke into their home, killed his wife and assaulted him, authorities said.",
      "State police said Dabate gave them a timeline of events that conflicted with data on his wife\u2019s Fitbit, which showed she was moving around for about an hour after the time Dabate said she was shot.",
      "Dabate testified in his defense and maintained his innocence, saying a large masked man with a voice like actor Vin Diesel was the killer.",
      "Part of Dabate's appeal questioned the reliability of the Fitbit evidence and whether the trial judge was wrong to have allowed it, but the Supreme Court upheld the data and its use.",
      "Dabate also accused Tolland State's Attorney Matthew Gedansky of multiple instances of impropriety, including Gedansky mentioning a notorious home invasion in Cheshire in 2007 while cross-examining Dabate. The home invaders killed a woman and her two daughters, ages 11 and 17, after terrorizing them for hours, while the woman's husband survived a vicious beating.",
      "Gedansky asked Dabate if he was trying to create a \u201clittle mini-Cheshire scene\u201d in his own home. The trial judge upheld an objection by Dabate's lawyer and asked Gedansky to rephrase the question, but Gedansky asked nearly the same exact question. The Supreme Court found Gedansky violated the judge's order to rephrase.",
      "\u201cIn referring to a \u2018mini Cheshire,\u2019 the prosecutor\u2019s question was unnecessarily inflammatory because it compared the defendant to other notorious offenders or infamous figures,\u201d Justice Joan Alexander wrote in the decision.",
      "Gedansky and Dabate's lawyer, Trent LaLima, did not immediately return email messages seeking comment Monday.",
      "The Supreme Court also found that Gedansky committed three other improprieties, including suggesting that the jury would have to be unintelligent or lazy to agree with the defense theory of the case.",
      "\u201cWe disapprove of the improprieties committed by the prosecutor during the trial of this case in strong and unqualified terms and expect our message to be taken with the utmost seriousness by prosecutors,\u201d the decision said.",
      "The court said it agreed with Dabate that \u201cthe prosecutor engaged in multiple acts of impropriety at trial that we consider troubling.\u201d",
      "Justices, however, said the state's case was very strong and Gedansky's missteps did not overshadow testimony by 130 witnesses and the 600 exhibits presented during the five-week trial."

    "story": [
      "Utah's governor intends to sign legislation making the state the first to ban fluoride in public water systems",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah will become the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, despite widespread opposition from dentists and national health organizations.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox said he would sign legislation that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Government researchers have found that community water fluoridation prevents about 25% of tooth decay.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got tried and true evidence of the safety and efficacy of this public health initiative,\u201d said American Dental Association President Brad Kessler, of Denver. Cavities could start emerging in children within months or years of Utah stopping fluoridation, Kessler said.",
      "The ban comes weeks after federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, was sworn into office.",
      "\u201cIt's not a bill I care that much about,\u201d Cox added, \u201cbut it's a bill I will sign.\u201d",
      "Utah lawmakers who pushed for a ban said putting fluoride in water was too expensive. Its Republican sponsor, Rep. Stephanie Gricius, acknowledged fluoride has benefits, but said it was an issue of \u201cindividual choice\u201d to not have it in the water.",
      "Cox said that like many people in Utah, he grew up and raised his own children in a community that doesn\u2019t have fluoridated water \u2014 or what he called a \u201cnatural experiment.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou would think you would see drastically different outcomes with half the state not getting it. We haven\u2019t seen that,\u201d Cox said in a weekend interview with ABC4 in Salt Lake City. \u201cSo it\u2019s got to be a really high bar for me if we\u2019re going to require people to be medicated by their government.\u201d",
      "Already, some cities across the country have gotten rid of fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids\u2019 intellectual development.",
      "A Utah teenager who urged lawmakers to pass the bill described suffering a medical emergency when the fluoride pump in Sandy, Utah, malfunctioned in 2019, releasing an excessive amount of the mineral into the drinking water. The fluoride sickened hundreds of residents and led many in Utah to push for its removal.",
      "It\u2019s rare to find high levels of fluoridation in water, according to the National Institutes of Health. The agency said it\u2019s \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to get a toxic dose of fluoride from water with standard levels of the mineral.",
      "Kessler said the amounts of fluoride added to drinking water have been reduced over time and are below levels considered problematic.",
      "\u201cThe science proves that it is effective at reducing cavities with little to no risk of other problems,\u201d he said.",
      "He added that a ban in Utah could have a domino effect with other legislatures being encouraged to follow suit with fluoride bans in their states.",
      "Opponents warned it would disproportionately affect low-income residents who may rely on public drinking water having fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care. Low-income families may not be able to afford regular dentist visits or the fluoride tablets some people buy as a supplement in cities without fluoridation.",
      "Fluoridation is the most cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "Utah in 2022 ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "In February, the city council in Riverton, a Salt Lake City suburb, unanimously passed a resolution to remove fluoride from the city\u2019s public water systems. Voters in Brigham City, 59 miles (95 kilometers) north of the capital city, struck down by a large margin a measure in 2023 that would have removed the mineral from its public water supply.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state\u2019s biggest city, Salt Lake City.",
      "Rodney Thornell, president of the Utah Dental Association, began practicing dentistry in a Salt Lake City suburb before the city added fluoride to its water. His adult patients who grew up locally continue to get lots of cavities but younger patients who grew up with fluoride in the water get fewer, he said.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re going to keep eating sugar, we need fluoride.\u201d Thornell said, noting that Utah residents consume more than the national average of candy and sugary drinks.",

      "WASHINGTON -- America's butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.",
      "The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science.",
      "\u201cButterflies have been declining the last 20 years,\u201d said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. \u201cAnd we don't see any sign that that's going to end.\"",
      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",
      "David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is \u201ccatastrophic and saddening\u201d when compounded over time.",
      "\u201cIn just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!\u201d Wagner said in an email. \"The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.\u201d",
      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies \u2014 which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 \u201cso it could be extinct.\u201d",
      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cYou can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cThat could really improve the situation for a lot of species.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Dr. Marty Makary will answer questions from a Senate panel about his plans to lead the Food and Drug Administration",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Food and Drug Administration is set to answer Senate questions Thursday about his plans for the agency, which may soon be at the center of an administration plan to scrutinize vaccines, antidepressants and ultraprocessed foods.",
      "Dr. Marty Makary \u2014 a surgeon, author and researcher \u2014 is known for his contrarian views and outspoken criticism of the medical establishment. Like health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Makary traces many of the health issues afflicting Americans to food additives, overprescribing of drugs and the influence of drugmakers, insurers and food companies.",
      "To become commissioner, he\u2019ll need a majority vote from members of the Senate\u2019s health committee, who will question him Thursday morning. A confirmation vote by the full Senate is expected later this month.",
      "The FDA has long been a target for Kennedy, who last year vowed to \u201cclear out\u201d entire departments at the agency, including those overseeing nutrition. Kennedy recently called for a \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d commission to review the safety of vaccines, antidepressants, stimulants and weight-loss drugs \u2014 all products regulated by the FDA \u2014 particularly in children.",
      "The approach has been lauded by most Republicans. But Senate Democrats are expected to push Makary on his willingness to break with Kennedy on key issues, including the safety and benefits of childhood vaccinations.",
      "FDA commissioners aren\u2019t typically involved in the agency\u2019s day-to-day scientific reviews, but they often serve as a buffer between FDA staff and political appointees elsewhere in government.",
      "For his part, Makary has been critical of the agency he would lead. While working as a Fox News contributor during COVID-19, he called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Despite such views, Makary is considered one of Trump\u2019s more conventional health nominees and is widely expected to be confirmed. Before the pandemic, Makary was mainly known for influential studies of medical errors, hospital costs and overprescribing of opioids.",
      "Headquartered in the suburbs outside Washington, the FDA oversees medical products plus billions of dollars in consumer goods, including most foods, cosmetics and vaping products.",
      "Makary would take over at a particularly turbulent period for the agency. Last month, the FDA abruptly fired hundreds of medical reviewers, researchers and inspectors, only to rehire some of them a week later. Several senior FDA officials have resigned or retired in recent months. The agency is also expected to lose more staffers to buyouts, further layoffs and return-to-office requirements.",
      "Among other issues facing the agency:",
      "\u2014 Pressure from anti-abortion groups to restrict the abortion pill mifepristone",
      "\u2014 Efforts to keep up with a wave of artificial intelligence-based medical systems",
      "\u2014 Legal battles with compounding pharmacies and telehealth companies over off-brand versions of weight-loss drugs",
      "In government ethics forms, Makary recently said he has cut financial ties with several companies that could be impacted by his work at FDA, including telehealth and drug companies that sell compounded versions of FDA-approved drugs.",

      "Authorities have revealed that actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease and showed severe signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease a full week after his wife died of hantavirus in their home",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease a full week after his wife died from hantavirus in their New Mexico hillside home, likely unaware that she was dead because he was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, authorities revealed Friday.",
      "Both deaths were ruled to be from natural causes, chief medical examiner Dr. Heather Jarrell said alongside state fire and health officials at a news conference.",
      "\u201cMr. Hackman showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d Jarrell said. \u201cHe was in a very poor state of health. He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that\u2019s what resulted in his death.\u201d",
      "Authorities didn't suspect foul play after the bodies of Hackman, 95, and Betsy Arakawa, 65, were discovered Feb 26. Immediate tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative.",
      "Investigators found that the last known communication and activity from Arakawa was Feb. 11 when she visited a pharmacy, pet store and grocery before returning to their gated neighborhood that afternoon, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Friday.",
      "Hackman's pacemaker last showed signs of activity a week later and that he had an abnormal heart rhythm Feb. 18, the day he likely died, Jarrell said.",
      "Although there was no reliable way to determine the date and time when both died, all signs point to their deaths coming a week apart, Jarrell said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite possible he was not aware she was deceased,\u201d Jarrell said.",
      "Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner, said he believes Hackman was severely impaired due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and unable to deal with his wife\u2019s death in the last week of his life.",
      "Most older Americans with dementia live at home, and many receive care from family or friends.",
      "Their bodies were found a little over a week later. Hackman was found in the home\u2019s entryway. His death was tied to heart disease with Alzheimer\u2019s disease contributing.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom. Authorities linked her death to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings. Thyroid medication pills prescribed to Arakawa were found nearby and weren\u2019t listed as contributing to her death, Jarrell said.",
      "Hantavirus typically is reported in spring and summer, often due to exposures that occur when people are near mouse droppings in homes, sheds or poorly ventilated areas. This is the first confirmed case of hantavirus in New Mexico this year.",
      "While hantavirus is found throughout the world, most cases in the U.S. have been found in western states. The virus can cause a severe and sometimes deadly lung infection.",
      "Jarrell said it was not known how quickly Arakawa died.",
      "One of the couple\u2019s three dogs also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs survived. Authorities initially misidentified the breed.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, said Erin Phipps, a veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department. The sheriff considers this an open investigation until they receive results of the dog's necropsy and finish checking into data from personal cellphones retrieved from the home.",
      "When Hackman and Arakawa were found, the bodies were decomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe\u2019s especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200 feet (2,200 meters).",
      "\u201cAll of us that knew him should have been checking on him,\u201d said Stuart Ashman, co-owner of Artes de Cuba gallery who cherished his encounters with Hackman at a local Pilates exercise studio, where they used to swap stories. \u201cI had no idea. ... It's just really sad. And that she died a week before him. My God.\u201d",
      "Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist in Virginia, said when two bodies are found at the same time, the usual assumption would be that they died at the same time. But Hackman\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease added a complicating factor: He apparently was unable to seek help after his wife died.",
      "\u201cThey died several days apart: One dying of a viral infection, the hantavirus, which can kill quite quickly. And the other death occurring from heart disease. And that too can be a relatively sudden death,\" Weedn said. \"Their (the authorities\u2019) explanation, I thought, was quite clear and plausible. I believe they really discovered what truly happened in this case.\u201d",
      "Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cHoosiers\u201d and \u201cSuperman\u201d from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.",
      "Hackman dedicated much of his time in retirement to painting and writing novels far from Hollywood\u2019s social circuit. He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia O\u2019Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, and he and his wife were investors in local businesses.",

    "story": [
      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life",
      "NEW YORK -- It took five years for Crystal Burke to put a name to the symptoms that haunted her.",
      "Heart palpitations. Insomnia so severe she slept only two to four hours a night. A newfound struggle to make decisions in her job as a nurse. Confusion when dealing with statistics, which she used to handle with ease.",
      "\u201cIt affected my work, it affected my relationships, it affected everything,\" Burke said. \"I felt lost. I didn\u2019t talk to anybody about it.\u201d",
      "Then Burke saw an advertisement about a face cream which contained estrogen, one of the two hormones ovaries produce less and less of with aging. She began talking with friends about her symptoms. And she connected the dots: menopause.",
      "At just 38, Burke had thought she was too young to be going through the life stage when menstrual periods stop and women no longer can become pregnant. But menopause is more than the pop culture stereotype featuring women in their 50s having hot flashes. Symptoms can start much earlier \u2014 during perimenopause, the time leading up to menopause \u2014 and go well beyond hot flashes.",
      "The many manifestations include insomnia, migraines, brain fog, loss of concentration, memory problems, mood swings, depression, anxiety, heart palpitations, hair loss and weight gain. If that wasn\u2019t enough, some people experience heavy, painful periods or recurring urinary tract infections.",
      "Chronic insomnia can make it difficult to concentrate. Brain fog leaves the afflicted struggling to find words during meetings. But social stigma and a lack of information have left menopausal people dealing alone with severe symptoms that may impact their work. Many stay silent, fearing they\u2019ll be viewed as underperformers or weak.",
      "Some women in senior leadership positions leave their jobs or reduce their hours as a result of debilitating side effects from menopause, said Lauren Redfern, executive director of Hormonally, a nonprofit that provides workplace training and education about women\u2019s health. But those who feel supported by employers during the transition are more likely to remain at work, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you open up a space to talk about these things, people are desperate to have a conversation,\u201d Redfern said. \u201cThe symptoms are so diverse and so far-reaching and so prolific they impact every area of someone\u2019s life.\u201d",
      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life. Yet due to the epidemic of silence around it, women, nonbinary people and transgender individuals often don't recognize the onset of unpleasant physical and emotional changes as side effects of declining hormone levels.",
      "Finding health care providers who are trained to identify and treat their symptoms can be challenging. Some startups have sought to change that by providing access to referrals or telehealth appointments with doctors or therapists who specialize in treating menopausal patients.",
      "\u201cWhen you don\u2019t know that something can get fixed, it\u2019s very scary,\u201d said Midi Health founder Joanna Strober, whose company connects women with professionals who understand menopause. \u201dIf you think, \u2018For the rest of my life I\u2019m going to have brain fog and not remember anyone\u2019s name, and I\u2019m going to keep losing my car in the parking lot and I\u2019m going to keep gaining weight,\u2019 then it\u2019s very demoralizing.\u201d",
      "Burke found relief when she began hormone replacement therapy. Inspired to help others, she co-founded The Menopause Clinic in Louisiana to offer telehealth services focused on menopause.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing is for women to know what perimenopause is, what menopause is, and that there are options,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThe suffering isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d",
      "Hormone replacement therapy is not an option for those with certain medical histories, and some doctors are unwilling to prescribe it. Some experts recommend acupuncture, dietary changes and exercise to help manage symptoms.",
      "The Mayo Clinic estimates that menopause symptoms lead to $1.8 billion in lost work time per year in the U.S. About 5% of employers offer menopause benefits or accommodations such as the ability to work from home or a cool room, according to benefit consulting company NFP.",
      "Here are some steps you or your employer can take to make the workplace more hospitable for people experiencing menopause.",
      "Finding supportive colleagues can help bridge knowledge gaps. If your organization doesn't have a menopause support group, you can start one. Once established, the group or human resources department can bring in facilitators to teach the entire workforce \u2014 not just women \u2014 about menopause.",
      "Sarah Daniels, a communications manager, started a support group called \u201cMenopause Matters\u201d at Arriva Group, a U.K.-based public transportation company. The male-dominated company already had a gender inclusion group, so Daniels joined and organized the menopause group as an offshoot.",
      "The group's monthly meetings are held online during business hours. Participants swap notes on supplements, teas, treatments and beauty products. Daniels believes the group improves productivity because it gives members a sense of belonging within the organization.",
      "\u201cI know how lonely it is when you are going through these things, because you think, \u2018Is this just happening to me?'\" she said. \u201cI had a UTI (urinary tract infection) that was so severe that I fainted on a train. My periods were so heavy that I couldn\u2019t leave the house.\u201d",
      "Arriva has a policy that says bosses must listen to and make reasonable adjustments for employees struggling with menopause. That could mean more restroom breaks, uniform adaptations to help with hot flashes or flexible working hours, Daniels said.",
      "People working for employers who do not subsidize menopause-related care and programs can model requests for similar benefits after the small percentage of companies that do.",
      "When Shevonya Noble joined biotechnology firm Genentech as a principal quality and compliance leader, she was connected with a care advocate who helped her find a nutritionist, wellness coach, career coach, mental health provider and physical support coach to address her menopause symptoms.",
      "Appointment costs were covered through a benefit provided by Maven, which partners with employers and health plans to deliver care targeted to women. Genentech\u2019s benefits also include menopause-specific classes and support groups.",
      "At a former employer, Noble felt she had to hide the hot flashes that interrupted her sleep and disrupted her concentration while giving presentations because she didn't see anyone else furiously fanning themselves at their desks.",
      "\u201cThe conversation about menopause needs to be broadened to include men, not just men in our lives but in the workplace as well,\u201d Noble said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we not shy away from the topic but include it in our conversations and to just take the mystique away from what goes on with women at this stage in life.\u201d",
      "Speaking up about symptoms also may help. When women experience hot flashes and brain fog at work, they\u2019re often seen as less competent, but if they say, \u201cIt\u2019s menopausal, I\u2019m getting treated for it,\u2019\u201d the discrimination goes away and they\u2019re seen as powerful leaders again, according to Midi founder Strober.",
      "\u201cYou have to call it out. You have to say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a hot flash,\u2019 not just look sweaty in a meeting, because then they just discount you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you call it out, you can take your power back.\u201d",

      "A yearslong legal battle over the right to an emergency abortion in Idaho has been abruptly upended now that President Donald Trump has moved to drop the high-profile case",
      "A yearslong legal battle over the right to an emergency abortion in Idaho has been abruptly upended now that President Donald Trump has moved to drop the high-profile case.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if it was needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences.",
      "Yet a little more than a month after taking over the White House, Trump's decision to abandon the legal fight signals how the Republican administration plans on interpreting federal law designed to protect urgent care when up against states' abortion bans.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. The ruling came down while President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was in office, but many of the justices who helped reverse Roe v. Wade were appointed under Trump.",
      "So in response, Biden warned that his administration considered abortion part of the stabilizing care that federal law requires facilities to provide to patients who show up at an emergency room. A month later, Biden sued Idaho, which had enacted an abortion ban that makes it a crime with a prison term of up to five years for anyone who performs or assists in an abortion.",
      "The Biden administration argued that Idaho\u2019s abortion ban prevented ER doctors from offering an abortion if a woman needs one in a medical emergency. But Idaho\u2019s attorney general has pointed out that federal law also requires hospitals to consider the health of the \u201cunborn child\u201d in its treatment, too.",
      "The lawsuit has twisted and turned in the legal system ever since. Last year, the Supreme Court agreed to step into the Idaho case, but it handed down a narrow ruling: Hospitals were allowed to make determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations, but the key legal question about what care hospitals should legally provide remains unresolved.",
      "Known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, the 1986 law requires emergency rooms to offer a medical exam if you turn up at their facility. The law applies to any ERs that accept Medicare funding \u2014 so nearly all of them.",
      "Those ERs are also required to stabilize patients experiencing a medical emergency before discharging or transferring them. Notably, if the ER doesn't have the resources or staff to treat a patient, medical staffers must arrange a medical transfer to another hospital \u2014 they can't simply direct a patient to go elsewhere.",
      "EMTALA is more scrutinized than ever since Roe was overturned. Multiple doctors and families have told The Associated Press about pregnant women with dangerous medical conditions showing up in hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices only to be denied the abortions that could help treat them. Some women described facing harmful delays.",
      "Not yet. And the DOJ's three-page motion didn't explain why they wanted to abandon the lawsuit either. However, since having a hand in revoking the constitutional right to abortion, Trump has repeatedly touted his support of leaving abortion regulations up to the states.",
      "Meanwhile, ending the effort to use federal law to protect emergency abortions was a goal of Project 2025, the blueprint created by the Heritage Foundation for a second Trump term, which calls for reversing what it describes as \u201cdistorted pro-abortion\u201d interpretations of federal law. Trump insisted during his 2024 presidential campaign that Project 2025 was not part of his agenda.",
      "\u201cTheir move to drop this case against Idaho I think really shows what their true priorities are \u2014 and it is to push an anti-abortion political agenda rather than support the lives, health and well being of pregnant women and people, not just in Idaho but across the country because this case does have far-reaching impact,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers.",
      "Trump's decision to drop the Idaho case comes several months after the Supreme Court said the federal government couldn't require hospitals to provide pregnancy terminations when it would violate Texas' abortion ban.",
      "Texas had sued over the Biden administration's enforcement of EMTALA, and a lower federal court eventually sided with the state. But similar to the case in Idaho, the Supreme Court stopped short of deciding whether the federal law can supersede a state's abortion ban.",
      "Meanwhile, concern has grown over whether Trump's decision in the Idaho case is a sign that his administration may also reverse course in a longstanding legal battle over telehealth access to mifepristone, the medication used in the nation's most common abortion method.",
      "The Department of Justice under Biden had sought to dismiss a complaint brought by a handful states seeking to roll back access to mifepristone. It's currently unclear how Trump plans on proceeding."

      "Patients who live in rural counties are 10% more likely to die of their cancer than those living in metropolitan areas, said Neli Ulrich of the University of Utah\u2019s Huntsman Cancer Institute.",
      "A third of patients travel more than 150 miles for care at the Salt Lake City cancer center. But for patients even further away \u2014 in Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Wyoming \u2014 because it\u2019s also the regional hub for NIH-funded studies of new treatments.",
      "So Ulrich\u2019s center helps train local doctors to do at least some of the blood tests and other steps of clinical trials that let faraway patients participate without traveling \u2014 a program threatened if her university loses tens of millions in NIH cuts.",
      "The issue: Most of the NIH\u2019s budget \u2014 more than $35 billion a year \u2014 goes to universities, hospitals and other research groups. The grants are divided into \u201cdirect costs\u201d \u2014 covering researchers\u2019 salaries and a project\u2019s supplies \u2014 and \u201cindirect costs,\u201d to reimburse other expenses supporting the work such as electricity, maintenance and janitorial staff, and safety and ethics oversight.",
      "NIH directly negotiates with research groups, a process that grants managers say requires receipts and audits, to set rates for those indirect expenses that can reach 50% or more. But the Trump administration now plans to cap those rates at 15%. The administration estimates it would save the government $4 billion a year but scientists say it really means they'll have to stop some lifesaving work.",
      "They are \u201creal expenses, that\u2019s the critical point \u2013 they are not fluff,\u201d said Ulrich. Using separate cancer center funds to cover those costs would threaten other \u201cactivities that are really important to us in serving our communities across the mountain West.\u201d",
      "A federal judge has blocked the move but until the court fight is done researchers aren\u2019t sure what they can continue to afford.",
      "NIH grants divided between researchers in every state in 2023 supported more than 412,000 jobs and $92 billion in new economic activity, according to a yearly report from United for Medical Research that often is cited as Congress sets the agency's budget.",
      "The AP tallied how much money would have been lost in each state under a 15% cap on those grants\u2019 indirect costs. Those lost dollars alone would have cost at least 58,000 jobs, concluded an analysis assisted by Inforum, a nonpartisan economic consulting firm that conducts UMR's economic impact reports.",
      "Consider Hopkins, which runs about 600 NIH-funded clinical trials plus other laboratory research and is Baltimore\u2019s largest private employer. \u201cIf we can\u2019t do science and we can\u2019t support the science, we can\u2019t support the surrounding community either,\u201d Huganir said.",
      "Huganir studies how the brain stores memory as people learn when he discovered a gene that, when mutated, causes certain intellectual disabilities.",
      "After years studying the SynGap1 gene, \u201cwe have what we think is a really great therapeutic\u201d almost ready to be tested in severely affected children. Huganir has applied for two new NIH grants key for moving toward those trials.",

Some already have, even though studying different populations is fundamental to medicine.",

People don\u2019t know what the rules are,\u201d said well-known Hopkins specialist Dr. Otis Brawley. \u201cWe\u2019re actually going to kill people is what it amounts to, because we\u2019re not studying how to get appropriate care to all people.\u201d",

      "Taken together, experts have raised concerns about a possible misinterpretation of Kennedy's message: that because vitamin A is available, they don't need to be vaccinated.",
      "",
      "\"Vitamin A is absolutely not a substitute nor an equivalent for MMR vaccination, which is the best way to prevent a child from getting measles,\" Ericka Hayes, MD, of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told MedPage Today.",
      "",

      "",
      "\"I think some people are thinking, 'Oh, well, then, if I, for example, take vitamin A, I won't get measles, or I'm less likely to get measles,'\" Hayes said. \"And that is absolutely not the case.\"",
      "",
      "Much of the literature about vitamin A and measles comes from lower- and middle-income countries, where deficiency may pose more of a problem. However, given that vitamin A deficiency can put kids at risk of worse outcomes with measles  --  and most kids aren't assessed for vitamin A levels  --  U.S. expert consensus has settled on administering the vitamin in all cases.",
      "",
      "Tina Tan, MD, of Northwestern University, who is president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said vitamin A \"really plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system and supports the function of immune cells so the body can fight off infections like measles.\"",
      "",
      "However, taking vitamin A won't prevent a child from getting measles in the first place, Hayes said, and it can have \"significant toxicities,\" especially when taken in high doses. \"And just because you're taking vitamin A or have a good vitamin A level doesn't guarantee that you will not have a ... severe case of measles,\" she added.",

      "",
      "Tan said that the \"number of unvaccinated individuals is growing, and that basically increases the risk for spread of measles, because measles is one of the most contagious viruses.\"",

      "If you\u2019re about to go to the gym, should you eat something beforehand",
      "If you listen to some self-proclaimed exercise experts on social media, they swear that working out on an empty stomach burns more fat.",
      "But it\u2019s a common misconception that exercising in a fasted state improves performance or burns more calories, said Abby Langer, a dietitian in Toronto.",
      "\u201cThe research shows that in terms of gains, it doesn\u2019t really make much of a difference,\u201d she said.",
      "Does that mean you should load up on protein and carbs right before a workout? No, that\u2019s not true either.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at when \u2014 and how \u2014 you should eat, before, after or even during a workout. (And remember, experts say what you eat is more important than when you eat.)",
      "The calories in food literally are energy, so you need them to fuel your body for a proper workout. Eating too much too soon beforehand, though, can be problematic.",
      "Exercising diverts blood from organs including the stomach to the muscles, said Langer, author of \u201cGood Food, Bad Diet.\u201d So exercising on a full stomach affects the digestive process, which could cause cramping or even make you feel sick.",
      "That\u2019s particularly the case with meals high in fat, protein or fiber, which take longer to digest than carbohydrates. Langer recommends eating a high ratio of carbs beforehand and waiting two to three hours before intense exercise.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to eat a big steak an hour before you play hockey,\u201d she said.",
      "If you exercise first thing in the morning or before dinner, it\u2019s OK to have a carb-rich snack like a banana with peanut butter or yogurt with fruit beforehand. It will give you the energy to perform well, and you can fuel up afterward with a full meal.",
      "That steak may serve you better afterward because that\u2019s when a higher ratio of protein is easier to digest, said Krista Austin, a physiologist in Colorado Springs.",
      "Austin said if it will be an hour or longer before you can have a full meal, it\u2019s better to have a high-protein snack in the meantime to help curb your appetite. The reason has little to do with muscle recovery or nutrient absorption: Rather, people who are too hungry make poor dietary choices.",
      "\u201cA lot of people get very hungry about an hour after exercise, and you don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d said Austin, author of \u201cPerformance Nutrition: Applying the Science of Nutrient Timing.\u201d \u201cYou want to catch it early, or you go and overeat.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s another myth that you need to grab a protein shake within minutes of finishing to build the biggest muscles, Langer said.",
      "Many exercise enthusiasts point to what\u2019s known as an \u201canabolic window\u201d of about an hour within exercising that the body is primed to repair muscle. For the average person, you have a much longer window, and nutrient timing is less important than making sure you consume some protein at every meal, Langer said. The body needs a continuous supply of amino acids like protein for muscle repair and maintenance, she said, which means about 25 to 30 grams at every meal, depending on various factors.",
      "\u201cPrioritizing that will help with goals, either muscle building, satiety, weight loss, all of that,\u201d Langer said.",
      "Most people who are eating enough throughout the day don\u2019t need anything during a workout. Langer and Austin said the threshold is about an hour of intense exercise. Longer than that \u2014 say you're training for a marathon \u2014 and you can benefit from a carb-rich snack in the middle.",
      "Instead of focusing on when to eat, Austin said to focus on what and how much. She cautioned against overcomplicating the topic and recommended following the USDA\u2019s My Plate recommendations for a balanced diet.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing we need to teach people is that nutrition is simple,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you need to stop focusing on the concept of nutrient timing and just make sure that you\u2019re consistently eating throughout the day and focus on health.\u201d",

      "Jackie Chen was part of a group of social workers who often carried a loudspeaker seeking to mediate between police and protesters during the social unrest. She was freed at her first trial in September 2020, but the secretary of justice appealed and a court ordered a retrial by another judge.",

      "Judge May Chung wrote in her verdict that Chen had continuously shouted unfounded accusations against the police and suggested the officers' actions involved the use of excessive force or were too rapid. Chen had used her social worker role, claiming to be \u201csafeguarding justice,\" to back the protesters, the judge said.",

      "TEHRAN, Iran -- China, Iran and Russia conducted joint naval drills Tuesday in the Middle East, offering a show of force in a region still uneasy over Tehran's rapidly expanding nuclear program and as Yemen's Houthi rebels threaten new attacks on ships.",
      "The joint drills, called the Maritime Security Belt 2025, took place in the Gulf of Oman near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of all crude oil traded worldwide passes. The area around the strait in the past has seen Iran seize commercial ships and launch suspected attacks in the time since President Donald Trump first unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers.",
      "The drill marked the fifth year the three countries took part in the drills.",
      "This year\u2019s drill likely sparked a warning late Monday from the British military\u2019s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center, which said there was GPS interference in the strait, with disruptions lasting for several hours and forcing crews to rely on backup navigation methods.",
      "\u201cThis was likely GPS jamming to reduce the targeting capability of drones and missiles,\u201d wrote Shaun Robertson, an intelligence analyst at the EOS Risk Group. \u201cHowever, electronic navigation system interference has been reported in this region previously during periods of increased tension and military exercises.\u201d",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry identified the vessels it sent to the drill as the corvettes Rezky and the Hero of the Russian Federation Aldar Tsydenzhapov, as well as the tanker Pechenega. China's Defense Ministry said it sent the guided-missile destroyer Baotou and the comprehensive supply ship Gaoyouhu. Neither offered a count of the personnel involved.",
      "Neither China nor Russia actively patrol the wider Middle East, whose waterways remain crucial for global energy supplies. Instead they broadly cede that to Western nations largely led by the U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet. Observers for the drill included Azerbaijan, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 with the Americans likely keeping watch as well.",
      "However, both China and Russia have deep interests in Iran. For China, it has continued to purchase Iranian crude oil despite facing Western sanctions, likely at a discount compared to global prices. Beijing also remains one of the top markets for Iranian imports.",
      "Russia, meanwhile, has relied on Iran for the supply of bomb-carrying drones it uses in its war on Ukraine.",
      "The drills marked a major moment for Iran's state-run television network. It's aired segments showing live-fire during a night drill and sailors manning deck guns on a vessel. The exercises come after an Iranian monthslong drill that followed a direct Israeli attack on the country, targeting its air defenses and sites associated with its ballistic missile program.",
      "While Tehran sought to downplay the assault, it shook the wider populace and came as a campaign of Israeli assassinations and attacks have decimated Iran's self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d \u2014 a series of militant groups allied with the Islamic Republic. Syrian President Bashar Assad was also overthrown in December, further weakening Iran's grip on the wider region.",

      "MITI MURHESA, Congo -- Hospitals across eastern Congo that were once at the forefront of the country\u2019s response to the mpox outbreak are facing a setback in detecting the disease and offering treatment following the advance of Rwanda-backed rebels in the region.",
      "Eastern Congo had been the epicenter of an mpox outbreak, spurred by a new form of the virus that quickly spread to African neighbors and led the World Health Organization to declare it a global health emergency.",
      "But as the M23 rebel group moved into the region's largest city of Goma on Jan. 26, in a major escalation of their yearslong fight against government forces, the conflict has hindered efforts to contain the virus and treat patients.",
      "The rebels' capture of Goma and nearby Bukavu triggered the flight of hundreds of patients from treatment centers, drugs and vaccine doses are in short supply in the absence of a humanitarian corridor to allow access for more aid, several hospitals have been destroyed while the collection and testing of medical samples have been slow, doctors and patients told The Associated Press during a recent visit to one of the mpox hot spots.",
      "\u201cThe situation has been very difficult. Insecurity has disrupted everything,\u201d said Dr. Serge Munyahu Cikuru, medical officer in charge of the Miti Murhesa health zone in South Kivu province\u2019s Kabare territory, which the M23 also controls.",
      "The country, meanwhile, continues to battle other diseases in the east, including cholera and measles, in addition to mysterious outbreaks that recently started in the northwestern region.",
      "Congo saw a 31% weekly increase in mpox cases last week, bringing the total to 16,255, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "However, that is only one side of the story: Only seven out of the 26 provinces reported cases last week, the public health agency said at its last briefing, partly blaming the security crisis.",

      "Many of the fleeing patients were in the Miti Murhesa health zone, one of the hardest hit in the mpox outbreak. At least 4,700 cases were reported there as of the end of 2024, according to the zone's chief medical officer Dr. Cikuru.",
      "Only two of the four treatment centers in the zone are currently functional while others are among numerous health facilities affected by the fighting between government forces and M23, he said.",

      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- Several hundred student protesters have blocked Serbia's public television station building in Belgrade as tensions are soaring in the Balkan country days ahead of a planned large rally over the weekend billed as an endgame in months of anti-government demonstrations.",
      "The students first blocked the TV building in central Belgrade, Serbia's capital, late on Monday and several hundred gathered again early on Tuesday, after announcing that their blockade will last for at least 22 hours.",
      "University students in Serbia are behind almost daily rallies that started after a concrete canopy crashed down in November at a railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad, killing 15 people. The protests have rocked populist rule of President Aleksandar Vucic and his firm grip on power.",
      "During the late Monday blockade, riot police briefly intervened with batons against the crowd, which tried to block one of the entrances to the TV building with metal security fences. At least one plain clothes policemen was injured in skirmishes.",
      "The students blame the public TV for bias reporting and siding with Vucic and the government during the demonstrations. The Serbian president was the guest of the main TV news bulletin on Monday evening, but its yet unclear what exactly triggered the evening protest.",
      "During the interview, Vucic insulted the student-led protests, warning that security forces will use force against participants of the big rally planned for Saturday. He pledged never to step down because of the massive nationwide demonstrations.",
      "\u201cYou will have to kill me if you want to replace me,\u201d he said,",
      "The TV reporter who interviewed Vucic called the protesting students \u201ca mob,\" which the president appeared to approve of. The station, RTS, issued a statement, denouncing the blockade.",
      "\u201cForcibly preventing RTS employees from coming to their workplaces represents a dangerous step into open conflicts with unpredictable consequences,\u201d it said.",
      "Some of the TV station's employees apparently managed to enter the building through a side entrance that's not publicly known, allowing the program to continue uninterrupted.",
      "Many in Serbia believe that the huge concrete construction fell down because of poor renovation work fueled by government corruption. The students have insisted on full accountability in the tragedy, a call that has garnered widespread support among citizens who are largely disillusioned with politicians and have lost trust in state institutions.",
      "Student-led rallies have drawn tens of thousands of people, becoming among the biggest ever in Serbia, which has a long history of anti-government protests. Vucic has described the rallies as a Western-orchestrated ploy to oust him from power.",
      "The next big rally is planned on Saturday in Belgrade and Vucic has alleged the protesters \u201cwill try to achieve something with violence and that will be the end.\u201d Many demonstrators \"will end up behind bars accused of criminal acts,\u201d he added.",
      "All student-led protests in the past months have mostly been peaceful, while incidents were recorded when opponents drove their cars into protest blockades or attacked the protesters.",
      "Vucic and his right-wing Serbian Progressive Party have held a firm grip on power in Serbia for over a decade, facing accusations of stifling democratic freedoms despite formally seeking European Union entry for Serbia.",
      "Authorities have indicted 16 people over the canopy collapse, but many doubt that the actual culprits will face justice."

      "This past weekend\u2019s sectarian violence was possibly among the bloodiest 72 hours in the modern history of Syria after 14 years of civil war \u2014 and it threatens to open an endless cycle of vengeance",
      "BEIRUT -- The Haydar family huddled in their apartment while gunmen stalked their hometown of Baniyas, hunting for members of Syria\u2019s minority Alawite sect like them. After 24 terrifying hours, a friend helped Samir Haydar, his wife and two sons escape \u2014 just in time.",
      "Minutes later, the gunmen, who were Sunni Muslim, broke into his building and killed the Alawites still there, Haydar said. Down the street, gunmen took Haydar\u2019s two older brothers and a nephew out of their homes and killed them, too.",
      "\u201cIf I had stayed five minutes longer, I with my entire family would have been killed,\u201d Haydar, 67, said.",
      "This past weekend\u2019s sectarian violence was possibly among the bloodiest 72 hours in the modern history of a country torn by 14 years of civil war \u2014 and it threatens to open an endless cycle of vengeance. From early Friday to Sunday night, attackers rampaged through coastal provinces heavily populated by Alawites, as well as the nearby provinces of Hama and Homs, killing people, sometimes entire families, on streets, in homes, on rooftops.",
      "Of the nearly 1,000 civilians killed, nearly 200 were in Baniyas, according to the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor. The toll could not be independently confirmed.",
      "Among the attackers, witnesses say, were hardline Sunni Islamists, including Syria-based jihadi foreign fighters, who came from nearby provinces. Some had been allied to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the disbanded insurgent group that in December led the overthrow of longtime autocrat Bashar Assad and whose members dominate the interim government now running the country.",
      "But many were local Sunnis, unleashing hatreds pent-up over past atrocities blamed on Alawites loyal to Assad.",
      "Survivors say some of the attackers in Baniyas were Syrians from surrounding villages seeking vengeance over a 2013 massacre in the nearby town of Beyda, where paramilitaries killed several hundred Sunnis. It was one of several mass killings under then-President Assad, whose attempts to crush protests helped foment an armed insurgency.",
      "Assad, who is Alawite, filled his security agencies and paramilitaries with members of the sect. Some Sunnis blame the entire community for Assad\u2019s brutal crackdowns, though Alawites say they also suffered under his rule.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of injustices. Many were waiting for the chance to let it out,\u201d Haydar said from his hiding place after fleeing home. \u201cInstead of the pain teaching them mercy and making them against killings, they translated it into more killings.\u201d",
      "Government reinforcements \u2014 which residents said did not intervene during the height of the killings \u2014 were eventually sent to restore order, and calm appeared to hold by late Monday. The government declared an independent committee appointed by the president will investigate the attacks. But the bloodshed has deeply tainted attempts by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa to convince Syria\u2019s minorities that he wants to include them as equals.",
      "The bloodshed began after reports Thursday night of seemingly coordinated attacks by Assad loyalists on government security forces near the city of Latakia and elsewhere along the coast.",
      "The Associated Press spoke to nine residents from villages and towns hit by the violence. Some refused to give their names out of fear for their security.",
      "Haydar said that around daybreak Friday, hordes of armed Sunnis descended on Baniyas and surrounding villages in vans and pickup trucks, and waving guns. Another resident said she heard the gunmen shouting, \u201cGod is great,\u201d and threatening and cursing the Alawite residents.",
      "Images and videos soon surfaced online, mostly posted by the perpetrators. Some show fighters in military fatigues pushing residents out of homes into the streets, beating some with rifles and forcing them to bark like dogs, in humiliation. Some show fighters firing on civilians. The hundreds of videos posted could not be immediately verified.",
      "Looting and theft were rampant. Haydar said armed men went into the building of one of his elder brothers, 74-year-old Rafik, stole his valuables and left.",
      "Hiding in his home, Haydar said he saw fighters shoot a neighbor at the entrance of a nearby building. One fighter turned the body over to ensure he was dead.",
      "Around noon Friday, Haydar got a call from the wife of his other brother, Iskander. She screamed that fighters had stormed their building and taken away Iskander and their son, Mourad.",
      "Later, Mourad told his mother what happened. The fighters dragged them to the roof and made him, his father and five other men lie down. Then they sprayed them with bullets. Miraculously, Mourad was uninjured. His father and the rest of the men were killed.",
      "Ali Sheha, a 57-year-old resident of the same neighborhood, said five of his neighbors were shot in the street, including two doctors and their two children. The gunmen prevented anyone from coming to remove their bodies for hours. Acting fast, Sheha secured a van. He, his wife, three children and other families squeezed in and fled.",
      "That night, the village where they took refuge also came under attack. Sheha said he and hundreds of others fled again, sleeping for two nights outside among olive and pine trees.",
      "By Saturday afternoon, Sheha said he knew of at least 20 people killed, including three cousins and two of their children with special needs, gunned down in their food stall.",
      "When fighters entered his nephew\u2019s house, they asked if his wife was Sunni, because she wore a headscarf. They checked her ID and let her go. His sister, living in a building with many Christians, said the gunmen spared them and her husband, in his 80s.",
      "Haydar and his family escaped with help from a Sunni friend who negotiated for hours with the gunmen, explaining that Haydar had once been imprisoned by Assad\u2019s security forces.",
      "The friend, declining to give his name for fear of retribution, said that at one point, the gunmen shoved and hit him, criticizing him for harboring Alawites.",
      "During the weekend\u2019s violence, the friend sheltered 15 Alawites in his home, he said by phone from Baniyas.",
      "In Tuwaym, an Alawite village in the Sunni-majority Hama province in central Syria, a resident said gunmen summoned the men, beat them with rifles and shot some. By the time they left, they had killed 25 members of her family, including her father and nine children between the ages of four and 15.",
      "\u201cI carried the children with my own hands. Some had their bones coming out of the gaping wounds,\u201d she said, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear for her safety.",
      "In Baniyas and elsewhere, bodies were left lying in streets, cars and apartment buildings, civil rescue teams said. Sheha and other residents began documenting those killed. Lists of names and recorded testimonies of terrified residents surfaced online. Haydar buried his brothers Sunday.",
      "Sheha was part of a group of Alawite civilians that sought to build bridges with the new government.",
      "He said the Alawites can\u2019t be blamed for the crimes of Assad\u2019s forces. Most Alawites were impoverished under Assad, abused by his top aides and forced to show loyalty and serve in the army, he said.",
      "Instead of seeing inclusion and transitional justice, the community is targeted in revenge, he said. In a national dialogue convened this month by al-Sharaa, only a few Alawites were included in the 600-member conference, he said.",
      "\u201cRecovery from this won\u2019t be easy,\u201d he said.",

      "Inflation data released Tuesday by Hungary's statistical office showed an annual inflation rate of 5.6% for February, while food prices were up 7.1% on the year. By contrast, average inflation in the 20-member eurozone was 2.4% in February, according to the European Union's statistical office Eurostat.",
      "Hungary, which isn\u2019t a member of the eurozone, uses the forint as its national currency.",
      "The data came as an \u201cunpleasant inflation surprise\" for Hungary, which \u201cindicates increasing price pressure in the Hungarian economy with regard to more permanent inflationary trends,\u201d Orsolya Nyeste, a macroeconomic analyst with Erste Bank, wrote in a note on Tuesday.",
      "Hungary has frequently led the EU in inflation in recent years as a cost of living crisis has gripped the country. The populist government has pointed to external factors such as the war in neighboring Ukraine and EU sanctions against Russia to explain the yearslong inflation spiral, though prices in other regional countries like Poland, Romania and Slovakia haven't risen nearly as steeply.",
      "Extreme jumps in food prices \u2014 peaking at more than 45% at the beginning of 2023 \u2014 have spurred previous government interventions in Hungary that included price caps on a number of food items as well as fuel at filling stations. But some critics and economists argued that sellers simply raised prices on other products to make up for shortfalls caused by the price controls.",
      "The inflation numbers present a challenge for Orb\u00e1n as Hungary's economy continues to struggle before a national election in 2026. The EU's longest-serving leader, in power since 2010, faces a challenge from a new party that has placed the stagnating economy and cost of living issues at the center of its political platform.",
      "Compounding Hungary's difficulties, the EU has withheld billions in funding from Budapest because of concerns over judicial independence and rule-of-law standards."

      "Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has been arrested by police at Manila\u2019s international airport on order of the International Criminal Court in connection with a case of crime against humanity filed against him",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested by police at Manila's international airport Tuesday on order of the International Criminal Court in connection with a case of crime against humanity filed against him, the Philippine government said.",
      "Duterte was arrested after arriving from Hong Kong and police took him into custody on orders of the ICC, which has been investigating the massive killings that happened under the former president's deadly crackdown against illegal drugs, President Ferdinand Marcos' office said in a statement.",
      "The Manila office of the International Police received an official copy of the arrest warrant from the global court and the notice for an arrest warrant was served to the former president, the government said.",
      "It was not immediately clear where Duterte was taken by the police. The government said the 79-year-old former leader was in good health and was examined by government doctors.",
      "\u201cHe's now in the custody of authorities,\u201d the government said.",
      "The ICC began investigating drug killings under Duterte from Nov. 1, 2011, when he was still mayor of the southern city of Davao, to March 16, 2019, as possible crimes against humanity. Duterte withdrew the Philippines in 2019 from the Rome Statute in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability.",
      "The Duterte administration moved to suspend the global court\u2019s investigation in late 2021 by arguing that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations, arguing the ICC \u2014 a court of last resort \u2014 didn\u2019t have jurisdiction.",
      "Appeals judges at the ICC ruled in 2023 the investigation could resume and rejected the Duterte administration\u2019s objections. Based in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICC can step in when countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects in the most heinous international crimes, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who succeeded Duterte in 2022 and became entangled in a bitter political dispute with the former president, has decided not to rejoin the global court. But the Marcos administration has said it would cooperate if the ICC asks international police to take Duterte into custody through a so-called Red Notice, a request for law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and temporarily arrest a crime suspect.",

      "The latest tensions stem from fighting in the country's north between government troops and a rebel militia, known as the White Army, that's widely believed to be allied with Machar.",
      "Last week a South Sudanese general was among several people killed when a United Nations helicopter on a mission to evacuate government troops from the town of Nasir, the scene of the fighting in Upper Nile state, was shot at. Earlier in the week, after the White Army overran the military garrison in Nasir, government troops surrounded Machar\u2019s home in Juba and several of his allies were arrested. Deputy army chief Gen. Gabriel Duop Lam, who is seen as loyal to Machar, was among those detained.",
      "Kiir had angered Machar\u2019s group earlier in the year by firing officials seen as loyal to Machar, who has charged that \u201cpersistent violations through unilateral decisions and decrees threaten the very existence\u201d of their peace pact.",
      "Kiir urged calm after last week's helicopter incident, saying in a statement that his government \"will handle this crisis and we will remain steadfast in the path of peace.\u201d",
      "Civil war erupted in South Sudan in late 2013 when a rift between Kiir and Machar escalated into fighting along ethnic lines. Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, accused a group of soldiers loyal to Machar, an ethnic Nuer, of trying to take power by force.",
      "Machar escaped Juba, and later rebels loyal to him came close to capturing Juba but were repulsed by a combined force of South Sudanese soldiers loyal to Kiir and Ugandan special forces.",
      "More than 400,000 people were killed in the 5-year civil war that followed.",
      "With the support of regional leaders and the international community, Kiir and Machar signed a peace deal in 2018 and Machar returned to Juba as South Sudan's first vice president.",
      "But the political rivalry between South Sudan's top two leaders \u2014 with Kiir suspicious of his deputy\u2019s ambitions and Machar calling Kiir a dictator \u2014 remains an obstacle to lasting peace. Both men have been accused of violating multiple ceasefires.",
      "Kiir and Machar are under pressure from the U.S. and others to more quickly implement the 2018 peace deal and prepare for elections.",
      "Challenges include the government\u2019s failure to implement promised reforms such as completing the unification of the army command.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine has key questions it wants answered as army chiefs from over 30 countries arrive Tuesday in Paris for talks on creating an international force to deter future Russian aggression once a ceasefire is established. They include troop size, location and, crucially, military options in the event of a transgression.",
      "The Paris meeting is the most significant culmination so far of French and British efforts to rally nations under a so-called \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d to safeguard Ukraine by establishing a reassurance and deterrence force to dissuade Russia from invading again.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, who is to attend the meeting, said it would be held in \u201cclose coordination\u201d with the NATO alliance.",
      "The talks will include nearly all 32 NATO countries \u2014 notably without the United States \u2014 as well as Commonwealth nations and Asian powers Japan and South Korea, said a French military official. Participants will be invited to spell out what their militaries might be able and willing to contribute, be that troops, weapons or other assistance.",
      "French Defense Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu said \u201cthis meeting is important because it lays the ground for these security guarantees\u201d and how \u201cEuropean armed forces can gain credit and credibility for diplomatic talks which will, unquestionably, extend over the long term.\u201d",
      "Some Ukrainian officials are wary of any deal without clearly identified security guarantees. For them, a key question is how such a coalition will respond if Russia violates any future ceasefire agreement. What kind of military response would follow a large-scale offensive by Russia and how quickly will that response materialize?",
      "Western and Ukrainian officials said that, while there is plenty of thinking and resolve, there is no definitive plan for military options yet. First, they must assess what willing countries might be able to offer. The Associated Press spoke to Western and Ukrainian officials in Kyiv, as well as French officials in Paris and British officials in London. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to speak openly about sensitive matters.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has welcomed the proposal but expressed skepticism, telling The AP in an interview in February that foreign troops alone would not be a sufficient guarantee of security for his country, and that such a plan should be backed up by weapons from the U.S. and Europe, and support for Kyiv to develop its own defense industry.",
      "\u201cDiplomats are discussing, military officials are discussing, but we still don\u2019t have real proposals,\u201d said a senior Ukrainian official about the plan. The talks \u201care not in the first stage, we did a lot in the first stage, but we still don\u2019t have a real solid approach.\u201d",
      "As President Donald Trump has appeared to nix the idea of U.S. security guarantees and other U.S. officials said this will fall on Europe to enforce, the French-British plan looks to create a force equipped with enough military might to dissuade Russia from attacking Ukraine again. \u201cThat is the crux of it,\u201d said a Western official in Kyiv.",
      "The force being envisaged by France and Britain would aim to reassure Ukraine and deter another large-scale Russian offensive after any ceasefire, a French military official told AP. It could include heavy weaponry and weapons stockpiles that could be rushed within hours or days to aid in Ukraine\u2019s defense in the event of a Russian attack that shatters any truce, the official said.",
      "The Western official in Kyiv, offering another idea on the table, said they could incorporate direct and immediate strikes on Russian assets in the event of a violation.",
      "Details of the contours of the proposal have emerged piecemeal in recent weeks as technical discussions have been ongoing between Western diplomatic and military officials in Ukraine and other European capitals.",
      "Political leaders have convened key summits in the past two months to establish common ground. It was discussed at a summit of more than a dozen mostly European leaders in London on March 2, and at a virtual planning meeting on March 5 called by the U.K. and attended by officials from about 20 countries.",
      "France and Britain are now casting the net even wider in their search for nations willing to back the blueprint and provide the force with teeth. The Paris talks on Tuesday will include not just NATO and European Union nations but also Asian and Oceania countries. Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea will dial into the discussions remotely, the French military official said. Turkey, which has the largest army in NATO and a robust defense industry and shared stakes in the Black Sea, will attend. NATO nation Canada will also be represented.",
      "The United States \u2014 NATO\u2019s most militarily powerful member \u2014 was not invited because European nations want to show that they are able to shoulder a large part of the job of safeguarding Ukraine once a truce is in effect, the French military official said.",
      "Last month, some Western officials described a small Europe-dominated \u201creassurance force\u201d of less than 30,000 troops, rather than an ambitious army of peacekeepers posted along the 600-mile (1,000 kilometer) front line.",
      "But other officials have said the numbers were under discussion. According to one version of the proposal, troops would be posted away from the front line at key infrastructure sites such as nuclear power plants and backed by Western air and sea power. The front line would largely be monitored remotely, with drones and other technology. Air power, including U.S. air power based outside Ukraine, perhaps in Poland or Romania, would be in reserve to deter breaches and reopen Ukrainian airspace to commercial flights.",
      "Allied navies could also play a role in the Black Sea clearing mines and patrolling to keep international waters safe.",
      "The idea is to \u201caggregate\u201d the capabilities those countries are ready to provide in order to be able to offer security guarantees to make sure the peace deal is \u201crobust and verifiable,\u201d with the aim to get some U.S. backstop, another French official said.",
      "\u201cTo get signals on the U.S. backstop, the \u2018able and willing\u2019 European countries must be able to aggregate their capabilities and demands,\u201d he said.",
      "Some Western officials cautioned that there will be several stages to a peace plan and a broader range of countries could join the coalition later on. The first step could be a one-month freeze, as proposed by Zelenskyy and European leaders, as a confidence building measure.",
      "The Ukrainian officials said they were optimistic about the coalition of the willing, conceding they have few other options with NATO off the table.",
      "\u201cI fully believe it\u2019s very possible,\u201d said one senior Ukrainian official. \u201cTrump is comfortable with the idea, the idea is very positive for us, and if Europe wants to be a real player, they should do this.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf they lose this opportunity, we will be in a very difficult situation,\u201d he added.",

      "Pope Francis has written and spoken at length about sickness, aging and death",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis has written and spoken at length about sickness, aging and death, and personally directed that his doctors provide the fairly detailed daily updates that have punctuated his own battle with pneumonia.",
      "On Monday, they reported good news: Francis was no longer in imminent danger of death but needed to remain hospitalized for several more days to receive treatment.",
      "The 88-year-old pope is merely responding to the sometimes morbid interest in the health of popes over centuries, and is making his own the somewhat-mixed legacy of St. John Paul II. The Polish pope suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease, and his decline was on public view for years. But the Vatican never admitted he had the disease until after he was dead.",
      "Francis\u2019 candor with his own fragility is very much in keeping with a decision he made early on in his papacy to be up front about his health: He granted an unprecedented tell-all interview to an Argentine doctor who published a book in 2021 detailing Francis\u2019 physical and mental health history. And last week, Francis recorded an audio message from the hospital that laid bare the weakness of his voice, and the labored, breathless effort it took for him to utter just a few words.",
      "Here are a few of Francis\u2019 past musings on sickness, ageing and death and how they might affect the future of his pontificate.",
      "Francis has long complained about the way society treats old people, saying they are part of today\u2019s consumerist \u201cthrowaway culture\u201d when they are deemed no longer productive. For that reason especially, he insisted that Pope Benedict XVI continue to be part of the life of the church during his 10-year retirement.",
      "Francis\u2019 views on ageing have been consistent, even as he himself has aged and become dependent on a wheelchair and walker to get around.",
      "In the 2010 book \u201cOn Heaven and Earth,\u201d written alongside his friend the Argentine Rabbi Abraham Skorka, Francis denounced the cruelty that confronts elderly people. He shamed families who shut their grandparents away in nursing homes and neglect to visit them.",
      "\u201cThe elderly are sources of the transmission of history, the people who give us memories, they are the memory of the people, of a nation, of the family and of the culture, religion,\u201d said Francis, who at the time was the archbishop of Buenos Aires.",
      "In the same book, then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio recalled that his grandmother Rosa, who helped raise him, had the words of an adage framed on her bedside table that stayed with him all his life: \u201cSee that God sees you, see that he is watching you, see that you will die and you don\u2019t know when.\u201d",
      "He referred to the saying again in 2018 in a speech to priests, and that his grandmother had instructed him to recite it every day \u201c\u2018so you will remember that life has an end.\u2019\"",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t understand much at the time, but that verse, since I was three years old, has stuck with me,\u201d he told the priests. \u201cAnd it helped me. The thing was kind of bleak, but it helped me.\u201d",
      "The Argentine journalist and physician, Dr. Nelson Castro, revealed in his 2021 book \u201cThe Health of Popes,\u201d that Francis had reached out to him within a few months of his 2013 election with a suggestion that he write a book about the history of the health of the popes, including his own.",
      "Castro was granted access to the Vatican Secret Archives to research the lives and deaths of past popes and had a sit-down interview with Francis on Feb. 19, 2019, during which the reigning pope spoke at length and in detail about his various ailments over the years: The respiratory infection that resulted in the removal of the upper lobe of his right lung, the gangrenous gallbladder he had removed when he was provincial superior of the Jesuits, the compressed vertebrae, flat feet and fatty liver he has lived with.",
      "The most noteworthy revelation was that Francis said he saw a psychiatrist weekly during six months of Argentina\u2019s military dictatorship. He had sought out help to manage his anxiety when he was trying to hide people from the military and ferry them out of Argentina.",
      "\u201cIn those six months she helped me with respect to how to manage the fears of that time,\u201d he told Castro. \u201cIf you can imagine what it was like to transport someone hidden in the car \u2014 covered by a blanket \u2014 and pass through military controls. \u2026 It created an enormous tension in me.\u201d",
      "He said the therapy also helped him to maintain a sense of equilibrium in making decisions of all kinds, and that in general he believes all priests must understand human psychology.",
      "\u201cWe should offer a mate to our neuroses,\u201d he said, referring to the South American tea. \u201cThey are our companions for life.\u201d",
      "As early as 2014 Francis was already assuming his papacy would be short-lived and that his own death was not far off.",
      "\u201cI realize that this is not going to last long, two or three years, and then \u2026 off to the house of the Father,\u201d he told reporters in 2014 while traveling home from one of his early foreign trips, to South Korea.",
      "He told Castro later that he thought about death \u2014 a lot \u2014 but that it didn\u2019t scare him \u201cone bit.\u201d",
      "Francis made plans, too: He decided his tomb will be in St. Mary Major basilica, not in the Vatican, so he can be near his favorite icon of the Madonna, the Salus Populi Romani (\"Salvation of the People of Rome\"), which is located there.",
      "More recently, he has taken to speaking about upcoming events that he is pretty sure he won\u2019t be around for, and indicating who might.",
      "In 2023, speaking to reporters about the Vatican\u2019s warming relations with Vietnam, Francis concurred that the country warranted a papal visit.",
      "\u201cIf I don\u2019t go, surely John XXIV will,\u201d he said chuckling, referring to a future pope who might be named for the progressive, Vatican II-era pontiff, John XXIII.",

      "A former British soldier who pleaded guilty to the murder of three women at their family home north of London has been sentenced to a whole-life order, meaning that he would never be released from prison",
      "LONDON -- A former British soldier who used a crossbow and a knife to murder three women at their family home north of London was sentenced Tuesday to a whole-life order, meaning that he would never be released from prison.",
      "Kyle Clifford, 26, had pleaded guilty in January to murdering his ex-girlfriend Louise Hunt, 25, and her 28-year-old sister Hannah Hunt with a crossbow and their mother, Carol Hunt, 61, with a knife on July 9, 2024. He was convicted of three counts of murder, one of false imprisonment and two counts of possession of offensive weapons.",
      "He was also found guilty of raping Louise Hunt during the \"carefully planned\" attack on the family.",
      "Sentencing Clifford, Justice Joel Bennathan said he was \u201ca jealous man soaked in self-pity \u2014 a man who holds women in utter contempt.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Clifford planned the murders for days after becoming enraged when an increasingly concerned Louise ended their 18-month relationship.",
      "During the case, the jury was shown evidence that Clifford gained access to the family home in the quiet residential neighborhood of Bushey, northeast of the capital, by deceiving Carol Hunt on the pretext he was returning Louise\u2019s belongings, before brutally stabbing her to death.",
      "Clifford \u201clay in wait\u201d for an hour for Louise to enter the house, before restraining, raping and ultimately murdering her with a crossbow. He then fatally shot Hannah Hunt when she returned to the property after work.",
      "Following the murders, police launched a manhunt for the suspect before he was found injured the following day in a cemetery in Enfield, north London. Clifford had shot himself in the chest with the crossbow. He remains in a wheelchair, having been paralyzed from the chest downwards."

    "story": [
      "Philippine ex-President Rodrigo Duterte, who left a savage legacy over his deadly anti-drugs crackdown, was arrested on an international warrant as he returned to Manila",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- Philippine ex-President Rodrigo Duterte, who left a savage legacy over his deadly anti-drugs crackdown, was arrested on a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity for the thousands killed in a war he waged against drugs in a political career spanning decades. His detention capped an international investigation into killings, which unfolded for more than a dozen years..",
      "Duterte again came under the spotlight during a weekend trip to Hong Kong when the trip sparked speculation that he may have gone into exile while on a trip to Hong Kong to evade a looming international arrest warrant. He had appeared as the main speaker on Sunday at a gathering of thousands of cheering and flag-waving Filipino expatriates, who jammed Southorn Stadium in downtown Wan Chai district.",
      "Now 79 and in poor health, Duterte campaigned for his political party\u2019s senatorial candidates ahead of the May 12 mid-term elections in the Philippines. He said he was aware the International Criminal Court had issued a warrant for his arrest over his campaign against illegal drugs that left thousands of suspects dead.",
      "He again tried to justify the brutal crackdown and the crowd cheered him on. Police arrested him as he got off the plane at Manilla International Airport based on an ICC warrant.",
      "Here\u2019s more about Duterte, his ICC case and what lies ahead for one of Asia\u2019s most unorthodox leaders in his time:",
      "Duterte, a former prosecutor, congressman and longtime mayor of the southern Philippine city of Davao, built a political name with his expletive-laced outbursts against the elites, the dominant Roman Catholic church and the West. He was also seen as pro-poor and a populist, but he is perhaps best remembered for his brutal approach to criminality, particularly illegal drugs.",
      "Under his police-enforced crackdown in Davao at the start of the millennium, an estimated 1,000 mostly poor suspects were gunned down extrajudicially. One police officer involved in the Davao killings who later defected from Duterte told The Associated Press that up to 10,000 suspects were killed by his and other police and civilian hit squads under Duterte.",
      "The death toll in the crackdown was alarmingly high for years, gaining Duterte nicknames like \u201cthe Punisher\u201d and \u201cDuterte Harry,\u201d after the Western movie police character with little regard for the law.",
      "Human rights activists said people were afraid to testify against Duterte in court.",
      "In 2016, Duterte won the presidency on an audacious but failed promise to eradicate illegal drugs and corruption within three to six months, in a country long weary of crime and corruption scandals.",
      "\u201cAll of you who are into drugs, you sons of bitches, I will really kill you,\u201d Duterte told a huge crowd in a 2016 campaign stop in Manila. \u201cI have no patience, I have no middle ground. Either you kill me or I will kill you idiots.\u201d",
      "The United States, the European Union and other Western governments raised alarms over the anti-drugs campaign, prompting Duterte in 2016 to tell then-President Barack Obama \u201cyou can go to hell\u201d as he threatened to \u201cbreak up with America.\u201d",
      "The ICC launched an investigation into drug killings under Duterte from Nov. 1, 2011, when he was still mayor of Davao, to March 16, 2019, as possible crimes against humanity. Duterte withdrew the Philippines in 2019 from the Rome Statute in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability over the killings.",
      "The Duterte administration moved to suspend the global court\u2019s investigation in late 2021 by arguing that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations, arguing the ICC \u2014 a court of last resort \u2014 didn\u2019t have jurisdiction.",
      "Appeals judges at the ICC ruled in July 2023 the investigation could resume and rejected the Duterte administration\u2019s objections. Based in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICC can step in when countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects in the most heinous international crimes, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who succeeded Duterte in 2022 and became entangled in a bitter political dispute with the former president, has decided not to rejoin the global court. But the Marcos administration has said it would cooperate if the ICC asks international police to take Duterte into custody through a so-called Red Notice, a request for law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and temporarily arrest a crime suspect.",
      "China, which controls Hong Kong, and the Philippines do not currently belong to the ICC, but both are members of Interpol. The global court may issue a warrant for Duterte\u2019s arrest through Interpol.",
      "A prominent Philippine politician closely involved in the ICC cases against Duterte told the AP over the weekend the global court had issued a warrant for Duterte's arrest through Interpol. The politician spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss the sensitive issue publicly.",
      "Neither the ICC nor Interpol have yet confirmed the issuance of an arrest warrant.",
      "In his rambling speech on Sunday before mostly Filipino workers in Hong Kong, Duterte again justified his deadly anti-drugs campaign, saying it safeguarded Filipino people.",
      "Duterte has denied authorizing extrajudicial killings, but he openly and repeatedly threatened to kill suspected drug dealers when he was in office.",
      "\u201cWhat was my sin?\u201d Duterte asked in Hong Kong. \u201cI did everything in my time so Filipinos can have a little peace and tranquility.\u201d",
      "He said he was prepared to go to jail but told the crowd in jest to make donations for the construction of a monument of him \u2014 which he suggested with a gesture of his hand should show him holding a gun.",
      "Duterte had said he retired from politics after his stormy presidential term ended in 2022. But in another turnaround from his earlier remarks, he registered to run for mayor of Davao with one of his sons running with him for vice mayor in elections in May.",
      "In Davao, additional police forces were deployed at the international airport and extra checkpoints were set up in what authorities said were meant to be prepared for any contingency ahead of the mid-term elections. The forces in Davao and elsewhere could step in if Duterte\u2019s arrest were to ignite unrest, which the Marcos administration said it could deftly handle."

      "BANGKOK -- A local resistance group fighting against Myanmar\u2019s military government has acknowledged responsibility for the killing last week of a Buddhist monk and his disciple in the country\u2019s eastern region.",
      "Dhamma Thara, 48, was the latest religious figure to die in the civil war that arose after the army seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.",
      "Buddhist monks are influential in their local communities and have historically been involved in political actions in Myanmar, an overwhelmingly Buddhist nation. While many have supported pro-democracy movements, other monks with ultranationalist views have allied themselves with the army.",
      "A joint statement by 14 local social organizations posted on Facebook on Tuesday said that Dhamma Thara and his disciple, Aik Pi, were killed on March 4 by an armed group at the Buddhist monastery in Ohndaing village in Phekhon township in eastern Shan state. The area is located about 100 kilometers (about 60 miles) east of Myanmar's capital, Naypyitaw.",
      "A local resistance group called the \u201cBee Column\u201d, which pledges allegiance to the National Unity Government, the main opposition organization, took responsibility for the killings in two separate statements posted Sunday on the Facebook page of \u201cPekon Police,\u201d another group fighting against the military.",
      "The group accused the monk of being an informer for the military and collaborating to organize the return of displaced people to the town of Pekon to form a pro-government garrison. It said he had also requested the military carry out artillery and air strikes on the outskirts of the town.",
      "The statements claimed that the monk had admitted to being a supporter of the military and that he was killed by a 29-year-old member of the Bee Column in a fracas that broke out as they tried to take him from the monastery where he was temporarily staying. It said his disciple was killed inadvertently as he ran through the scene.",
      "However, the local social organizations in their joint statement denied the guerrillas\u2019 allegations on Tuesday, saying those were false narratives without any credible evidence and the actions mirrored the brutality of the military dictatorship.",
      "\u201cKilling without due process is not a fight against dictatorship but the creation of another form of oppression. We call for immediate and fair action against those responsible for these crimes.\u201d the statement said.",
      "Nang Soi Khan, an official of one of the social organizations, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that Dhamma Thara was primarily involved in providing humanitarian aid to displaced persons.",
      "The Karenni Interim Executive Council, a coalition of armed groups fighting the military in Kayah state, said in a Saturday statement that detailed investigations will be carried out to ensure justice. Myanmar Pressphoto Agency, an online media, reported on Monday that the leader of the Bee Column said the group would accept the resistance authorities\u2019 ruling.",
      "Last year, a prominent monk, Bhaddanta Munindarbhivamsa, was killed when the car in which he was traveling was fired upon by soldiers on a truck. The killing of the 78-year-old monk drew outrage, especially because the military initially lied and blamed it on resistance fighters. Last month, another local resistance group was suspected of killing a Catholic village priest in the country\u2019s northwest.",
      "In addition to the scattered killings of Buddhist and Christian clergy, dozens of houses of worship of both religions have been damaged or destroyed. often by shelling or aerial bombardment by the military."

      "Browne\u2019s wife, Maria Browne, Antigua\u2019s Minister of Housing, told The Antigua Observer newspaper in July 2024 that the proceeds were used to pay off government debt. Days before the report was published, the prime minister had said his administration was considering using the money to build a resort.",

      "\u201cI sincerely believe that Nissan has so much more potential than what we're seeing today,\u201d Espinosa told reporters, while stressing that he needs time to come up with details for a turnaround.",
      "He stressed his love for Nissan, noting he has developed a deep understanding of what makes the company unique and valuable.",
      "Nissan said the company leadership needed to be \u201crenewed\u201d to achieve long-term growth. Uchida, who remains as a director, expressed confidence in Espinosa as \u201ca real car guy,\u201d and stressed he was handing over the baton of leadership to better unify company ranks.",
      "\u201cI am confident that Nissan will definitely make a comeback,\u201d he said, appearing at the hastily called news conference with Espinosa.",
      "Speculation about Uchida's future was rife after he called off talks last month with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co., announced late last year, to set up a joint holding company to integrate its businesses. At the time, he told reporters the focus of the talks had changed to making Nissan into a Honda subsidiary, which he denounced as unacceptable.",
      "He also said their strategic partnership to realize synergies on specific projects like electric vehicles and other research will continue.",
      "Nissan is projecting a loss of 80 billion yen ($540 million) for the full fiscal year through the end of this month.",
      "When asked about talks with Honda and other possible partnerships, Espinosa declined comment, saying he needed more time.",
      "During Uchida\u2019s more than five years at Nissan\u2019s helm, sales faltered, including in key markets like the U.S. and China. Uchida also earlier announced the company was slashing 9,000 jobs.",
      "It\u2019s a sad turn for the maker of the Z sportscar, loved by auto buffs around the world, and the Leaf electric car, a pioneer in that sector that launched in 2010.",
      "Uchida joined Nissan in 2003, job-hopping from major Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai, and worked with Nissan\u2019s alliance partner Renault SA of France before overseeing Nissan\u2019s China operations.",
      "Nissan was rescued from near bankruptcy by Renault in 1999. In 2018, Carlos Ghosn, the former superstar executive sent in by Renault, was arrested by Japanese authorities on various financial misconduct charges, including under-reporting his compensation. He later fled Japan for Lebanon.",
      "Nissan's tarnished corporate image after the Ghosn fiasco was a major challenge, Nishida said. So were the COVID-19 pandemic and broader shifts in the auto industry.",
      "Apart from Uchida's departure as chief executive, Nissan announced other sweeping managerial changes, including giving an expanded role to Guillaume Cartier, its chief performance officer, in global marketing and customer experience.",
      "Eiichi Akashi, corporate vice president of the Vehicle Planning and Vehicle Component Engineering Division, was named chief technology officer, succeeding Kunio Nakaguro.",

      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- A Canadian man has been sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for shootings at an oil pipeline in South Dakota and an electrical substation in North Dakota that caused $1.7 million in damages after a judge found that his crimes met the definition of terrorism.",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. corruption case involving Indian energy tycoon Gautam Adani has exposed vulnerabilities in India's solar sector that are hindering its capacity to switch to clean energy and help limit climate change",
      "BENGALURU, India -- President Donald Trump's decision to freeze a law banning business bribes overseas could offer Indian tycoon Gautam Adani, one of Asia's richest people, a reprieve from American corruption allegations linked to a major solar project in India.",
      "U.S. prosecutors allege that one of Adani's companies duped investors by hiding that its project was backed by a $265 million bribery scheme. The case now may be reviewed, and enforcement of any potential decision against it is uncertain. Whatever its fate, the case has highlighted vulnerabilities in India\u2019s solar sector that are hindering its capacity to switch to clean energy, help limit climate change and cut heavy pollution in many of its cities.",
      "The Adani Group, whose business interests span much of the economy from ports and airports to energy and media, has denied the U.S. allegations. It declined requests from The Associated Press for comment.",
      "Earlier this month, Trump suspended the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, raising expectations among some in India that the allegations against Adani might be put on ice. Shares in Adani\u2019s companies surged but then fell just days later when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sought help from Indian authorities in serving its complaint against Adani.",
      "The allegations have had wider repercussions outside India. Adani Green Energy has withdrawn its wind energy projects from Sri Lanka after the island nation sought to renegotiate prices. Kenya canceled energy and airport expansion deals with the company, while investor TotalEnergies, a French oil giant, has paused new investments.",
      "Adani Green Energy, or AGEL, is India\u2019s largest renewable energy company. It is building one of the world\u2019s largest clean power projects in salt deserts bordering Pakistan in the Western Indian state of Gujarat. Once completed, they would produce 30 gigawatts of clean power, enough to power nearly 18 million Indian homes.",
      "AGEL has projects in 12 Indian states, with 11.6 gigawatts of clean power capacity. It aims to generate 50 gigawatts of renewable power by 2030, a tenth of India\u2019s clean energy goal for the same time period.",
      "In November, Adani said his company would invest $35 billion over five years in large-scale solar, wind, and hybrid power plants across India. It is also one of the country's few large-scale producers of solar and wind power components. But the industry itself is struggling.",
      "India's state-owned electricity companies are chronically short on cash. By 2022-23 their losses totaled $7.8 billion \u2014 2.4% of India\u2019s GDP, according to government data. Operations are plagued by bad planning, fears of public anger over higher electricity rates and large electricity losses during transmission.",
      "\u201cWaiving the costs upfront makes it cheap for those building power plants, but ultimately the system has to bear that cost,\u201d said Rohit Chandra, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi.",
      "Accommodating inevitable fluctuations in solar and wind power is also costly, said Vibhuti Garg, an energy economist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis or IEEFA. That means keeping expensive coal power on standby.",
      "Renewable energy is cheaper than coal in India, but utilities still view clean power as just a \u201cstatutory obligation,\u201d said Alexander Hogeveen Rutter, an energy analyst in Bengaluru.",
      "To troubleshoot state utilities' financial woes, the federal government agency established the Solar Energy Corporation of India, or SECI, to help manage risks.",
      "SECI awarded a contract of 12 gigawatts of solar energy to the Adani Group and another New York Stock Exchange-listed company, Azure Power, at a specific price. The U.S. indictment alleges that state utilities balked at buying power at that rate and that the bribery was aimed at getting them to sign on.",
      "Azure Power said in a statement in November that it was cooperating with American agencies and that it had ceased to employ the people mentioned in the indictment. SECI didn't respond to queries from The Associated Press.",
      "SECI doesn\u2019t buy clean power but facilitates sales to Indian states. That cuts risks of power developers going unpaid but it has raised administrative costs, Rutter said. \"This whole scheme, which was supposed to drive down costs is actually driving up costs,\u201d he said.",
      "India restricts imports of cheap Chinese solar modules and is subsidizing local manufacturers. That helped raise domestic production by six-fold in 2021-2023, according to the Press Trust of India, though Indian-made solar components are more expensive than Chinese one.",
      "But India lags behind countries like Brazil and Australia in rooftop solar, having installed only 11 gigawatts so far -\u2013 far less than the 40 gigawatts it aimed to have by 2022. Policies favoring large installations have constrained growth of solar, which mainly comes from football-field-sized farms, Rutter said.",
      "Many large renewable energy companies, like Adani's, manufacture parts like solar panels and cells to help reduce their own costs and remain profitable while selling power at lower prices acceptable to the state-owned utilities, Garg said. But this limits competition since small companies \u2014 considered vital for India's clean energy ambitions \u2014 can't match the prices set by corporate giants that make the equipment used to generate solar power.",
      "The U.S. indictment has exposed weaknesses spots in India\u2019s regulatory framework, which is prone to \u201ccrony relationships\u201d between companies and the government, said Joe Athialy, executive director of the New Delhi-based Centre for Financial Accountability.",
      "Most government bids are conducted transparently, with some even driving down prices to unviable levels, said Vinay Rustagi, an independent energy consultant. But occasional \u201cone-off tenders\u201d are poorly publicized or slip under the radar, limiting competition.",
      "The fraud allegations against Adani reflect \"an extreme example of trying to combine solar project development with solar manufacturing,\u201d he said.",
      "Slower progress for India's transition away from fossil fuels matters. It's the most populous nation, with 1.4 billion people in 2023, and its electricity demand is projected to grow by at least 6% annually for the next few years, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "India's solar capacity has been growing rapidly with record-high solar power installations reported in 2024. But while solar makes up 16% of India's total generating capacity, it accounts for only 4% of the electricity used, according to government data compiled by IEEFA. The global average was over 5% in 2023, according to the London-based think tank Ember.",
      "By late 2024, SECI still didn\u2019t have buyers for 9 gigawatts or more than a third of the 24.5 gigawatts of solar power capacity it can offer.",
      "As is true in many places, insufficient storage capacity means solar projects struggle to find buyers since the utilities prefer to purchase stable, ready-to-use power. This is why only 16% of last year\u2019s new solar projects had found buyers by November, compared to 44% the year before, according to a report by the financial services firm JM Financial Institutional Securities.",
      "\u201cIndia\u2019s solar story, while still growing, is slowing down,\u201d said Chandra.",

      "President Donald Trump says he's buying a Tesla to show loyalty to company CEO Elon Musk",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump, who's buying a Tesla to show loyalty to company CEO Elon Musk, has had plenty to say about electric vehicles over the years. Most of it is not good.",
      "Of course, Trump was once a sharp critic of Musk, too, which is especially notable given how tight the pair are now.",
      "A look at some of Trump's comments on EVs \u2014 and Musk:",
      "Trump marked Christmas 2023 with a social media post lumping \u201cAll Electric Car Lunacy\u201d in with a number of political enemies that he said \u201care looking to destroy our once great USA. MAY THEY ROT IN HELL.\u201d",
      "A few weeks earlier, during a rally in Ankeny, Iowa, Trump said of EVs: \u201cThey don\u2019t go far. They cost a fortune.\u201d He also suggested that the U.S. military was looking at making \u201cArmy tanks all electric\u201d and scoffing, \u201cyou\u2019re in the middle of the desert and you say, \u2018You know what, we\u2019re running low on electric. Do they have a charger around anywhere?\u2019\u201d",
      "In November 2023, at a Claremont, New Hampshire, rally, Trump similarly picked up on distance being an electric vehicle issue: \u201cYou can\u2019t get out of New Hampshire in an electric car.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhere are you going? \u2018I\u2019m going to Massachusetts.\u2019 Well, you better get yourself a gas turbine because this car is not going to get you there,\" he said. \u201cWell, you could, if you stop about four times.\u201d",
      "That followed his joke during an event in Clive, Iowa, the previous month: \"Electric cars are good if you have a towing company.\"",
      "Electric vehicles were an especially attractive Trump target during the six-week United Auto Workers strike in September 2023. That's when he told a rally in Clinton Township, Michigan, \u201cYou go all electric so you can drive for 15 minutes before you have to get a charge.\u201d",
      "Trump, a Republican, also posted on his social media site that then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, sold autoworkers \"down the river with his ridiculous all Electric Car Hoax.\" He suggested that promoting electric vehicles \u201cwas the idea of the Radical Left Fascists, Marxists, & Communists\" and that \"Within 3 years, all of these cars will be made in China.\u201d",
      "As on many top issues, Trump has been inconsistent on electric vehicles. During his first term, in September 2020, Trump cheered an all-electric Lordstown Motors Endurance truck at an event outside the White House, calling it an \u201cincredible vehicle.\u201d",
      "After Musk endorsed the former president's bid to return to the White House, Trump began suggesting that electric vehicles could work for some buyers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m for electric cars. I have to be because Elon endorsed me very strongly,\" Trump said during an August rally in Atlanta.",
      "In a subsequent conversation on X, the social media platform Musk also owns, Trump called Tesla a \u201cgreat product\u201d while noting, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean everybody should have an electric car.\u201d",
      "During his inaugural address, Trump promised, \u201cWe will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry,\" but he also said that Americans will \"be able to buy the car of your choice.\u201d While there was no Biden mandate to force the purchase of EVs, his policies were aimed at encouraging Americans to buy them and car companies to shift from gas-powered vehicles to electric cars.",
      "Just like he had a change of heart about EVs, Trump has changed his tune about Musk, who's now one of his advisers. When the pair got into an online feud in 2022, Trump ridiculed Musk for seeking support during his first term.",
      "\u201cWhen Elon Musk came to the White House asking me for help on all of his many subsidized projects, whether it\u2019s electric cars that don\u2019t drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere, without which subsidies he\u2019d be worthless, and telling me how he was a big Trump fan and Republican, I could have said, \u2018drop to your knees and beg,\u2019 and he would have done it,\u201d Trump wrote then."

      "Bishop also has business ties to Australian companies involved in current and past mining and energy projects in Myanmar, Justice for Myanmar said.",

      "Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland, restated vigorously soon after he returned to the White House in January, comes as part of an aggressively \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy platform that includes demands for Ukraine to hand over mineral rights in exchange for continued military aid, threats to take control of the Panama Canal, and suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "Increasing international tensions, global warming and the changing world economy have put Greenland at the heart of the debate over global trade and security, and Trump wants to make sure that the U.S. controls this mineral-rich country that guards the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America.",

      "\u201cGreenland \u2014 located on the crossroads between North America, Europe and Asia, and with enormous resource potential \u2014 will only become more strategically important, with all powers great and small seeking to pay court to it.

      "Following the Cold War, the Arctic was largely an area of international cooperation. But climate change, the hunt for scarce resources and increasing international tensions following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine are once again driving competition in the region.",
      "Greenland sits off the northeastern coast of Canada, with more than two-thirds of its territory lying within the Arctic Circle. That has made it crucial to the defense of North America since World War II, when the U.S. occupied Greenland to ensure that it didn\u2019t fall into the hands of Nazi Germany and to protect crucial North Atlantic shipping lanes.",
      "The U.S. has retained bases in Greenland since the war, and the Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Force Base, supports missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO. Greenland also guards part of what is known as the GIUK (Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom) Gap, where NATO monitors Russian naval movements in the North Atlantic.",
      "Greenland has large deposits of so-called rare earth minerals that are needed to make everything from computers and smartphones to the batteries, solar and wind technologies that will power the transition away from fossil fuels. The U.S. Geological Survey has also identified potential offshore deposits of oil and natural gas.",
      "Greenlanders are keen to develop the resources, but they have enacted strict rules to protect the environment. There are also questions about the feasibility of extracting Greenland\u2019s mineral wealth because of the region\u2019s harsh climate.",
      "Greenland\u2019s retreating ice cap is exposing the country\u2019s mineral wealth and melting sea ice is opening up the once mythical Northwest Passage through the Arctic.",
      "Greenland sits strategically along two potential routes through the Arctic, which would reduce shipping times between the North Atlantic and Pacific and bypass the bottlenecks of the Suez and Panama canals. While the routes aren\u2019t likely to be commercially viable for many years, they are attracting attention.",
      "In 2018, China declared itself a \u201cnear-Arctic state\u201d in an effort to gain more influence in the region. China has also announced plans to build a \u201cPolar Silk Road\u201d as part of its global Belt and Road Initiative, which has created economic links with countries around the world.",
      "Then U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected China\u2019s move, saying: \u201cDo we want the Arctic Ocean to transform into a new South China Sea, fraught with militarization and competing territorial claims?\u201d A Chinese backed rare earth mining project in Greenland stalled after the local government banned uranium mining in 2021.",
      "The legislation that extended self-government to Greenland in 2009 also recognized the country\u2019s right to independence under international law. Opinion polls show a majority of Greenlanders favor independence, though they differ on exactly when that should occur. The potential for independence raises questions about outside interference in Greenland that could threaten U.S. interests in the country."

      "To billionaire Elon Musk and his cost-cutting team at the Department of Government Efficiency, Karen Ortiz may just be one of many faceless bureaucrats",
      "NEW YORK -- To billionaire Elon Musk and his cost-cutting team at the Department of Government Efficiency, Karen Ortiz may just be one of many faceless bureaucrats. But to some of her colleagues, she is giving a voice to those who feel they can't speak out.",
      "Ortiz is an administrative judge at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission -- the federal agency in charge of enforcing U.S. workplace anti-discrimination laws that has undergone tumultuous change since President Donald Trump took office. Like millions of other federal employees, Ortiz opened an ominous email on Jan. 28 titled \u201cFork in the Road\" giving them the option to resign from their positions as part of the government\u2019s cost-cutting measures directed by Trump and carried out by DOGE under Musk, an unelected official.",
      "Her alarm grew when her supervisor directed administrative judges in her New York district office to pause all their current LGBTQ+ cases and send them to Washington for further review in order to comply with Trump's executive order declaring that the government would recognize only two \u201cimmutable\u201d sexes \u2014 male and female.",
      "Ortiz decried management\u2019s lack of action in response to the directive, which she said was antithetical to the EEOC\u2019s mission, and called upon some 185 colleagues in an email to \u201cresist\u201d complying with \u201cillegal mandates.\u201d But that email was \u201cmysteriously\u201d deleted, she said.",
      "The next day, after yet another frustrating \u201cFork in the Road\u201d update, Ortiz decided to go big, emailing the EEOC's acting chair Andrea Lucas directly and copying more than 1,000 colleagues with the subject line, \u201cA Spoon is Better than a Fork.\" In it, Ortiz questioned Lucas's fitness to serve as acting chair, \u201cmuch less hold a license to practice law.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know I take a great personal risk in sending out this message. But, at the end of the day, my actions align with what the EEOC was charged with doing under the law,\u201d Ortiz wrote. \u201cI will not compromise my ethics and my duty to uphold the law. I will not cower to bullying and intimidation.\u201d",
      "Ortiz is just one person, but her email represents a larger pushback against the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping changes to federal agencies amid an environment of confusion, anger and chaos. It is also Ortiz\u2019s way of taking a stand against the leadership of a civil rights agency that last month moved to dismiss seven of its own cases representing transgender workers, marking a major departure from its prior interpretation of the law.",
      "Right after sending her mass email, Ortiz said she received a few supportive responses from colleagues -- and one calling her unprofessional. Within an hour, though, the message disappeared and she lost her ability to send any further emails.",
      "But it still made it onto the internet. The email was recirculated on Bluesky and it received more than 10,000 \u201cupvotes\u201d on Reddit after someone posted it with the comment, \u201cWow I wish I had that courage.\u201d",
      "\u201cAN AMERICAN HERO,\u201d one Reddit user deemed Ortiz, a sentiment that was seconded by more than 2,000 upvoters. \u201cWho is this freedom fighter bringing on the fire?\" wrote another.",
      "The EEOC did not feel the same way. The agency revoked her email privileges for about a week and issued her a written reprimand for \u201cdiscourteous conduct.\u201d",
      "Contacted by The AP, a spokesperson for the EEOC said: \u201cWe will refrain from commenting on internal communications and personnel matters. However, we would note that the agency has a long-standing policy prohibiting unauthorized all-employee emails, and all employees were reminded of that policy recently.\u201d",
      "A month later, Ortiz has no regrets.",
      "\u201cIt was not really planned out, it was just from the heart,\u201d the 53-year-old told The Associated Press in an interview, adding that partisan politics have nothing to do with her objections and that the public deserves the EEOC's protection, including transgender workers. \u201cThis is how I feel and I\u2019m not pulling any punches. And I will stand by what I wrote every day of the week, all day on Sunday.\u201d",
      "Ortiz said she never intended for her email to go beyond the EEOC, describing it as a \u201clove letter\u201d to her colleagues. But, she added, \u201cI hope that it lights a fire under people.\u201d",
      "Ortiz said she has received \u201ca ton\u201d of support privately in the month since sending her email, including a thank-you letter from a California retiree telling her to \u201ckeep the faith.\u201d Open support among her EEOC colleagues beyond Reddit and Bluesky, however, has proven more elusive.",
      "\u201cI think people are just really scared,\u201d she said.",
      "William Resh, a University of Southern California Sol Price School of Public Policy professor who studies how administrative structure and political environments affect civil servants, weighed in on why federal workers may choose to say nothing even if they feel their mission is being undermined.",
      "\u201cWe can talk pie in the sky, mission orientation and all these other things. But at the end of the day, people have a paycheck to bring home, and food to put on a table and a rent to pay,\u201d Resh said.",
      "The more immediate danger, he said, is the threat to one's livelihood, or inviting a manager's ire.",
      "\u201cAnd so then that\u2019s where you get this kind of muted response on behalf of federal employees, that you don\u2019t see a lot of people speaking out within these positions because they don\u2019t want to lose their job,\u201d Resh said. \u201cWho would?\u201d",
      "Richard LeClear, a U.S. Air Force veteran and EEOC staffer who is retiring early at 64 to avoid serving under the Trump administration, said Ortiz\u2019s email was \u201cspot on,\u201d but added that other colleagues who agreed with her may fear speaking out themselves.",
      "\u201cRetaliation is a very real thing,\u201d LeClear said.",
      "Ortiz, who has been a federal employee for 14 years and at the EEOC for six, said she isn\u2019t naive about the potential fallout. She has hired attorneys, and maintains that her actions are protected whistleblower activity. As of Friday, she still had a job but she is not a lifetime appointee and is aware that her health care, pension and source of income could all be at risk.",
      "Ortiz is nonetheless steadfast: \u201cIf they fire me, I\u2019ll find another avenue to do this kind of work, and I\u2019ll be okay. They will have to physically march me out of the office.\u201d",
      "Many of Ortiz\u2019s colleagues have children to support and protect, which puts them in a more difficult position than her to speak out, Ortiz acknowledged. She said her legal education and American citizenship also put her in a position to be able to make change.",
      "Her parents, who came to the United States from Puerto Rico in the 1950s with limited English skills, ingrained in her the value of standing up for others. Their firsthand experience with the Civil Rights Movement, and her own experience growing up in mostly white spaces in Garden City on Long Island, primed Ortiz to defend herself and others.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in my DNA,\u201d she said. \u201cI will use every shred of privilege that I have to lean into this.\u201d",
      "Ortiz received her undergraduate degree at Columbia University, and her law degree at Fordham University. She knew she wanted to become a judge ever since her high school mock trial as a Supreme Court justice.",
      "Civil rights has been a throughline in her career, and Ortiz said she was \u201csuper excited\u201d when she landed her job at the EEOC.",
      "\u201cThis is how I wanted to finish up my career,\" she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if that happens.\u201d",

      "BERLIN -- Flight cancellations at Hamburg Airport after a surprise strike by workers affected more than 40,000 passengers on Sunday, a day before a planned wider protest across Germany amid new contract negotiations.",
      "Only 10 of more than 280 scheduled flights went as planned early Sunday, the airport said. Many service desks sat empty as would-be passengers lined up to seek information about the cancellations. One big electronic departure board overhead had \u201ccanceled\u201d in red next to the list of all flights.",
      "The surprise walkout, which reportedly took place with only about a half-hour advance notice, came before a broader series of preannounced strikes across 13 airports in Germany on Monday, organized by the ver.di union.",
      "The union, whose members work in areas including passenger services and cargo and goods screening, called for Sunday's strike by security control staff to put pressure on company representatives amid collective bargaining talks.",
      "\u201cThe behavior of the trade union ver.di is dishonorable: The strike without notice hits Hamburg Airport at the start of the vacation season,\" airport spokeswoman Katja Bromm said in a statement. She said that on Monday, arrivals would be possible, and that \u201cconsiderable disruptions and cancellations\u201d were expected.",
      "Bromm said that Sunday's walkouts were \"excessive and unfair to tens of thousands of travelers who have nothing to do with the disputes.\u201d",
      "For months, ver.di has been negotiating a new agreement that aims to improve occupational health and safety, provide more vacation days, an increase in the annual bonus to 50% and the freedom to choose a doctor for employees\u2019 regular, mandatory medical exams, among other things.",
      "Lars Stubbe, a trade union official, said that \u201ca strike must cause economic damage.\u201d",

      "Some would-be passengers didn't hide their frustration.",
      "\u201cI also wonder why it\u2019s like this, because it was supposed to be a big strike tomorrow (Monday) \u2014 and why is it today?\u201d said Alva Wetzel, who had hoped to travel. \u201cIt\u2019s just stupid.\u201d",

      "BERLIN -- Germany's Greens, whose support is needed for the prospective next government's plans to loosen debt rules for defense spending and draw up a huge infrastructure investment fund, said Monday that they won't support the package as things stand.",
      "Conservative leader Friedrich Merz, who won last month's German election, is trying to put together a coalition with outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left Social Democrats. Last week, the two sides said they would seek to exempt some defense spending from the nation's tight self-imposed rules on running up debt, an issue of growing urgency as doubts increase about the U.S. commitment to European allies.",
      "They also want to set up a 500 billion euro ($533 billion) fund, financed by borrowing, to invest in Germany\u2019s creaking infrastructure over the next 10 years and help restore the economy to growth.",
      "Their plans will need a two-thirds majority in parliament because Germany's \u201cdebt brake\u201d \u2014 which allows new borrowing worth only 0.35% of annual gross domestic product \u2014 is anchored in the constitution. And they are trying to get them through the outgoing parliament next week, rather than the newly elected one, because parties that for different reasons are unlikely to agree to the plans have just over one-third of the seats in the new chamber.",
      "Since Merz's Union bloc and the Social Democrats don't have enough seats to pass the plans on their own, they need support from the environmentalist Greens.",
      "The leadership of the Greens' parliamentary group decided Monday to recommend that their lawmakers reject the plans, co-leader Katharina Dr\u00f6ge said. She said the Greens have long sought a reform of the \u201cdebt brake\u201d to ease investment in the economy and measures against climate change, while Merz had insisted before the election that there was no need to finance such investments through borrowing.",
      "Dr\u00f6ge argued that the prospective coalition partners' proposed infrastructure fund wouldn't actually target useful investments, but instead serve as a \u201ctreasure chest\u201d for measures such as tax cuts.",
      "Asked about the Greens' comments, the general secretary of Merz's Christian Democratic Union, Carsten Linnemann, said talks would be held with the Greens \u201cand then we will see how far we get.\u201d His party also plans to talk to the pro-business Free Democrats, but that party has strongly criticized running up more debt.",

      "Old 401(k)s are a little like the old clothes in the back of your closet",
      "Old 401(k)s are a little like the old clothes in the back of your closet. You know you should do something about them, but there they sit, mostly out of sight and mind.",
      "And so it is with your old 401(k). If deciding what to do with an old (k) plan has been on your to-do list for a while, here are the key steps you should take to get it done.",
      "If your balance in your former employer\u2019s 401(k) plan is over $7,000, you can leave the money behind in the old plan or roll the assets into an IRA or your new employer\u2019s 401(k).",
      "But if your balance falls below that $7,000 threshold, some of the decision-making may be out of your hands.",
      "Assuming your balance is over $7,000, your next task is to decide whether to roll the money into an IRA or keep it inside a 401(k).",
      "I often recommend rolling over the assets from a former 401(k) into a no-fee IRA with a topnotch mutual fund company or discount broker. But some people value the extra creditor protections that can accompany 401(k) assets versus IRA assets, while others may prize 401(k)-specific investment options.",
      "If you think you will be better off leaving your money inside a 401(k) rather than rolling it over to an IRA, the next job is to conduct some research on your own 401(k) options.",
      "Even if you do decide to stay with a 401(k), you may need to decide whether you\u2019re better off staying put in your former employer\u2019s plan or that of your new employer.",
      "If a rollover to an IRA is the way to go, the next step is to identify the right brokerage firm or mutual fund company. Look for a firm that offers a breadth of high-quality investment options with no additional layers of fees for IRA investors. Target-date funds are an elegant, low-maintenance, and underutilized option.",
      "If you decide to roll Roth 401(k) contributions to an IRA or your current employer\u2019s 401(k), your new account will be Roth, too, meaning that you won\u2019t owe tax on qualified withdrawals.",
      "If you have traditional 401(k) assets, a rollover is also a good time to consider whether to convert those assets to a Roth account at the same time.",
      "If you\u2019ve decided to roll over your assets to an IRA, fill out the paperwork or online form to open the IRA. You\u2019ll then request a direct rollover from your 401(k) plan to the new IRA provider.",
      "The process may be a bit more cumbersome if you\u2019re rolling over to your current employer\u2019s 401(k).",
      "In both cases, make sure your 401(k) provider makes the check payable to the provider and sends it directly to them, rather than to you. If the check is made out to you, 20% of the balance will be withheld for income tax. You\u2019ll then have 60 days to get that money deposited into an IRA or another 401(k); if that deadline comes and goes, the distribution will count as a withdrawal and you\u2019ll owe ordinary income tax and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you\u2019re not 55 or older.",
      "If you\u2019ve decided to roll over your assets from an old 401(k) to another 401(k) or IRA, you\u2019ll also have to determine how you\u2019ll allocate those assets.",
      "If all of your retirement assets were in your old 401(k), a sturdy target-date fund is a one-stop, low-maintenance choice that you can hold into retirement. If your old 401(k) is just one of several accounts geared toward retirement, a rollover can be an ideal time to check up on how all the pieces fit together\u2014and where you have holes.",

      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Praised by the ancient Greek giants Homer and Euripides for its superb quality nearly 3,000 years ago, Cyprus\u2019 Commandaria is the world\u2019s oldest recorded and named wine.",
      "Despite its rich heritage, the sweet wine has struggled to find its niche in the global market. Now a number of micro-wineries in this east Mediterranean island nation are reviving traditional wine-making techniques and giving Commandaria a chance at a long-awaited comeback.",
      "Makers hope to tap rich legends around the ruby red wine.",
      "It\u2019s said to have won the world's first known wine competition during the 13th century rule of French King Philippe Augustus. English King Richard the Lionheart is said to have served it to guests at his 1191 wedding in Cyprus. And 14th century Mayor of London Henry Picard reputedly indulged the leaders of England, France, Scotland, Denmark and Cyprus in the Feast of the Five Kings.",
      "The wine, known as \u201cnama\u201d in antiquity, was renamed by the medieval Knights Hospitaller, who set up headquarters during the Third Crusade at an estate known for its wine production that they named Grande Commanderie.",
      "The island\u2019s Orthodox Church later adopted Commandaria as its communion wine during Byzantine times.",
      "Production peaked when Venice ruled Cyprus in the 15th and 16th centuries and prized the wine for its sweetness and complex bouquet.",
      "Now bottles are sold for around 20 euros ($20) to up to 150.",
      "The wine's notes of honey, raisin, walnut, fig, carob, cinnamon, coffee and caramel are attributed to the island\u2019s rich volcanic soil, said Christakis Nicolaou, community leader of Zoopigi village, home to the Commandaria museum.",
      "Annual production of the wine in recent years hovered at around 200,000 bottles because demand tapered off, according to Savvas Constantinou, a beverage inspector with Cyprus\u2019 agriculture and environment ministry.",
      "One factor is the exclusion of some 800,000 Commandaria-loving Russian tourists as a result of sanctions imposed following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Constantinou said a bid to expand into the massive Chinese market made headway five years ago but wavered after producers couldn\u2019t meet demand.",
      "Wine expert Demetri Walters, who holds the prestigious title of Master of Wines, said Commandaria sales haven\u2019t gained much traction abroad primarily because of a lack of marketing. For instance, the island\u2019s main producer KEO have been slow to understand the potential of the wine, particularly their older vintages.",
      "\u201cA shame, as their Commandaria wines are very good,\u201d Walters told the Associated Press. \u201cThe unique and antique history, the extraordinary quality across the two styles and the terrific value for money...Everyone who tastes it for the first time with me is blown away by the complexity of the wine.\u201d",
      "Walters said although sweet wines are \u201cout of fashion\u201d except in the specialist trade, this is slowly changing for Commandaria. He said the wine was entered the UK market in recent years, but as a niche offering.",
      "Wineries such as Revecca in the mountain village of Ayios Mamas have found a steady domestic and foreign following, with sales on an upward swing since it opened in 2015.",
      "Its Commandaria last year won top prize at the national wine competition. The winery employs three people and produces 3,000 bottles a year.",
      "Winery curator Nikolas Christodoulides said he\u2019s experimenting with bespoke varieties catering to clients' tastes.",
      "\u201cOur focus is on improving quality rather than being fixated on quantity,\u201d Christodoulides said. The approach has worked for one Israeli couple who, according to Christodoulides, flies to Cyprus just to replenish their stock.",
      "Commandaria is made with dark Mavro and white Xynisteri grapes that are indigenous to Cyprus. They are left in the sunshine after harvest for seven to 12 days to bring out the distinctive sweetness.",
      "The wine is matured in reused oak barrels for at least two years in line with strict production laws to conform with the European Union\u2019s protected designation of origin. That means authentic Commandaria comes only from 14 villages on the southern face of the Troodos mountain range, where they\u2019re exposed to sunlight throughout the day.",
      "Some wineries produce a darker, sweeter version made strictly from the Mavro grapes. That version is preferred at the Karseras winery in the village of Doros, with an annual average production of 40 tons.",
      "Manager Philippos Karseras is encouraged by an upswing in domestic consumption, though it isn\u2019t quite enough to make up for the loss of the Russian market.",
      "But those running the Revecca winery believe that these small wineries will gradually win back consumers.",
      "\u201cWe have ensure the consistency of our product\u2019s quality first and win over the domestic market before we can make a collective push to market Commandaria abroad,\u201d Christodoulides said."

      "Algeria is planning to import one million sheep ahead of Eid al-Adha to curb rising prices and shortages amid drought and inflation",
      "ALGIERS, Algeria -- Algeria\u2019s president has announced plans to import a staggering one million sheep ahead of this year\u2019s Eid al-Adha, the Muslim holiday during which families worldwide purchase livestock for sacrifice.",
      "President Abdelmadjid Tebboune on Sunday instructed his ministers to launch plans for the massive livestock import effort to stabilize costs and meet soaring demand.",
      "The plan is the latest in a series of measures designed to ease public frustration over rising costs and the military-backed government's uncompromising grip on power.",
      "It builds on previous efforts to flood markets with food staples throughout Islam's holy month of Ramadan. Yet its scale has few parallels.",
      "North Africa is enduring its seventh consecutive year of extreme heat and below-average rainfall. The record drought has shrunk harvests and driven up the price of animal feed needed to raise livestock, including in the northern Algerian highlands where breeders raise sheep revered by the population for their quality.",
      "Algeria\u2019s government has traditionally played a dominant role in the economy and in the past imported livestock in small quantities to ensure affordable options for low-income citizens. Last year, it facilitated the sale of 100,000 sheep in state-run stores, sourcing them from Argentina, Australia, Brazil and Spain.",
      "Eid al-Adha, which takes place this year in early June, is an annual \u201cfeast of sacrifice\u201d in which Muslims slaughter sheep to honor a passage of the Quran in which the prophet Ibrahim prepared to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to God, who intervened and replaced the child with a sheep.",
      "It's a celebrated tradition in Muslim-majority Algeria, yet also a pricey proposition. During last year\u2019s Eid, sheep prices skyrocketed to 200,000 Algerian dinars ($1,496) in some markets \u2014 ten times the country\u2019s minimum wage. Many Algerians have in recent years been forced to forgo the cherished tradition.",
      "This year\u2019s initiative aims to prevent price spikes and shortages that could put the ritual sacrifice out of reach for most Algerian families.",
      "The Ministries of Agriculture and Trade will immediately seek international sources to meet Tebboune\u2019s target, hoping to counteract the soaring inflation that has pushed basic goods and services \u2014 including meat \u2014 beyond the reach of many.",
      "\u201cThank God, this year\u2019s Ramadan is a blessing. The markets are well-stocked, housewives can shop without stress, without pressure. Products are available, and prices are accessible,\u201d said Yasmine Zireg, a mother of three, on Monday.",
      "History has shown that food prices can incite widespread political anger in North Africa and Algeria isn't the only country taking steps ahead of Eid Al-Adha.",
      "Its import plan comes just ten days after neighboring Morocco\u2019s King Mohammed VI offered his subjects a reprieve from the costly ritual. The King said in a Feb. 27 letter read on state-run television, warned that the slaughter could burden low-income Moroccans and, as the highest religious authority under Moroccan law, said they could forgo it.",
      "The move \u2014 which was widely covered in Algerian media \u2014 could harm livestock producers and put disparities between those who can afford sheep and those who can't on stark display.",
      "Tebboune\u2019s intervention is also designed to make the Eid more feasible for those who otherwise couldn't afford sheep. It's one of several government spending policies Algeria has put in place to calm social unrest while continuing to crack down on opposition parties, journalists and people critical of the military-backed government."

The six-team league is drawing an average of 7,300 fans this season \u2013 up from 5,500 last year \u2013 and might expand by as many as two franchise next season.",
      "USA Hockey had 73,083 registrations among girls in 2023-24, a 47.4% increase over its 2013-14 total (49,587). Boys registrations increased by 4.8% over the same time, from 302,303 to 316,737.",
      "\u201cOverall, the skill level has gotten so much better over the years that it becomes one of those sports that was almost a no-brainer to be adding at the Division III level,\u201d said Joe Cranston, who coaches defending champion Wisconsin-River Falls, which hosts the D-III championship March 28-30. The 12-team tournament begins Saturday on campus sites.",
      "There are 44 women's hockey programs in Division I and Division II, a 12.8% rise from 2015 (39). The two divisions compete in a single national tournament, which ends this year with the Women's Frozen Four March 21-23 in Minneapolis.",
      "The modest growth at the higher level can be blamed on the bigger costs with adding a D-I program. Ice availability is a factor for any team at any level, and setting budgets is difficult for any athletic director dealing with the NCAA House settlement and name, image and likeness compensation questions.",
      "Minnesota reported operating expenses of a little over $3.6 million for women\u2019s hockey in 2023-24. Michigan released a feasibility study saying expenses would run about $4.5 million annually if it started a women\u2019s hockey program.",
      "By contrast, Wisconsin-River Falls reported $197,087 in women\u2019s hockey expenses in its 2024 Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act survey.",
      "Michelle McAteer has a unique perspective, as a new commissioner of a Division I conference (the Western Collegiate Hockey Association) who finished a 14-season run coaching Division III program Augsburg last year.",
      "\u201cHockey\u2019s an expensive sport to operate, and to operate a rink is an expensive investment,\u201d McAteer said. \u201cAt the Division III level, not everyone has their own rinks on campus. You can get by playing in community rinks and renting. The facility demands at the Division I level are quite different. The investment and infrastructure are a lot more. Everything is more. They have more significant travel. They have a more significant equipment budget, the staffing differences.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s probably enough talent nowadays to accommodate more Division I programs. The difference is apparent on the ice.",
      "\u201cTen to 12 years ago, there were a lot of teams at the Division I level that might have had one good line, a line-and-a-half, maybe two,\u201d said coach Mark Johnson, whose Badgers have been the top-ranked team in women's hockey most of the season. \u201cNow everybody\u2019s got two or three lines, maybe four lines, that can compete and play at a real high level.\u201d",
      "Because the schools in larger divisions haven\u2019t added women\u2019s hockey programs at a rate that correlates with the growth in the sport at the youth level, it\u2019s created more opportunities for Division III schools.",
      "\u201cI have kids on my team who were All-Americans 15 years ago who couldn\u2019t make my team now,\u201d Cranston said. \u201cKids who were Division I players 10 years ago who couldn\u2019t make my team now.\u201d",
      "Plattsburgh State won five titles in a six-year stretch from 2014-19, but there\u2019s been a different champion for each of the last five tournaments.",
      "Norwich won in 2018, Plattsburgh State in 2019, Middlebury in 2022, Gustavus Adolphus in 2023 and Wisconsin-River Falls last year. There were no Division III championships in 2020 or 2021 due to the pandemic.",
      "\u201cMost years there\u2019s maybe three or four teams that could win it all,\u201d Cranston said. \u201cI think this year there\u2019s probably twice that, probably seven or eight teams that could win the whole thing.\u201d",
      "SUNY Oswego athletic director Wendy McManus, the head of the NCAA Division III women\u2019s hockey committee, says smaller schools will continue adding the sport as long as youth participation stays strong.",
      "\u201cI do think eventually it will level off,\u201d McManus said. \u201cI say that because you don\u2019t see California schools or true West Coast schools playing hockey that much. We say \u2018West\u2019 is basically Minnesota, Wisconsin.\u201d",
      "That growth has provided welcome opportunities that might not have been available a decade earlier.",
      "For instance, MSOE\u2019s roster includes forward Hannah Baumann of Wausau, Wisconsin, who said she grew up idolizing Marabella and was a big Badgers fan. Baumann used to have to drive an hour to practice because of the relative lack of girls hockey teams.",
      "There now are more girls teams than ever, and some gather in the stands for MSOE\u2019s home games. That has particular meaning for forward Helen Bechthold, who grew up in the Milwaukee area playing for one of those youth programs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cool to see they have all-girls teams playing now, because when I was playing, they didn\u2019t have all-girls teams,\u201d said Bechthold, who grew up playing with boys. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see. A lot of them were like, \u2018You played where we play\u2019 and stuff like that. That definitely makes me happy. I\u2019m happy they have that opportunity.\u201d",

      "Andrea Kimi Antonelli once hid in a stack of tires to get through security and into the Formula 1 paddock. Now the 18-year-old Italian is Lewis Hamilton's successor at Mercedes.",
      "Antonelli is among F1's biggest intake of new drivers in years as top teams put some trust in youth. Six of the 20 drivers on the 2025 grid are starting their first full seasons in F1. Some could potentially compete for wins. Others already risk losing a hard-won F1 seat.",
      "An unexpectedly talented Formula 2 field last season came at a time when some F1 teams were keen to move on from older drivers like Sergio Perez and Valtteri Bottas. Switching in 2025 gives teams a chance to let youngsters gain experience before the F1 car design rules change radically for 2026.",
      "Here's a look at the rookie class:",
      "Stepping into a seven-time champion's shoes at Mercedes puts the spotlight on Antonelli, who is set to become the third-youngest F1 driver ever. The Italian wants to be known as just \u201cthe next Mercedes driver\u201d because of Hamilton's legacy. The first time Antonelli visited an F1 paddock was age eight in 2014 when his father Marco \u2014 who ran a team in a support series \u2014 hid him in a stack of tires under an umbrella to get past security and into the German Grand Prix. \u201cThat was a really cool experience,\u201d he said last month. Antonelli had a stellar record in junior series and was sixth in F2 last year but a heavy crash in practice for Mercedes at Monza in August was a tough introduction to F1.",
      "The Red Bull driver is the odd man out in this list because he\u2019s taken part in 11 F1 races since 2023, though never a full season. He says he\u2019ll feel \u201cmore like a rookie\u201d at the start of the season on tracks he hasn\u2019t raced before. Partnering four-time champion Max Verstappen as the replacement for Perez is a daunting task for Lawson, who knocked Verstappen out of qualifying in only his third F1 race in Singapore in 2023. The New Zealander needs to justify Red Bull\u2019s decision to elevate him over his 2024 teammate \u2014 and former roommate \u2014 Yuki Tsunoda, who outperformed Lawson over their six races together last year.",
      "It's less than a year since Bearman burst onto the scene in F1 with a combative seventh-place finish for Ferrari in Saudi Arabia while Carlos Sainz Jr. was sidelined because of surgery. He'd never previously raced in Jeddah and was racing with two days' notice. Bearman beat experienced teammate Nico H\u00fclkenberg in two races for Haas later that year and is now a full-time Haas driver for 2025. Bearman remains part of Ferrari's junior program but displacing regular Ferrari drivers Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc is unlikely any time soon.",
      "The son of legendary motorcycle world champion Mick Doohan enters 2025 with his F1 career under threat as soon as it has begun. Alpine's decision to sign ex-Williams driver Franco Colapinto as reserve means a would-be replacement is available if Doohan doesn't impress team management. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to have pressure on your shoulders because you\u2019re in such a cut-throat sport,\u201d Doohan said. The Australian driver placed third in F2 in 2023 but didn't race at all last year until a surprise entry for the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Finishing 15th, he was far off the pace of teammate Pierre Gasly in seventh.",
      "Lawson's promotion to Red Bull left an opening at its second team, now rebranded Racing Bulls, for F2 runner-up Hadjar. The French driver arrives at a team with a history of changing drivers mid-season if they don't perform. Even eight-time Grand Prix winner Daniel Ricciardo didn't last a full year there in 2024.",
      "Despite winning the F2 title last season, beating Hadjar, Antonelli and Bearman, Bortoleto's arrival in F1 has been overshadowed by his former rivals. That's partly because his new team Sauber struggled last year and is marking time before a full rebrand as the Audi works team in 2026. With a helmet design paying tribute to three-time champion Ayrton Senna, Bortoleto is F1's first full-time Brazilian driver since 2017.",

      "There are 14 teams that were in the preseason AP Top 25 men's college basketball poll that are no longer in the rankings this week",
      "LAWRENCE, Kan. -- This was a time early in the season when Kansas seemed to be an insurmountable juggernaut, full of high-profile transfers such as Zeke Mayo and AJ Storr, All-American candidates such as Hunter Dickinson and veterans accustomed to winning.",
      "They were the preseason No. 1 in the AP Top 25. And for several weeks, the Jayhawks played like it.",
      "But things hardly went according to script the rest of the season. They lost to longtime rival Missouri in a non-conference game, and dropped rare home games to West Virginia, Houston and Texas Tech. They plummeted out of the Top 25 altogether, ending a run of 80 consecutive weeks in the poll, and tumbled down the Big 12 standings.",
      "Now, they enter their conference tournament as the No. 6 seed. And perhaps most importantly, they could be staring at the same seeding \u2014 or worse \u2014 in the NCAA tourney, where coach Bill Self's teams have never been worse than a No. 4.",
      "\u201cI think we're talented enough. We were the preseason No. 1 team in the country for a reason,\u201d Dickinson said after a confidence-boosting win over Arizona on Saturday. \u201cWe have the talent. But it's just a matter of going out there and showing it.\u201d",
      "They will get their chance beginning Wednesday, when they play Utah or UCF in the second round of the Big 12 Tournament.",
      "Kansas isn't the only once-highly ranked team trying to build some late-season momentum, though. In fact, the Jayhawks are one of 14 teams that were ranked in the preseason poll but no longer reside in it. Many are still locks to make the NCAA field Sunday, but others are teetering on the bubble and a couple may need to win their league tournaments just to qualify.",
      "Arizona dropped from the Top 25 this week after its loss at Allen Fieldhouse, but the No. 3 seed in the Big 12 tourney is still a good bet for a good seed on Selection Sunday. So is two-time reigning national champion UConn, which was ranked third in the preseason Top 25 but dropped out in early February and is seeded third in the Big East Tournament.",
      "Other unranked locks include Creighton, the second seed in the Big East; Gonzaga, the No. 2 seed in the West Coast behind Saint Mary's; and Ole Miss, which was ranked as high as No. 16 this season and is seeded eighth in the SEC tourney.",
      "Baylor was ranked eighth in the preseason Top 25 but fell out by mid-January, and going 4-6 over its final 10 games ahead of the Big 12 tourney \u2014 where it is seeded seventh \u2014 hardly helps. Still, the Bears of VJ Edgecomb and Co. took second-ranked Houston to the wire last weekend, and picking up a win in Kansas City this week should be enough.",
      "Arkansas, which was preseason No. 16, enters the SEC tourney having won four of five, and a win or two as the No. 9 seed could be important. The same goes for preseason No. 17 Indiana, which is likewise seeded ninth in the Big Ten Tournament.",
      "North Carolina is starting to resemble the preseason No. 9 in the country, but a slew of early losses \u2014 Stanford, Wake Forest, Pitt and Duke during one five-game stretch \u2014 has made life tough for the Tar Heels. They're seeded fifth in the ACC and could need at least two wins to make the NCAA field, and perhaps to save coach Hubert Davis' job.",
      "Texas also could be playing for its coach, Rodney Terry, along with an NCAA berth. The Longhorns were preseason No. 19 but out by early January. They are are seeded 13th in the SEC and open with fellow bubble-dweller Vanderbilt on Wednesday.",
      "Cincinnati was ranked 20th and Rutgers was 25th in the preseason Top 25, but both probably need to win their conference tournaments to make the NCAA field. The Bearcats are seeded 13th in the Big 12 and play Oklahoma State on Tuesday, while the Scarlet Knights are 11th in the Big Ten and open with USC on Wednesday.",

They have no other losses and won the SEC regular season and conference tournaments. Staley feels they should be No. 1 by how tough a schedule they've faced.",
      "The Bruins have just two losses on their schedule this season, both coming to rival USC. They went through a difficult Big Ten season and came away unblemished other than the losses to the Trojans. UCLA had a convincing win over South Carolina in November that vaunted them up to No. 1 for 12 weeks.",

      "This fall will mark the 10th anniversary of the NBA changing its playoff rules and not guaranteeing a division champion a top-four seed regardless of record.",
      "This season's Southeast Division is a good reason why that change was necessary.",
      "In NBA history, there\u2019s never been a division with a worst won-loss record than the Southeast this season. Entering Monday, the five teams in the Southeast \u2014 Atlanta, Orlando, Miami, Charlotte and Washington \u2014 had a combined record of 113-200, that winning percentage of .369 set to be the worst of any division ever.",
      "The official low bar, for now, is a winning percentage .384 by the Central Division in 1970-71. That was a season where Baltimore won the division at 42-40 and Atlanta, Cincinnati and Cleveland combined to go 84-162.",
      "And this is the crazy part about the Southeast: this season, Atlanta, Orlando and Miami seem pretty much like locks for the play-in tournament at this point, meaning two of those teams are going to make the playoffs even though none are on pace to finish with a winning record.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know division-wise, but I just know it seems in both conferences it\u2019s a dogfight,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cWith the play-in and everything, it\u2019s been really good for the league. A lot more teams are competing.\u201d",
      "The Southeast being the NBA's official battleground division is not a new thing. There won't be a 50-win team from the Southeast this year; that's no surprise, because there's been only one \u2014 the 2021-22 Heat, who went 53-29 \u2014 in the last 10 seasons.",
      "Let's put that in some perspective. The Atlantic Division has had 15 teams reach the 50-win mark over the last decade, the Northwest and Pacific have each had 11, the Central and Southwest have each had nine. Boston is on pace to do it for a sixth time in that span, Cleveland has done it five including this season already, Golden State has done it five and Toronto has five such seasons in that span as well.",
      "The Southeast? Nope, just the one.",
      "Forget winning 50 games. Over the last decade there have been only 17 instances \u2014 out of 50 chances \u2014 of a Southeast team simply finishing a regular season with a winning record. And someone's going to have to go on a heck of a tear if a team from the Southeast is going to add to that total this season. That said, there are three teams still very much in the race for something.",
      "\u201cI do feel like having more teams involved can be good,\" Atlanta coach Quin Snyder said. \u201cI think that distinction between being a playoff team and a play-in team is a little bit murky to me. It's the postseason, in my mind.\u201d",
      "Charlotte and Washington are headed to the lottery and have been headed there from basically the start of the season. Miami, Atlanta and Orlando all still have hope of turning this season into something memorable.",
      "The Heat went from the play-in to the NBA Finals two years ago, which is something that Snyder pointed to as further proof that the play-in is a huge opportunity for teams. The Southeast might end the year with the worst divisional record in NBA history, but there's still a slew for the Hawks, Magic and Heat to play for.",
      "\u201cWe have to fight our way out of this funk,\" Orlando coach Jamahl Mosley said. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what it is, it\u2019s a funk and we\u2019ve got to fight our way out of it. ... Because in this league, it can turn fast one way or the other.\u201d",

      "A group of Ukrainian war veteran amputees have been in Oregon learning a form of adaptive skiing for people with one leg",
      "HOODOO SKI AREA, Ore. -- Ukrainian war veteran Oleksandr Shvachka lost his left leg to Russian tank fire outside Kyiv. Three years on, the latest step in his physical and mental rehabilitation recently unfolded under a brilliant blue sky on a snow-covered mountain more than 5,000 miles (8,047 kilometers) away.",
      "Shvachka, 38, was one of five Ukrainian veterans who came to the Pacific Northwest for ski lessons this month with Oregon Adaptive Sports, an organization working to make sports more accessible to people with disabilities.",
      "On a recent day, he listened attentively to an instructor before launching himself down a slope at Hoodoo Ski Area in central Oregon, leaning on two hand-held \u201coutriggers,\u201d which resemble forearm crutches with short skis at the ends, for turns and balance as he picked up speed.",
      "Shvachka was wounded in the village of Makariv outside the capital of Kyiv in March 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine the previous month. He said skiing on the mountain was an \u201camazing emotion.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a new experience, and I\u2019m so happy,\u201d he said.",
      "The Oregon city of Corvallis has been sister cities with Uzhhorod in western Ukraine for over 30 years. Its sister city association is hosting the veterans, some of whom have been recovering in Uzhhorod\u2019s rehabilitation hospital, as well as two Ukrainian ski coaches, association co-founder Carol Paulson said.",
      "The ski program's goal is to improve the veterans\u2019 physical and mental health and teach the Ukrainian ski coaches how to use adaptive ski equipment so they can share that knowledge with the war-torn country\u2019s thousands of amputees. The group had four days of lessons over the course of two weeks.",
      "\u201cIt reminds them that they can participate fully in life,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cThe best thing is the feeling that they get not only of independence, but just of well-being.\u201d",
      "In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Paulson taught adaptive skiing to Vietnam War veterans who had lost limbs. She saw how being active on the mountain improved their mood and wanted to offer the same experience to Ukrainian war veterans.",
      "\u201cThe peacefulness of skiing compared to other sports, too, is special,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet. You have the pristine snow and the breeze of the wind.\u201d",
      "For Shvachka, adaptive sports have been key in his physical and mental rehabilitation, while the other veterans provide motivation, he said.",
      "In 2023, with his prosthetic leg, Schvachka ran a 10K race organized by the U.S. Marine Corps in Washington, D.C., and competed with other Ukrainian veteran amputees in Arnold Classic Europe, an offshoot of a fitness and body-building competition founded by Arnold Schwarzenegger.",

      "NFL MVP Josh Allen was rewarded with a contract extension worth $330 million, with an NFL record $250 million of it guaranteed, which makes him among the league\u2019s highest-paid players",
      "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- NFL MVP Josh Allen was rewarded Sunday with a contract extension worth $330 million, including an NFL record $250 million of it guaranteed, which makes him among the league\u2019s highest-paid players.",
      "The Buffalo Bills announced the agreement, while two people with knowledge of the deal revealed the contract's value to The Associated Press. The people spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because the Bills did not release that figure, which was first reported by ESPN.com.",
      "The new deal adds two years to Allen\u2019s contract and locks the 28-year-old in through the 2030 season.",
      "Cleveland quarterback DeShaun Watson's five-year contract signed in 2022 set the previous record in featuring $230 million in guarantees, per Spotrac.com. The total value of Allen's new contract ranks second behind Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes, who signed a 10-year, $450 million in 2020.",
      "Meanwhile, Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott tops the NFL list in averaging $60 million per season after signing a four-year, $240 million contract extension last summer.",
      "Allen's new contract follows his seventh NFL season in which he became the Bills third player to earn NFL MVP, and first since running back Thurman Thomas did so in 1991. The new deal eclipses Allen\u2019s previous contract, a six-year $258 million deal he signed with Buffalo in August 2021.",
      "Allen has established himself as one of the league\u2019s elite quarterbacks and rewritten nearly every franchise single-season passing and scoring record at his position. In doing so, he\u2019s overcome the many questions and criticisms he faced for being considered a raw and inaccurate player when Buffalo selected him with the No. 7 pick in the 2018 draft out of Wyoming.",
      "Just as important, Allen has solidified what had been an unsettled position in Buffalo since Hall of Famer Jim Kelly retired following the 1996 season. The Bills under Allen have won five consecutive AFC East titles and are on a six-year playoff run.",
      "Allen\u2019s MVP honor came during a season in which he essentially did more with what was considered less receiving talent around him. Adopting an \u201cEverybody Eats\u201d motto, Buffalo ran away with the AFC East by clinching the division with five games still left in a 13-win season and after the team traded top receiving option Stefon Diggs to Houston and lost No. 2 receiver Gabe Davis in free agency.",
      "Though Allen failed to top 4,000 yards for the first time since 2019, the quarterback enjoyed his most efficient season with a career-low six interceptions, a year after throwing a career-worst 18. Allen finished with 28 touchdowns passing, scored another 12 rushing and was credited with a touchdown receiving after completing a pass to Amari Cooper, who then lateralled the ball back to the quarterback.",
      "The only thing missing for Allen is a Super Bowl appearance. The Bills have reached the AFC championship game in 2020 and this past season only to lose both times to Kansas City.",
      "The new deal also follows a significant development in Allen\u2019s personal life. The quarterback proposed to actress and singer Hailee Steinfeld during the team\u2019s bye week in mid-November. Their relationship began in the spring of 2023, when pictures emerged of the two having dinner in New York City.",
      "Allen credited Steinfeld for playing a major supporting role in his career development.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s been a huge part. The morale, the support. When I get home, she\u2019s my biggest fan, my biggest supporter. She\u2019s just the best,\u201d Allen told the AP in December.",
      "The new contract is also expected to provide Buffalo much-needed savings under the salary cap entering the league\u2019s new business year, which opens Wednesday. The team was projected to be close to the cap limit after releasing veteran edge rusher Von Miller earlier in the day.",
      "And the deal follows GM Brandon Beane spending the past weeks locking in the young core of the team by signing fourth-year edge rusher Greg Rousseau and third-year players linebacker Terrel Bernard and receiver Khalil Shakir to four-year contract extensions.",
      "A two-time All-Pro, Allen\u2019s 76 wins, 262 total touchdowns and 30,595 total yards are the most by any NFL player through their first seven seasons in the league.",
      "From a team perspective, Allen holds the top two single-season passing yards records topped by his 4,544 in 2020 and last season he passed Kelly for most total touchdowns with 262. Among the single-season team records he holds are most TD passes (37 in 2020), most completions (646 in 2021), best completion rate (69.2 percent in 2020).",

      "Nissan stock edged up slightly at the opening but soon slipped about 1% in early Wednesday trading in Tokyo, highlighting investors' skepticism over what was announced late the previous day.",
      "Espinosa, who joined Nissan in 2003, has spent much of his Nissan career in Mexico and Southeast Asia, overseeing product planning including the drive toward electric vehicles, meaning he's an insider perhaps less willing to take drastic action.",
      "\u201cI sincerely believe that Nissan has so much more potential than what we're seeing today,\u201d Espinosa told reporters, while stressing that he needs time to come up with details for a turnaround.",
      "He stressed his love for Nissan, noting he has developed a deep understanding of what makes the company unique and valuable.",
      "Nissan said the company leadership needed to be \u201crenewed\u201d to achieve long-term growth. Uchida, who remains as a director, expressed confidence in Espinosa as \u201ca real car guy,\u201d and stressed he was handing over the baton of leadership to better unify company ranks.",
      "\u201cI am confident that Nissan will definitely make a comeback,\u201d he said, appearing at the hastily called news conference with Espinosa.",
      "Speculation about Uchida's future was rife after he called off talks last month with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co., announced late last year, to set up a joint holding company to integrate their businesses. At the time, he told reporters the focus of the talks had changed to making Nissan into a Honda subsidiary, which he denounced as unacceptable.",
      "He also said their strategic partnership to realize synergies on specific projects like electric vehicles and other research will continue.",
      "Nissan is projecting a loss of 80 billion yen ($540 million) for the full fiscal year through the end of this month.",
      "When asked about talks with Honda and other possible partnerships, Espinosa declined comment, saying he needed more time.",
      "During Uchida\u2019s more than five years at Nissan\u2019s helm, sales faltered, including in key markets like the U.S. and China. Uchida also earlier announced the company was slashing 9,000 jobs.",
      "Analysts said Nissan's future remains precarious, with little time left, but noted Nissan may need an outsider rather than an insider like Espinosa.",
      "Todd Duvick and Will Lee, auto analysts at CreditSights, believe the focus is still on a business turnaround, not the proposed integration with Honda.",
      "\u201cNot that a turnaround could not coexist with a Honda merger, but we view it as unlikely that Nissan would be open to becoming a subsidiary of Honda at this time, at least until the board has time to assess the effectiveness of Espinosa\u2019s strategy once it is unveiled and put into action,\u201d they said in a report.",
      "It\u2019s a sad turn for the maker of the Z sportscar, loved by auto buffs around the world, and the Leaf electric car, a pioneer in that sector that launched in 2010. Besides its proud legacy, Nissan also boasts solid engineering. It recently showed off its autonomous vehicle running on regular streets near its Yokohama headquarters.",
      "Uchida joined Nissan in 2003, job-hopping from major Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai, and worked with Nissan\u2019s alliance partner Renault SA of France before overseeing Nissan\u2019s China operations.",
      "Nissan was rescued from near bankruptcy by Renault in 1999. In 2018, Carlos Ghosn, the former superstar executive sent in by Renault, was arrested by Japanese authorities on various financial misconduct charges, including under-reporting his compensation. He later fled to Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.",
      "Nissan's tarnished corporate image after the Ghosn fiasco was a major challenge, Uchida said. So were the COVID-19 pandemic and broader shifts in the auto industry.",
      "Apart from Uchida's departure as chief executive, Nissan announced other sweeping managerial changes, including giving an expanded role to Guillaume Cartier, its chief performance officer, in global marketing and customer experience.",
      "Eiichi Akashi, corporate vice president of the Vehicle Planning and Vehicle Component Engineering Division, was named chief technology officer, succeeding Kunio Nakaguro.",
      "Teiji Hirata, a corporate vice president, will become chief \u201cmonozukuri\u201d officer and executive officer, responsible for manufacturing and supply chain management, replacing Hideyuki Sakamoto.",
      "Jeremy Papin, the chief financial officer, was also appointed to be an executive officer. There was no change for Stephen Ma, who serves as chairperson of Nissan's management committee in China.",

      "In less than a month, TikTok could have one or a few new owners, be banned again, or simply receive another reprieve to continue operating in the United States.",
      "Questions about the fate of the popular video sharing app have continued to linger since a law requiring its China-based parent company to divest or face a ban took effect on Jan. 19. After taking office, President Donald Trump gave TikTok a 75-day reprieve by signing an executive order that delayed enforcement of the statute until April 5.",
      "As he returned to Washington from his Florida home on Sunday, Trump told reporters that a deal could come soon. He did not offer any details on the interested buyers, but said the administration was in talks with \u201cfour different groups\u201d about TikTok.",
      "\u201cA lot of people want it and it\u2019s up to me,\u201d Trump said aboard Air Force One.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "If TikTok is not sold to an approved buyer by April 5, the original law that bans it nationwide would once again go into effect. However, the deadline for the executive order doesn't appear to be set in stone and the president has reiterated it could be extended further if needed.",
      "Trump\u2019s order came a few days after the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a federal law that required TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, to divest or be banned in January. The day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users and came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.",
      "During his first term, Trump tried to ban TikTok on national security grounds, which was halted by the courts before his administration negotiated a sale of the platform that eventually failed to materialize. He changed his position on the popular app during last year's presidential election and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters.",
      "The decision to keep TikTok alive through an executive order has received some scrutiny, but it has not faced a legal challenge in court.",
      "Although it\u2019s unclear if ByteDance plans to sell TikTok, several potential bidders have come forward in the past few months.",
      "Aides for Vice President JD Vance, who was tapped to oversee a potential deal, have reached out to some parties, such as the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI, to get additional details about their bids, according to a person familiar with the matter. In January, Perplexity AI presented ByteDance with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation.",
      "Other potential bidders include a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic advisor. Investors in the consortium say they\u2019ve offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. And if successful, they plan to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they say will provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "Jesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, says he too has organized a consortium, which includes the CEO of the video game platform Roblox, and is offering ByteDance more than $30 billion for TikTok.",
      "Trump said in January that Microsoft was also eyeing the popular app. Other interested parties include Trump\u2019s former Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and Rumble, the video site popular with some conservatives and far-right groups. In a post on X last March, Rumble said it was ready to join a consortium of parties interested in purchasing TikTok and serving as a tech partner for the company.",
      "Trump has said he is looking to have the U.S. government broker a deal for 50% control of TikTok. However, the administration hasn't provided details on what exactly that would entail, or what role the U.S. government could play in the future of the short-form video app.",
      "Some potential bidders have floated proposals that would allow the U.S. to invest or own a stake in the platform. Last month, Trump himself also said the U.S. could own part of TikTok through a new government-owned investment fund.",
      "Chinese officials, who would have to approve the deal, appear to have softened their stance on the issue compared to last year when Beijing called the push for divestment a \u201crobbers\u201d act.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in January that business operations and acquisitions \u201cshould be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it involves Chinese companies, China\u2019s laws and regulations should be observed,\u201d Mao said.",
      "If ByteDance sits down to negotiate, the company would likely need to iron out major details with the U.S. over the proprietary algorithm that populates TikTok feeds as well as the flow of content between the U.S. and the rest of the world.",

      "Explorers have discovered the sunken wreckage of one of the first steel cargo ships to travel the Great Lakes",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Twenty years before the Titanic changed maritime history, another ship touted as the next great technological feat set sail on the Great Lakes.",
      "The Western Reserve was one of the first all-steel cargo ships to traverse the lakes. Built to break speed records, the 300-foot (91.4-meter) freighter dubbed \u201cthe inland greyhound\u201d by newspapers was supposed to be one of the safest ships afloat. Owner Peter Minch was so proud of her that he brought his wife and young children aboard for a summer joyride in August 1892.",
      "Then tragedy struck. As the ship entered Lake Superior's Whitefish Bay between Michigan and Canada on Aug. 30, a gale came up. With no cargo aboard, the ship was light and floating high in the water. The storm battered it until it cracked in half. Twenty-seven people perished that night, including the Minch family. The only survivor was wheelsman Harry W. Stewart, who swam a mile (1.6 kilometers) to shore after his lifeboat capsized.",
      "For almost 132 years the lake hid the wreckage. In July, explorers from the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society pinpointed the Western Reserve off Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The society announced the discovery Saturday at the annual Ghost Ships Festival in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Executive Director Bruce Lynn called the discovery one of the society's most significant finds.",
      "\u201cThere's a number of concurrent stories that make this important,\u201d Lynn said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cMost ships were still wooden. It was a technologically advanced ship. They were kind of a famous family at the time. You have this new ship, considered one of the safest on the lake, new tech, a big, big ship. (The discovery) is another way for us to keep this history alive.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel, the society's marine operations director, and his brother, Dan Ertel, spent more than two years looking for the Western Reserve.",
      "Lynn said this winter the brothers outlined a search grid. On July 22 they set out on the David Boyd, the society's research vessel. Heavy ship traffic that day forced them to alter their course, though, and search an area adjacent to their original grid, Lynn said.",
      "The brothers towed a side-scanning sonar array behind their ship. Side sonar scans to starboard and port, providing a more expansive picture of the bottom than traditional sonar mounted beneath a ship. About 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Whitefish Point on the Upper Peninsula, they picked up a line with a shadow behind it in 600 feet of water. They dialed up the resolution and spotted a ship broken in two with the bow resting on the stern. Each section was 150 feet (45.2 meters) long, suggesting they'd found the Western Reserve.",
      "Eight days later, the brothers returned to the site along with Lynn. They deployed a submersible drone equipped with high-intensity lighting and a high-resolution camera. The drone returned clear images of a portside running light that match the Western Reserve's starboard running light, which had washed ashore in Canada after the ship went down. That light was the only artifact recovered from the ship.",
      "\u201cThat was confirmation day,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cIt's pretty exciting.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel said that discovery gave him chills \u2014 and not in a good way. \u201cKnowing how the 300-foot Western Reserve was caught in a storm this far from shore made a uneasy feeling in the back of my neck,\" he said in a society news release. \"A squall can come up unexpectedly\u2026anywhere, and anytime.\u201d",
      "The Edmund Fitzgerald, a freighter that went down in a November 1975 storm that was immortalized in the Gordon Lightfoot song, \u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\" sank off Whitefish Point within 100 miles of the Western Reserve. There were no survivors."

      "OKUMA, Japan -- The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's radiation levels have significantly dropped since the cataclysmic meltdown 14 years ago Tuesday. Workers walk around in many areas wearing only surgical masks and regular clothes.",
      "It's a different story for those who enter the reactor buildings, including the three damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. They must use maximum protection \u2014 full facemasks with filters, multi-layered gloves and socks, shoe covers, hooded hazmat coveralls and a waterproof jacket, and a helmet.",
      "As workers remove melted fuel debris from the reactors in a monumental nuclear cleanup effort that could take more than a century, they are facing both huge amounts of psychological stress and dangerous levels of radiation.",
      "The Associated Press, which recently visited the plant for a tour and interviews, takes a closer look.",
      "A remote-controlled extendable robot with a tong had several mishaps including equipment failures before returning in November with a tiny piece of melted fuel from inside the damaged No. 2 reactor.",
      "That first successful test run is a crucial step in what will be a daunting, decades-long decommissioning that must deal with at least 880 tons of melted nuclear fuel that has mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three ruined reactors.",
      "Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant, says even the tiny sample gives officials a lot of information about the melted fuel. More samples are needed, however, to make the work smoother when bigger efforts to remove the debris begin in the 2030s.",
      "A second sample-retrieval mission at the No. 2 reactor is expected in coming weeks.",
      "Operators hope to send the extendable robot farther into the reactor to take samples closer to the center, where overheated nuclear fuel fell from the core, utility spokesperson Masakatsu Takata said. He pointed out the target area as he stood inside the inner structure of the No. 5 reactor, which is one of two reactors that survived the tsunami. It has an identical design as No. 2.",
      "Radiation levels are still dangerously high inside the No. 2 reactor building, where the melted fuel debris is behind a thick concrete containment wall. Earlier decontamination work reduced those radiation levels to a fraction of what they used to be.",
      "In late August, small groups took turns doing their work helping the robot in 15- to 30-minute shifts to minimize radiation exposure. They have a remotely controlled robot, but it has to be manually pushed in and out.",
      "\u201cWorking under high levels of radiation (during a short) time limit made us feel nervous and rushed,\" said Yasunobu Yokokawa, a team leader for the mission. \"It was a difficult assignment.\u201d",
      "Full-face masks reduced visibility and made breathing difficult, an extra waterproof jacket made it sweaty and hard to move, and triple-layered gloves made their fingers clumsy, Yokokawa said.",
      "To eliminate unnecessary exposure, they taped around gloves and socks and carried a personal dosimeter to measure radiation. Workers also rehearsed the tasks they'd perform to minimize exposure.",
      "The mission stalled early on when workers noticed that a set of five 1.5-meter (5-foot) pipes meant to push the robot into the reactor's primary containment vessel had been arranged in the wrong order.",
      "A camera on the robot also failed because of high radioactivity and had to be replaced.",
      "The workers' highest individual radiation dose was more than the overall average but still far below anything approaching a 100-millisievert five-year dose limit.",
      "Even so, a growing number of workers are concerned about safety and radiation at the plant, said Ono, the decommissioning chief, citing an annual survey of about 5,5,00 workers.",
      "In 2023, two workers splashed with contaminated sludge at a water treatment facility suffered burns and were hospitalized, though they had no other health problems.",
      "Yokokawa and a plant colleague, Hiroshi Ide, helped in the 2011 emergency and work as team leaders today. They say they want to make the job safer as workers face high radiation in parts of the plant.",
      "On the top floor of the No. 2 reactor, workers are setting up equipment to remove spent fuel units from the cooling pool. That's set to begin within two to three years.",
      "At the No. 1 reactor, workers are putting up a giant roof to contain radioactive dust from decontamination work on the top floor ahead of the removal of spent fuel.",
      "To minimize exposure and increase efficiency, workers use a remote-controlled crane to attach pre-assembled parts, according to TEPCO. The No. 1 reactor and its surroundings are among the most contaminated parts of the plant.",
      "Workers are also removing treated radioactive wastewater. They recently started dismantling the emptied water tanks to make room to build facilities needed for the research and storage of melted fuel debris.",
      "After a series of small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor.",
      "Experts say the hard work and huge challenges of decommissioning the plant are just beginning. There are estimations that the work could take more than a century. The government and TEPCO have an initial completion target of 2051, but the retrieval of melted fuel debris is already three years behind, and many big issues remain undecided.",
      "Ide, whose home in Namie town, northwest of the plant, is in a no-go zone because of nuclear contamination, still has to put on a hazmat suit, even for brief visits home.",
      "\u201cAs a Fukushima citizen, I would like to make sure the decommissioning work is done properly so that people can return home without worries,\u201d he said."

      "LOS ANGELES -- When artificial intelligence-backed tractors became available to vineyards, Tom Gamble wanted to be an early adopter. He knew there would be a learning curve, but Gamble decided the technology was worth figuring out.",
      "The third-generation farmer bought one autonomous tractor. He plans on deploying its self-driving feature this spring and is currently using the tractor's AI sensor to map his Napa Valley vineyard. As it learns each row, the tractor will know where to go once it is used autonomously. The AI within the machine will then process the data it collects and help Gamble make better-informed decisions about his crops \u2014 what he calls \u201cprecision farming.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to completely replace the human element of putting your boot into the vineyard, and that\u2019s one of my favorite things to do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be able to allow you to work more smartly, more intelligently and in the end, make better decisions under less fatigue.\u201d",
      "Gamble said he anticipates using the tech as much as possible because of \u201ceconomic, air quality and regulatory imperatives.\u201d Autonomous tractors, he said, could help lower his fuel use and cut back on pollution.",
      "As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce. New agricultural tech like AI can help farmers to cut back on waste, and to run more efficient and sustainable vineyards by monitoring water use and helping determine when and where to use products like fertilizers or pest control. AI-backed tractors and irrigation systems, farmer say, can minimize water use by analyzing soil or vines, while also helping farmers to manage acres of vineyards by providing more accurate data on the health of a crop or what a season\u2019s yield will be.",
      "Other facets of the wine industry have also started adopting the tech, from using generative AI to create custom wine labels to turning to ChatGPT to develop, label and price an entire bottle.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see anybody losing their job, because I think that a tractor operator\u2019s skills are going to increase and as a result, and maybe they\u2019re overseeing a small fleet of these machines that are out there, and they\u2019ll be compensated as a result of their increased skill level,\u201d he said.",
      "Farmers, Gamble said, are always evolving. There were fears when the tractor replaced horses and mules pulling plows, but that technology \u201cproved itself\u201d just like AI farming tech will, he said, adding that adopting any new tech always takes time.",
      "Companies like John Deere have started using the AI that wine farmers are beginning to adopt. The agricultural giant uses \u201cSmart Apply\u201d technology on tractors, for example, helping growers apply material for crop retention by using sensors and algorithms to sense foliage on grape canopies, said Sean Sundberg, business integration manager at John Deere.",
      "The tractors that use that tech then only spray \u201cwhere there are grapes or leaves or whatnot so that it doesn\u2019t spray material unnecessarily,\u201d he said. Last year, the company announced a project with Sonoma County Winegrowers to use tech to help wine grape growers maximize their yield.",
      "Tyler Klick, partner at Redwood Empire Vineyard Management, said his company has started automating irrigation valves at the vineyards it helps manage. The valves send an alert in the event of a leak and will automatically shut off if they notice an \u201cexcessive\u201d water flow rate.",
      "\u201cThat valve is actually starting to learn typical water use,\u201d Klick said. \u201cIt\u2019ll learn how much water is used before the production starts to fall off.\u201d",
      "Klick said each valve costs roughly $600, plus $150 per acre each year to subscribe to the service.",
      "\u201cOur job, viticulture, is to adjust our operations to the climatic conditions we\u2019re dealt,\u201d Klick said. \u201cI can see AI helping us with finite conditions.\u201d",
      "Angelo A. Camillo, a professor of wine business at Sonoma State University, said that despite excitement over AI in the wine industry, some smaller vineyards are more skeptical about their ability to use the technology. Small, family-owned operations, which Camillo said account for about 80% of the wine business in America, are slowly disappearing \u2014 many don\u2019t have the money to invest in AI, he said. A robotic arm that helps put together pallets of wine, for example, can cost as much as $150,000, he said.",
      "\u201cFor small wineries, there\u2019s a question mark, which is the investment. Then there\u2019s the education. Who\u2019s going to work with all of these AI applications? Where is the training?\u201d he said.",
      "There are also potential challenges with scalability, Camillo added. Drones, for example, could be useful for smaller vineyards that could use AI to target specific crops that have a bug problem, he said \u2014 it would be much harder to operate 100 drones in a 1,000 acre vineyard while also employing the IT workers who understand the tech.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think a person can manage 40 drones as a swarm of drones,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a constraint for the operators to adopt certain things.\u201d",
      "However, AI is particularly good at tracking a crop\u2019s health \u2013 including how the plant itself is doing and whether it\u2019s growing enough leaves \u2013 while also monitoring grapes to aid in yield projections, said Mason Earles, an assistant professor who leads the Plant AI and Biophysics Lab at UC Davis.",
      "Diseases or viruses can sneak up and destroy entire vineyards, Earles said, calling it an \u201celephant in the room\u201d across the wine industry. The process of replanting a vineyard and getting it to produce well takes at least five years, he said. AI can help growers determine which virus is affecting their plants, he said, and whether they should rip out some crops immediately to avoid losing their entire vineyard.",
      "Earles, who is also cofounder of the AI-powered farm management platform Scout, said his company uses AI to process thousands of images in hours and extract data quickly \u2014 something that would be difficult by hand in large vineyards that span hundreds of acres. Scout's AI platform then counts and measures the number of grape clusters as early as when a plant is beginning to flower in order to forecast what a yield will be.",
      "The sooner vintners know how much yield to expect, the better they can \u201cdial in\u201d their wine making process, he added.",
      "\u201cPredicting what yields you\u2019re going to have at the end of the season, no one is that good at it right now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really important because it determines how much labor contract you\u2019re going to need and the supplies you\u2019ll need for making wine.\u201d",
      "Earles doesn\u2019t think the budding use of AI in vineyards is \u201cfreaking farmers out.\u201d Rather, he anticipates that AI will be used more frequently to help with difficult field labor and to discern problems in vineyards that farmers need help with.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve seen people trying to sell them tech for decades. It\u2019s hard to farm; it\u2019s unpredictable compared to most other jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe walking and counting, I think people would have said a long time ago, \u2018I would happily let a machine take over.\u2019\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers urge the Trump administration to scrap plans to kill more than 450,000 invasive barred owls in West Coast forests in coming decades",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Monday urged the Trump administration to scrap plans to kill more than 450,000 invasive barred owls in West Coast forests as part of efforts to stop the birds from crowding out a smaller type of owl that's facing potential extinction.",
      "The 19 lawmakers \u2014 led by Republican Rep. Troy Nehls, a Texas conservative, and Democrat Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, a California liberal \u2014 claimed the killings would be \u201cgrossly expensive\u201d and cost $3,000 per bird.",
      "They questioned if the shootings would help native populations of northern spotted owls, which have long been controversial because of logging restrictions in the birds' forest habitat beginning in the 1990s, and the closely related California spotted owl.",
      "Barred owls are native to eastern North America and started appearing in the Pacific Northwest in the 1970s. They\u2019ve quickly displaced many spotted owls, which are smaller birds that need larger territories to breed.",
      "An estimated 100,000 barred owls now live within a range that contains only about 7,100 spotted owls, according to federal officials.",
      "Under a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plan approved last year, trained shooters would target barred owls over 30 years across a maximum of about 23,000 square miles (60,000 square kilometers) in California, Oregon and Washington.",
      "The plan did not include a cost estimate. But the lawmakers said in a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that it could top $1.3 billion based on extrapolating costs from a grant awarded to the the Hoopa Valley Native American Tribe in California to kill up to 1,500 barred owls.",
      "\u201cThis is an inappropriate and inefficient use of U.S. taxpayer dollars,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \"This latest plan is an example of our federal government attempting to supersede nature and control environmental outcomes at great cost.\u201d",
      "A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesperson did not immediately respond to questions about the cost estimate and the owl removal program. The agency's plan called for more than 2,400 barred owls to be removed this year and for that number to ramp up to more than 15,500 birds annually beginning in 2027.",
      "Scientists for years have been shooting barred owls on an experimental basis and officials say the results show the strategy could halt spotted owl declines. As of last year, about 4,500 barred owls were killed on the West Coast by researchers since 2009.",
      "Killing one bird species to save others has divided wildlife advocates and is reminiscent of past government efforts to save West Coast salmon by killing sea lions and cormorants. Or when, to preserve warblers, cowbirds that lay eggs in warbler nests were killed. The barred owl removals would be among the largest such effort to date involving birds of prey, researchers and wildlife advocates said.",
      "Barred owls arrived in the Pacific Northwest via the Great Plains, where trees planted by settlers gave them a foothold, or via Canada\u2019s boreal forests, which have become warmer and more hospitable as the climate changes, researchers said.",
      "Their spread has undermined decades of spotted owl restoration efforts that previously focused on protecting forests where they live. That included logging restrictions under former President Bill Clinton that ignited bitter political fights and temporarily helped slow the spotted owl\u2019s decline.",

      "Nissan Motor Corp. recently showcased its driverless technology on city streets in Yokohama",
      "YOKOHAMA, Japan -- The van makes its way slowly but surely through the city streets, braking gently when a car swerves into its lane. But its steering wheel is turning on its own, and there's no one in the driver\u2019s seat.",
      "The driverless technology from Nissan Motor Corp., which uses 14 cameras, nine radars and six LiDar sensors installed in and around the vehicle, highlights Japan's eagerness to catch up with players like Google\u2019s Waymo that have taken the lead in the U.S.",
      "Japan, home to the world\u2019s top automakers, has not kept pace with the global shift to autonomous driving, so far led by China and the U.S. But momentum is building.",
      "Waymo is going to land in Japan this year. Details haven't been disclosed, but it has a partnership with major cab company Nihon Kotsu, which will oversee and manage their all-electric Jaguar I-PACE sport-utility vehicles, first in the Tokyo area, still with a human cab driver riding along.",
      "During Nissan's demonstration, the streets were bustling with other cars and pedestrians. The vehicle stayed within the maximum speed limit in the area of 40 kph (25 mph), its destination set with a smartphone app.",
      "Takeshi Kimura, the Mobility and AI Laboratory engineer at Nissan, insists an automaker is more adept at integrating self-driving technology with the overall workings of a car \u2014 simply because it knows cars better.",
      "\u201cHow the sensors must be adapted to the car\u2019s movements, or to monitor sensors and computers to ensure reliability and safety requires an understanding of the auto system overall,\u201d he said during a recent demonstration that took reporters on a brief ride.",
      "Nissan\u2019s technology, being tested on its Serena minivan, is still technically at the industry's Level Two because a person sits before a remote-control panel in a separate location outside the vehicle, in this case, at the automaker's headquarters, and is ready to step in if the technology fails.",
      "Nissan also has a human sitting in the front passenger seat during the test rides, who can take over the driving, if needed. Unless there is a problem, the people in the remote control room and the passenger seat are doing nothing.",
      "Nissan plans to have 20 such vehicles moving in the Yokohama area in the next couple of years, with the plan to reach Level Four, which means no human involvement even as backup, by 2029 or 2030.",
      "Autonomous vehicles can serve a real need given the nation\u2019s shrinking population, including a shortage of drivers.",
      "Other companies are working on the technology in Japan, including startups like Tier IV, which is pushing an open source collaboration on autonomous driving technology.",
      "So far, Japan has approved the use of so-called Level Four autonomous vehicles in a rural area in Fukui Prefecture, but those look more like golf carts. A Level Four bus is scuttling around a limited area near Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport. But its maximum speed is 12 kmph (7.5 mph). Nissan's autonomous vehicle is a real car, capable of all its mechanical workings and speed levels.",
      "Toyota Motor Corp. recently showed its very own \u201ccity\u201d or living area for its workers and partnering startups, near Mount Fuji, being built especially to test various technology, including autonomous driving.",
      "Progress has been cautious.",
      "University of Tokyo Professor Takeo Igarashi, who specializes in computer and information technology, believes challenges remain because it\u2019s human nature to be more alarmed by accidents with driverless vehicles than regular crashes.",
      "\u201cIn human driving, the driver takes responsibility. It\u2019s so clear. But nobody is driving so you don\u2019t know who will take responsibility,\u201d Igarashi told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIn Japan, the expectation for commercial services is very high. The customer expects perfect quality for any service \u2014 restaurants or drivers or anything. This kind of auto-driving is a service form a company, and everybody expects high quality and perfection. Even a small mistake is not acceptable.\u201d",
      "Nissan says its technology is safe. After all, a human can\u2019t be looking at the front, the back and all around at the same time. But the driverless car can, with all its sensors.",
      "When a system failure happened during the recent demonstration, the car just came to a stop and all was well.",
      "Phil Koopman, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, believes the autonomous vehicle industry is just getting started.",
      "The main problem is what\u2019s known as \u201cedge cases,\u201d those rare but dangerous situations that the machine has not yet been taught to respond to. Using autonomous fleets of a significant size for some time is needed for such edge cases to be learned, he said.",
      "\u201cWe will see each city require special engineering efforts and the creation of a special remote support center. This will be a city-by-city deployment for many years,\u201d said Koopman.",

      "WASHINGTON -- America's butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.",
      "The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science.",
      "\u201cButterflies have been declining the last 20 years,\u201d said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. \u201cAnd we don't see any sign that that's going to end.\"",
      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",
      "David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is \u201ccatastrophic and saddening\u201d when compounded over time.",
      "\u201cIn just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!\u201d Wagner said in an email. \"The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.\u201d",
      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies \u2014 which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 \u201cso it could be extinct.\u201d",
      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cYou can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cThat could really improve the situation for a lot of species.\u201d",

Moana (Auli\u2019i Cravalho) again sets sail from her home island, this time in search of a wider community of Pacific Islanders. Dwayne Johnson, as the voice of Maui, is also back. In my review, I wrote that \u201cthe warm Polynesian spirit and open-sea sense of adventure is back in \u2018Moana 2,\u2019 but little of the original\u2019s humor or catchy songs finds its way into this heartfelt but lackluster sequel.\u201d",

The public fascination into this woman dubbed Octomom quickly became vicious and judgmental. Suleman had no job and relied on government assistance, so she was declared irresponsible and unfit to raise 14 kids. She did capitalize on the attention with a book deal, tabloid deals and paid TV appearances but within a few years she'd declared bankruptcy, turned to pornography to earn money and was accused of welfare fraud by the state of California.

      "The number of monarch butterflies wintering in the mountains west of Mexico City, rebounded this year, doubling the area they covered in 2024 despite the stresses of climate change",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The number of monarch butterflies wintering in the mountains west of Mexico City rebounded this year, doubling the area they covered in 2024 despite the stresses of climate change and habitat loss, experts said Thursday.",
      "The annual butterfly count doesn\u2019t calculate the individual number of butterflies, but rather the number of acres they cover as they gather on tree branches in the mountain pine and fir forests. Monarchs from east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada overwinter there.",
      "Mexico\u2019s Commission for National Protected Areas (CONANP) said that this year, butterflies covered 4.4 acres (1.79 hectares) compared to only 2.2 acres (0.9 hectares) the year before. Last year\u2019s figure represented a 59% drop from 2023, the second lowest level since record keeping began.",
      "After wintering in Mexico, the iconic butterflies with black and orange wings fly north, breeding multiple generations along the way for thousands of miles. The offspring that reach southern Canada begin the trip back to Mexico at the end of summer.",
      "Gloria Tavera Alonso, the Mexican agency\u2019s director general of conservation, said the improved numbers owed to better climatic factors and humidity. Drought along the butterflies\u2019 migratory route had been listed as a factor in last year\u2019s decline.",
      "The impact of changes in weather year after year mean fluctuations are expected. For that, Jorge Rickards, Mexico director general for the World Wildlife Fund, said \u201cyou can't let down your guard\u201d and must continue to expand conservation efforts.",
      "Tavera Alonso credited ongoing efforts to increase the number of plants the butterflies rely on for sustenance and reproduction along their flyway.",
      "Butterflies have not been faring well north of the border.",
      "The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting western overwinter populations of monarch butterflies \u2014 a separate population from those that winter in central Mexico \u2014 along the California coast, northern Baja California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28 years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced in February that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second-lowest since the survey began in 1997.",
      "And the first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance in the United States found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday\u2019s journal Science.",
      "Experts say that monarchs face risks across North America in large part due to the reduction in milkweed where the monarchs lay their eggs. The plant has been disappearing due to drought, wildfires, herbicides and urbanization.",
      "In December, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed that monarch butterflies receive protection as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.",

      "China is denying the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s accusations against 12 Chinese nationals charged in connection with global cybercrime campaigns targeting dissidents, news organizations, U.S. agencies and universities",
      "WASHINGTON -- Twelve Chinese nationals \u2014 including mercenary hackers, law enforcement officers and employees of a private hacking company \u2014 have been charged in connection with global cybercrime campaigns targeting dissidents, news organizations, U.S. agencies and universities, the Justice Department says.",
      "A set of criminal cases filed in New York and Washington add new detail to what U.S. officials said Wednesday is a booming hacking-for-hire ecosystem in China, in which private companies and contractors are paid by the Chinese government to target victims of particular interest to Beijing in an arrangement meant to provide Chinese state security forces cover and deniability.",
      "The indictments come as the U.S. government has warned of an increasingly sophisticated cyber threat from China, such as a hack last year of telecom firms called Salt Typhoon that gave Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, including U.S. government officials and prominent public figures.",
      "One indictment charges eight leaders and employees of a private hacking company known as I-Soon with conducting a sweeping array of computer breaches around the world meant to suppress speech, locate dissidents and steal data from victims. Among those charged is Wu Haibo, who founded I-Soon in Shanghai in 2010 and was a member of China's first hacktivist group, Green Army, and who is accused in the indictment of overseeing and directing hacking operations.",
      "Earlier reporting by The Associated Press on leaked documents from I-Soon mainly showed I-Soon was targeting a wide range of governments such as India, Taiwan or Mongolia, but little on the United States.",
      "But the indictment contains new revelations about I-Soon\u2019s activities targeting a wide range of Chinese dissidents, religious organizations and media outlets based in the U.S., including a newspaper identified as publishing news related to China and opposed to the Chinese Communist Party. Other targets included individual critics of China living in the U.S., the Defense Intelligence Agency and a research university.",
      "The targets were in some cases directed by China's Ministry of Public Security \u2014 two law enforcement officers were charged with tasking certain assignments \u2014 but in other instances the hackers acted at their own initiative and tried to sell the stolen information to the government afterward, the indictment says.",
      "The company charged the Chinese government the equivalent of between approximately $10,000 and $75,000 for each email inbox it successfully hacked, officials said.",
      "Phone numbers listed for I-Soon on a Chinese corporate registry rang unanswered, and I-Soon representatives did not immediately respond to an AP email requesting comment Wednesday.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry on Thursday denied the charges, calling the U.S. \u201chypocritical\" and pointing to U.S. cyberattacks on China.",
      "\u201cChina firmly opposes the groundless accusation made by the US and urges the US to immediately stop abusing sanctions,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a press conference in Beijing.",
      "A separate indictment charges two other Chinese hackers, identified as Yin Kecheng and Zhou Shuai, in a for-profit hacking campaign that targeted victims including U.S. technology companies, think tanks, defense contractors and health care systems. Among the targets was the U.S. Treasury Department, which disclosed a breach by Chinese actors late last year in what it called a \u201cmajor cybersecurity incident.\u201d",
      "The Treasury Department announced sanctions Wednesday in connection with the hacking, and the State Department announced multimillion-dollar rewards for information about the defendants.",
      "I-Soon is part of a sprawling industry in China, documented in an AP investigation last year, of private hacking contractors that steal data from other countries to sell to the Chinese authorities.",
      "Over the past two decades, Chinese state security\u2019s demand for overseas intelligence has soared, giving rise to a vast network of these private hackers-for-hire companies that have infiltrated hundreds of systems outside China.",
      "China\u2019s hacking industry rose in the early days of the internet, when Wu and other Chinese hackers declared themselves \u201cred hackers\u201d \u2014 patriots who offered their services to the Chinese Communist Party, in contrast to the anti-establishment ethos popular among many coders.",
      "The indictment \u201cproved the close ties and interaction among China\u2019s first generation patriotic hackers,\u201d said Mei Danowski, a cybersecurity analyst who wrote about I-Soon on her blog, Natto Thoughts. They \u201call turned to entrepreneurs now \u2014 doing businesses with the governments and making profits through other means.\u201d",
      "Since I-Soon documents were leaked online last year, the company has been suffering but is still in operation, according to Chinese corporate records. They've downsized and moved offices.",

      "\"A budget is a reflection of our values,\" Warren said on the floor. \"This proposal makes crystal clear where Republicans' values lie. After months of bipartisan talks, they're walking away from the negotiating table and offering a non-starter House bill that forces us to the brink of a full government shutdown. The Republican shutdown playbook is dangerous, and it will hurt working families.\"",
      "Though she did not expressly state how she plans to vote on the package, she said House Democrats were right to oppose the measure, and said the Senate should follow suit.",
      "\"Democrats in the House have showed us they are united,\" Warren said, when asked if Senate Democrats should be united in their opposition to the House package. \"Why should it be different in the Senate?\"",

      "\"A shutdown is uncharted territory when you've got an administration that at least in some ways probably would welcome a shutdown because that would give the president almost unlimited power: deciding who is essential who is not unessential, folding up agencies,\" King said. \"So that is the dilemma that is being discussed.\"",
      "The House has left town for the week after passing their bill. If Democrats in the Senate want to avoid a shut down on Friday night, they'll have to furnish at least eight votes to do it, with Republican Sen. Rand Paul already stating he'll oppose the package.",

      "The 99-page bill decreases spending overall from last year's funding levels, but increases spending for the military by about $6 billion.",
      "While there is an additional $6 billion for veterans' health care, non-defense spending is about $13 billion lower than fiscal year 2024 levels.",
      "The legislation leaves out emergency funding for disasters, but provides a boost in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation operations.",
      "It also increases funding for W.I.C. by about $500 million, a program that provides free groceries to low-income women and children.",
      "Now that the House has dispatched its bill to the Senate, it's not yet clear how it will fare as it will require significant bipartisan support to pass the upper chamber.",
      "Vote was major test of Johnson's leadership",
      "The spending bill was a major test for Johnson. In the absence of Democratic support, Johnson could only afford to lose one Republican vote before a second defection killed the bill.",
      "In a statement following the vote, Johnson said Republicans \"stood for the American people\" and blasted Democrats who he said \"decided to double down on partisan politics.\"",

      "Kennedy said removing dyes is a top priority of the Trump administration.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told food industry leaders in a closed-door meeting on Monday that he wants them to remove artificial color additives from their products by the end of his time in office, according to a memo describing the meeting, which was obtained by ABC News.",
      "At the Washington gathering, which included the CEOs of Kellogg's, Smucker's and General Mills, Kennedy said it is a top priority of the Trump administration to rid America's food of the artificial dyes, wrote Melissa Hockstad, president and CEO of the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group, who penned the memo.",
      "Hockstad addressed the memo to \"Consumer Brands Member CEOs.\"",
      "\"The Secretary made clear his intention to take action unless the industry is willing to be proactive with solutions,\" Hockstad wrote.",
      "Kennedy has long championed removing artificial coloring from America's food, and the effort has become a pillar of the \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement.",
      "In January, the Food and Drug Administration revoked its authorization of one type of red food dye -- Red No. 3. The dye is known to cause cancer in laboratory animals but was allowed to be used by manufacturers for years because scientists didn't believe it raised cancer risk in humans at the level typically consumed.",
      "The FDA, under then-President Joe Biden, acted after longtime pressure by consumer advocates.",
      "But a different type, Red No. 40, remains on the market and hasn't been studied by the FDA in more than 20 years. FDA and health officials said there is no evidence though that it is harmful, and food manufacturers said they need to be able to rely on ingredients generally recognized as safe.",
      "In the memo, Hockstad said her association will work with HHS leaders about removing \"roadblocks\" so food companies can help meet Kennedy's goal.",
      "\"We will be working with your teams to gain as much alignment as possible about how we move forward and ensure the industry is positioned in the best possible way as we navigate next steps forward,\" she wrote. \"But to underscore, decision time is imminent.\"",
      "A spokeswoman for the Consumer Brands Association confirmed the authenticity of the letter, which was first reported by Bloomberg, but did not provide further comment.",
      "The spokeswoman provided ABC News with a copy of a thank-you letter Hockstad sent Kennedy after the meeting.",
      "\"The industry is committed to delivering safe, affordable and convenient product choices to consumers,\" she wrote. \"We will engage with you and the administration on solutions to improve transparency, ensure ingredient evaluations are grounded in a science and risk-based process and increase healthier options for consumers.\"",
      "Vani Hari, an activist and founder of Food Babe and Truvani who delivered 400,000 petition signatures to the Michigan headquarters for Kellogg's last year asking the company to remove artificial food dyes, applauded Kennedy.",
      "\"I have been working on this issue for over a decade and I am thrilled Secretary Kennedy laid out an ultimatum,\" Hari told ABC News in a statement.",
      "\"These food companies have already reformulated their products without dyes in so many countries, now it's time for them to do the same in America. Americans deserve the same safer foods other countries get,\" she continued.",

      "The order mandates that lawyers working for the firm have clearances stripped.",
      "The law firm Perkins Coie has filed suit against the Trump administration over an executive order signed by President Donald Trump last week that targeted the firm for its work representing Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign.",
      "Attorneys representing Perkins Coie filed the lawsuit on Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, along with a request for a temporary restraining order to bar enforcement of the executive order.",
      "\"The Order is an affront to the Constitution and our adversarial system of justice,\" the lawsuit said. \"Its plain purpose is to bully those who advocate points of view that the President perceives as adverse to the views of his Administration, whether those views are presented on behalf of paying or pro bono clients.\"",
      "It's the first legal challenge in what Trump has previewed will be a wave of executive actions seeking to punish law firms that have represented his perceived political enemies.",
      "The order, signed by Trump on March 6, mandates that lawyers working for Perkins Coie have their security clearances stripped and aims to terminate any government contracts that might exist with the firm or other entities that it represents. It further bars agencies from hiring employees of Perkins Coie and prohibits employees from the firm from accessing government buildings.",
      "\"Perkins Coie brings this case reluctantly,\" the lawsuit said. \"The firm is comprised of lawyers who advocate for clients; its attorneys and employees are not activists or partisans. But Perkins Coie\u2019s ability to represent the interests of its clients -- and its ability to operate as a legal-services business at all -- are under direct and imminent threat. Perkins Coie cannot allow its clients to be bullied.\"",
      "In his signing of the order, Trump pointed to Perkins Coie's work in the 2016 campaign and ties to the \"Steele Dossier,\" which detailed a series of highly salacious allegations about Trump that were later investigated by the FBI and determined to be unsubstantiated.",
      "Marc Elias, who left Perkins Coie to start his own firm in 2021, brokered an agreement with the research and intelligence firm Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research on Trump leading up to the 2016 election. Fusion then hired a former British spy, Christopher Steele, who compiled the dossier.",
      "As Perkins Coie's lawsuit noted, however, the two attorneys singled out in the executive order's actual text \"have not been with the firm for years.\"",
      "\"The retaliatory aim of the Order is intentionally obvious to the general public and the press because the very goal is to chill future lawyers from representing particular clients,\" the lawsuit said.",

      "Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II is running to become the state's next Democratic governor",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- Garlin Gilchrist II, a Democrat from Detroit who is Michigan's first Black lieutenant governor, announced he's jumping into the crowded 2026 race for governor on Tuesday.",
      "A software engineer by trade, Gilchrist vaulted from relative political obscurity in 2018 to run alongside Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and his profile has been bolstered over the past six years by working closely with one of the nation\u2019s most high-profile Democrats.",
      "\"When you have a problem, an engineer can fix that problem,\u201d Gilchrist said in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of his announcement, saying he's built up relationships in each of the state's 83 counties. \u201cThat\u2019s a story that I\u2019m going to tell.\u201d",
      "As governor, he said he\u2019ll focus on expanding affordable housing and improving access to health care, particularly mental health services.",
      "He recognized that voters sent President Donald Trump back to the White House in part because of frustration with a \u201cstatus quo that wasn\u2019t serving them.\u201d Trump notched a 1.5-point victory in Michigan last fall.",
      "\u201cThat anger comes from not having results, from things not working,\u201d said Gilchrist. He described moving to Washington state to work for Microsoft after graduating from the University of Michigan, but says that as governor, he'll make sure residents can \"be their best self here.\u201d",
      "\u201cI want us to make good choices today so that the people of Michigan know that they can take their next step here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can build their careers and their families and their futures here.\u201d",
      "Still, Gilchrist will have to balance that narrative with his role near the top of the Democratic Party, which held full control of state government from 2022 to 2024. Gilchrist in his AP interview did not break from Whitmer, calling her an ally and said they have \u201claid a really good foundation for the future of the state of Michigan.\u201d",
      "Gilchrist is seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party. His hometown Detroit is the state\u2019s largest Democratic stronghold and nearly 80% Black, bolstering his appeal. If elected, Gilchrist would be the first Black governor of the state. However, before joining Whitmer on the Democratic ticket, he ran for Detroit City Clerk in 2017 and narrowly lost to incumbent Janice Winfrey.",
      "Lieutenant governors also don't have a good track record in Michigan when trying to ascend to the governor's office, with the most recent example being Republican Brian Calley, who was trounced in the party's primary in 2018.",
      "Gilchrist joins Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson in the 2026 Democratic primary. Whitmer has said she won't endorse any candidate.",
      "The primary winner could face an uphill battle in the general election. Along with a Republican opponent \u2014 Republican Senate Leader Aric Nesbitt is seen as the leading candidate currently \u2014 they may also contend with Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a former Democrat now running for governor as an independent.",

      "U.S. and Ukrainian representatives will meet for peace talks this week.",
      "LONDON -- The U.S. is \"just about\" ready to lift its freeze on intelligence sharing with Ukraine, President Donald Trump said Sunday, as American and Ukrainian negotiators prepare for bilateral talks in Saudi Arabia intended to move toward a peace deal to end Russia's three-year-old invasion.",
      "\"Well, we just about have,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One when asked if he would consider resuming intelligence sharing. \"We want to do anything we can to get Ukraine serious about getting something done,\" he added.",
      "A U.S. official told ABC News on Monday evening that the U.S. is still not providing intelligence to Ukraine for offensive purposes, but continues to provide intelligence for defensive purposes.",
      "Trump's administration has embarked on a dramatic pivot away from the \"ironclad\" backing of Ukraine practiced by former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Trump has falsely blamed Ukraine for starting the war, tried to undermine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's legitimacy, sought to strong-arm Kyiv into a controversial minerals sharing deal and froze military aid and intelligence support in a bid to force Ukraine into making concessions to Russia.",
      "Tuesday's talks in Jeddah are intended to revitalize bilateral relations following weeks of tense exchanges between Washington, D.C., and Kyiv, which culminated in an explosive Oval Office confrontation between Trump, Zelenskyy and Vice President JD Vance.",
      "The U.S. delegation in Saudi Arabia will include Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz. The Ukrainian team will be led by Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelenskyy's presidential office. The U.S. side is expecting Ukraine to show willingness to make peace, Trump suggested on Sunday.",
      "\"We'll be looking at a lot of things,\" he said. \"We have big meetings coming up. As you know, it's Saudi Arabia that's going to include Russia. It'll be Ukraine. We'll see if we can get something done.\"",
      "\"I think everybody wants to see it get done,\" the president added. \"We're going to make a lot of progress.\"",
      "\"I think they will sign the minerals deal,\" Trump said when asked about progress on the controversial agreement. \"I want them to want peace.\" Trump claimed that Ukraine has not yet shown that willingness.",
      "Trump avoided answering whether he would place sanctions or tariffs on Russia and pointed to White House officials' upcoming meetings in Saudi Arabia. The president also avoided giving a definitive answer when asked if the U.S. would resume aid to Ukraine if the minerals deal is signed.",
      "Zelenskyy will travel to Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet with the kingdom's crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "\"Tomorrow, we will continue working to bring peace closer -- there will be my visit to Saudi Arabia,\" the Ukrainian president wrote on social media Sunday. \"Also, today, the meeting of our teams -- Ukraine and the United States -- in Saudi Arabia has been further prepared. We hope for results -- both in bringing peace closer and in continuing support.\"",
      "On Monday morning, Zelenskyy said in a post to Telegram, \"Ukraine has been seeking peace since the very first second of the war and we have always said that the only reason the war continues is Russia.\"",
      "A source close to Zelenskyy confirmed to ABC News that Ukraine will propose a partial ceasefire in its talks with the U.S. The partial ceasefire would apply to long-range air strikes and attacks at sea, the source said.",
      "The timeframe for the truce remains unclear.",
      "\"We want to propose a partial ceasefire that can be monitored and then see how the Russians respond to determine the next steps,\" the source added.",
      "Rubio told reporters on Monday he saw some promise in Ukraine's partial ceasefire proposal.",
      "\"I'm not saying that alone is enough, but it's the kind of concession you would need to see in order to end this conflict,\" he said ahead of meetings with Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Rubio said finalizing the mineral deal with Ukraine was \"an important topic, but it's not the main topic on the agenda.\"",
      "\u201cIt's certainly a deal the president wants to see done but it doesn't necessarily have to happen tomorrow,\" he said. \"There's still more details to work out.\u201d",
      "The public U.S.-Ukraine break has prompted concern among European leaders, with leaders both rallying around Zelenskyy and urging him to repair his fraying relations with Trump. Officials in Russia appeared jubilant, openly suggesting that the Trump administration had aligned its views with the Kremlin's.",
      "Trump and his top officials have said that both Ukraine and Russia will be expected to make concessions in pursuit of a peace deal to end Moscow's invasion, which itself is only the latest chapter in more than a decade of cross-border aggression.",
      "Trump last week suggested in a post to Truth Social that he was \"strongly considering large-scale sanctions\" and tariffs on Russia until a deal is reached, adding that Moscow \"is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now.\" Trump also told a joint session of Congress he had received \"strong signals\" that Russia is ready to make peace.",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said last week that the U.S.-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia are a \"positive\" development, though stressed there are unresolved \"nuances.\"",
      "\"The question is who to negotiate with?\" Peskov told reporters. Russia has repeatedly framed Zelenskyy as an illegitimate president, citing the delay to planned 2024 presidential elections in Ukraine necessitated by the imposition of martial law.",
      "The Kremlin has also cited a September 2022 Ukrainian decree in which Zelenskyy declared negotiations with Putin \"impossible,\" after Moscow claimed to have annexed four partially-occupied Ukrainian regions.",
      "On Monday, Peskov told journalists that Russia's read on this week's meeting \"is not important.\"",
      "\"What is important here is what the United States expects at various levels,\" he continued. \"We have repeatedly heard statements that the U.S. expects the Ukrainians to demonstrate their desire for peace. That's probably what everybody is waiting for. Whether the members of the Zelenskyy regime really want peace or not. Of course, this is very important and it is necessary to decide.\"",
      "Peskov also dismissed reports that U.S. and Russian officials would meet again in Saudi Arabia this week. \"It is not true,\" he told reporters.",
      "Meanwhile, both Russia and Ukraine are continuing their long-range missile and drone strike campaigns. Deadly weekend strikes by Russia prompted condemnation from several European nations.",

      "Andriy Kovalenko, the head of the Counter-Disinformation Center operating as part of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, said drones attacked the Novokuybyshevsk oil refinery in Samara Oblast. Kovalenko said the refinery has an annual capacity of 8.8 million tons of oil, putting it among the country's ten largest refineries.",
      "Kovalenko said the plant produces a wide range of petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel and fuel oil, which are used by transport and military equipment. \"For the Russian army, this refinery has strategic significance, as it ensures stable fuel supplies for military operations,\" he said.",

      "But the DOJ said Tuesday that they would not make Ezell available for testimony.",
      "By making Ezell unavailable, DOJ attorneys also withdrew his sworn affidavit, a move that Judge Charles Alsup suggested would heavily increase the odds that the Trump administration loses the case, which involves the legality of firing thousands of probationary employees.",
      "\"Live testimony of Mr. Ezell is also not necessary, as a factual matter, because existing documentary evidence and briefing demonstrates that OPM is not directing agencies to terminate probationary employees,\" DOJ lawyers argued.",
      "A group of federal unions has alleged that Ezell lied in a sworn declaration that his office did not order the firing of probationary employees based on \"performance or misconduct,\" prompting Judge Alsup to order Ezell to testify in person and under oath in San Francisco on Thursday.",
      "The Trump administration attempted to push back on the order -- arguing in a filing Monday that the testimony raises \"fundamental constitutional concerns.\"",
      "Judge Alsup late Monday denied their request to cancel the hearing.",
      "\"The problem here is that Acting Director Ezell submitted a sworn declaration in support of the defendant's position but now refuses to appear to be cross examined or to be deposed,\" Judge Alsup wrote in an order Monday night.",
      "The plaintiffs allege that on Feb. 13, Ezell convened a phone call with the heads of federal agencies to direct them to terminate thousands of federal employees and \"falsely state that the terminations are for performance reasons.\"",
      "In a sworn declaration last month, Ezell denied directing the terminations based on performance reasons, instead arguing that OPM only issued guidance to individual agencies about the need for probationary workers to \"demonstrate why it is in the public interest\" for the government to continue to employ them.",
      "\"OPM did not direct agencies to terminate any particular probationary employees based on performance or misconduct, and did not create a 'mass termination program,' as the plaintiffs in this matter described it,\" Ezell wrote.",
      "The groups challenging the firings in court say that was a lie, and Judge Alsup appeared inclined to agree during a court hearing last month.",
      "\"How could so much of the work force be amputated suddenly overnight? It's so irregular and so widespread and so aberrant from the history of our country,\" Judge Alsup said. \"How could that all happen with each agency deciding on its own to do something so aberrational?\"",

      "The prosecutor told jurors they will hear the author and contributor to Voice of America explain why the government of Iran wanted to silence her.",
      "Alinejad fled Iran following the country\u2019s disputed 2009 presidential election and became a U.S. citizen in October 2019. She will describe why she stands up to the Iranian regime, Gutwillig said, and why she \u201crefuses to back down.\u201d",
      "\u201cMasih Alinejad inspires others in Iran and around the world to do the same thing. That is why they want to kill her. And you will hear all of that from Ms. Alinejad herself,\u201d he said.",

      "The prosecutor told jurors that key testimony will come from the man hired to kill Alinejad: Khalid Mahdiyev of Yonkers.",
      "Detective Daniel Smith, the trial's first witness, said Mahdiyev was arrested in July 2022 when he ran a stop sign in Alinejad's neighborhood and was found to be driving despite a suspended driver's license. A search of his car turned up a loaded AK-47 assault rifle, Smith said.",
      "Defense attorneys for Amirov and Omarov told jurors in opening statements that their clients were not guilty and that prosecutors' evidence was merely circumstantial.",
      "Attorney Michael Martin, representing Amirov, said his client had insisted for the 25 months since his January 2023 arrest that he was not guilty.",
      "He promised to discredit the testimony of Mahdiyev, calling him a \u201cmurderer, a kidnapper, an arsonist, a robber, an extortionist, a scammer, a fraudster and a liar.\u201d",

      "\u201cShe shared them with millions. She shined a light on the government of Iran's oppression of women, and that enraged the regime\u201d Gutwillig said."

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. officials have not determined who was behind an apparent cyber attack on the social media site X that limited access to the platform for thousands of users, according to a Trump administration official familiar with the ongoing investigation into the matter.",
      "Monday's outage was described as a cyber attack by the official, who was not authorized to comment publicly on the matter and spoke Tuesday on the condition of anonymity. The official added that the Republican administration takes all cyber attacks against American companies seriously but underscored that the U.S. government had not gleaned any specific intelligence about who might have been behind the attack.",
      "The comments came after Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X and a top adviser to President Donald Trump, claimed in an appearance on Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cKudlow\u201d show that the cyber attackers had \u201cIP addresses originating in the Ukraine area\u201d without going into detail on what that might mean.",
      "Cybersecurity experts quickly pointed out, however, that this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the attack originated in Ukraine.",
      "Musk bought what was then Twitter in 2022 and serves as the CEO of Tesla, all while effectively running Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "His electric vehicle company has faced some headwinds as he's become the face of Trump's effort to dramatically shrink the size of the government through DOGE. Its stock plunged 15% on Monday, its biggest one-day loss since September 2020.",
      "Analysts have said Musk\u2019s shift to right-wing politics doesn\u2019t appear to sit well with potential Tesla buyers, generally perceived to be wealthy, environmentally conscious liberals who have turned to electric vehicles in an attempt to reduce fossil fuel emissions.",
      "Tesla has also been a target of protests and vandalism in the U.S. and elsewhere over Musk's push for large-scale federal government layoffs, contract cancellations and other budget slashing moves.",
      "Trump said on his social media platform that he\u2019ll buy a Tesla on Tuesday to demonstrate \"confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhy should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???\u201d Trump said."

      "The passenger was traveling with his sister, who said her brother told her before the violent outburst to \u201cclose her eyes and pray because Satan's disciple(s) had followed them onto the plane,\u201d according to an FBI agent's affidavit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court.",
      "No one was seriously hurt on the Monday night flight operated by Envoy Air, a regional carrier for American Airlines. The 31-year-old passenger was jailed on charges including misdemeanor battery, misdemeanor obstruction of police and a felony count of criminal property damage.",
      "FBI Agent Savannah Solomon described the violent episode in her affidavit, saying there was probable cause to charge the man with a federal crime of interfering with a flight crew.",
      "Solomon wrote that eight passengers were on the plane and flight attendants became concerned immediately after takeoff when they noticed one of them appearing to have a \u201cfit of epilepsy\u201d that included \u201cstomping, incoherent yelling, and shaking.\u201d",
      "When a flight attendant approached the man, he turned in his seat and kicked the attendant in the chest, sending the worker flying into a window across the aisle, the agent wrote.

    "story": [
      "A federal judge says President Donald Trump overstepped his authority in freezing almost all spending on U.S. humanitarian and development work abroad",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump overstepped his constitutional authority in freezing almost all spending on U.S. humanitarian and development work abroad, a federal judge ruled, saying the administration could no longer simply sit on the tens of billions of dollars that Congress has appropriated for foreign aid.",
      "But Judge Amir H. Ali stopped short of ordering Trump officials to use the money to revive the thousands of contracts they have abruptly terminated for U.S. aid and development work around the world.",
      "Ali's ruling Monday evening came hours after Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the administration had finished what has been a six-week purge of programs of the six-decade-old U.S. Agency for International Development, cutting 83% of them. Rubio said he would move the remaining aid programs under the State Department.",
      "Rubio made his announcement in a post on X, in one of his few public comments on what has been a historic shift away from U.S. foreign aid and development, executed by Trump political appointees at the State Department and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency teams.",
      "Rubio in the post thanked DOGE and \u201cour hardworking staff who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform\u201d in foreign aid.",
      "Trump on Jan. 20 issued an executive order directing a freeze of foreign assistance funding and a review of all U.S. aid and development work abroad. Trump charged that much of foreign assistance was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda.",
      "Rubio's social media post Monday said that review was now \u201cofficially ending,\" with some 5,200 of USAID's 6,200 programs eliminated. Those programs \u201cspent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States,\u201d Rubio wrote. About 1,000 remaining contracts would now be administered by the State Department, he said.",
      "Democratic lawmakers and others call the shutdown of congressionally funded programs illegal, saying such a move requires Congress' approval.",
      "In his preliminary injunction Monday, Ali said Trump could not simply ignore most of what is roughly $60 billion in foreign assistance funding that was given to USAID and State by Congress, which under the U.S. Constitution has the authority to spend money.",
      "\u201cThe constitutional power over whether to spend foreign aid is not the President\u2019s own \u2014 and it is Congress\u2019s own,\u201d Ali wrote, adding elsewhere that Trump officials \u201coffer an unbridled view of Executive power that the Supreme Court has consistently rejected.\u201d",
      "But Ali declined the request from nonprofit groups and businesses to revive the canceled contracts for foreign assistance work around the world, saying it was up to the administration to make decisions on specific contracts. The mass contract cancellations also were a separate matter than the funding freeze that two global health groups, the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, had originally gone to court to challenge, he said.",
      "Ali also ordered Trump officials to pay all of the roughly $2 billion it owed to aid groups and businesses up to mid-February, and ordered them to do it at a pace of at least 300 back payments a day.",
      "Despite claims from the administration it was continuing to fund at least life-saving programs in its foreign aid freeze, USAID staffers and the agency's nonprofit and business partners say all payments through USAID were cut off until recently, and that USAID's payment system itself disabled by Musk's DOGE.",
      "Ali's ruling came after the Supreme Court had rejected the Trump administration's appeal in the case.",
      "USAID supporters said the sweep of the cuts have made it difficult to tell what U.S. efforts abroad the Trump administration actually supports.",
      "\u201cThe patterns that are emerging is the administration does not support democracy programs, they don\u2019t support civil society ... they don\u2019t support NGO programs,\u201d or health or emergency response, said Andrew Natsios, the USAID administrator for Republican former President George W. Bush.",
      "\u201cSo what\u2019s left\u201d?\u201d Natsios asked.",
      "Republicans broadly have made clear they want foreign assistance that would promote a far narrower interpretation of U.S. national interests going forward.",
      "The dismantling of USAID that followed Trump\u2019s order upended decades of policy that humanitarian and development aid abroad advanced U.S. national security by stabilizing regions and economies, strengthening alliances and building goodwill.",
      "The State Department said in a court filing earlier this month it was killing more than 90% of USAID programs. Rubio gave no explanation for why his number was lower.",
      "In the weeks after Trump's order, one of his appointees and transition team members, Pete Marocco, and Musk pulled USAID staff around the world off the job through forced leaves and firings, shut down USAID payments overnight and terminated aid and development contracts by the thousands.",
      "The shutdown has left many USAID staffers and contractors and their families still overseas, many of them awaiting back payments and travel expenses to return home.",
      "The Trump administration on Monday gave USAID staffers abroad until April 6 to move back to the United States if they want to do so on the government\u2019s tab, according to a USAID email sent to staffers and seen by The Associated Press. Staffers say the deadline gives them scant time to pull children from school, sell homes or break leases, and, for many, find somewhere to live after years away from the United States.",

      "Measles outbreaks in West Texas and New Mexico now have more than 250 cases total",
      "Measles outbreaks in West Texas and New Mexico are now up to more than 250 cases, and two unvaccinated people have died from measles-related causes.",
      "Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that's airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.",
      "Here's what you need to know about measles in the U.S.",
      "Texas state health officials said Tuesday there were 25 new cases of measles since the end of last week, bringing Texas' total to 223. Twenty-nine people in Texas are hospitalized.",
      "New Mexico health officials announced Friday that there were 30 cases in Lea County, which neighbors the West Texas communities at the epicenter of the outbreak.",
      "A school-age child died of measles in Texas last month, and New Mexico reported its first measles-related death in an adult last week.",
      "Measles cases have been reported in Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines an outbreak as three or more related cases \u2014 and there have been three clusters that qualified as outbreaks in 2025.",
      "In the U.S., cases and outbreaks are generally traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. It can then spread, especially in communities with low vaccination rates.",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "People at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak, said Scott Weaver with the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.",
      "Adults with \u201cpresumptive evidence of immunity\u201d generally don\u2019t need measles shots now, the CDC said. Criteria include written documentation of adequate vaccination earlier in life, lab confirmation of past infection or being born before 1957, when most people were likely to be infected naturally.",
      "A doctor can order a lab test called an MMR titer to check your levels of measles antibodies, but health experts don't always recommend this route and insurance coverage can vary.",
      "Getting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says.",
      "People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said. That also includes people who don\u2019t know which type they got.",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",
      "In communities with high vaccination rates \u2014 above 95% \u2014 diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called \u201cherd immunity.\u201d",
      "But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.",
      "The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. Five years earlier, measles cases were the worst in almost three decades in 2019.",

      "The Supreme Court has weighed in twice on President Donald Trump\u2019s rapid-fire efforts to remake the federal government",
      "WASHINGTON -- In fewer than 500 carefully chosen and somewhat opaque words, the Supreme Court has now weighed in twice on President Donald Trump's rapid-fire efforts to remake the federal government.",
      "The justices did not give Trump's administration what it sought. The court rejected the Republican administration's position that it had the immediate power to fire the head of a watchdog office. In the other, the court slowed the effort to block the release of up to $2 billion in foreign aid.",
      "In the end, the short-term losses for the administration may mean little, and the court's actions arguably reflect less about whether Trump was right or wrong in either case.",
      "Instead, they may stand for an important, but less showy, commitment to regular order from the top of a judicial system that has emerged as a key check on Trump\u2019s power with the Republican-controlled Congress largely supportive or silent.",
      "Jack Goldsmith, a Justice Department official during President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, said there may be benefits for the court in taking small steps and delaying, which \u201cbrought the court advantage by achieving emergency outcomes it wanted without having to tip its hand prematurely on the merits of the cases.\u201d",
      "Trump's unparalleled flex of presidential power seems destined for several dates at a Supreme Court that he helped shape with three appointees during his first term.",
      "But even a conservative majority that has a robust view of presidential power and granted him broad immunity from criminal prosecution might balk at some of what the president wants to do.",
      "His push to end birthright citizenship for the children of parents who are in the U.S. illegally, for instance, would discard more than 100 years of practice and a relatively settled understanding of the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship to \u201call persons born or naturalized in the United States.\u201d",
      "Challenges to the citizenship order are among more than 100 lawsuits that have been filed, and lower-court judges have hit pause on the administration's plans more than 30 times.",
      "The Supreme Court's early forays have largely not been about the substance of what the president wants to do but about the procedures used by federal judges who have the first crack at evaluating the lawfulness of the administration's actions.",
      "Trump allies, most notably his billionaire adviser Elon Musk, have railed at judges slowing his agenda, threatening impeachment and launching personal attacks. The Federal Judges Association, the largest such organization, issued a rare public statement decrying \u201cirresponsible rhetoric shrouded in disinformation\u201d that could undermine public confidence in the judiciary.",
      "Though Trump has said he would obey the courts, Vice President JD Vance, Musk and others have suggested the administration could defy a court order, which would spark a constitutional crisis. Trump has vowed to appeal decisions he doesn't like, something his administration has done quickly in several cases even as some plaintiffs question whether the government is fully following judges' orders.",
      "\u201cIt seemed to me that they're playing pretty fast and loose,\u201d said Jeffrey Schmitt, a professor at the University of Dayton School of Law. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be seen as blatantly disrespecting the courts and refusing to follow their orders. They also don\u2019t want to change their behavior.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court, meanwhile, is getting drawn into the fray in fits and starts. That could change soon, as more lawsuits reach a stage at which they can be appealed to the high court.",
      "\u201cIt strikes me that the court is trying to signal that the normal processes should take place,\u201d said Kent Greenfield, a Boston College law professor who is the main author of a letter signed by roughly 1,000 scholars contending that the nation already is in a constitutional crisis as a result of Trump's actions.",
      "A progressive group, Court Accountability, said the court's more recent order, in the foreign aid freeze case, may have been reported as a setback for the administration.",
      "\u201cBut a closer look at the majority\u2019s short order reveals that the Chief Justice actually gave Trump everything he wanted,\u201d the group wrote on its blog, explaining that additional delays only make it harder for people and groups hurt by the freeze to recover.",
      "Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law, wrote on The Volokh Conspiracy blog that the high court has ducked urgent constitutional issues it should have decided about the extent of the president's power. Instead, he wrote, district judges \u201care now confident they can issue any order they wish against the executive branch, and the Supreme Court will not stop them. This is the judiciary run amok.\u201d",
      "But while they sparked online outrage in some quarters of the president's base, the events of the past few days could be seen as validation for the justices' cautious approach.",
      "On Feb. 21, a Supreme Court order temporarily kept Hampton Dellinger, the head of the Office of Special Counsel, in his job despite efforts by Trump to fire him.",
      "In fact, the justices didn\u2019t rule either way on the administration\u2019s request to throw out an order in Dellinger's favor. The high court held the matter \u201cin abeyance,\u201d pending further proceedings in the lower court.",
      "On Thursday, Dellinger ended his legal fight after a federal appeals court ruled against him \u2014 but not before he stalled the firing of 5,000 federal workers slated for layoffs.",
      "The Supreme Court finally acted on the administration\u2019s request, hours after Dellinger dropped out, dismissing it as moot.",
      "The scale of the federal layoffs that the new administration wants to carry out could also put federal employment law in front of the high court. While experts say the justices appear inclined to allow the president more power to hire and fire agency heads, the outlook is less clear for civil service protections for other federal workers.",
      "In the foreign aid freeze case, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali narrowed his payment order to require the administration to immediately pay only those organizations that had originally filed the lawsuit.",
      "But with nearly a dozen lawsuits filed over moves to freeze federal funding abroad and at home so they can align spending with Trump's agenda, the fight over \u201cpower of the purse\u201d seems bound to return to the Supreme Court.",

      "A small U.S. federal agency that invests in African small businesses is expected in court on Tuesday to fight for control over its operations and existence",
      "WASHINGTON -- A small U.S. federal agency that invests in African small businesses is expected in court on Tuesday to fight for control over its operations and existence.",
      "The U.S. African Development Foundation last week tried to keep staff from Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency from entering their offices in Washington. DOGE staff managed to gain entry after returning with U.S. Marshals.",
      "Ward Brehm, the president of USADF, last week sued the Trump administration, saying in a complaint that the attempted takeover was illegal and that neither President Donald Trump nor DOGE had the authority to shut down its operations or replace its board members and president.",
      "Hours later, U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon in Washington temporarily barred the administration from replacing USADF's leadership. Leon will hear arguments Tuesday from government lawyers and attorney's representing Brehm about whether the Trump administration can remove the board members and appoint new ones.",
      "Trump last month in an executive order targeted USADF and three other agencies for closure in an effort to deliver on campaign promises to shrink the size of the federal government. The independent agency was created in 1980 by Congress and is controlled by board members, who must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.",
      "A primary question in the case is whether the Trump administration has the legal authority to remove the independent board members. Presidents are restricted from firing these members without cause, thanks to a nearly 90-year-old Supreme Court decision known as Humphrey\u2019s Executer, which has been a backstop for advocates in court against the Trump administrations' firings. More recent Supreme Court decisions have expanded the president\u2019s removal power and legal experts say the high court's conservative majority may be inclined to overturn that precedent.",
      "In a filing on Monday, attorneys for the government claimed the Trump administration last month removed USADF's board members by emails from the White House. USDAF challenged that account, saying that just one board member, Brehm, received a removal email.",
      "The remaining board members made Brehm president on March 3. The previous USADF president resigned before the agency was targeted for elimination.",
      "Attorneys for the Trump administration have argued that USADF's board has, \u201cdone everything possible to avoid complying with the President\u2019s clear directives,\u201d and that \u201cthe President must be able to designate acting officials to fulfill his duty to enforce the laws.\u201d",
      "Congress in 2023 allocated $46 million to USADF to invest in relatively small agricultural projects and energy infrastructure projects among other economic development initiatives in 22 African countries. The agency employs around 50 people.",
      "In court filings, USADF describes staff from DOGE demanding access to their systems, which staff denied citing privacy and security requirements. They also said DOGE emailed USADF's staff last month announcing that Pete Marocco, the deputy administrator of USAID who has overseen its dismantling, would chair USADF's board.",
      "Marocco and some of the same DOGE staff have succeeded in shuttering another independent agency, the Inter-American Foundation. On Feb. 28, a White House official told IAF staff that Marocco would chair the agency's board, according to a letter sent to Congress by Eddy Arriola, the chair of IAF's board.",
      "The same day, Marocco held an emergency board meeting outside of IAF's offices because he was not able to gain entry to the building. In notes entered into the Federal Register, Marocco said he designated himself the acting CEO and president of IAF, seemingly firing the sitting president.",
      "Since, IAF's grants and contracts have been cancelled and most of its 37 staff members have been laid off. In 2024, IAF oversaw almost $350 million in investments in Latin American and the Caribbean, with a little more than half of that coming from outside funds, meaning from countries or private funders.",

      "Police say a man torched three Tesla chargers in a South Carolina parking lot and at the same time apparently inadvertently set himself on fire",
      "NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. -- A man burned three Tesla chargers in a South Carolina parking lot and also apparently inadvertently set his clothes on fire, police said.",
      "The man spray-painted \u201clong live the Ukraine\u201d and a crude reference to President Donald Trump on the pavement next to the charging stations Friday near an outlet mall in North Charleston, according to a report from the North Charleston Police.",

      "No arrests have been made, North Charleston Police spokesperson Harve Jacobs said Tuesday. The agency turned the investigation over to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "Investigators collected the beer bottles while firefighters cut the power to the chargers and put out the blaze.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans will face a critical test of their unity when a spending bill that would avoid a partial government shutdown and keep federal agencies funded through September comes up for a vote.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is teeing up the bill for a vote as soon as Tuesday despite the lack of buy-in from Democrats, essentially daring them to oppose it and risk a shutdown that would begin Saturday if lawmakers fail to act.",
      "Republicans will need overwhelming support from their members in both chambers \u2014 and some help from Senate Democrats \u2014 to get the bill to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk. It's one of the biggest legislative tests so far of the Republican president's second term.",
      "\u201cThe CR will pass,\u201d Johnson told reporters Monday, using Washington shorthand to describe the continuing resolution. \u201cNo one wants to shut the government down. We are governing, doing the responsible thing as Republicans. It\u2019s going to be up to Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats to do the right thing.\"",
      "The strategy has the backing of Trump, who is calling on Republicans to \u201cremain UNITED \u2014 NO DISSENT \u2014 Fight for another day when the timing is right.\u201d",
      "House Republicans said the bill would trim $13 billion in non-defense spending from the levels in the 2024 budget year and increase defense spending by $6 billion, which are rather flat changes for both categories when compared with an overall topline of nearly $1.7 trillion in discretionary spending. The bill does not cover the majority of government spending, including Social Security and Medicare. Funding for those two programs is on auto pilot and not regularly reviewed by Congress.",
      "Democrats are mostly worried about the discretion the bill gives the Trump administration on spending decisions. They are already alarmed by the administration's efforts to make major cuts through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, run by billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk. And they say the spending bill would fuel the effort.",
      "\u201cThis is not a clean CR. This bill is a blank check,\u201d said Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. \u201cIt's a blank check for Elon Musk and President Trump.\u201d",
      "Spending bills typically come with specific funding directives for key programs, but hundreds of those directives fall away under the legislation, according to a memo released by Senate Democrats. So the administration will have more leeway to reshape priorities.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has endorsed this full-year CR because he understands what is in it for him: more power over federal spending to pick winners and losers and devastate Democratic states and priorities,\u201d the memo warned.",
      "For example, the Democratic memo said the bill would allow the administration to steer money away from combating fentanyl and instead use it on mass deportation initiatives.",
      "Normally, when it comes to keeping the government fully open for business, Republicans have had to work with Democrats to craft a bipartisan measure that both sides can support. That\u2019s because Republicans almost always lack the votes to pass spending bills on their own.",
      "This time, Republican leaders are pushing for a vote despite Democratic opposition. Trump is showing an ability this term to hold Republicans in line. He met with several of the House chamber's most conservative members last week.",
      "Now, House Republicans who routinely vote against spending bills said they would support this one. The House Freedom Caucus, which includes many of the House's most conservative members, issued a statement of support saying \u201ccontrary to Congress\u2019 longtime abuse of this legislative tool, this CR is a paradigm shift.\u201d",
      "Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., is still a holdout, though. He says he'll vote no.",
      "\u201cI guess deficits only matter when we're in the minority,\u201d said Massie, when asked why colleagues weren't listening to his concerns.",
      "Trump went after Massie on social media, calling him a \u201cGRANDSTANDER, who\u2019s too much trouble.\u201d",
      "\"HE SHOULD BE PRIMARIED, and I will lead the charge against him,\" Trump posted online.",
      "Rep. Tom Cole, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, acknowledged the continuing resolution was not the outcome he was seeking but said it was time to end the cycle of short-term extensions Congress has been passing to keep the government open. This will be the third for the current budget year.",
      "\u201cCongress does have other things to do,\" said Cole, of Oklahoma. \u201cIt's got a lot on its plate this year.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, House Democratic leaders have come out strongly against it. Less clear is how strongly they'll push members in competitive battleground districts to follow their lead.",
      "\u201cHouse Democrats will not be complicit in the Republican efforts to hurt the American people,\" House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said.",
      "Senate Democrats generally seem to be emphasizing patience at this stage, waiting to see if Republicans can muscle the bill through the House before taking a stand.",
      "\u201cNo comment,\u201d said top Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York as he rushed through the hallway outside the Senate chamber.",
      "Still, several rank-and-file Democrats criticized the measure. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said he was stunned that Republicans were \u201ctrying to jam through something that is their way or the highway.\u201d",
      "If the bill does move to the Senate later this week, support from at least eight Democratic senators will likely be needed for it to advance to passage.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll be up to the Democrats whether they want to deliver the votes and keep the government from shutting down,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.",
      "Democrats also introduced an alternative bill Monday night funding the government through April 11. The bill could serve as a Plan B if the GOP-led effort falters.",
      "The spending bill could also have major ramifications for the District of Columbia's government. City officials voiced their concerns during a news conference outside the Capitol on Monday, and district residents later in the day flooded the hearing room and surrounding hallway where lawmakers were considering debate rules for the measure.",
      "The bill would limit the district to last year's funding levels, though it's already spending at 2025 levels. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, said the proposal would require the district to cut $1.1 billion in spending in the next six months since it has already passed a balanced budget and is midway through its fiscal year. That means, officials said, cuts to critical services such as education and public safety.",
      "The mayor also emphasized that the district's 2025 budget focused on boosting three priorities: public safety, public education and economic growth.",
      "\u201cIf the Congress goes through with this action, it will work against a priority that President Trump and I share, and that is to make Washington, D.C., the best, most beautiful city in the world,\u201d Bowser said.",

    "story": [
      "The district attorney of Los Angeles County says he does not support resentencing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were convicted of killing their parents in 1989",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The district attorney of Los Angeles says he does not support the resentencing of Lyle and Erik Menendez, brothers who have spent more than 30 years in prison for killing their parents at their Beverly Hills home in 1989.",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said Monday that the brothers have repeatedly lied about why they killed their parents and \u201cfell short\u201d of taking full responsibility for their crimes.",
      "The brothers have argued that they committed the crimes in self-defense after years of abuse by their father.",
      "Here are some things to know about the case:",
      "The shotgun killings of Jose and Kitty Menendez took place on Aug. 20, 1989, in their Beverly Hills mansion. Their son Lyle Menendez was the one who called 911, with the brothers initially claiming the killing was Mafia-related or connected to their father\u2019s business dealings.",
      "The brothers went on spending sprees, buying Rolex watches, cars and houses. Two months later, Erik Menendez told his psychologist, Jerome Oziel, that he and his brother killed their parents. They were eventually arrested and charged in their parents\u2019 deaths.",
      "The murder case captured the public\u2019s attention. Coming on the heels of the O.J. Simpson trial, the nation was hungry for true crime TV. The brothers\u2019 first trial was one of the first to be almost entirely televised on Court TV. It spawned documentaries, television specials and dramatizations. The Netflix drama \u201c Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story \u2033 and the documentary \u201cThe Menendez Brothers,\u201d released in the fall of 2024, have been credited for bringing new attention to the case.",
      "Lyle and Erik Menendez's first trial took place in 1993 with separate juries. Prosecutors argued they killed their parents for financial gain. The brothers\u2019 attorneys never disputed the pair killed their parents, but argued that they acted out of self-defense after years of emotional and sexual abuse by their father.",
      "Both trials resulted in a hung jury on all three counts for the killing of Jose and Kitty Menendez, and the conspiracy to commit murder. The juries were split over murder and manslaughter convictions.",
      "At the second trial in 1995, the judge excluded a substantial amount of evidence presented in the first trial, including testimony from several family members who witnessed or heard about the abuse. Prosecutors doubled down on their claim that no abuse happened. A single jury convicted both brothers of three counts, including first-degree murder, plus lying in-wait and special circumstance allegations. They were sentenced to life without parole in 1996.",
      "In the years that followed, the brothers repeatedly appealed their convictions. In 1998, they were denied by an appellate court and the California Supreme Court. Their petitions for habeas corpus, a request for a court to examine whether someone is being lawfully detained, were denied by the state Supreme Court.",
      "After exhausting their options in state court, they filed petitions in federal court, which were denied. They then appealed in 2005 to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which denied them again.",
      "Their attorney said after that appeal failed, they resigned themselves to spending the rest of their lives in prison.",
      "In 2015, the brothers heard about a letter written by Erik Menendez to his uncle Andy Cano that was mentioned in a Barbara Walters television special. When they asked their attorneys about it, the attorneys were unaware of the letter and realized it had not been introduced at either trial, making it effectively new evidence.",
      "This letter, attorneys say, corroborates the allegations that Erik was sexually abused by his father.",
      "Roy Rossello, a former member of the Latin pop group Menudo, recently came forward saying he was drugged and raped by Jose Menendez, the boys\u2019 father, when he was a teen in the 1980s. Menudo was signed under RCA Records, which Jose Menendez headed at the time.",
      "Rossello spoke about his abuse in the Peacock docuseries \u201cMenendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed.\u201d He provided a signed declaration to the brothers\u2019 lawyers, the final piece of evidence needed for them to file a new petition for habeas corpus in May 2023 and ask for a reexamination of the case.",
      "The brothers have submitted a petition for habeas corpus asking the court to grant them a new trial in light of the new evidence presented.",
      "The court is also considering a motion for resentencing submitted by Hochman's predecessor, George Gasc\u00f3n, last October. Gasc\u00f3n said his office would recommend the brothers receive a new sentence of 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole immediately because they were under 26 years old at the time of the crimes. If the state parole board granted their release, California Gov. Gavin Newsom then has 150 days to review the parole board\u2019s decision.",
      "Finally, the brothers have asked Newsom to grant them clemency. Newsom has ordered the state parole board to evaluate whether the brothers would pose a risk to the public if released.",
      "Hochman says he opposes resentencing the Menendez brothers because of their \u201clack of full insight and lack of complete responsibility for their murders.\"",
      "On Monday, his office announced it was withdrawing the resentencing motion submitted by Gasc\u00f3n's office. Hochman also said in February he does not support the brothers\u2019 habeas corpus petition for a new trial.",
      "Hochman said the brothers failed to \u201ccome clean\u201d about lies they told as the case unfolded, including their original claim that they did not kill their parents. He said their repeated argument that they shot their parents in self-defense does not match the facts of the case that show their premeditated steps to plan the killings and make it look like a gang hit.",
      "He also said the brothers did not admit they tried to get friends to commit perjury for them and lied about their mother trying to poison their whole family.",
      "Hochman's opposition to resentencing considerably reduces the Menendez brothers' chances at freedom, according to Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and professor of criminal law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cFrankly it\u2019s the details that are set forth in this lengthy response,\u201d Levenson said, referring to the 88-page document released by his office. \u201cUp to now, it\u2019s pretty much been the defense\u2019s view of the facts for the court\u2019s consumption and the public as well.\u201d",
      "LA's previous district attorney, Gasc\u00f3n, supported resentencing, pointing to the brothers\u2019 rehabilitation in prison and saying the trial would have been treated differently with today\u2019s understanding of how sexual and physical abuse affects children.",
      "When prosecutors support resentencing, there is \u201csomewhat of a presumption\u201d that the court will do it, Levenson. Without that support, there may even be jurisdictional issues over whether the court can proceed.",
      "The brothers' resentencing hearing is still set for March 20 and 21, presided over by LA County Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic.",
      "\u201cTheir more likely avenue would be through the governor\u2019s office and clemency,\u201d Levenson said. \u201cThat frankly is because Judge Jesic is likely to pay very close attention to all the facts set forth in this opposition.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump, the real estate developer turned commander in chief, is laying bare his style of diplomacy in the early weeks of his new term: It\u2019s a whole lot like a high-stakes business deal, and his No. 1 goal is to come out of the transaction on top.",
      "The tactics are clear in his brewing trade war with Canada and Mexico, in his approach to Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and in his selection of the first country he will visit in his second term.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump approaches diplomacy and engages in a very transactional manner, with economics as the foundation and driving force behind international affairs,\" retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, the president's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, explained at an event in Washington this past week.",
      "For Trump, it\u2019s about leverage, not friendship; dollars as much as values; and hard power versus soft.",
      "It's not just a matter of negotiating style. At stake is the post-World War II international order as Trump's actions raise doubts about American leadership around the globe.",
      "He's shaping a foreign policy that's more inward looking and conscious of the bottom line, dismissing American soft-power levers such as the U.S. Agency for International Development as dubious and riddled by waste and suggesting that the United States might not defend fellow NATO members that aren't meeting defense spending benchmarks set by the alliance.",
      "Politics and presidents to a certain degree are all transactional. But Trump, who helped make himself a household name by burnishing an image as an intrepid real estate dealmaker, is taking it to another level as he navigates an increasingly complicated world.",
      "The Republican president, in his previous life as a real estate titan, saw every deal as one in which there were clear winners and losers. In his return to the White House, he is more demonstrably injecting a what's-in-it-for-me approach to his dealings with both friend and foe.",
      "Edward Frantz, a University of Indianapolis historian who has studied the American presidency, said Trump's \u201cledger\u201d approach might not be the most practical way to conduct diplomacy.",

He also made the kingdom his first overseas stop during his first White House term after the Saudis promised $450 billion in U.S. investment.",
      "Trump acknowledged that the United Kingdom, one of America's oldest allies, has traditionally been the first stop for U.S. presidents. But money talks.",
      "In his dealings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump has highly focused on who has the leverage. Putin has \u201cthe cards\u201d and Zelenskyy does not, Trump has said repeatedly.",
      "Zelenskyy appeared to be making some strides in assuaging Trump after their recent rocky meeting in the Oval Office ended with Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticizing the Ukrainian leader for what they said was insufficient gratitude for the tens of billions of dollars in U.S. assistance provided in the three years since Russia invaded.",
      "Zelenskyy said later that how that meeting went down was \u201cregrettable.\" He also made clear he was ready to sign off on a minerals deal with the U.S. \u2014 even without the explicit American security guarantees sought by the Ukrainians \u2014 that Trump wants.",
      "In his Tuesday address before a joint session of Congress, Trump acknowledged Zelenskyy\u2019s fence-mending efforts. Trump also announced plans to send top advisers to Saudi Arabia this week for talks with Ukrainian officials.",
      "But soon Trump was back to criticizing Zelenskyy, saying he does not have the leverage to keep fighting the war with Russia.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine, and they don\u2019t have the cards,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn terms of getting a final settlement, it may be easier dealing with Russia, which is surprising, because they have all the cards.\"",
      "Trump\u2019s push on Zelenskyy \u2014 and pivot toward Moscow \u2014 marks a significant departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy toward Russia since the Cold War.",
      "Others before Trump, including Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, have tried resets with Russia, but perhaps never at a time as fraught. Deep skepticism toward Moscow, even in the best moments in the relationship, has been the standard operating posture in both Republican and Democratic administrations.",
      "But Trump, who ran on a promise to quickly end the war, has veered from Democratic President Joe Biden's approach of making no major decision that could impact Ukraine without Kyiv's involvement.",
      "At the same time, the new Republican administration has taken steps toward a more cooperative line with Putin, for whom Trump has long shown admiration.",
      "Trump has ordered a pause on U.S. military aid for and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, halted offensive cyberoperations against Russia by U.S. Cyber Command and disbanded a program aimed at seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs as a means to punish the Kremlin for its invasion.",
      "Kellogg, who also served in Trump's first White House, recalled seeing Trump's \u201ctransactional diplomacy approach\u201d early in the first term. Kellogg said that the president's first question in meetings with foreign leaders was often the same.",
      "\"As I found the very first time we were in the Cabinet room when a foreign official came in, the comment was, \u2019What is the trade imbalance between our two nations?''' Kellogg recalled, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations event.",
      "The trade ledger has been top of mind for Trump as he argues that for too long America has been played by friends and adversaries, including neighbors Canada and Mexico.",
      "Trump last week announced 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada amid widespread fears of the economic fallout from a broader trade war. He then postponed most of them.",
      "The White House insists the pending tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of fentanyl. Trump has also at times suggested that the tariffs could be resolved by fixing the trade deficit.",
      "The president on Friday was back to excoriating Canada, this time complaining about policies he said are hurting American dairy farmers and the lumber industry. He said he will act soon to even the ledger with Canada through reciprocal tariffs.",
      "\"Canada has been ripping us off for years on lumber and on dairy products,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whom Trump has taken to belittling as the governor of America's 51st state, said his country will not be backing down from Trump's trade war.",
      "The episode has underscored Trump's willingness to embrace hard power to resolve differences, even if it means testing one of the world\u2019s most durable and amicable alliances.",
      "The center-left Trudeau was so flummoxed by Trump's move that he found himself quoting the sharply conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page to make the point that this fight was unnecessary.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal,\" Trudeau said. \"But Donald, they point out that even though you\u2019re a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Conservatives have long talked about cutting government, but Republicans in Congress have shied away from approving deep reductions because of fear of how voters would react",
      "DENVER -- For decades, conservatives in Congress have talked about the need to cut government deeply, but they have always pulled back from mandating specific reductions, fearful of voter backlash.",
      "Now, President Donald Trump's administration is trying to make major cuts in government through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, run by billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 an initiative led by an unelected businessman who's unlikely to ever run for office and was appointed by a termed-out president who no longer needs to face voters again.",
      "The dynamic of cutting government while also cutting out those who answer to voters has alarmed even some fiscal conservatives who have long pushed for Congress to reduce spending through the means laid out in the Constitution: a system of checks and balances that includes lawmakers elected across the country working with the president.",
      "\u201cSome members of the Trump administration got frustrated that Congress won't cut spending and decided to go around them,\u201d said Jessica Reidl of the conservative think tank The Manhattan Institute. Now, she said, \u201cno one who has to face voters again is determining spending levels.\u201d",
      "That may be changing.",
      "On Thursday, facing mounting court challenges to the legality of Musk ordering layoffs, Trump told his Cabinet that Musk could only make recommendations about government reductions. And there were more signs that Congress, after sitting on the sidelines for nearly the first two months of Trump's administration, is slowly getting back into the game.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican senators told Musk that he needed to ask Congress to approve specific cuts, which they can do on an up-or-down, filibuster-free vote through a process known as recission.",
      "Senators said Musk had never heard of the process before. That was a striking admission given that it's the only way for the executive branch to legally refuse to spend money that Congress has given it.",
      "\u201cTo make it real, to make it go beyond the moment of the day, it needs to come back in the form of a rescission package,\u201d said Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a longtime advocate of spending reductions who said he introduced the idea of recission to Musk during the lunch meeting of the GOP caucus.",
      "Of course, letting Congress have the final word may be constitutional, but it would open up the process to individual representatives or senators balking at cuts because of home-state interests or other concerns, as some have already. But Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and an economist in George W. Bush's administration, said that \u201cmessy\u201d process is a superior one.",
      "\u201cThere's always this instinct in people to insulate decisions from politics,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cIt's a mistake in a democracy. It's really messy. You're not going to get the cleanliness of a corporate reorganization.\u201d",
      "Riedl noted she has advocated for deep cuts for decades, but there's a reason Congress has balked.",
      "\u201cIf Congress won't pass certain spending cuts, it's because the American people don't want it enough,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I want spending levels to be cut, it's my job to persuade the people of America to agree with me.\u201d",
      "Trump and his supporters argue they did just that in the last presidential election when he promised to shake up Washington: \u201cThe people elected me to do the job and I\u2019m doing it,\u201d Trump said during his address to Congress last week.",
      "A corporate-style approach to government has long been the goal of conservatives, especially one segment that has recently called for a more CEO-style leader who is less tied down by democratic commitments to voters. Musk has embodied that, bringing the same disruptive, cost-cutting zeal he brought to his private companies. Some of his DOGE moves mirrored steps he took to slash the social media site Twitter, including the email offering buyouts, both times called \u201cFork in the Road.\u201d",
      "Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, said the effort seems more destructive than just an attempt to shrink government in ways conservatives have long advocated.",
      "\u201cIt is usurping the role of Congress on spending and program design, using cuts as a backdoor way to impound and close agencies created by Congress,\u201d Moynihan said. \u201cIt is implementing an unprecedented scale of disruption.\u201d",
      "Grover Norquist, an anti-tax activist whose pledge to make government small enough to \u201cdrown it in a bathtub\u201d has made him an icon for small-government conservatives, cheered the DOGE project. He said Congress has to authorize any real reductions, but hoped that DOGE's cuts show the legislative branch that voters will not panic when government is shrunk.",
      "\u201cIf we do something for three years, they'll make it the law,\u201d Norquist said of Congress. \u201cThey'll see it's safe, they'll see it's successful. They'll come in and put their name on it.\u201d",
      "Norquist acknowledged that Congress has repeatedly balked at the level of cuts that he would like to see, even under unified Republican control. He asserted that \u201c95%\u201d of Republicans support such reductions but \u201cthat wasn't enough to get it across the finish line\u201d in an era where the majority party usually only has a razor-thin margin of control in either chamber.",
      "The past nearly half-century of politics has been defined by conservatives pledging to cut government spending, only to see it continue to grow. Republican Ronald Reagan swept into the presidency in 1980 pledging to cut government, but when he left eight years later its size had increased. The trend continued through Trump\u2019s first term and during Democrat Joe Biden's presidency.",
      "Now, however, Trump will not face voters again, despite occasional quips about seeking a constitutionally prohibited third term. He has been open about his grudge against the federal bureaucracy, which he blames for many of his troubles during his initial four years in office.",
      "\u201cI don't think previous presidents have had the same animus towards the federal government this one has,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said.",
      "He noted that Trump has launched a second cost-cutting initiative through traditional channels \u2014 his own Office of Management and Budget, which asked agencies to prepare for mass layoffs. That, Holtz-Eakin said, makes those coming reductions likelier to stick than DOGE cuts.",
      "Holtz-Eakin said there are initial signs of voter discontent over the pace, depth and chaos of the cuts. \"The usual way you visit that on a president is you wipe out his party in the midterms,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cYou never evade the voters.\u201d"

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Saudi Arabia is to host talks on Tuesday between the United States and Ukraine in a new diplomatic push after an argument erupted during President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Feb. 28 visit to the White House.",
      "The oil-rich kingdom may seem like an unusual venue for talks aimed at smoothing over relations after the blowup. But Saudi Arabia under its assertive Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been positioning itself as an ideal location for possible peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow \u2014 and even the first face-to-face talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about why this meeting is taking place and Saudi Arabia's role:",
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials will meet after the Oval Office meeting between Zelenskyy, Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance descended into an extraordinary 10-minute argument before journalists.",
      "Trump at one point admonished Zelenskyy by angrily saying: \"You\u2019re gambling with World War III, and what you\u2019re doing is very disrespectful to the country.\" Zelenskyy ended up leaving the White House without signing a deal that included granting the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals. Kyiv hoped that deal would ensure the continued flow of U.S. military support that Ukraine urgently needs as it battles Russia in the war that began after Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022.",
      "Saudi Arabia's Foreign Ministry in a statement on Friday identified the location for the talks as Jeddah, a port city on the Red Sea. It's not clear why the kingdom picked Jeddah as opposed to Riyadh, the Saudi capital where the initial Russia-U.S. talks took place on Feb. 18. However, Jeddah has hosted other diplomatic engagements in the past and is home to royal palaces.",
      "The Foreign Ministry said the kingdom would continue to pursue \u201ca lasting peace to end the Ukrainian crisis.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe kingdom has continued these efforts over the past three years by hosting many meetings on this matter,\u201d the ministry said.",
      "Zelenskyy plans to visit Saudi Arabia on Monday ahead of the talks. He earlier delayed a trip to the kingdom after traveling to the neighboring United Arab Emirates, which also has been considered as a possible venue for peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow.",
      "\u201cWe continue working on the relevant steps with our partners who want peace, who want it just as much as we do,\u201d Zelenskyy said Friday. \u201cThere will be a lot of work here in Europe, with America in Saudi Arabia \u2014 we are preparing a meeting to accelerate peace and strengthen the foundations of security.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy wrote online that a team including his chief of staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov traveling with him to Saudi Arabia will take part in the talks. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will lead the American team for the Ukrainian talks and meet with Prince Mohammed.",
      "Sybiha also spoke on Friday with Rubio ahead of the talks. Sybiha described it as a \u201cconstructive call.\" A two-sentence readout from the State Department said Rubio \u201cunderscored President Trump is determined to end the war as soon as possible and emphasized that all sides must take steps to secure a sustainable peace.\u201d",
      "Trump himself sounded upbeat on Air Force One on Sunday when speaking to journalists.",
      "\u201cI think you\u2019re gonna have eventually \u2014 and maybe not in the distant future \u2014 you\u2019re gonna have some pretty good results coming out of Saudi Arabia this week,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked on Monday about the talks, said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what we\u2019re expecting. It matters what the United States is expecting.\"",
      "Since assuming power in Saudi Arabia, Prince Mohammed took an aggressive posture both at home and abroad. His public image reached its nadir with the 2018 slaying of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, believed by the United States and others to be at the prince\u2019s orders.",
      "In the last two years, however, Prince Mohammed instead has reached a d\u00e9tente with Iran, hosted Zelenskyy for an Arab League summit and been involved in negotiations over the wars in Sudan and the Gaza Strip. Riyadh also maintained ties to Russia through the OPEC+ oil cartel while Western nations levied sanctions against it. That's reasserted the role the kingdom long has perceived itself as having \u2014 being the leader of the Sunni Muslim world and a dominant force in the Middle East.",
      "Hosting Russia-U.S. talks, possibly drawing Trump to the kingdom for his first foreign trip in this term through investments and other possible meetings only raise Saudi Arabia's profile further as a neutral territory for high-stakes negotiations. Saudi Arabia's autocratic government, compliant media and distance from the war also allows for talks to take place in a tightly controlled country with relative privacy.",
      "Trump remains focused on reaching some kind of peace deal to stop the war. His approach toward Ukraine so far has relied far more on stick than carrot \u2014 limiting their access to intelligence and weaponry. While conciliatory toward Putin, Trump recently also threatened new sanctions against Russia over its ceaseless attacks on Ukrainian cities.",
      "If Ukraine and the U.S. reach some sort of understanding acceptable to Trump, that could accelerate his administration\u2019s push to talks. However, the rest of Europe remains skeptical as they have been sidelined from the talks. The European Union last week agreed to boost the continent\u2019s defenses and to free up hundreds of billions of euros for security.",

      "A new law in South Dakota prohibiting the use of eminent domain to acquire land for carbon capture pipelines challenges the viability of a proposed project snaking through five Midwest states",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- A new law in South Dakota prohibiting the use of eminent domain to acquire land for carbon capture pipelines raises questions about the viability of a proposed 2,500 mile (4,023-kilometer) project snaking through five Midwest states.",
      "Summit Carbon Solutions, the company behind the estimated $8.9 billion pipeline, vowed to keep pursuing the project despite South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden's announcement Thursday that he had signed a bill into law that will make routing the line much more difficult. The law bans Summit from forcing South Dakota landowners to allow the pipeline through their property.",
      "Plans call for the pipeline to carry greenhouse gas emissions from more than 50 ethanol plants in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota to a spot in North Dakota, where it would be permanently stored underground.",
      "It's unclear whether Summit will pursue legal action but the company said in a statement that \u201call options are on the table\" and the project \u201cmoves forward\u201d in other states. The company promised it would have more news soon.",
      "Large pipeline projects typically rely on eminent domain, with companies arguing that even if most landowners agree to grant access to their property, a project can be scuttled if only a few refuse.",
      "Summit says the company, which has secured over 2,700 easements across the region, has approval for routes in Iowa and North Dakota and a leg in Minnesota.",
      "The current proposed route would cut through nearly 700 miles (1,126.5 kilometers) of South Dakota before entering North Dakota, so rerouting to the east through Minnesota would be a big challenge.",
      "A Summit spokesperson did not respond to questions Friday about whether the company would consider a new route.",
      "The sponsor of the South Dakota bill, Republican Rep. Karla Lems, said Summit could either reroute its pipeline through Minnesota into North Dakota or \u201cnegotiate with landowners in South Dakota\u201d and go around opponents.",
      "Gov. Rhoden said the South Dakota law wasn't intended to kill the project and suggested Summit see it as \u201can opportunity to reset.\u201d",
      "Minnesota is a relatively small part of Summit\u2019s overall project. The only segment approved in the state is a 28-mile (45-kilometer) leg from an ethanol plant near Fergus Falls to the North Dakota border. Summit\u2019s project also includes two legs in southern Minnesota that would go into Iowa.",
      "A Minnesota Public Utilities Commission spokesperson did not respond to phone or email messages.",
      "The country's transition to electric vehicles has been slower than many people expected, but most think a shift away from internal combustion engines will eventually happen.",
      "Nearly 40% of the nation's corn crop is brewed into ethanol, which is blended into most gasoline sold in the U.S. Midwest farmers and the ethanol industry therefore see it as essential to have new markets as less of the fuel additive goes to power cars.",
      "They see passenger jet fuel as a potentially huge new market for ethanol. However, under current rules the process for turning ethanol into aviation fuel would need to emit less carbon dioxide to qualify for tax breaks intended to reduce greenhouses.",
      "The carbon capture pipeline is a key part of achieving those goals, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said.",
      "Walt Wendland, who runs an ethanol plant in Onida, South Dakota, said the \u201cethanol industry is a margin business\u201d and the new state law will put South Dakota ethanol producers at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cEver since I built a plant, I never wanted an advantage, just don\u2019t put me at a disadvantage,\u201d Wendland said.",
      "It has been four years since Summit proposed building the pipeline, along with two other companies that later abandoned their plans. It has been a challenging process for Summit, which dealt with lawsuits in Nebraska and elsewhere, opposition before a regulatory commission in Iowa and now the eminent domain ban in South Dakota.",
      "In its statement, Summit expressed optimism about the future but didn't offer specifics about how it could build a pipeline without eminent domain authority in South Dakota.",
      "Since the pipeline was proposed, the federal government\u2019s approach to climate change also has changed dramatically. Democratic President Joe Biden increased tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to encourage carbon capture as an effort to slow climate change.",
      "However, Republican President Donald Trump has emphasized the need for more oil and gas drilling and coal mining, and has put far less emphasis on alternative energy. Trump has not indicated whether his views will lead to changing federal policy regarding carbon capture pipelines.",

    "summary": "The measure is part of the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which has been introduced to Parliament.",
    "story": [
      "Councils are to be given greater powers to seize land, under government plans to boost housebuilding.",
      "The measure is part of the flagship Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which has been introduced in Parliament and aims to speed up building.",
      "Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook said he wanted greater use of compulsory purchase orders (CPOs), which allow public authorities to acquire land without the consent of the owner.",
      "Currently, councils buying sites through CPOs must factor in the \"hope value\" - the potential value if planning permission for development is secured  - and this is set to be axed to allow land to be bought at a lower price.",
      "However, rural campaign groups raised concerns farmers could be forced to sell at knock-down prices and that green spaces could be lost.",
      "Victoria Vyvan, president of the Country Land and Business Association said the \"expensive, slow and bureaucratic planning system\" was what was preventing land sales by her members, who \"strongly believe that a small number of homes should be built in a large number of villages\".",
      "She added: \"In removing hope value from compulsory purchases, the government wants farmers to pay for a housing crisis they didn't create.",
      "\"We doubt house builders contracted by councils will be taking a lower profit, so once again farmers will be the only part of the supply chain to lose out.\"",
      "Paul Miner, head of planning and policy at CPRE, the countryside charity, said the group supported the use of CPOs to build genuinely affordable homes on previously developed land.",
      "But he added: \"Compulsory purchase shouldn't be used to enable the development of valued countryside and local green spaces.\"",
      "New homes fall again in government's first six months",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Labour would build on green belt to boost housing",
      "Responding to such fears, Pennycook told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was \"somewhat mystified\" by this interpretation, saying CPOs would be used \"far more often\" for regenerating brownfield - or previously developed - land.",
      "\"We think it's right these powers are more widely used and it will be for local authorities to make the decisions about what land is appropriate for those powers to be used on,\" he added.",
      "A requirement for the secretary of state to sign off on CPOs will be removed \"in certain instances\", he said, adding that the legislation would be \"transformative\" in unlocking construction for new homes, roads, rail and renewable energy projects.",
      "The bill also aims streamline the planning process, with more decisions made directly by officers rather than councillors.",
      "However, councils have raised concerns this could mean they will be shut out of the democratic planning process.",
      "Richard Clewer, housing and planning spokesperson at the Country Councils Network, said he welcomed changes to CPOs as a \"useful tool\".",
      "However, he said changes to the planning process could \"dilute and bypass the role of councillors\", particularly with rural developments where a few new homes could make a significant impact.",
      "Defending the plans, Pennycook said \"expert planning officers\" would support elected councillors with technical detail and allow councillors to focus on larger, more controversial applications.",
      "The government has promised to build 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years, with the pledge key to boosting economic growth.",
      "However, the number of new homes continued to fall during the first six months that Labour was in power, with the construction industry warning the country does not have enough workers to deliver on the target.",
      "Pennycook said the inheritance from the previous Conservative government was \"dire\" but there were \"very positive signs\" and \"green shoots coming forward\" in the number of planning applications being submitted.",
      "Other measures in the bill include:",
      "Up to \u00a32,500 off energy bills for people living within 500m of new pylonsStreamlining the process for approving key projects like wind farms, roads or railways and banning multiple \"meritless\" legal challenges.Allowing \"ready-to-go\" energy projects to jump to the front of the queue for grid connections, replacing the current \"first come, first served process\" which the government says has clogged up the system",

      "Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary Angela Rayner said the plans would be \"backing the builders\" and \"taking on the blockers\" to create \"the biggest building boom in a generation\".",
      "She told the BBC that cutting the number of bodies which get a say in planning decisions would prevent some cases of \"ludicrous\" rejections.",
      "Officials will consult on removing Sport England, the Theatres Trust and the Garden History Society from the list of \"statutory consultees\", who are legally required to provide advice on decisions.",
      "The government said in some cases organisations were slowing down building, giving the example of a housing development in Bradford which was delayed because the application was thought to have not adequately considered the speed of cricket balls from a nearby club.",
      "\"We can't have nonsensical approaches that mean people's houses can't be built because of a stray cricket ball,\" Rayner said, adding: \"We need to have a common sense approach.\"",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump  has said he will \"buy a brand new Tesla\" after shares in the electric car firm fell more than 15%.",
      "Trump blamed \"radical left lunatics\" boycotting the firm to \"attack and do harm\" to Tesla owner Elon Musk.",
      "However, stock analysts said the main reason for the poor performance of the shares was fear about Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year.",
      "Trump's own economic policies on tariffs are also making investors nervous, analysts said.",
      "US markets slumped on Monday as investors concerned about the economic effects of Trump tariffs sold shares.",
      "This came after the US president hinted at a potential US recession, telling a TV interviewer that the world's biggest economy was in a \"period of transition\".",
      "Investors fear Trump's tariffs could push up the pace of price rises and hit economic growth as firms pass on the costs of bringing goods into the country onto customers.",
      "As part of the sell-off, shares in technology firms dropped, with Tesla stock sinking by 15.4%, while artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant Nvidia, Facebook owner Meta, Amazon, and Google-parent Alphabet also fell sharply.",
      "Tesla's shares recovered somewhat - rising 3.6% - when US markets opened on Tuesday. Other US tech stocks also regained some lost ground.",
      "Tesla's initial drop came after a UBS analyst warned on Monday that new Tesla deliveries could be much lower than expected this year.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump took to his Truth Social platform trying to drum up Tesla sales, asking \"Republicans, Conservatives, and all great Americans\" to support Musk, who has been putting his energies into trying to slash federal government jobs.",
      "Despite his comments, Trump policies so far have been designed to limit electric car sales, including his revoking a 2021 order by former president Joe Biden that half of all car sales should be electric by 2030, and halting unspent government funds for charging stations.",
      "Trump's tariffs could also hurt the manufacturer. Tesla chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said in January Tesla parts sourced from Canada and Mexico would be subject to the levies and that this could hit profitability.",
      "Trump said on Tuesday Musk is doing a \"fantastic job\", but \"radical left lunatics\" are \"trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla\" in an effort \"to attack and do harm to Elon\".",
      "\"I'm going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American,\" Trump added.",
      "Tesla shares are back to around the level they were before the US election.",
      "They spiked after Trump's win as investors bet on Musk's business benefitting from his backing the president.",
      "Mr Musk has been heading up the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), which is not an official US government agency.",
      "Doge has been trying to make huge cuts to federal funding, and Musk himself has has been voicing support for far-right politics.",
      "His stance has been drawing criticism in the US. About 350 demonstrators protested outside a Tesla dealership in Portland, Oregon, last week, and nine demonstrators were arrested outside a New York City Tesla dealership earlier in March.",
      "Linsay James, an investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said that although there is \"an element\" of Elon Musk's politics \"having a brand impact\", there were other reasons for the share price fall.",
      "Ultimately the drop \"comes down to hard numbers\", she said.",
      "\"When we look at new orders, for example in Europe and China, you can see that they've effectively halved over the last year,\" she said.",
      "Sales in Europe have fallen sharply this year. Across the continent, they were down 45% in January compared to the same month in 2024, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).",
      "There has also been a steep decline in China \u2013 a key market \u2013 and Australia.",
      "Other experts have said Tesla is over-valued, so the fall is seen as a correction, while others have pointed to rising competition from some of Chinese electric vehicle companies.",
      "Investors are \"certainly getting more worried about an economic slowdown too, so the richest-valued companies like Tesla have been hit hardest in recent days\", she added.",
      "They have also been concerns that Musk has not been focusing on his firms.",
      "In an interview with Fox Business on Monday, he said he was combining the Doge role with running his businesses \"with great difficulty\".",
      "Alongside Tesla, his businesses include Space X, which has experienced serious failures in the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket, and the social media network X, which suffered an outage on Monday.",

    "story": [
      "Global sales of smartwatches have fallen for the first time, new figures indicate, in large part due to a sharp decline in the popularity of market leader, Apple.",
      "Market research firm Counterpoint says 7% fewer of the devices were shipped in 2024 compared to the year before.",
      "Shipments of Apple Watches fell by 19% in that period, Counterpoint says.",
      "It blames the slump on a lack of new features in Apple's latest devices, and the fact a rumoured high-end Ultra 3 model never materialised.",
      "\"The biggest driver of the decline was North America, where the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,\" said Counterpoint senior research analyst Anshika Jain.",
      "Apple was also hit with sales and import bans in the US in late 2023 and early 2024 over a disputed patent regarding blood oxygen level monitoring - which Ms Jain says also contributed to lower sales figures in the first half of 2024.",

      "Sales in China also grew from 19% of the market to 25% in the year from the last quarter of 2023.",
      "This was the first time it recorded more smartwatch sales than India or North America, according to Counterpoint.",
      "The Chinese manufacturers also appeared to tap into another trend - the growing popularity of smartwatches for children, the only segment of the market to grow in 2024.",
      "Imoo, known in China as \"Little Genius\", specialises in children's smart watches and saw a 22% rise in shipments.",
      "\"The kids' smart watch segment is gaining traction as parents are concerned for their children's safety, and they desire to track and stay constantly connected with their children,\" Counterpoint's Balbir Singh said.",
      "But Imoo was eclipsed by a 135% rise in shipments from Beijing-based tech company Xiaomi.",
      "Its Smart Band activity trackers sell for a fraction of the price of rivals made by Apple and Samsung.",
      "\"We're seeing the large consumer electronics players like Apple and Samsung really just look to drive a way higher margin and not engage in the price war,\" said Mr Gebbie.",
      "\"Xiaomi has done a really good job of selling devices, particularly in regions like southern and eastern Europe where that greater affordability tends to resonate a lot more strongly with customers.\"",
      "Another large contributor to the global sales drop was India, which fell from 30% of the market to 23%.",
      "He said this was partly because of a \"bubble\" in ultra-cheap devices from Indian manufacturers which has now burst.",
      "\"We read and saw a lot in terms of complaints about the quality of devices, with people being unhappy with them,\" he said.",
      "\"For those companies, there's been a sense that from this point onwards they would be better served by maybe making and selling products with a slightly longer lifespan.\"",
      "Counterpoint says it expects a small recovery in the global market, with \"single-digit percentage growth in 2025\".",
      "It predicts the uptick in sales will be driven by the increasing adoption of AI features, and a greater emphasis of providing a wider range of health data.",

      "This would likely be done through a central scheme, which would be simpler for consumers than filing a legal complaint and would require firms to check if customers had lost out.",
      "Last month, a decision at the Court of Appeal broadened the net of those who could receive compensation, potentially increasing the lenders' final bill to billions of pounds.",
      "Why was the judges' decision so important?",
      "While the initial investigations surrounded discretionary commission arrangements, which were banned in 2021, the Court of Appeal decision widened the scope to any car finance commissions.",
      "The three judges unanimously agreed that it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be clearly told how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "The hearing included the test case of Marcus Johnson, 34, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, who bought his first car - a Suzuki Swift - in 2017.",
      "He was not informed the car dealership was being paid 25% commission, which was added on to what he had to pay back.",
      "\"I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He said he had no option but to use finance when he bought the car, describing it as \"heartbreaking\" to find out so much extra money had been taken.",
      "\"Someone in my situation at that time, not being able to buy that kind of age car with cash, you would use finance,\" he said.",
      "Following the judges decision in his - and two other car buyers' - favour, banks have set aside millions of pounds for potential compensation. Lloyds Banking Group, for example, has put aside \u00a31.2bn.",
      "It's thought the total cost of compensation could reach \u00a325bn or more, according to analysts.",
      "Car loan scandal payout fears as row drags on",
      "How has the regulator responded?",
      "The FCA said that the decision could lead to dealers and motor finance providers receiving a deluge of new complaints, and it is urging people to make a claim if they feel they were the victims of mis-selling.",
      "Some could come from people previously told they had no claim for compensation because they did not have a discretionary commission arrangement.",
      "The regulator has extended the time providers have to consider complaints until December 2025, aligning the deadline for firms to deal with discretionary and non-discretionary arrangement complaints.",
      "The time period covers claims regarding leasing deals, as well as Personal Contract Purchase (PCP) agreements.",
      "The FCA also wants the Supreme Court to make a quick decision when it reconsiders the Court of Appeal's ruling.",
      "The Finance and Leasing Association, the trade body for motor finance providers, welcomed the extension.",
      "However, others have questioned whether it creates a further compensation delay for those who were mis-sold these agreements.",
      "In February, the Supreme Court rejected an unusual intervention from the government, which was worried huge amounts of redress payments could upset the car market and make it less competitive."

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 11:24:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The claim has been made by the platform's owner Elon Musk, a vocal critic of Ukraine and its president.",
    "story": [
      "Experts have cast doubt on Elon Musk's claim that a large-scale outage which hit X was caused by hackers in Ukraine.",
      "Platform monitor Downdetector says it had more than 1.6 million reports of problems with the social media site from users around the world on Monday.",
      "\"We're not sure exactly what happened but there was a massive cyber-attack to try and bring down the X system with IP [Internet Protocol] addresses originating in the Ukraine area,\" Musk said in an interview with the Fox Business channel.",
      "However, Ciaran Martin, professor at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government told the BBC that explanation was \"wholly unconvincing\" and \"pretty much garbage.\"",
      "Prof Martin - former head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre - says it looks as if X was targeted by what's known as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, where hackers flood a server with internet traffic to prevent users from connecting to a website.",
      "\"It's not that sophisticated - it's a very old technique,\" Mr Martin told Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "\"I can't think of a company of the size and standing internationally of X that's fallen over to a DDoS attack for a very long time,\" he added.",
      "He said the incident at X \"doesn't reflect well on their cyber security.\"",
      "Many users trying to access the platform and refresh feeds on its app and desktop site during Monday's outages were met with a loading icon.",
      "Musk, who has been a frequent critic of Ukraine and its President Volodymyr Zelensky, has offered no evidence to support his claim and did not say whether or not he thought state actors were involved.",
      "He posted on X that \"either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved\".",
      "But Prof Martin said tracing IP addresses \"tells you absolutely nothing,\" because hackers in this situation would hijack devices from all over the world.",
      "The BBC has approached the Ukrainian embassy in Washington DC for comment.",
      "Alp Toker, director of Netblocks, which monitors the connectivity of web services, said its own metrics suggested the outages could well be linked to a cyber attack.",
      "\"What we've been seeing is consistent with what we've seen in past denial of service attacks, rather than a configuration or coding error in the platform,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He said the organisation has seen several major outages spanning more than six hours on Monday, \"each having global impact\".",
      "\"This is amongst the longest X/Twitter outages we've tracked in terms of duration, and the pattern is consistent with a denial of service attack targeting X's infrastructure at scale,\" he added.",
      "Musk has previously claimed that the platform has been targeted by DDoS attacks, but these have not been confirmed.",
      "Like all major social networks, X is a regular target for disruptive and attention seeking attacks.",
      "But X has a track record of falling due to these attacks much more than other larger sites like Facebook and Instagram.",
      "In 2023, a small group of hackers called Anonymous Sudan took the site offline in more than a dozen countries for hours in an attempt to pressurise Elon Musk into launching his Starlink service in their country.",
      "Two men were arrested in 2024 for being the ringleaders of the group - showing that hackers can disrupt X with DDoS attacks from anywhere in the world with the right tools and expertise.",
      "Cyber specialists are seeing a \"sharp rise\" in DDoS attacks which are becoming \"an increasingly popular tool\" for criminals, according to Sian John, chief technology officer at cyber security company NCC Group.",
      "\"Businesses that store large amounts of sensitive data, like tech firms, financial institutions, and healthcare providers, are frequent targets,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Published1 day ago",
      "Published1 day ago",
      "Thames Water, the UK's biggest water company, is in financial crisis and has secured a rescue loan to avoid coming under government control.",
      "However, creditors have won the right to challenge the High Court's decision to allow \u00a33bn funding and their appeal begins on Tuesday.",
      "Even with the rescue deal, Thames still has huge debts and is struggling to fix leaks, sewage spills and modernise outdated infrastructure.",
      "Thames serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people.",
      "Without this latest financial lifeline, it had faced running out of money by the end of March.",
      "How did Thames end up with so much debt?",
      "Many UK water companies have large debts, but Thames Water's problems are the worst.",
      "Water companies were privatised in 1989, with the idea that private investment would improve the system.",
      "But critics say this hasn't happened - some companies have taken on too much debt and failed to invest in infrastructure.",
      "When Thames was privatised in 1989, it had no debt. But over the years it borrowed heavily and now has debts of about \u00a319bn.",
      "Its debt pile increased sharply when Macquarie, an Australian infrastructure bank, owned Thames Water, with debts reaching more than \u00a310bn by the time the company was sold in 2017.",
      "Macquarie said it invested billions of pounds in upgrading Thames's water and sewage infrastructure while it owned the company, but critics argue that it took billions of pounds out of the company in loans and dividends.",
      "Will the rescue deal avert crisis for Thames?",
      "Thames says the \u00a33bn in emergency funding will give it the space needed to complete a restructuring of its debts and attract a cash injection from prospective new investors.",
      "But the proposals had to be approved by the High Court after a group of creditors opposed it, arguing that the 9.75% interest rate on the loan was too costly.",
      "However, that group of creditors is now appealing against the High Court's decision.",
      "If the funding deal had not been approved, Thames faced the possibility of a temporary nationalisation, under a measure known as a Special Administration Regime.",
      "What will that mean for customers?",
      "Even if Thames Water had come under special administration, customers would have seen no impact on their services. Taps would still have run and toilets still have flushed.",
      "However, water bills in general are set to rise, with the rate at which they are due to increase set by the water regulator Ofwat.",
      "Ofwat, the water regulator, says that Thames Water can increase bills by up to 35% - excluding inflation - over the next five years.",
      "But the company says it needs a 53% rise to fix pipes and keep up with demand. It has appealed for permission to charge more.",
      "Customers are unhappy. Consumer groups argue people shouldn't have to pay more because the company has been badly run.",
      "But Sir Adrian Montague, Thames Water's chairman, has warned that without bigger price rises, the company cannot guarantee safe and resilient water supplies that can cope with climate change and population growth.",
      "Who owns Thames Water now?",
      "Thames Water is privately owned by a group of pension funds and investment firms. The biggest shareholders include:",

      "Other investors include funds from Canada, Australia, and the Netherlands.",
      "Why was Thames Water privatised?",
      "The entire water and waste sector was privatised 34 years ago under the late Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government for \u00a37.6bn. At the time, Mrs Thatcher wrote off the industry's \u00a35bn debt, leaving companies with a clean slate and gave them \u00a31.5bn in public money.",
      "The government had wanted to privatise the industry in 1984 but a public backlash against the plan saw it shelved until after the general election three years later. At the time, the UK was under pressure from Europe to improve the purity of its water.",
      "However, meeting European standards would cost billions of pounds worth of investment which, it was hoped, would come from the private sector and, by extension, companies' customers.",
      "\"If we want environmental improvement, it will cost money,\" said Mrs Thatcher in 1988. \"It will be the people who want those improvements in water who will have to pay.\"",
      "Former Labour MP Ann Taylor later said of privatising the water industry: \"The message is always the same - maximise the cost to the consumer to ensure maximum return to the investor. We should not be surprised at that. After all, that is what private investors expect of their companies.\"",

    "summary": "The move is in retaliation to Trump's tariff threats on Canada, and is expected to raise energy costs for 1.5 million US homes.",
    "story": [
      "Canada's most populous province Ontario is slapping a retaliatory 25% surcharge on electricity it sends to US states in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods.",
      "Ontario leader Doug Ford confirmed the move in a news conference on Monday morning, saying it will increase costs for affected US customers by an average of $100 (\u00a377.65) per month.",
      "Roughly 1.5 million American homes and businesses in the northern border states of New York, Michigan and Minnesota will be impacted.",
      "Ford said that the surcharge on energy will remain until the threat of tariffs from the US \"is gone for good.\"",
      "\"President Trump's tariffs are a disaster for the U.S. economy. They're making life more expensive for American families and businesses,\" Ford said in a statement on Monday.",
      "At Monday's news conference, Ford threatened to escalate further if the US increases their tariffs on Canada.",
      "\"I will not hesitate to increase this charge if necessary,\" he said. \"If the US escalates, I will not hesitate to shut off electricity completely.\"",
      "He added that he understands the tariffs are not the fault of the American people, blaming Trump solely for them. \"Believe me when I say I don't want to do this,\" Ford remarked, though he added: \"As premier, my number one job is to protect the people of Ontario.\"",
      "Ford said that Ontario will be using the revenue from its retaliatory tariffs on energy to support local workers and businesses impacted by US tariffs on Canada.",
      "Canada's federal government has also imposed its own dollar-for-dollar reciprocal tariffs on $30bn worth of US goods exported north. The list of products impacted ranges from clothing to perfume to orange juice.",
      "Trump responded to the surcharge in a social media post on Tuesday, saying \"your not even allowed to do that\".",
      "He said the US would \"get it all back\" with its own reciprocal tariffs in the coming weeks.",
      "\"Canada is a Tariff abuser, and always has been, but the United States is not going to be subsidizing Canada any longer,\" he said.",
      "President Trump has threatened Canada repeatedly with a blanket 25% tariff on all Canadian exports to the US - a move that economists have warned could result in job losses in Canada while increasing prices for Americans.",
      "The US has threatened similar tariffs on neighbouring Mexico as well.",
      "Last week, Trump imposed the levies but quickly reversed course, saying he would temporarily spare carmakers from tariffs until 2 April.",
      "He later carved out further exemptions on goods shipped under North America's free trade pact, the US-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) agreement, which Trump signed in his first term. The measures also reduced tariffs on potash - a key ingredient for fertiliser needed by US farmers - from 25% to 10%.",
      "Trump, however, is still expected to impose tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium some time this week.",
      "Governors from states affected by the electricity tax also responded.",
      "Democratic New York Governor Kathy Hochul has commissioned a review of the impact of Trump's tariffs and Ford's response on energy prices and supply reliability in the state.",
      "\"These federal tariffs have been poorly conceived from the start: crafted in secret with no transparency and no clear economic rationale, they've only served to destabilize our capital markets and create uncertainty among New York families and businesses,\" she said in a statement.",
      "The trade war tensions have rattled markets and raised fears of economic turbulence.",
      "The S&P 500 share index, which tracks the biggest listed American companies, has plunged to its lowest point since September, after Trump imposed the tariffs last week and later declined to rule out the possibility of a recession.",
      "In a Fox News interview that was taped on Thursday, Trump said \"I hate to predict things like that\" in response to the possibility of a severe economic downturn, after saying that the tariffs could bring about a \"period of transition.\"",
      "\"It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us,\" Trump said."

President Xi Jinping is now betting big on it, as a slowing Chinese economy grapples with the blow of tariffs from its biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "Beijing plans to invest 10tn Chinese yuan ($1.4tn; \u00a31tn) in the next 15 years as it competes with Washington to gain the edge in advanced tech. AI funding got yet another boost at the government's annual political gathering, which is currently under way. This comes on the heels of a 60 billion yuan-AI investment fund created in January, just days after the US further tightened export controls for advanced chips and placed more Chinese firms on a trade blacklist.",
      "But DeepSeek has shown that Chinese companies can overcome these barriers. And that's what has stunned Silicon Valley and industry experts \u2013 they did not expect China to catch up so soon.",

      "Timmy's machine comes from the same company, SenseRobot, which offers a wide range in abilities \u2013 Chinese state media hailed an advanced version in 2022 that beat chess Grand Masters at the game.",
      "\"Parents will ask about the price, then they will ask where I am from. They expect me to come from the US or Europe. They seem surprised that I am from China,\" Mr Tang said, smiling. \"There will always be one or two seconds of silence when I say I am from China.\"",

      "One of the secrets to China's engineering success is its young people. In 2020, more than 3.5 million of the country's students graduated with degrees in science, technology, engineering and maths, better known as STEM.",
      "That's more than any other country in the world - and Beijing is keen to leverage it. \"Building strength in education, science and talent is a shared responsibility,\" Xi told party leaders last week.",
      "Ever since China opened its economy to the world in the late 1970s, it has \"been through a process of accumulating talent and technology,\" says Abbott Lyu, vice-president of Shanghai-based Whalesbot, a firm that makes AI toys. \"In this era of AI, we've got many, many engineers, and they are hardworking.\"",
      "Behind him, a dinosaur made of variously coloured bricks roars to life. It's being controlled through code assembled on a smartphone by a seven-year-old.",
      "The company is developing toys to help children as young as three learn code. Every package of bricks comes with a booklet of code. Children can then choose what they want to build and learn how to do it. The cheapest toy sells for around $40.",
      "\"Other countries have AI education robots as well, but when it comes to competitiveness and smart hardware, China is doing better,\" Mr Lyu insists.",
      "The success of DeepSeek turned its CEO Liang Wenfeng into a national hero and \"is worth 10 billion yuan of advertising for [China's] AI industry,\" he added.",
      "\"It has let the public know that AI is not just a concept, that it can indeed change people's lives. It has inspired public curiosity.\"",
      "Six homegrown AI firms, including DeepSeek, have now been nicknamed China's six little dragons by the internet \u2013 the others are Unitree Robotics, Deep Robotics, BrainCo, Game Science, and Manycore Tech.",
      "Some of them were at a recent AI fair in Shanghai, where the biggest Chinese firms in the business showed off their advances, from search and rescue robots to a backflipping dog-like one, which wandered the halls among visitors.",
      "In one bustling exhibition hall, two teams of humanoid robots battled it out in a game of football, complete in red and blue jerseys. The machines fell when they clashed \u2013 and one of them was even taken off the field in a stretcher by their human handler who was keen to keep the joke going.",

      "'Catch-up mode'",
      "But as the world learns of China's AI potential, there are also concerns about what AI is allowing the Chinese government to learn about its users.",
      "AI is hungry for data - the more it gets, the smarter it makes itself and, with around a billion mobile phone users compared to just over 400 million in the US, Beijing has a real advantage.",
      "The West, its allies and many experts in these countries believe that data gathered by Chinese apps such as DeepSeek, RedNote or TikTok can be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party. Some point to the country's National Intelligence Law as evidence of this.",
      "But Chinese firms, including ByteDance, which owns TikTok, says the law allows for the protection of private companies and personal data. Still, suspicion that US user data on TikTok could end up in the hands of the Chinese government drove Washington's decision to ban the hugely popular app.",
      "That same fear \u2013 where privacy concerns meet national security challenges - is hitting Deepseek. South Korea banned new downloads of DeepSeek, while Taiwan and Australia have barred the app from government-issued devices.",
      "Chinese companies are aware of these sensitivities and Mr Tang was quick to tell the BBC that \"privacy was a red line\" for his company. Beijing also realises that this will be a challenge in its bid to be a global leader in AI.",
      "\"DeepSeek's rapid rise has triggered hostile reactions from some in the West,\" a commentary in the state-run Beijing Daily noted, adding that \"the development environment for China's AI models remains highly uncertain\".",
      "But China's AI firms are not deterred. Rather, they believe thrifty innovation will win them an undeniable advantage \u2013 because it was DeepSeek's claim that it could rival ChatGPT for a fraction of the cost that shocked the AI industry.",
      "So the engineering challenge is how to make more, for less. \"This was our Mission Impossible,\" Mr Tang said. His company found that the robotic arm used to move chess pieces was hugely expensive to produce and would drive the price up to around $40,000.",
      "So, they tried using AI to help do the work of engineers and enhance the manufacturing process. Mr Tang claims that has driven the cost down to $1,000.",
      "\"This is innovation,\" he says. \"Artificial engineering is now integrated into the manufacturing process.\"",
      "This could have enormous implications as China applies AI on a vast scale. State media already show factories full of humanoid robots. In January, the government said that it would promote the development of AI-powered humanoid robots to help look after its rapidly ageing population.",
      "Xi has repeatedly declared \"technological self-reliance\" a key goal, which means China wants to create its own advanced chips, to make up for US export restrictions that could hinder its plans.",
      "The Chinese leader knows he is in for a long race \u2013 the Beijing Daily recently warned that the DeepSeek moment was not a time for \"AI triumphalism\" because China was still in \"catch-up mode\".",

    "story": [
      "The cost of reducing energy bills for people who live near pylons will be paid for by increasing average annual bills across the country by 80p, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has told the BBC.",
      "Under the government's plans, households in Great Britain within 500m of new or upgraded pylons will get discounts of up to \u00a32,500 over 10 years, equivalent to \u00a3250 a year.",
      "Miliband said the costs of the scheme were \"more than offset\" by the benefits of the new infrastructure.",
      "He added that the idea was not about buying people off but \"recognising the service\" they were doing for the whole country.",
      "However, rural campaign groups said it was \"impossible to put a price on the loss of a landscape\".",
      "A government-commissioned report found hundreds of miles of new pylons will be needed to meet its clean energy targets.",
      "But new infrastructure proposals have sparked fierce opposition from residents in parts of the country like Norfolk and Suffolk, with campaigners arguing they will destroy the countryside.",
      "The bill discounts, which will be funded by electricity suppliers, are expected to be in place from 2026.",
      "Suppliers are expected to recoup costs by passing them on to other customers.",
      "Miliband told the BBC: \"At the moment, we're having to switch off offshore wind farms because we haven't got the transmission infrastructure.",
      "\"So everybody benefits from this. Everybody gets lower bills, and those who live near pylons are given a recognition of what they're doing.\"",
      "The idea forms part of the government's Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which is due to be published this week.",
      "The legislation aims to speed up the building of new homes and infrastructure by cutting red tape and simplifying the planning process.",
      "The government has put the changes at the heart of its push for economic growth.",

      "The government said this would mean communities could get \u00a3200,000 worth of funding per km of overhead electricity cable in their area, and \u00a3530,000 per substation.",
      "Initial analysis estimates both bill discounts and community funds could see a total additional cost of between \u00a31-2 a year for the average customer over 10 years.",
      "The government is also looking at how communities near onshore wind farms and other energy infrastructure can receive benefits.",
      "The plans were welcomed by RenewableUK, which represents the sector.",
      "The group's head of policy, James Robottom, said bill discounts would \"help to enable the roll-out of much-needed new grid infrastructure at a faster pace, so that we can make the most of the vast amounts of clean power we're producing\".",
      "However, Jackie Copley, campaign lead at CPRE, the countryside charity, said: \"Investing in local green spaces or improving community infrastructure would be a better way to spend this money.",
      "\"Paying individuals comes with many problems, including questions of fairness, likely legal challenges, and the fact that it's impossible to put a price on the loss of a landscape.\"",
      "The idea of giving people living near new pylons money off their energy bills was also proposed under the previous Conservative government.",
      "A government survey in 2024 suggested 78% of people would find an energy infrastructure project more acceptable if they were offered discounts on their bills.",
      "Some energy companies already offer bill discounts to customers who live near infrastructure like wind turbines, while grants are also available for local communities affected.",
      "The bill also includes measures that would allow \"ready-to-go\" energy projects to jump to the front of the queue for grid connections, replacing the current \"first come, first served\" process.",
      "The government says the existing system is being \"clogged up\" by speculative projects creating 10 year waits for \"viable infrastructure\".",

    "summary": "The incoming Canadian PM has made standing up to his US counterpart a big part of his campaign.",
    "story": [
      "Mark Carney's elevation to the top job in Canada is of particular significance at this moment when his country is at the frontline of a North American trade war. He becomes the \"anti-Trump\" on the US president's doorstep.",
      "The former Bank of England governor chose to lean strongly into resisting Donald Trump's policies at his acceptance speech. He said the US president had brought \"dark days\" from \"a country we can no longer trust\" and that he was \"proud\" of Canadians resisting the US \"with their wallets\".",
      "While on trade specifically Mr Carney vowed to keep the retaliatory tariffs \"until Americans show us respect\", it was clear that the general threats against Canadian sovereignty are equally as important in his thinking.",
      "Trump has repeatedly said he will use economic power to encourage Canada to become the 51st state of the US, but Carney hit back. \"The Americans want our resources, our land, our water, our country\u2026 Canada will never be part of America in any way, shape or form,\" he said.",
      "Behind the scenes, Carney has been encouraging a very robust response to Mr Trump. As he told me last month in his only UK interview during his campaign to succeed current Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, it was necessary to \"stand up to a bully\".",
      "He ridiculed Trump's allegations of Canada's involvement in fentanyl trade, and the US president's suggestion that Canada has ripped off the US. Canada's trade deficit is caused \"entirely\" by its exports of subsidised oil, Carney told me, and \"perhaps we should ask for that subsidy back\".",

      "Carney talks tough on Trump threat - but can he reset relations?",
      "How Britain's former top banker became Canada's next prime minister",
      "He follows in the footsteps of former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi as a former top central banker who became a G7 leader. It is an otherwise rare path, but it may be good timing when Canada's nearest neighbour has suggested using economic power to take over.",
      "Carney has experience in this area having dealt with a number of acute political-economic crises, such as the banking crash, the eurozone crisis, sterling's sharp slide after Brexit, and the start of the pandemic.",
      "He has also regularly attended G20 meetings at leader level, including in the presence of Trump, as chair of the Financial Stability Board, an international economic body. At one such meeting, the Trump team threatened to leave the International Monetary Fund.",
      "Carney believes that Trump only respects power. Of any attempt to mollify Trump, he said \"good luck with that\". He will focus further tariff retaliation on bringing inflation and interest rate rises to Canada's \"southern neighbour\".",
      "The Canadian election is due by October, but Carney might call an earlier one. Depending on that, he is on course to host Trump in Canada at the G7 Summit in June.",
      "His rise to the top job raises the stakes for the UK. On the one hand, a more robust approach from an allied G7 leader stands in contrast to the UK's attempt to hug the White House closely.",
      "On the other hand, Carney also hinted at wanting to diversify trade towards \"more reliable\" partners, which would include the UK and EU. Canada might send its subsidised energy to Europe, rather than the US.",
      "The bigger strategic point is that Carney's background means a focus on international solidarity, and defence of the existing multilateral system.

      "Canada's new leadership expects support from its Commonwealth ally, the UK. After my recent interview with him, Carney turned the camera to the portrait on the wall of the office from which he was talking to me: King Charles. The message was clear.

      "Out of all the criminal actors involved in crypto currency, North Korea is the best at laundering crypto, Dr Robinson says.",
      "\"I imagine they have an entire room of people doing this using automated tools and years of experience. We can also see from their activity that they only take a few hours break each day, possibly working in shifts to get the crypto turned into cash.\"",

      "ByBit thought it was transferring the funds to its own digital wallet, but instead sent it all to the hackers.",
      "Ben Zhou, the CEO of ByBit, assured customers that none of their funds had been  taken.",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of flights have been cancelled across Germany as airport workers stage a nationwide strike over pay, posing a major disruption for air travellers.",
      "The industrial action, led by the trade union Verdi, began unexpectedly on Sunday at Hamburg Airport, before expanding to a nationwide strike.",
      "Passengers at Frankfurt, Munich, Berlin and other major hubs have been urged not to travel to airports, with operations severely disrupted. Frankfurt, Germany's busiest airport, said passengers would be unable to board flights and transfer would \"almost certainly\" be affected.",
      "Verdi, which represents public sector and transport workers, is in an ongoing dispute over wages and working conditions.",
      "German media reports thousands of flights could be cancelled across the day, disrupting travel for more than 500,000 passengers.",
      "The Lufthansa group, whose main hub is in Frankfurt, confirmed \"delays and extensive cancellations\" across all its airlines.",
      "Meanwhile, Munich Airport warned of a \"greatly reduced flight schedule\". This includes flights by Eurowings, Austrian Airlines and Swiss Air.",
      "Katja Bromm, spokeswoman for Hamburg Airport, where all 143 departures scheduled on Monday have already been cancelled, said Verdi was \"dishonourable\" to call a strike without notice at the start of the holiday season.",
      "She said that Sunday's walkouts were \"excessive and unfair to tens of thousands of travellers who have nothing to do with the disputes\".",
      "A spokesman for Verdi accepted that the strike would affect many, but said the travel disruption was necessary to extracting a better pay offer.",
      "Lars Stubbe, the union's Hamburg representative, told the BBC: \"The workers are aware that disruptions do happen, and they are uncomfortable with that, but in any case, it is the employer that caused these strikes because they haven't put a negotiable offer on the table.\"",
      "Many of Frankfurt Airport's 1,770 scheduled flights have already been cancelled, while the majority of Munich's 820 flights are expected to be cancelled.",
      "Hundreds more cancellations are anticipated across Stuttgart, Dusseldorf, Cologne and Berlin.",
      "Many passengers had already checked in their luggage and were having problems getting it returned, according to public broadcaster NDR.",
      "ADV, which represents major German airports, said the strike had \"almost completely paralysed air traffic\".",
      "Verdi's demands include an 8% pay rise, or at least \u20ac350 (\u00a3294) more per month, for all workers - and three extra days of holiday, plus one additional day for union members.",
      "Stubbe said that while airport wages range were above minimum wage, ranging from \u20ac13-\u20ac25 per hour, workers in different roles - particularly security staff - received less annual leave than others.",
      "\"There have been two rounds of negotiations in which the employers have not yet offered one penny,\" he added.",
      "\"It is quite usual that we don't get any offers in the first round, but now even in the second round, the employers have basically said, 'No, we're not going to give you an offer because we don't have any money'.\"",
      "BDLS, the body which sets security workers' pay, said in a statement: \"The damage caused by this strike is almost exclusively to companies that are not at the negotiating table.\"",
      "It called on the government to outlaw short-notice strikes, adding that air transport was \"essential for Germany as a business location\" which \"must not be exploited\" in collective pay disputes.",
      "Ralph Beisel, ADV's general manager, said the strike was having an impact on European and global air traffic, leading to missed connections due to a \"domino effect\".",
      "He called for reforms to German strike laws concerning \"critical\" infrastructure.",
      "The so-called \"warning strike\", an established tactic in German wage negotiations, concerns two separate pay disputes: one relating to airport security workers, and a broader disagreement over pay for federal and municipal government employees.",
      "Verdi has also called for strikes in waste collection across several German cities, including Berlin, Essen and Kiel, where bins have gone unemptied since last week.",
      "Pay talks for government workers are set to restart on Friday in Potsdam, while the next round of talks for airport security staff is scheduled to begin on 26 March.",
      "Niklas Benrath, of the VKA, which regulates pay and conditions for municipal workers, also criticised the strikes, saying Verdi's demands would cost nearly \u20ac15bn.",
      "\"With a total municipal debt of around \u20ac160bn, these demands are not financially viable,\" he added."

    "story": [
      "The NHS is \"looking into\" allegations that patient data was left vulnerable to hacking due to a software flaw at a private medical services company.",
      "The flaw was found last November at Medefer, which handles 1,500 NHS patient referrals a month in England.",
      "The software engineer who discovered the flaw believes the problem had existed for at least six years.",
      "Medefer says there is no evidence the flaw had been in place that long and stressed that patient data has not been compromised.",
      "The flaw was fixed a few days after being discovered.",
      "In late February the company commissioned an external security agency to undertake a review of its data management systems.",
      "An NHS spokesperson said: \"We are looking into the concerns raised about Medefer and will take further action if appropriate.\"",
      "Medefer's system allows patients to book virtual appointments with doctors, and gives those clinicians access to the appropriate patient data.",
      "However, the software bug, discovered in November, made Medefer's internal patient record system vulnerable to hackers, the engineer said.",
      "The software engineer, who does not want to be named, was shocked by what he uncovered.",
      "\"When I found it, I just thought 'no, it can't be'.\"",
      "The problem was in bits of software called APIs (application programming interfaces), which allow different computer systems to talk to each other.",
      "The engineer says that at Medefer those APIs were not properly secured, and could potentially have been accessed by outsiders, who would have been able to see patient information.",
      "He said it was unlikely that patient information was taken from Medefer, but that without a full investigation, the company could not have known for sure.",
      "\"I've worked in organisations where, if something like this happened, the whole system would be taken down immediately,\" he said.",
      "On discovering the flaw the engineer told the company that an external cybersecurity expert should be brought in to investigate the problem, which he says the company did not do.",
      "Medefer says the external security agency has confirmed that it has found no evidence of any breach of data and that all the company's data systems were currently secure.",
      "It says the process of investigating and fixing the API flaw was \"extremely open\".",
      "Medefer said it had reported the issue to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office)  and the CQC (Care Quality Commission), \"in the interests of transparency\", and that the ICO had confirmed there is no further action to be taken as there is no evidence of a breach.",
      "The engineer, who had been contracted in October to test for flaws in the company's software, left the company in January.",
      "In a statement Dr Bahman Nedjat-Shokouhi, founder and CEO of Medefer, said: \"There is no evidence of any patient data breach from our systems.\"",
      "He confirmed that the flaw had been discovered in November and a fix was developed in 48 hours.",
      "\"The external security agency has asserted that the allegation that this flaw could have provided access to large amounts of patients' data is categorically false.\"",
      "The security agency will complete its review later this week.",
      "Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi added: \"We take our duties to patients and the NHS very seriously. We hold regular external security audits of our systems by independent external security agencies, undertaken on multiple occasions every year.\"",
      "Cybersecurity experts, who have looked at information supplied by the software engineer, have expressed their concern.",
      "\"There is the possibility that Medefer stored data derived from the NHS not as securely as one would hope it would be,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey.",
      "\"The database might be encrypted and all the other precautions taken, but if there is a way of glitching the API authorisation, anyone who knows how could potentially gain access,\" he added.",
      "Another expert pointed out that as Medefer deals with highly-sensitive, medical data, the company should have brought in cybersecurity experts as soon as the problem was identified.",
      "\"Even if the company suspected that no data was stolen, when facing an issue that could have resulted in a data breach, especially with data of the nature in question, an investigation and confirmation from a suitably qualified cybersecurity expert would be advisable,\" says Scott Helme, a security researcher.",
      "Medefer was founded in 2013 by Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi, with a goal to improve outpatient care. Since then its technology has been used by NHS trusts across England.",
      "In a statement the NHS spokesperson said those trusts are responsible for their contracts with the private sector.",
      "\"Individual NHS organisations must ensure they meet their legal responsibilities and national data security standards to protect patient data when appointing suppliers, and we offer them support and training nationally on how this should be done.\""

      "Rachel Reeves has previously ruled out further tax rises, but faces difficult choices because of the performance of the UK economy and world events.",
      "What is the Spring Statement and when is it?",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy on Wednesday 26 March.",
      "It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",
      "Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings to Parliament, and alongside this will make her Spring Statement on the economy.",
      "After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond.",
      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to \"give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "That means no big policy announcements are made on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand.",
      "With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing.",
      "The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029/30 financial year, has been wiped out.",
      "Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\". Her two main rules are:",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spendingTo get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending",
      "To get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the Treasury has drafted plans for several billion pounds of spending cuts.",
      "It is understood welfare spending is in the firing line, but other government departments will also see budgets pruned.",
      "The government already had concerns about the rising number of benefit claimants and Reeves has previously pledged \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system.",

      "Reducing the \u00a320,000 tax-free annual limit in cash ISAs, to encourage more people to invest their savings in stocks and shares Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",

      "Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.",
      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",
      "Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze beyond this to raise about \u00a37bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi.",
      "Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so \"would hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\".",
      "Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish - not shrinking, but not growing as desired.",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, according to the latest official figures.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation."

      "Business retail consultant Ged Futter told the BBC this was about loss prevention and staffing costs.",
      "\"There is no way this is about making it quicker for the shopper. It's supposed to be scan and go - this is scan and stop while your trolley is weighed.\"",
      "He said self-scan had increased the rate of shoplifting but instead of putting staff back on tills, supermarkets were trying to use even more technology to stop thefts.",
      "\"This is supermarkets saying, 'we know there are thefts so what we are going to do is treat every customer in exactly the same way to reduce theft'.",
      "\"They're forgetting that trust is the most important thing for all of the retailers and it works both ways. If customers don't feel trusted or think they're being treated like thieves they will go somewhere else.\"",
      "The British Retail Consortium has said shoplifting is \"out of control\" after its annual crime survey found incidents of customer theft reported by retailers in the UK rose by 3.7 million to 20.4 million, and cost retailers \u00a32bn.",
      "Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics revealed shoplifting offences reported by police in England and Wales rose by 23% to more than 492,000 over the same period.",
      "That is the highest figure since current recording practices began in 2003.",
      "Retail criminologist Prof Emmeline Taylor told the BBC she had seen similar trolley scales used in European supermarkets and there was \"definitely an element of trying to control loss\" but added \"let's not forget a lot of scan and go loss can be accidental\".",
      "A random audit of 20,000 scan and go baskets found 43% had at least one error, a 2022 global study on self-checkout found.",
      "Prof Taylor said Tesco's scales were \"quite foreboding and reminiscent of security scanners\".",
      "\"They don't want to give the impression that they are pointing the finger at their honest customer,\" she said.",
      "\"They will need to balance how they respond when there is a weight discrepancy because you can lose a customer for life if they feel they've been wrongly accused of something.\"",
      "She said she could see customers getting frustrated using the scales.",
      "\"You've left your handbag in the trolley, you've got to take your child out of the seat, you might be queueing behind someone who has been stopped and you can't get through so the trial needs to focus on minimising friction points in the customer experience.\"",
      "The scales are the latest example of supermarkets turning to technology to streamline time and costs. The ratio of self-scan to staffed tills continues to be fiercely debated. Some shoppers love the speed and convenience while others are fed up of hearing \"unexpected item in the bagging area\".",
      "In August upmarket north of England supermarket chain Booths got rid of self-scan altogether, while Asda and Morrisons said they would put more staff back on manned tills."

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 00:44:28 GMT",
    "summary": "The controversial cafe chain is expanding outside London but locals often have mixed feelings.",
    "story": [
      "There is a cheerful red awning and a newly painted cream wooden shopfront on the market square in Macclesfield.",
      "A new bakery cafe has just opened, offering ciabatta and sourdough loaves as well as hot cross buns, syrupy cakes, vegetable quiches and of course coffee.",
      "Like towns around the UK, Macclesfield has struggled with retailers closing, leaving empty stores, so there is a buzz around the new arrival.",
      "But Gail's, a brand that started in London more than 20 years ago, is controversial. It draws crowds and inspires social media memes, but attracts fierce criticism too.",
      "A recent spate of national media coverage has even asked why some people \"hate\" Gail's so much, focusing on everything from who owns it to what it does with unsold pastries.",
      "Its arrival isn't universally popular here either.",
      "\"We don't need another coffee shop,\" says Linda Willdig. She is out shopping with her friend Nicola Tomlinson, who agrees. \"There are too many,\" says Nicola.",
      "In fact, from a table outside the new Gail's you could easily throw a cinnamon bun and hit both a Caffe Nero and a Costa. Greggs is just around the corner too.",
      "So something different might have been better, says Jane Kent, a community nurse.",
      "\"People will be larding out on all the bakery stuff,\" she says. \"We don't need more pastries.\"",
      "At heart, though, the objections to Gail's are not about what it sells, but that it doesn't really belong, that it will push up prices and put independent cafes out of business.",
      "But Stephanie Lamb, a teacher on maternity leave, is more welcoming.",
      "\"I don't know Gail's, so it's not necessarily a chain to me,\" she says. \"I'm just happy to have something extra in town.\"",
      "She likes a latte and a croissant and somewhere she can read a book for an hour.",
      "At Gail's prices that would set her back \u00a36.50. Yes, it's pricey, she says, but she is still planning to \"give it a whirl\".",
      "Gail's - a name that suggests a traditional, single-owner, cafe - favours attractive old buildings, often ones vacated as bank branches close, especially if it is a corner site that means it's more visible to passers by.",
      "It has 170 outlets mostly clustered in London and the south east. But this year it plans to open around 40 more, including Ely, Cambridgeshire later this month, Bath in April, and Buxton, Derbyshire in May.",
      "At Friday's opening in Macclesfield there was a flurry of interest in the new place on the square.",
      "Even in the wake of the cost of living crisis, we are increasingly choosing a coffee out as a treat. Nearly two-thirds of people said they went to a coffee shop more than once a week, according to World Coffee Portal, spending more than \u00a36 per visit on average.",
      "So coffee shops are weathering the tough economic climate better than most businesses. There are now 11,450 branded chain outlets across the UK, up from 9,800 five years ago.",
      "Speciality chains like Black Sheep Coffee, Coffee#1 and Blank Street are springing up in city centres, while the giants like Costa and Starbucks are opening drive-throughs and outlets in retail parks.",
      "Caffe Nero has bought up several smaller chains, in different parts of the country, and is retaining their independent branding so it can make the most of local loyalties.",
      "With enthusiasm for coffee so strong it's something of a mystery to Gail's chief executive Tom Molnar why people object to his chain. He feels misunderstood.",
      "Mr Molnar - a joint owner with private equity backing - has been working on expanding the brand since he joined in 2003, but says it's not just about coffee. Its role as a neighbourhood bakery - baking fresh in-store and in regional bakery hubs every day - is key.",
      "He's hoping to roll Gail's out to many more neighbourhoods, including less affluent ones.",
      "\"It's not supposed to be posh,\" he insists.",
      "But for now they pick very carefully where to open, using an algorithm to help select the most promising postcodes.",
      "It flags up things like whether there is a local butcher, bookshops, a park, schools, churches or a farmers' market.",
      "\"I prefer a place that's evolving and growing rather than some place that's too established,\" he says.",
      "If the algorithm homes in on a particular High Street it is a vote of confidence in that town's future.",
      "But retail experts warn that the very nature of the places that Gail's is picking means there are likely to be accusations of gentrification, increasing prices and rents for existing businesses and residents.",
      "\"Gail's is moving into areas with strong local identities. And when that happens, there will always be a reaction,\" says Kate Hardcastle, founder of Insight with Passion.",
      "\"It's not just about a bakery opening, I think it's also about what it represents.",
      "\"Some will see it as a sign of investment and revitalisation, while others worry it's another step back to our High Streets looking like carbon copies of each other,\" she says.",
      "In Flour, Water, Salt - a direct rival to Gail's selling sourdough bread, bagels, coffee-iced buns and sausage rolls - that is just yards from the new shop, some loyal customers are adamantly opposed to the newcomer.",
      "\"Gail's isn't welcome here,\" says Karen Pearson, a businesswoman who lives just outside Macclesfield. She and her friends are worried that the arrival of Gail's means the town is \"on the up\", when in fact they would rather it \"stayed like it is\".",
      "They're not keen on big corporations coming into the town, concerned they might squeeze out independents.",
      "But firefighter and local councillor Anthony Harrison, reckons Gail's is no match for a place like Flour, Water, Salt. \"It's just a posh Greggs,\" he says.",
      "Independents may not be as under threat as people fear, says Graham Soult, a retail consultant from the north of England.",
      "Local owners can offer a more personal touch, respond to local tastes and demands,  he says, while it can be hard for chains to deviate from their given formula.",
      "\"I think a lot of independents are really adept at navigating all the things that are thrown at them,\" he says.",
      "Despite difficult times, the number of independent coffee shops has risen over the last five years from 11,700 to around 12,400 now.",
      "Flour, Water, Salt's manager Toby Johnstone isn't worried. It could mean more footfall, with more people trying his shop too.",
      "\"We are happy there's something else opening and keeping the town centre going,\" he says. \"It's good to have competition.\""

      "This is what waiting to catch a flight can look like these days \u2013 if you can afford to pay $550 (\u00a3433) a year to have the correct credit card required to gain entry.",
      "Then once inside Chase's new La Guardia lounge you can then choose to pay up to $3,000 to access a private suite for a few hours.",
      "BBC Business Daily: the battle of the VIP lounges",
      "It is all part of what has been described as a global arms race among the credit card companies that you are probably entirely unaware of \u2013 they are competing to outdo each other with bigger, better, bolder airport lounges.",
      "And while most of us don't have access to these lounges, experts say we are almost certainly helping pay for them. And they don't come cheap.",
      "\"Yes, it's an arms race, and they're getting extraordinary,\" says Clint Thompson, the news editor at the flight and travel website The Points Guy. \"From what we do know, we're talking up to tens of millions of dollars per lounge.",
      "\"Like the new [American Express-owned] Centurion lounge in Atlanta, I believe they spent about $100m to make that happen.\"",
      "Airport lounges aren't a new concept, and credit card issuers have long teamed up with airlines to offer branded credit cards with lounge access.",
      "But now the card issuers are building lounges themselves, as a way of directly appealing to card holders - and potential new customers too.",
      "JP Morgan Chase, American Express, Capital One, they're all now in the lounge - and lifestyle - business.",
      "For American Express this includes opening a high-end lounge in midtown Manhattan.",
      "Its Centurion New York venue is located on the 55th floor of a skyscraper, with floor to ceiling windows offering sweeping views of New York, and fine dining and private bars.",
      "It's designed for Centurion card holders \u2013 a card which will cost you $10,000 as a signing on fee, plus $5,000 a year. And it is invite-only to get one.",
      "\"We're more than a credit card company or a charge card company, it's more a lifestyle brand, getting you special access to concerts, getting you into restaurants,\" says Audrey Hendley, the head of global travel at American Express.",
      "The card issuers have even moved into a 21st Century staple, the coffee shop.",
      "Capital One have Capital One Caf\u00e9s - now you have a barista in a bank.",
      "Their branch in the Georgetown neighbourhood of Washington DC has all the classic signs of the hip coffee shop - exposed vents, bare brick walls, barista coffee machine.",
      "The only immediate giveaway you might be in the bank is the neon Capital One sign on the wall and their branded touch screens. Look a bit closer, and you might spot one of their casually dressed people who looks like a customer, but is actually what Capital One calls their ambassadors, here to welcome you in and help you with all your banking needs.",
      "Anyone can use the caf\u00e9, but hold a Capital One card and you get money off your brew.",
      "\"We're creating a showroom for our products,\" says Shaun Rowley the director of Capital One Cafes.",
      "\"For customers to come in and see Capital One in action, to touch it, to smell it and even taste it with our cafes. And watching them walk out, as you know, raving fans and advocates for us is kind of the return that we're looking for.\"",

      "\"Yeah, it is a piece of plastic with the chip in it that holds your money, but it is something that actually gives you a position in society,\" he says. \"It is something that says something about who you are. It is something that can make you feel elevated.",
      "\"The credit card firms are not just building rooms at airports, they're building a sense of self. It's kind of amazing that financial services companies have managed to kind of look at some deep-core human drivers, and then build experiences around that.",
      "\"And that's why they're so successful with them, because they've managed to find the psychological levers to pull, rather than just looking at the world through a rational lens.\"",
      "But even if you're never going to get access to these places, you are ultimately still paying for them, according to Lulu Wang. He's assistant professor of finance at Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University near Chicago, and has studied how card payment systems work.",
      "He points out that credit cards are more expensive for merchants, be they retailers, or bars and restaurants to accept than debit cards as they incur a higher processing fee.",
      "Prof Wang says merchants are likely to put up prices to cover the additional cost of people using credit cards.",
      "\"We typically think that corporations, you know, they're facing higher costs, they're going to pass on a pretty substantial share of those costs onto consumers,\" he explains.",
      "\"If we impose all these costs on the merchant, it ends up being a cost that is ultimately borne by all of us as consumers. Well-off people get to use the high merchant fee, high reward cards, and then it's the rest of society that has to bear that cost.\"",

    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, will be Canada's next prime minister, at least for now. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.",
      "Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.",
      "He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.",
      "But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "But holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect it to be called as early as this month.",

      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University.",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "In his time at the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, he oversaw considerable changes in how the institution worked. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Carney's time at the bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "He is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "His political ambitions have been rumoured for years, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament.",

      "Both countries applied for membership of the Western defence alliance Nato in May 2022, some three months after the winter invasion.",
      "Less than three years later, they're both full members and already reaping the benefits, in terms of both national security and economics.",
      "\"We're no longer a country that cannot be trusted,\" observes Micael Johansson, chief executive of Swedish defence company Saab, in reference to the nation's previous historic neutrality.",
      "He points out that in the year since Sweden joined Nato in March 2024, Saab has already negotiated framework agreements with the Nato Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA). The NSPA is the body that organises Nato's ordering from defence firms.",

      "Jukka Siukosaari, Finland's Ambassador to the UK, agrees. \"Being part of Nato brings us on an equal footing with all the other allies. It enlarges the possibilities for Finnish companies in the defence sector and beyond.\"",
      "Private companies will benefit from pledges by Nato member states to increase defence spending.",

      "Amidst uncertainty about what Nato might look like in future, there is no doubt that these higher spending commitments will remain and perhaps even strengthen if Europe was to decide it could no longer rely on the USA.",
      "Nato's newest members' spending commitments are already ahead of those expressed by several existing members. Last year, Finland spent 2.4% and Sweden 2.2% of their respective GDP on defence, and both aim to raise this to between 2.6% and 3% in the next three years.",
      "Examples of new Nato initiatives on Europe's northern flank include the establishment of new Nato bases, and efforts to establish joint defence forces, in northern Finland.",
      "Plus the formation of The Joint Nordic Air Command, which brings together Finland's, Sweden's, Norway's and Denmark's 250 front-line combat aircraft under a joined up command structure, with flexible basing and backed by shared intelligence.",

      "In these areas Saab's boss is eager to promote its own solutions, such as the GlobalEye airborne early warning and control platform, and its Sea Wasp, a remotely-controlled underwater vehicle that can neutralise explosive devices.",
      "Yet given Donald Trump's strong emphasis on \"America first\", it is unlikely that he will be happy with European Nato members choosing Saab, or indeed any other European defence firm over US rivals.",
      "Europe will need to balance its desire to reduce its reliance on the US with its obvious need to retain American support.",
      "European members will also need to consider Nato's defence systems' complexities and interdependencies. They often combine technologies and machines, weaponry and ammunition, vehicles, crafts and vessels, that are produced in several different Nato countries.",
      "In a sense, then, the alliance is held together by complex supply chains and contractual agreements that could not possibly be untangled overnight.",
      "\"Europe's Trans-Atlantic relationship will always remain important,\" says Mr Johansson, though he also points to a \"growing realisation in Europe that we have to do more on our own\".",

      "Also applied by Norway and Denmark, it considers national infrastructure such as the internet and telephony, energy generation and distribution, road networks, and secure supplies of food, medicine as parts of a total defence system.",

      "Beyond the civilian infrastructure spending, national military service, for instance, sometimes takes people away from the economically productive parts of the economy, Ambassador Siukosaari points out.",
      "But perhaps what they deliver does more for the nation than mere provision of products and services?",

    "summary": "The Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni feud has shone a light on a part of the entertainment industry that many of those within it would rather remain invisible.",
    "story": [
      "The lawsuits between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni have shed light on a secretive group of people in Hollywood who operate behind the scenes to keep a lid on fallouts and scandals. But in recent years their role has shifted - and their challenges multiplied",
      "Listen to Steven read this article.",
      "\"She's a phony, but I guess the public likes that\u2026\" This is the line that actress Joan Crawford is said to have declared about film star Bette Davis.",
      "The back-and-forth sniping between the pair played out in public in the 1930s and 40s. \"Bette is a survivor... She survived herself,\" Crawford also apparently remarked.",
      "Their tempestuous relationship was so notorious that in 2017 it was made into an Emmy award-winning TV series, Feud.",
      "Hollywood rivalries are of course nothing new \u2013 yet conflicts today rarely play out so publicly. That might be why the dispute between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, which spilled out into the open in December 2024, is still in the headlines three months on.",
      "The subsequent legal battle brought to light a fallout during production of the film It Ends With Us. After the promotional and cinematic run had ended, the pair \u2013 who didn't appear on the red carpet together at the premiere in New York \u2013 filed lawsuits against each other.",
      "Lively has accused Baldoni and others of carrying out a smear campaign against her after she complained about alleged sexual harassment on set. Baldoni, meanwhile, has accused Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds and their publicist of carrying out a smear campaign against him, and claims that she tried to take over control of the film. Both sides deny all allegations.",
      "What emerged as this all played out is that crisis PR managers had been employed. Legal representatives for Lively obtained numerous text messages between Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel and the crisis team he retained, led by Melissa Nathan, whose previous clients include Johnny Depp and Drake. Ms Nathan was alleged to have texted Ms Abel, \"You know we can bury anyone.\"",
      "Lively has now reportedly taken on the CIA's former deputy chief of staff Nick Shapiro to advise on her legal communications strategy.",
      "While the outcomes of the lawsuits remain to be seen, the feud has cast the spotlight on an industry that would ordinarily remain largely invisible: that is, the publicity machine at work behind the scenes in Hollywood.",
      "\"On every set, there are fights, liaisons\u2026 there are all sorts of things that go on,\" explains Richard Rushfield, founder and columnist at Hollywood newsletter The Ankler. \"Hollywood is a world full of very messy people coming together for these giant projects, where they put together teams quickly to make these things and disband immediately after.",
      "\"Between all that a lot of stuff goes on, and they deal with it quietly \u2013 they're very obsessive about controlling the narrative. When this stuff explodes into the public, beyond control, it makes everyone very nervous.\"",
      "But the world of the Hollywood PR has shifted in recent years, partly because of the growth of social media, which has changed the relationship between celebrities and fans, bringing them into direct contact and removing some of the mystique.",
      "So, what does that mean for the people whose job it is to keep a lid on the industry's messy reality?",
      "From Tom Hardy to Sarah Jessica Parker",
      "Few fallouts have spilled out into the open in recent years \u2013 and those that did were picked over simply because they're so rare. Actor Dwayne Johnson revealed \"a fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach moviemaking and collaborating\" with his Fast & Furious co-star Vin Diesel, in a 2018 interview.",
      "The stars of another action film, Mad Max: Fury Road, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, are reported to have filmed many of their scenes separately.",
      "And then there were the alleged tensions between Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker, who were co-stars of Sex and the City, which ran for six years. In 2018, after Parker offered condolences for Cattrall's brother's death, Cattrall responded on social media, calling Parker a \"hypocrite\" and stating, \"You are not my family. You are not my friend.\"",
      "But behind the scenes, hundreds of other spats will never see the light of day. \"Some of a publicist's best work may never be seen,\" says Daniel Bee, a publicist and brand consultant based in Los Angeles, \"because it stopped something that was wrong, or re-crafted something to a different narrative, or pointed the light in a different direction.",
      "\"The most interesting stuff I've ever done as a publicist is the stuff nobody will ever know about.\"",
      "'Powerful forces at play'",
      "Since Daniel Bee started out as an entertainment publicist in 1997, he has observed a shift in the wider industry. \"I started my career in the British media, there were 11 national newspapers competing with each other. It was a bear pit, hard work, and it was getting to know individuals via relationships.",
      "\"Now, you're up against an anonymous algorithm and accounts where you don't know who you're up against. It's harder to control than ever before.\"",
      "Certainly, social media has posed challenges for those attempting to control narratives around major films and their stars \u2013 while also heralding new forms of \"dark arts\" through which publicists can attempt to shape opinion.",
      "Dating apps could be in trouble \u2013 here's what might take their place",
      "Nasa needs saving from itself \u2013 but is this billionaire right for that job?",
      "Sneaky Britain? How our moral compasses are changing",
      "\"There has always been an army of advisors and consultants doing PR voodoo,\" says Eriq Gardner, entertainment law expert and founding partner of Puck News. \"While I'd love to say the public is media-literate and savvy enough to read between the lines to see the spin, the truth is there are a lot of powerful forces at play and sometimes a large amount of misinformation.\"",
      "So-called PR voodoo is different now that a celebrity \u2013 or their fans \u2013 can access an audience of millions with a click.",
      "While the publicists of previous eras might only have had to worry about print and broadcast platforms, smartphones and social media mean today's digital landscape is a wild west where anyone can shape their own narrative. A badly judged post or comment can damage an actor's career.",
      "But the flipside is a whole new medium in which PRs can practise their \"voodoo\".",
      "Astroturfing and ways to 'cause mischief'",
      "One of the tactics is \"astroturfing\" \u2013 or disguising an orchestrated campaign as a spontaneous up-swelling of public opinion.",
      "This works by manipulating public opinion and creating a false impression of grassroots support (hence the name) or opposition, often coordinated through social media accounts in a way that seems organic.",
      "The practice isn't new, but has been given new life with the advent of social media algorithms.",
      "\"It's deliberately planting disinformation, or twisted versions of the truth, in certain sections of social media,\" says Carla Speight, founder of the PR Mastery app. \"The aim is the halfway point of influential where they will get a bit of traction, but so that it's not too obvious \u2013 you wouldn't hire a Kardashian to do it.",
      "\"It's built up in layers,\" she continues. \"It's like playing a very sinister game of chess. You're putting all the pieces in the right places, just the right amount of mixed-up information, and then you just watch it explode.\"",
      "Although the posts might appear to be genuine public opinion, in fact it's a faked crowd \u2013 whether that's made up of bots or real people, who can be paid to coordinate their posts.",
      "\"All it takes is one or two people to create a meme and put it with the right people,\" says Ms Speight. \"It needs to appear as a trend, and then it's gone. Something is dripped here, something else over there, and when it's done well\u2026 it causes a bit of mischief.\"",
      "Reinventing an age-old tactic?",
      "But all of this is simply a new platform for an age-old trend that has been going on long before the advent of social media, according to Mr Bee. \"Undetected smear campaigns have always been a thing,\" he points out.",
      "\"Previously it would have been a publicist whispering to a diarist of a national newspaper. The issue with digital media is it's anonymous and untraceable.\"",
      "What has changed, he continues, is that audiences have become savvier. \"Whereas before, a quite subservient audience would just take what was given to them in the media, with natural scepticism, curiosity, and a greater level of information, I think people use more critical thinking.\"",
      "Eriq Gardner is less convinced: \"I'm not sure the public approaches what they read with enough scepticism.\"",
      "And yet those in the industry are often alert to it. According to Ms Speight, \"Usually, there's a distinct sort of tell, and it may be the PR thing where we have 'spidey senses' and we can sort of see it, but you're asking, 'Where has that come from? Who started that?' And when there's never a specific place to point it to, that's usually a tell-tale sign.\"",
      "The Hollywood ecosystem",
      "What's clear, though, is that, with studios providing some publications with significant advertising revenue, as well as supplying talent for special events and front covers, revelations often emerge elsewhere in the media.",
      "\"When [scandals] come out, it's usually from places outside of Hollywood,\" argues Mr Rushfield. \"The Harvey Weinstein story was broken by The New York Times and the New Yorker.\"",
      "It was The New York Times that first reported Lively's legal complaint in December. \"It's one of the few places that can afford to do that, and then everyone else jumped in so nobody was sticking their neck out.\" Baldoni filed a $250 million lawsuit against the New York Times in December, although a federal judge indicated this week that it might be dismissed.",
      "Even when bigger outlets break news about Hollywood disputes, the growing dominance of social media means that stories might not have the same cut-through they had previously.",
      "Doreen St Felix, a writer who was previously an editor on Lena Dunham's newsletter, recently wrote in The New Yorker that stories of harassment and abuse, for example, now receive a \"curdled, cynical, and exhausted reception\" \u2013 this, less than a decade after the emergence of the MeToo movement.",
      "She went on to claim that: \"The late 2010s genre of #MeToo reportage cannot thrive on today's volatile internet. Information is misinformation and vice versa. Victims are offenders and offenders are victims.\"",
      "Sometimes, however, the best way for publicists to prevent stories being amplified is by bypassing social media entirely when reacting to a scandal.",
      "\"If you give it to the press first, they don't quote as many of the comments on social media,\" says Ms Speight. \"You control the narrative completely, because the comments come afterwards.\"",
      "Mr Rushfield points out that very little of the revelations in the entertainment press comes out because someone \"uncovered\" something. \"Almost everything you read is there because somebody placed it there \u2013 somebody is dictating a story.\"",
      "What viewers want",
      "None of this industry would exist if the appetite weren't there and if the viewing public didn't want to unpick details about their lives \u2013 and rifts. And yet attitudes towards celebrity have undoubtedly changed since the advent of social media.",
      "\"It's now a two-way communication, which it never was before,\" points out Mr Bee. \"It was generally celebrities, or lawyer or government or whatever, just saying something that gets reported, and that message is conveyed. Now, you have to be prepared for a two-way conversation.\"",
      "But he thinks there are different attitudes to the media today than in the era of celebrity gossip magazines. Nodding to the UK, he continues: \"We had the Leveson Inquiry, we're about to get an ITV drama about phone hacking \u2013 it's as if the curtain has been lifted.\"",
      "As for the Lively and Baldoni lawsuits, it's not clear how these will play out \u2013 but the very fact that it has so unusually spilled into the public domain is a reminder of how well-oiled the Hollywood publicity machine is the rest of the time. And that is unlikely to change soon.",

    "summary": "The actor may not have known his wife was dead inside the home he was living in because of the disease.",
    "story": [
      "Actor Gene Hackman was alone.",
      "The two-time Academy Award winner didn't make any calls and missed meals.",
      "Medical experts say it's possible the 95-year-old, who was in declining health and suffering from advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, did not even realise his wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living.",
      "If he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act - a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died.",
      "Officials in New Mexico say Betsy Arakawa, 65, died of a rare virus about seven days before Hackman perished on 18 February of natural causes.",
      "The pair - and one of their dogs - were found dead in their Santa Fe home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through a window.",
      "Authorities, at first, said the grim discovery was \"suspicious enough\" to launch an investigation.",
      "Their remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition. Arakawa was found in a bathroom with scattered pills nearby. Hackman was found near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses. One of their three dogs was found dead in a crate.",
      "But a police investigation found no foul play.",
      "Instead, the case has shed light on the grim realities of Alzheimer's disease, which damages and destroys cells in one's brain over time - taking away memory and other important mental functions.",
      "\"It's like he was living in a reel,\" Catherine V Piersol, PhD, an occupational therapist with decades of experience in dementia care, told the BBC of how Hackman may have experienced the repeated loss of his wife.",
      "She noted patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease like the actor live in the present and are unable to both look back at moments in the past or look forward and act.",
      "\"I imagine he would be trying to wake her up and not being successful. But then [he] could have been distracted in another room because of one of the dogs or something,\" she described.",
      "Then later, he'd again notice his wife on the ground and would \"live through it again\", she said.",
      "Though no one knows how Hackman spent his last days alive, the grim nature of the possibilities were discussed by authorities and the area's medical examiner.",
      "At a press conference last week, Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico's chief medical examiner, said Arakawa died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Hackman's death was the result of significant heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor.",
      "Given Hackman's advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", Dr Jarrell said.",
      "His autopsy indicated he had not eaten recently, though he showed no signs of dehydration. Officials found no evidence that he had communicated with anyone after his wife's death and could not determine whether he was able to care for himself.",
      "Ms Piersol said patients with advanced Alzheimer's aren't able to pick up on environmental cues like light and darkness, making it harder to determine when he should eat, sleep or bathe.",
      "\"Those [cues] are oftentimes just, no longer available to people at this stage of dementia,\" she said.",
      "Dr Brendan Kelley, a neurologist who specialises in memory and cognition at UT Southwestern Medical Center, explained why Hackman may also not have been able to call authorities for help. He said Alzheimer's disease can leave patients caught between emotional discomfort and the inability to act on it.",
      "\"A person might feel worried or frightened, but at the same time they might not be capable to take the actions that you or I might normally think to do in order to alleviate that worry or concern, such as calling somebody else, or going to speak to a neighbour.\"",
      "Dr Kelley says Alzheimer's patients experience emotions like pain and sadness, and experience physical needs like hunger and thirst, it's just harder for them to identify what they are feeling.",
      "He said missing meals could also increase levels of confusion and agitation.",
      "The couple's deaths and the startling details of Hackman living in the home for a week after his wife's passing has shocked the Santa Fe area, where the couple had lived for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's just absolutely devastating,\" says Jeffery Gomez, a long-time resident of the city, who remembers seeing Hackman around town in his different cars, always with a smile on his face.",
      "His partner, Linda, said the details were triggering, explaining she cared for her elderly mother with dementia. \"Even when you have help, it's a lot,\" she said.",
      "\"We know Gene and his wife were very private people and she was probably trying to shield him from the public,\" she added, \"but the thought of doing that alone? It's a lot to shoulder.\"",
      "Laura N Gitlin, PhD, a behavioural scientist who researches ways to support caregivers told the BBC, this is becoming a common problem among caregivers.",
      "\"With the aging of a population, we also simultaneously have a shrinking of the number of people in the family, number of children, or relatives who live nearby,\" she explained.",
      "Ms Gitlin noted along with there being fewer caregivers, there is less support for these individuals on making big decisions - such as when it's time to place a loved one in a home instead of caring for them by yourself.",
      "Jeffery Gomez said he couldn't understand how no one checked in on the couple for such a long while.",

    "story": [
      "Six months ago, a viral TikTok trend made us obsessed with being very demure and very mindful - but now, modesty has taken a back seat among celebrities who have made see-through outfits all the rage on red carpets and catwalks.",
      "At the Brit Awards last week, big winner Charli XCX went full brat as she wore a sheer black dress, prompting hundreds of complaints to media watchdog Ofcom.",
      "She used one of her acceptance speeches to address the controversy of her outfit. \"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said. \"I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?\"",
      "The nearly naked look has been a talking point at other award ceremonies - including last Sunday's Oscars and the Grammys in February, when Kanye West's wife Bianca Censori dropped her coat on the red carpet to reveal an almost entirely invisible dress.",
      "The love for transparent textiles has continued at London and Paris fashion weeks, with many of the celebrities watching on also getting the memo.",
      "At Stella McCartney's Paris show, US actress and Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson wore a translucent black off-the-shoulder maxi dress with only a nude-coloured thong underneath.",
      "Rapper Ice Spice sported a black lace catsuit with a feathered coat at the show.",
      "Naked dressing was a key trend in some designers' spring/summer collections, and the theme has continued in autumn/winter looks too.",
      "As Vogue wrote in January: \"For a period of time, sheerness was few and far between, but nowadays, 'naked dressing' is commonplace every season.\"",
      "Dior's latest collection embraced see-through material and presented it in an ethereal way, with intricate detailing and gender-fluid silhouettes.",
      "Creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri described her collection as \"demonstrating how clothing is a receptacle that affirms cultural, aesthetic and social codes\".",
      "The trend divides opinion but is certainly part of a wider movement - last summer Charli XCX's definition of being a brat included wearing \"a strappy white top with no bra\".",
      "Sheer dressing is a nod to the minimalist looks of the 1990s - think transparent blouses and Kate Moss wearing a thin slip dress - and with our love for nostalgia fashion, it's no wonder it is taking off again.",
      "The trend also had a resurgence a decade ago. The \"free the nipple\" movement was everywhere in the early 2010s, with Rihanna stirring up headlines with her sheer crystal-embellished dress at the CFDA awards in 2014.",
      "Charli XCX's Brits outfit was praised by some on social media. \"Stop policing women's bodies,\" one person wrote, while another said she looked comfortable in her outfit so \"why is society judging?\"",
      "But many found it too risque for prime-time TV. Ofcom received 825 complaints  about the Brits ceremony, the majority relating to Charli's outfit and Sabrina Carpenter's eye-opening pre-watershed performance.",
      "\"Maybe think about putting this on at a time when kids ain't gonna be watching,\" one person wrote on social media.",
      "'Challenging fashion norms'",
      "Fashion stylist and CEO of clothing brand Mermaid Way, Julia Pukhalskaia, calls the choice to wear revealing dresses a \"provocative statement\", but says it's a \"way to reclaim the right to govern one's body\".",
      "The controversy around it feeds into a wider dialogue about women's rights and double standards when it comes to dress codes, she adds.",
      "Abhi Madan, creative director of fashion brand Amarra, believes the trend \"is about embracing freedom and boldness in fashion\".",
      "The idea of freeing the nipple \"isn't just about exposure - it's a movement towards body positivity and challenging conventional fashion norms\", he argues.",
      "\"Designers are now integrating sheer elements not just for shock value but to create a refined and elegant silhouette that empowers wearers.\"",
      "It seems many Hollywood stars this year were feeling empowered as chiffon, lace and tulle were in plentiful supply at the Oscars.",
      "Shock value is surely a factor for some, too, though.",
      "At Vanity Fair's Oscars afterparty, Julia Fox wore a mesh dress with only long wavy hair to cover some of her modesty.",
      "There were other interpretations of the naked dress - Megan Thee Stallion wore a green dress with strategically placed foliage and nipple coverings, while Zoe Kravitz opted to cover up the front but expose the back as a beaded mesh panel revealed her buttocks in her Saint Laurent dress.",
      "\"This year, naked dressing seemed to particularly thrive at the event,\" the New York Times noted.",
      "However, not everyone is on board. The Times fashion director Anna Murphy wrote that she's over the trend because \"it's only women who do this\".",
      "\"It is not an equal opportunities endeavour. It is, rather, a manifestation of the kind of thing that keeps this world unequal. That women's bodies are for public consumption and men's, usually, aren't,\" she wrote.",
      "Some men have been embracing the nearly naked trend, though. In 2022, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet wore striking a backless red top at Venice Film Festival, and at the 2023 Grammys Harry Styles freed the nipple in a plunge harlequin jumpsuit.",
      "It's the women who will continue to cause more of a stir on runways and red carpets - and society will still be split on whether it's redefining conventional notions of modesty in fashion, a product of misogyny, or simply seeking attention.",

    "story": [
      "No-one wants to be alone, and no job is more isolating than being a pop star.",
      "Just ask Lady Gaga.",
      "Her rise to fame in 2009-10 was unlike anything we'd seen before. One of the first pop stars to harness the power of the internet, she seemed to exist in a permanent onslaught of TMZ photos and gossip blogs.",
      "Their appetite was voracious. She wore through so many looks and sounds in the space of three years that one critic wrote she was \"speed-running Madonna's entire career\".",
      "And as her fame grew, the headlines became more unhinged. She staged a satanic ritual in a London hotel... She was secretly a hermaphrodite... She planned to saw her own leg off \"for fashion\".",
      "When she attended the 2010 MTV Awards in a dress made entirely of meat, nobody seemed to get the joke: Gaga was presenting herself as fodder for the tabloids, there to be consumed.",
      "On stage, she was an object of worship for her fans, the Little Monsters. But anyone who isn't a megalomaniac knows that that sort of adulation is a distant illusion.",
      "\"I'm alone, Brandon. Every night,\" Gaga told her stylist in the 2017 documentary, Five Foot Two.",
      "\"I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.\"",
      "Now 38, and happily engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky, Gaga admits that those years of solitude scared her.",
      "\"I think my biggest fear was doing this by myself - doing life on my own,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.\"",
      "The couple have been together since 2020, and revealed their engagement at the Venice Film Festival last September - where Gaga wore her million-dollar engagement ring in public for the first time.",
      "In person, it's dazzling, with a huge, oval-cut diamond set on a 18-karat white and rose gold diamond pav\u00e9 band.",
      "But on her other hand, Gaga sports a smaller, more understated ring, featuring a few blades of grass set in resin. It turns out that this is the really special one.",
      "\"Michael actually proposed to me with these blades of grass,\" she reveals.",
      "\"A long time ago, we were in the back yard, and he asked me, 'If I ever proposed to you, like, how do I do that?'",
      "\"And I just said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the back yard and wrap it around my finger and that will make me so happy'.\"",
      "It was a deeply romantic gesture that came tinged with sadness. Gaga's back yard in Malibu had previously played host to the wedding of her close friend, Sonja Durham, shortly before she died of cancer in 2017.",
      "\"There was so much loss, but this happy thing was happening for me,\" she recalls of Polansky's proposal.",
      "\"To get engaged at 38... I was thinking about what it took to get to this moment.\"",
      "Those feelings ultimately informed a song on her new album, Mayhem.",
      "Called (naturally) Blade of Grass, it finds the star singing about a \"lovers' kiss in a garden made of thorns\", and the promise of love in a time of darkness.",
      "She calls it a \"thank you\" to her partner. And fans might have a reason to thank him, too.",
      "Mayhem marks Gaga's full throttle return to pop, after a period where she'd been preoccupied with her film career, and spin-off albums that dabbled in jazz and the classic American songbook.",
      "Speaking to Vogue last year, the singer revealed it was her fianc\u00e9 who'd nudged her in that direction.",
      "\"He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music',\" she said.",
      "\"On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her,\" Polansky added. \"I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.\"",
      "'Angriest song'",
      "With that approach, the album goes right back to the sucker-punch sound of Gaga's early hits like Poker Face, Just Dance and Born This Way.",
      "On the latest single, Abracadabra, she even revisits the \"roma-ma-ma\" gibberish of Bad Romance \u2013 although this time there's a reference to death, as she sings, \"morta-ooh-Gaga\".",
      "In the album's artwork, her face is reflected in a broken mirror. In the videos, she squares off against earlier versions of herself.",
      "There's an overwhelming sense that the artist Stefani Germanotta is reckoning with the stage persona she created.",
      "It all comes to a head on a track called Perfect Celebrity where she sings, \"I became a notorious being\" \u2013 a lyric that, like the meat dress before it, strips away her humanity.",
      "\"That's probably the most angry song about fame I've ever written,\" she says.",
      "\"I'd created this public persona that I was truly becoming in every way - and holding the duality of that, knowing where I begin and Lady Gaga ends, was really a challenge.",
      "\"It kind of took me down.\"",
      "How did she reconcile the public and private sides of her life?",
      "\"I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being,\" she says.",
      "\"The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice.",
      "\"I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show.",
      "\"That is what it means to be Lady Gaga. It's the artist behind it all.\"",
      "In previous interviews, the musician has spoken of how she dissociated from Lady Gaga. For a time, she believed the character was responsible for all her success, and she had contributed nothing.",
      "Mayhem marks the moment where she reclaims ownership of her music, not just from \"Lady Gaga\" but from other producers and writers in her orbit.",
      "\"When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me.",

      "\"MHRA are doing everything we can to support this but absolutely will not cut any corners when it comes to the issues of critical patient safety,\" he wrote.",
      "Giving evidence to the inquiry, Mr Gove denied he had tried to pressure the MHRA in any way, or that the focus on Dyson meant resources could not be devoted to bids from other companies.",
      "\"Just imagine the situation, if you will, a minister \u2013 Matt Hancock, I, Boris Johnson \u2013 says we want to have a potentially lethal machine in hospitals deliberately so that we can meet an arbitrary deadline. It's inconceivable,\" he said.",

      "Their study compared the blood of two groups of healthy male donors in their 60s - the first had given blood three times a year for 40 years, the other only about five times in total.",
      "Subtle genetic differences not linked to a high risk of blood cancer were present in more of the frequent-donor group - but because healthier people tend to give blood, this skews the picture.",
      "With age, the cells in the body - including the blood - naturally develop mutations, which increases the risk of diseases such as cancer developing.",
      "When people donate blood, stem cells in the bone marrow make new blood cells to replace the lost blood - and this could shape the stem cells' genetic diversity.",

      "\"It's a type of mutation that is not associated with high risk of leukaemia development,\" study author Dr Hector Huerga Encabo said.",
      "And when mice were injected with these human blood stem cells in the lab, the cells were found to be good at making red blood cells - a positive sign, Dr Encabo said.",
      "Everyday things",
      "The research, published in the journal Blood, was conducted with scientists in Heidelberg and with the help of the German Red Cross blood donation centre.",
      "But the results do not prove donating blood reduces the chances of early blood cancer mutations developing.",
      "\"It might be that people who donate blood are more likely to be healthy if they're eligible and this is also reflected in their blood-cell clones,\" senior author Dominique Bonnet, who heads up a stem-cell laboratory at the Crick, said.",
      "And the research team now plans to analyse the blood of much larger numbers of people, including women.",
      "The current findings are a reminder that little everyday things - how people's environment changes - as well as their age, affects their tissues and blood, changing the stem cells, Dr Encabo said.",
      "'Healthy-donor effect'",
      "NHS Blood and Transplant said the research was \"interesting\" but further work was needed, because healthier people were more likely to donate.",
      "\"The 'healthy-donor effect' makes it difficult to study donor health generally,\" medical director Dr Lise Estcourt said.",

      "Current stocks were \"critically low\", the organisation added.",
      "Who can donate?",
      "In the UK, fit and healthy 17-65-year-olds can give blood - if they meet all the other criteria - but not if they have had cancer, an organ transplant or tested positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), among other reasons.",

      "But the at-home LED market is on the verge of becoming a massive industry - with masks and other devices retailing for anything from \u00a340 to \u00a31,500.",
      "The technology harnesses the power of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which then stimulate skin cells when they are exposed to the skin repeatedly.",
      "Mask developers make big claims that at-home LED masks can be used to treat acne scars, sun damage and fine lines - but does this stand up to scrutiny?",
      "The LED market is set to be worth \u00a3600m globally by 2032 - which is nearly double what airflow technology like the Dyson Airwrap will be worth at the same point.",
      "According to consultant dermatologist Dr Jonathan Kentley, LED technology works by causing the skin to absorb light energy, which then triggers cellular changes in a process known as photobiomodulation (PBM).",
      "\"This allows new blood vessels and skin cells to be formed, along with more collagen and elastin,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"PBM has also been used to treat acne as it has anti-inflammatory effects and reduces the amount of oil in the skin,\" he adds.",
      "A recent comprehensive study of PBM stated that more clinical trials on humans need to take place to fully understand how it actually works.",
      "US space agency Nasa first began studying the effect of LEDs in the 1990s to see if it could help in cell regeneration.",
      "Since then, medical-grade devices have been used by dermatologists \"for many years\", according to Dr Kentley.",
      "But at-home masks have only been on the retail market for about five years and cost a fraction of the medical devices.",
      "The main differences between medical devices and High Street masks are the strength of the LEDs, the number of bulbs on the device and how close they sit to the skin's surface when being used.",
      "LED therapy masks are 'visually interesting'",
      "Dr Justine Kluk, who runs her own dermatology clinic and specialises in treating acne, believes that while at-home masks \"sound promising\", mask wholesale manufacturers are \"speculating\" about their benefits.",
      "\"I don't believe anyone has run clinical trials of the LED mask at home to see if it is the same dose as a device you would use in a clinic or hospital,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"No-one is testing these devices in big enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time for us to feel really confident.",
      "\"So I believe the benefits from using one of these masks is probably very modest,\" she adds.",

      "\"People sitting watching TV wearing a red LED mask increases people's curiosity.",
      "\"Every other consultation I've had for the last six months, has involved people asking me about LED masks,\" she adds.",

      "Natalie O'Neill, 29, tells the BBC she started to use a mask \"out of curiosity to see if I would notice any difference\" and did not use it to treat an existing skin condition like acne.",
      "The skincare content creator says:  \"I noticed a change in my skin after a couple of weeks and felt it prevented breakouts really well.\"",
      "She adds that the mask has helped to \"keep my skin tone looking more even\" and faded marks on her face more quickly.",
      "O'Neill was not paid to promote a particular mask and caveats all her content on this technology by saying she uses it alongside a consistent skincare routine.",
      "\"Getting red light or LED therapy in a clinic is not immediately transferable to a mask, which a lot of consumers don't realise - I'm OK with that because I have the right expectations,\" she adds.",
      "Part of the appeal of LED masks is that they are easy to use and therefore have a low barrier to entry for potential buyers.",
      "Laurence Newman is the chief executive of CurrentBody, whose at-home LED mask is one of the world's best sellers.",
      "He started selling professional equipment to clinics more than 25 years ago and began developing an at-home LED mask in 2009, bringing out the company's first device just under 10 years later.",
      "\"We see that people use it for 10 minutes and get an instant glow afterwards,\" he tells the BBC.",

      "'This is a lot of money to spend'",

      "A report by drugs firm GSK - seen by the BBC - shows it learned in 2003 of a link between the medicines, known as dopamine agonist drugs, and what it described as \"deviant\" sexual behaviour. It cited a case of a man who had sexually assaulted a child while taking the drug for Parkinson's.",
      "While there is no explicit reference to this side effect in patient leaflets, the UK medicines regulator told us there was a general warning about increased libido and harmful behaviour. GSK says a risk of \"altered\" sexual interest is also referred to in the leaflets.",

      "The condition persisted after giving birth and she was prescribed the dopamine agonist drug Ropinirole. She says she was not warned by doctors of any side effects. It initially worked wonders for her RLS, she says, but after a year or so she began feeling unprecedented sexual urges.",
      "\"The only way I could describe it is it was just deviant,\" she tells us - using that word without any knowledge of the GSK research which had established a link with such behaviour.",

A \"common\" side effect of any medicine is considered to only affect 1% of people who take it, according to the NHS.",
      "The drugs work by mimicking the behaviour of dopamine, a natural chemical in our brains which helps regulate movement. It is known as the \"happy hormone\" because it is activated when something is pleasurable or we feel rewarded.",

      "The cases of what the GSK report from 2003 described as \"deviant behaviour\"  involved two men who were prescribed Ropinirole for Parkinson's disease. In one, a 63-year-old-man sexually assaulted a seven-year-old girl, leading to a custodial sentence.",
      "The documents said the perpetrator's libido had increased significantly from the start of his treatment with Ropinirole and his \"libido problem subsequently resolved\" after his dose was reduced.",
      "In the second case, a 45-year-old man carried out \"uncontrolled acts of exhibitionism and indecent behaviour\". His sex drive was reported to have increased prior to being prescribed Ropinirole but his urges \"intensified\" after the treatment.",

      "Like Terry, the overwhelming majority of people say they would like to die at home,  Office for National Statistics figures suggest, but in reality just over a quarter do. Instead, the most common place of death is in hospital.",
      "It is estimated that at least three-quarters of the 650,000 people who die every year in the UK require palliative care. But a recent report by end-of-life charity Marie Curie suggested more than a fifth of those who need it in England and Wales do not receive any.",

      "On top of the financial pressures felt by the rest of the NHS, experts say that a combination of demographic changes, different parts of the system acting in isolation and cash being spent in the wrong places have all brought the palliative care system to this point.",
      "And the problems are becoming more acute each year. For the 30 years up to 2011, the number of people dying in the UK was falling but that has changed as the people born during the boom in births following World War Two have grown old. Over the next decade, the number of deaths a year is expected to increase by 12%.",
      "The difficulties faced by hospices",
      "Where it works well, palliative care makes all the difference to those who use it. Hospices are a major provider of care, supporting 300,000 people a year - mainly in the community, not just inside their own buildings, contrary to popular belief.",
      "St Christopher's Hospice in south London is helping more than 1,700 people with terminal illnesses across five London boroughs. It receives referrals from GPs, district nursing teams and hospitals.",
      "Palliative care nurse Grace Larder says she provides many types of support to her patients, who have a range of conditions from motor neurone disease and Parkinson's to liver failure. This includes pain control and care for other physical problems, along with helping them with psychological and financial needs.",
      "\"We really develop relationships with people,\" she says. \"There's one patient I've been working with for nearly two years. You want to do your best.\"",
      "Most people she cares for tell her that they want to die at home, she says \u2013 but that's only possible if they get the right care.",
      "But many hospice services are in financial difficulties. Only around a third of St Christopher's funding comes from the NHS; the rest comes from fundraising and charitable donations.",
      "Any drugs the hospice provides has to come from their own funds too so they try to anticipate what their patients will need in advance and work with the patient's GP to have them prescribed on the NHS.",
      "A parliamentary report warned the current approach to funding is not sustainable.",
      "\"What other health service has to get by like that?\" says Helen King, who manages the team of nurses at St Christopher's. She points out that they are fortunate to have an affluent local community that donates generously.",
      "\"[But] the fact remains we get more money from our shops - from selling second-hand clothing - than we do from the government.\"",
      "Training is 'virtually non-existent'",
      "The government has recognised there is a problem and provided an extra \u00a3100m of funding this year to the sector \u2013 although hospice services have said this will mostly go on the rising costs they are facing.",
      "As for hospitals offering palliative care, audits show that four in 10 hospitals, for example, do not have specialist services available seven days a week - despite this having been set as a national standard in 2004.",
      "In practice, that means there is no specialist palliative care support from doctors or nurses available during evenings and weekends either in person or on-call, says Dr Clarke. \"You would never have that for other specialities like cardiology or renal so why should it happen for palliative care?\"",
      "The 'Time Lords' racing to tackle the threat of GPS jamming",
      "In the US, DEI is under attack. But under a different name, it might live on",
      "After White House clash, Starmer faces decision about who he can trust",
      "This is compounded by the fact that palliative care training is \"virtually non-existent\" for the other staff who pick up the burden, who often lack the confidence to speak to patients and families about dying and prescribe the right drugs, she says.",
      "\"We will come into work and find patients really suffering \u2013 in pain, breathless, agitated or with nausea and vomiting. It is hard to over-state how lamentably badly-resourced palliative care services are.\"",
      "Meanwhile, in the community, GPs are left to pick up the pieces. But Dr Catherine Millington-Sanders from the Royal College of General Practicioners says that, given an \"unrelenting workload\" and staffing shortages, it is difficult to provide the care patients need, particularly home visits.",
      "\"Families and unpaid carers bear the brunt,\" she says.",
      "Money would help - but it won't fix it",
      "So what is the solution? More money would help, but it wouldn't fix everything.",
      "Earlier this year the Health Economics Unit and Nuffield Trust think-tank found that plenty was being spent on people in the final year of their life. Nearly \u00a312bn was going on their healthcare, the report found \u2013 that works out at in excess of \u00a318,000 per person for everyone who dies.",
      "But the overwhelming majority of that \u00a312bn \u2013 85% - goes on hospitals and emergency care, rather than support in the community.",
      "It is, essentially, a false economy, as support in hospital tends to be more expensive.",
      "Dr Sam Royston, executive director of research at the charity, says these findings go a long way to explaining why \"too many people are dying in places where they don't want or need to be\".",
      "He adds: \"There must be a clear long-term ambition for all UK governments to shift health expenditure on people at the end of life from hospital to community.\"",
      "According to Dr Royston, just shifting 20% of the money spent caring for dying people in hospital would be transformative for community services as it would double current spending.",
      "Is better coordination the solution?",
      "What would a better system look like? First of all, more could be done to identify people's needs before they are admitted to hospital, Dr Royston believes.",
      "He points to a service in Bradford called React which works in emergency departments to identify and assess patients and diverting them towards teams in the community who can support them instead.",
      "A study found it reduced average unplanned bed days in patients' final year of life from 38 to 18.",
      "But to reduce the number of people going to hospital in the first place, there needs to be greater co-ordination of services too, given the complexity of support and variety of providers, says Dr Cox.",
      "She says there need to be electronic records that detail the wishes of people who are at the end of life that health and care staff can access: \"These electronic systems are available in some areas but not others,\" she says.",
      "She also argues providing a central hub or phone line to help people navigate and coordinate care would be transformational.",
      "She points to a system that has been set up in Cambridgeshire between a local hospice service, NHS 111 and the local ambulance service. It provides people at the end of their life with access to a specialist nurse 24 hours a day, simply by calling the NHS 111 advice line.",
      "\"A service like this can make a huge difference, providing equipment, responsive visits as well as telephone advice and signposting to other services,\" adds Dr Cox.",
      "And better training for non-specialist staff is also essential, Dr Cox and Dr Clarke agree.",
      "\"My utopia would be that you don't actually need lots of specialist palliative care services because everybody is so good at supporting patients at the end of life,\" adds Dr Clarke.",
      "\"If we were able to support people in the community properly, it would be better for them and would actually cost the NHS less.\"",
      "She adds: \"We need to prioritise this - you only die once.\"",

      "Disability charity Scope said a \"complex, adversarial and difficult to navigate\" system contributed to the rejections.",
      "With widespread benefits reform proposals expected within weeks, Prime Minister Keir Starmer this week called the current system \"unsustainable, indefensible and unfair\".",
      "The conditions most likely to result in a refused claim were those that may be managed more successfully by an adult than a child, like diabetes or asthma, experts said.",
      "But among those to have had claims rejected since PIP's introduction in 2013 are thousands living with life-changing conditions including cancer, blindness, psychosis, deafness and epilepsy.",
      "The 124,000 young people affected since then include Holly Crouch, who said the decision by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had left her feeling \"like a burden\" when \"nothing changed but my age\".",

      "\"I'll never feel like an adult as I can't do things everyone else is able to, like drive or work,\" she said. \"My parents even have to be there when I shower or boil a kettle as I could have a seizure.",
      "\"I understand there could be changes to conditions, but that's what reviews are for - you shouldn't just have your money stopped at 16 when you are not old enough for the process.\"",

      "\u2022 Points are awarded based on the individual's abilities and what help they need",
      "\u2022 Those points are added up to determine whether the threshold for a claim is met",

    "story": [
      "Councils are to be given greater powers to seize land, under government plans to boost housebuilding.",
      "The measure is part of the flagship Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which has been introduced in Parliament and aims to speed up building.",
      "Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook said he wanted greater use of compulsory purchase orders (CPOs), which allow public authorities to acquire land without the consent of the owner.",
      "Currently, councils buying sites through CPOs must factor in the \"hope value\" - the potential value if planning permission for development is secured  - and this is set to be axed to allow land to be bought at a lower price.",
      "However, rural campaign groups raised concerns farmers could be forced to sell at knock-down prices and that green spaces could be lost.",
      "Victoria Vyvan, president of the Country Land and Business Association said the \"expensive, slow and bureaucratic planning system\" was what was preventing land sales by her members, who \"strongly believe that a small number of homes should be built in a large number of villages\".",
      "She added: \"In removing hope value from compulsory purchases, the government wants farmers to pay for a housing crisis they didn't create.",
      "\"We doubt house builders contracted by councils will be taking a lower profit, so once again farmers will be the only part of the supply chain to lose out.\"",
      "Paul Miner, head of planning and policy at CPRE, the countryside charity, said the group supported the use of CPOs to build genuinely affordable homes on previously developed land.",

      "New homes fall again in government's first six months",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Labour would build on green belt to boost housing",
      "Responding to such fears, Pennycook told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was \"somewhat mystified\" by this interpretation, saying CPOs would be used \"far more often\" for regenerating brownfield - or previously developed - land.",
      "\"We think it's right these powers are more widely used and it will be for local authorities to make the decisions about what land is appropriate for those powers to be used on,\" he added.",
      "A requirement for the secretary of state to sign off on CPOs will be removed \"in certain instances\", he said, adding that the legislation would be \"transformative\" in unlocking construction for new homes, roads, rail and renewable energy projects.",
      "The bill also aims streamline the planning process, with more decisions made directly by officers rather than councillors.",
      "However, councils have raised concerns this could mean they will be shut out of the democratic planning process.",
      "Richard Clewer, housing and planning spokesperson at the Country Councils Network, said he welcomed changes to CPOs as a \"useful tool\".",
      "However, he said changes to the planning process could \"dilute and bypass the role of councillors\", particularly with rural developments where a few new homes could make a significant impact.",
      "Defending the plans, Pennycook said \"expert planning officers\" would support elected councillors with technical detail and allow councillors to focus on larger, more controversial applications.",
      "The government has promised to build 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years, with the pledge key to boosting economic growth.",
      "However, the number of new homes continued to fall during the first six months that Labour was in power, with the construction industry warning the country does not have enough workers to deliver on the target.",

      "Labour MP Sarah Owen, who chairs the Women and Equalities Committee, has been calling for this right to be extended in cases where miscarriages take place before 24 weeks.",
      "Speaking in the House of Commons, Madders said: \"Bereavement is not an illness, it's not a holiday and it does need its own special category.\"",
      "He added: \"I am grateful to the work of the Women and Equalities Committee for raising the important issue of miscarriage leave.",
      "\"The loss of a baby at any stage is an incredibly difficult personal experience and the inquiry they conducted demonstrated a clear gap in support for those who experience pregnancy loss and need time to recover and grieve.\"",
      "He said Owen had shown \"great bravery\" in speaking about her own experience of having a miscarriage.",
      "In 2021, Owen told MPs that after her own miscarriage she felt physically better in a few days but had \"all the classic signs\" of grieving.",
      "\"I could not eat, I could not sleep. I really did not hold much hope that life would ever get brighter,\" she said.",

      "Owen said she was \"so pleased\" to hear the minister's commitment.",

      "Vicki Robinson, CEO of the Miscarriage Association, said: \"We are extremely pleased to see, that for the first time ever, those experiencing pre-24-week pregnancy loss will be officially recognised in bereavement leave legislation.",
      "\"While we had been seeking paid leave, and the present commitment appears to be for unpaid leave, it nevertheless represents a significant step forward and provides long-overdue validation that this type of loss can be experienced as a bereavement like any other.\"",

      "The bill currently gives workers the right to paternity leave from day one of their employment, instead of the current 26 weeks.",

      "She said that was not long enough, adding that the UK had \"the worst\" paternity leave entitlement in the whole of the EU.",
      "Madders said the government would be holding a review of the parental leave system, which would be separate from the bill.",

      "But Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie, who drafted the bill, said the decision \"flies in the face of the climate ambitions that this government is supposed to have\".",

      "But Martin said: \"I'm going to introduce a Heat in Buildings Bill when I can be satisfied that those interventions within it will decrease fuel poverty at the same time as decarbonising houses.\"",

      "He added: \"This is yet another example of the SNP's climate delays, which have grown more and more worrying over the last year.",
      "\"It will also delay the huge benefit households need to see from ending their reliance on fossil fuels and their volatile prices.\"",
      "WWF Scotland also criticised the move and questioned the logic behind it.",
      "Io Hadjicosta, the charity's climate and energy policy manager, said: \"This announcement is deeply concerning and is yet another case of the Scottish government flip flopping when it comes to tackling the climate emergency.",
      "\"Reducing emissions from Scotland's housing stock by improving insulation and fitting renewable heat pumps would lift people out of fuel poverty - not increase it.",
      "\"By delaying the introduction of the Heat in Buildings Bill further all the government is doing is condemning the poorest in our society to increasingly high fossil fuel costs and damp, unhealthy homes.\"",
      "Last April the Scottish government confirmed it would scrap its annual and interim targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "It said they would be replaced with a system measuring emissions every five years.",
      "In a statement to the Scottish parliament, Energy Secretary Mairi McAllan accepted that the target of cutting emissions by 75% by 2030 was out of reach.",
      "But she told MSPs the government must act to chart a course reach net zero by 2045 at a pace and scale which was feasible, fair and just.",
      "The Heat in Buildings Bill was once described to me as \"game changing\" legislation designed to reduce the massive carbon footprint that comes from heating our homes.",
      "Our gas boilers are the main culprit; lots of individual devices inefficiently burning fossil fuels to create the heat.",
      "At least a million of them needed to be replaced by 2030 to meet the Scottish government's now abandoned interim climate change targets.",
      "The legislation would have meant anyone buying a home would have had to change to a green heating system \u2013 like a heat pump \u2013 within, say, two years of the sale being completed. The exact time frame had not been decided.",
      "But with the 2030 target now scrapped, and a much delayed energy strategy still not forthcoming, the pressure is off.",
      "Although the plan could be revived in the future it is pretty clear, from the tone of the ministerial statement, that something major would have to change for that to happen."

      "Initial analysis estimates both bill discounts and community funds could see a total additional cost of between \u00a31-2 a year for the average customer over 10 years.",

      "The idea of giving people living near new pylons money off their energy bills was also proposed under the previous Conservative government.",

      "The project was overseen by cabinet office officials and involved the MHRA, which helped draw up initial specifications and squeezed an approval process that would usually take 18-24 months into just weeks.",
      "A number of major companies were involved, including the carmakers Ford and McLaren, and the electronics giant Dyson.",
      "At the time, the company's founder Sir James Dyson held a number of telephone conversations with government officials, including the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson.",
      "The Covid inquiry was shown WhatsApp messages then sent between ministers and government advisers suggesting Sir James was concerned about the pace of project.",
      "On 20 March 2020, Mr Johnson wrote that \"Dyson [was] freaking\" and called for \"Action this day\".",
      "Minutes later ex health secretary Matt Hancock replied, \"I have also received the same. I will talk to Dyson and Michael [Gove] and sort it.\"",
      "Asked about the deal at the inquiry, the government's then chief commercial officer, Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, said it was the only example he could recall in the pandemic where he was asked to put a contract in place \"against commercial guidance\".",
      "Five days later, on 25 March, Boris Johnson wrote another WhatsApp message to the same group saying that: \"Dyson has a ventilator ready to go\u2026 It's safe, effective and loses less oxygen. Rhys Williams has blocked it under the misapprehension that oxygen passes through the motor. That is total b****cks.\"",
      "He accused officials of \"fiddling while Rome burns\" and added: \"Sorry but I'm on a mission. Dyson knows what he's doing and won't risk his global brand reputation delivering dodgy ventilators.\"",
      "'Totally unrealistic'",
      "Sir Gareth said, at that point, the Dyson prototype pushed air from a fan directly into the lungs of patients, something that could cause safety concerns.",
      "The Dyson team did subsequently \"fix\" that part of the design, he added.",
      "Later on 25 March, Sir Gareth wrote to Sir John Manzoni, a top civil servant in the cabinet office, saying that Michael Gove was \"INSISTENT we place an order with Dyson\u2026 contingent on passing clinical and passing MHRA approvals.\"",
      "A provisional \u00a3100,000 order was then placed for the Dyson prototypes, and an email from Michael Gove's private office set out a number of actions that needed be taken quickly including: \"The MHRA and Sir Gareth Rhys Williams to ensure by the end of Friday, [that] the Dyson product has been tested and approved by MHRA\u2026 [and] the final product has started to be manufactured.\"",
      "The following day Graeme Tunbridge, the director of devices for the MHRA, wrote to colleagues warning that Michael Gove was \"keen to press forward with Dyson's proposal to a timescale that is totally unrealistic.\"",
      "He added that Mr Gove \"did not appreciate the level of risk involved in the manufacture and use of ventilators\" and \"wanted to circumvent the expedited regulatory process that has been put in place\".",
      "\"MHRA are doing everything we can to support this but absolutely will not cut any corners when it comes to the issues of critical patient safety,\" he wrote.",
      "Giving evidence to the inquiry, Mr Gove denied he had tried to pressure the MHRA in any way, or that the focus on Dyson meant resources could not be devoted to bids from other companies.",
      "\"Just imagine the situation, if you will, a minister \u2013 Matt Hancock, I, Boris Johnson \u2013 says we want to have a potentially lethal machine in hospitals deliberately so that we can meet an arbitrary deadline. It's inconceivable,\" he said.",
      "The former minister said that the Dyson prototype ultimately \"did not get through testing\" and \"whenever confronted with brute facts about safety or otherwise, I would always accept them.\"",
      "He denied that his private office was instructing the regulator to approve the device saying the language used was simply \"shorthand for 'we would hope that it had been tested and if tested satisfactorily [then] approved by the MHRA to that timescale'\".",
      "In the end the government said the Ventilator Challenge helped scale up the production of three existing models, and approved one new design by the medical devices firm Penlon.",
      "In total, an extra 14,000 devices were delivered over three months, fewer than the government originally planned for as doctors identified other ways of treating the most severe Covid cases.",
      "In a statement, Dyson said Sir James Dyson responded to a personal call from Boris Johnson to \"develop and make a medical-grade ventilator in 30 days during the national emergency\".",
      "\"Far from receiving any commercial benefit, there was significant commercial cost to Dyson which diverted 450 engineers away from commercial projects,\" added a company spokesperson.",
      "\"Uniquely amongst the many businesses involved, [Sir] James Dyson did not seek payment for any of the \u00a320m the company spent on the project \u2013 rather this was its contribution to the national effort to save lives.\""

    "story": [
      "The body advising judges on criminal sentences has hit back at the justice secretary's call for it to scrap new guidance on sentencing offenders from ethnic monitories.",
      "The Sentencing Council said ministers from both major parties or their representatives had known about the plans since 2022 and did not object.",
      "It comes after Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood last week wrote to the council urging it to rethink guidance directing judges to review the lives of offenders from ethnic minority and other backgrounds before deciding on a punishment.",
      "Opposition politicians had claimed the changes amounted to a \"two-tier justice\" system.",
      "Lord Justice William Davis, the chairman of the council, said that Mahmood's officials were fully briefed on the plans that had been three years in the making.",
      "He said that ministers could not \"dictate\" sentencing and he would have to take legal advice on Mahmood's powers over the council's work.",
      "This raises the bizarre possibility that the body advising judges on how to judge might decide to go to court for a ruling on whether the minister overseeing justice has any power to tell judges what to do.",
      "The row was triggered after the Sentencing Council, which advises judges and magistrates on the complexities of prison terms and community punishments, issued new guidance for England and Wales on when a court should order a pre-sentence report into an offender's life.",
      "These reports do not tie the hands of judges but they often provide the court with a detailed insight into why an individual fell into crime, their risk of reoffending and the chances for rehabilitation outside of jail.",
      "The new guidelines told judges to order a pre-sentence report if the offender is from a minority background, facing the possibility of jail for the first time, a woman or pregnant.",
      "It also urged them to always consider a report in a wider range of circumstances, including where an offender has an addiction, is transgender, or has learning difficulties.",
      "Minister threatens law change after 'two-tier' row",
      "Call for ministers to overrule 'two-tier' sentencing changes",
      "More funding for judges to tackle record court delays",
      "Writing to the Sentencing Council last week, Mahmood said she objected to the new guideline, saying: \"As someone who is from an ethnic minority background myself, I do not stand for any differential treatment before the law.\"",
      "That came after the shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick described the plan as \"two-tier\" justice that would disadvantage white offenders.",
      "But in a six-page letter to Mahmood, the Sentencing Council chair said the new guidance aimed to correct disparities and had been drawn up after long discussions over how particular types of offenders were being treated differently to others.",
      "Lord Justice Davis said that people from ethnic minorities were receiving longer sentences and the aim was to ensure that punishments were more consistent, regardless of background.",
      "He said Conservative and Labour ministers, as well as their their officials, had at least 15 opportunities over three years to object to the plan",
      "\"I have seen it suggested that the guideline instructs sentencers to impose a more lenient sentence on those from ethnic minorities than white offenders,\" he said. \"Plainly that suggestion is completely wrong.\"",
      "The senior judge said ministerial representative had been at all 15 meetings where the changes was discussed between July 2022 and January 2025.",
      "The public consultation on the plans had set out the proposals and Conservative ministers, then in power, had welcomed the \"fuller guidance\".",
      "\"No concern was expressed about the term now under debate,\" said Lord Justice Davis.",
      "Only eight of 150 responses to the public consultation had objected to the explicit reference to ethnic minorities.",
      "The judge said: \"At no stage did the Lord Chancellor's representative express any concern or reservation about the term now under debate.",
      "\"The walk-through of the guideline with officials from the Ministry of Justice took place on Monday 3 March. Again no concern was expressed about the relevant term.\"",
      "While ministers have an exceptional power to intervene in the Sentencing Council's decisions, this has never been used in a situation where new guidance had been published and the government had already been extensively consulted and had not objected.",
      "\"I shall have to take legal advice as to whether the power... applies in those circumstances,\" said the judge.",
      "He continued: \"I do not accept the premise of your objection to the relevant part of the list of cohorts for whom a pre-sentence report will normally be considered necessary.",
      "\"In criminal proceedings where the offender is the subject of prosecution by the state, the state should not determine the sentence imposed on an individual offender.",
      "\"If sentencing guidelines of whatever kind were to be dictated in any way by Ministers of the Crown, this principle would be breached.\""

      "The Great Yarmouth MP was suspended by Reform and referred to the police over accusations he made threats of violence against the party's chairman. The Metropolitan Police has confirmed they are assessing an allegation of \"verbal threats\".",
      "There have also been allegations of bullying in Lowe's offices, which are being investigated by the lawyer hired by the party.",

      "On Sunday, the lawyer, a KC who has not been named by the party but whose credentials have been verified by the BBC, said: \"I have seen a number of statements made by Mr Lowe MP which are attributed to me and which describe my reactions to the process conducted by the party into the allegations made against both Mr Lowe MP and his constituency manager.",
      "\"I find myself in the unfortunate and regrettable position of having to make this statement to correct the record.\"",

      "'No credible evidence against me'",
      "On Friday, Lowe took issue with a statement issued by Reform, which set out that there would be an independent investigation into what had happened.",

      "\"She stated that this has been issued before the investigation has even started.",

      "\"Ever since this malicious attack on my reputation was launched, all I have asked for from both Reform and the KC is credible evidence against me. None has been provided. It still hasn't,\" he said.",
      "\"The KC has said she has been 'chasing' for that. I have received nothing. Because there is no credible evidence against me.\"",
      "He added: \"I have spoken with the KC at length, on the phone and through message. I've got to know her over the last week, and she has been very helpful, and is a charming lady who is trying to do her job in the very difficult position that Reform has put her in.\"",
      "'You have to stand up to bullies'",
      "He accused the party of an \"outright lie\" in claiming he had not co-operated with the investigation, a claim Reform made in a statement on Friday evening.",
      "\"I have been in discussions with my legal team this afternoon, and this will be followed by legal action in due course,\" Lowe told the BBC.",
      "\"I will not have my name dragged through the mud as part of a political assassination because I dared to question Nigel Farage. You have to stand up to bullies, and I am doing exactly that.\"",
      "He said the lawyer had told him on Friday night: \"I advised that you should simply say that the party was precipitous to state that these allegations had been made without also saying that the party has commissioned an independent investigation and the investigation has not yet got underway to look at all the evidence and evaluate its veracity.\"",
      "Lowe's suspension came after the Daily Mail published an interview with Lowe where he said Reform under Nigel Farage's leadership remained a \"protest party led by the Messiah\".",
      "Reform has removed the whip from Lowe, meaning he now sits as an independent MP.",
      "Reform spokeswoman Ann Widdecombe said the row was \"temporarily damaging\" to the party - but \"not damaging in the long term\".",

      "The family are from the Kharkiv region of eastern Ukraine, close to the Russian border, and had left their seven-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter with Ivan's parents while they found a suitable home for them to live.",
      "The parents - who came to the UK in May 2023 as strawberry pickers on seasonal worker visas - had planned to act as sponsors for their children under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which allows people in the UK to host those fleeing the war.",
      "Originally living in a caravan, it was several months before they found a family home to rent.",
      "But in February last year - without warning - the previous Conservative government changed eligibility rules so only British or Irish citizens or those with the right to live in the UK permanently could act as sponsors.",

      "\"I cannot explain that feeling,\" says Ivan. \"It was the best feeling in the world.\"",

      "Abramovich sold Chelsea in 2022, after he was sanctioned by the UK government over Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The \u00a32.5bn raised was meant to be used for humanitarian causes linked to the Ukraine war but it remains frozen in a UK bank account.",
      "Labour ministers are coming under increasing pressure to meet Abramovich's representatives or the members of the foundation that was set up to manage the funds.",

      "Sources close to the foundation said there was a deadlock and a political decision by a minister is needed to negotiate and sign off an agreement that can break the impasse.",
      "One source said: \"For three years, the government has been saying it's been working very hard to release the money. But they are not having meetings with the foundation. There has been no meeting with a minister since Labour took over, for example.\"",
      "The BBC understands the FCDO has acknowledged a request for a meeting between the foundation's board and Foreign Secretary David Lammy.",
      "Abramovich's representatives did not wish to comment, but those with knowledge of the situation acknowledged little contact or progress had been made on releasing the funds under the four prime ministers to have held power since the sale of the club.",
      "The issue has taken on new urgency after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced that part of the UK's overseas aid budget was being diverted to defence. In 2024/25, the UK is sending \u00a3282m in aid to Ukraine.",

      "Alison Griffin, of charity Save the Children, said: \"This money has been sitting gathering dust - and interest - when it could and should have been spent helping the children of Ukraine cope with the horrors of a full-scale war that has lasted over three years.\"",
      "The delay in releasing the funds centres on a disagreement between the UK government and Abramovich's lawyers.",
      "Abramovich was granted a special licence to sell Chelsea, providing he could prove he would not benefit from the sale.",
      "At the time, Abramovich said proceeds from the sale would be donated via a foundation \"for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine\", and his position has not changed.",
      "Abramovich - a Russian billionaire who made his fortune in oil and gas - cannot access the \u00a32.5bn under UK sanctions but the money still legally belongs to him.",

      "Sources said Abramovich's lawyers have insisted on using the money for all victims of the war in Ukraine including those outside the country, but the UK government has pushed back and argued the funds should only be spent on humanitarian efforts inside the war-torn country.",

      "The BBC understands the former foreign secretary believed a workable solution was in progress and a statement of intent about how the funds would be used was being drawn up by the foundation.",

      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to \"give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "That means no big policy announcements are made on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand.",
      "With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing.",
      "The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029/30 financial year, has been wiped out.",

      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",

In political circles it's long been common to find criticisms of Sir Keir Starmer for, frankly, being a bit dull, and not willing to play the minute-by-minute political game. But with Trump in the White House stoking drama the PM's colleagues believe his steadiness has become an asset.",

A senior government source says: \"The global crisis means people looking at us again, and the government has been making an argument that people are responding to: that we have got their backs.\"",
      "But aligning yourself with an American president doesn't always work out. Tony Blair's chinos weren't the only thing that became uncomfortable about his relationship with George W Bush.",

First up - perhaps not a box-office hit - they'll be looking at making the Whitehall machine work better, including making it easier to get rid of civil servants.",
      "Ministers tell me Downing Street is being run more effectively than before Christmas and has a clearer sense of direction, after early embarrassment over being far less prepared than promised.",
      "Sir Keir chairs regular meetings with individual cabinet ministers in charge of the government's \"missions\". I'm told he \"cross-examines\" them and their officials - and if their answers aren't up to snuff, they get called in for another meeting. \"He is a very nice man, but he is a hard man too,\" one of them confides.",
      "As well as slimming down parts of the civil service, there'll be more on the government's plans to cut billions off the welfare bill. Labour will argue it's for good reason, to help people stuck on benefits - while critics will say it's a way for the government to save money off the backs of some of the most vulnerable people in the country.",
      "On Thursday, the prime minister is expected to make his own speech in an attempt to weave it all together into a grand narrative about safety abroad and at home. One government source said the last few weeks had galvanised Sir Keir's thinking on this: when things are uncertain on the international stage, \"everything feels a bit wobbly\" and domestic security is amplified: you look around and feel your job isn't secure, your street isn't safe.",
      "This thinking has been a long time coming. \"Security\" was a word and concept used by Reeves and Sir Keir in opposition - but recently he's been making a more ideological argument than those close to him are used to hearing.",
      "As well as making the case that what happens around the world is inextricably linked to what happens at home, he holds that the old international consensus among Western leaders has failed for millions of voters.",
      "That argument was crystallised into a long memo he sent to his cabinet ministers and political team in the middle of February. In it he wrote: \"The government's challenge was to shape this new era. Not to defend institutions that are broken or old ideas that have failed, but to be the voice of working people who more than anything want security in their lives, and a country that is on the up again.\"",
      "He wrote that politicians were wrong to think markets had solutions for almost everything. \"We were cowed by the market - we came to act as if it always knew best and the state should sit it out.\"",
      "He also said governments had failed on immigration, failed to understand the public's concerns and also - to tell the truth. \"We ended up treating all immigration as an untrammelled good. Somehow, politics ended up being too scared to say what is obvious - that some people are genuine refugees and some aren't; that people coming here to work can be a positive, but that an island nation needs to control its borders.\"",
      "Some extracts from the letter have been revealed before. But what is notable, reading the whole document, is the prime minister closes his letter to colleagues with a call to provide \"security\" for the country, alongside renewing public services. He writes: \"Now is our moment to be bigger and bolder - to put pedal on metal on wholescale reform and change our politics and our country. Security and renewal are our twin tasks - we must now deliver them.\"",
      "You'll hear more of that argument from ministers in the coming days - we had a glimpse of it in the studio last Sunday morning too.",
      "The profound uncertainty Donald Trump's arrival in the White House has given the prime minister a moment to step into the spotlight on the world stage.",
      "And his government is now much more overtly weaving an argument that working to establish security round the world is fundamentally connected to sorting out security at home.",
      "There is a reason why, fresh from all the diplomatic handshakes, Sir Keir was back in the more familiar hi-vis and hard hat announcing defence jobs in Belfast.",
      "No 10 wants you to see and believe that crisis abroad can mean opportunity at home. This spasm in global security has given a prime minister sometimes accused of being a blank page a clearer story to tell.",
      "But in the end, for any prime minister, it is what happens on home turf, not foreign adventures that matter the most. A sceptical public will take a lot of convincing to believe government can improve their situation \u2013 make it easier to manage the bills, buy a house, or for their kids to find a decent job.",
      "As as a senior figure in the Labour movement concludes, \"he likes the statesman role but the bottom line is, change in people's lives will be the decider.\"",

    "summary": "President Macron has aired the idea that France's deterrence force could be used to defend of other European countries.",
    "story": [
      "So in the end Charles de Gaulle was right.",
      "As president of France in the 1960s, it was he who launched the policy of French strategic independence.",
      "Of course, he said, Americans were more our friends than Russians are. But the US too had interests. And one day their interests would clash with ours.",
      "In the world of today, his warnings have never seemed more clairvoyant.",
      "From his principle of superpower detachment, de Gaulle conjured the notion of France's sovereign nuclear deterrent \u2013 whose existence is now at the centre of debates over European security.",
      "France and the UK are the only two countries on the European continent which have nuclear weapons. Currently France has just short of 300 nuclear warheads, which can be fired from France-based aircraft or from submarines.",
      "The UK has about 250. The big difference is that the French arsenal is sovereign \u2013 i.e. developed entirely by France \u2013 whereas the UK relies on US technical input.",
      "On Wednesday President Emmanuel Macron aired the idea that France's deterrence force (force de frappe) could \u2013 in this highly uncertain new era - be associated with the defence of other European countries.",
      "His suggestion drew outrage from politicians of the hard right and left, who say that France is considering \"sharing\" its nuclear arsenal.",
      "That \u2013 according to government officials as well as defence experts \u2013 is a falsification of the argument. Nothing is to be \"shared\".",
      "According to Defence Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, the nuclear deterrent \"is French and will remain French \u2013 from its conception to its production to its operation, under a decision of the president.\"",
      "What is under discussion is not more fingers on the nuclear button. It is whether France's nuclear protection can be explicitly extended to include other European countries.",
      "Until now French nuclear doctrine has been built around the threat of a massive nuclear response if the president thought the \"vital interests\" of France were at stake.",
      "The limits of these \"vital interests\" have always been left deliberately vague \u2013 ambiguity and credibility being the two watchwords of nuclear deterrence.",
      "In fact French presidents going back to de Gaulle himself have all hinted that some European countries might de facto already be under the umbrella. In 1964 de Gaulle said that France would consider itself threatened if, for example, the USSR attacked Germany.",
      "So in one way there is nothing new in Macron suggesting a European dimension to France's deterrent.",
      "What is new, according to defence analysts, is that for the first time other European countries are also asking for it.",
      "\"In the past when France has made overtures [about extending nuclear protection], other countries were reluctant to respond,\" says Pierre Haroche of the Catholic University of Lille.",
      "\"They didn't want to send out the signal that they did not have complete faith in the US and Nato.\"",
      "\"But Trump has clarified the debate,\" Mr Laroche says. \"It's not that the Americans are talking of removing their nuclear deterrent \u2013 let's be clear, that does not seem to be on the table right now.\"",
      "\"But the credibility of US nuclear dissuasion is not what it was. That has opened the debate, and led the Germans to look more favourably on the idea of coming under a French and/or British umbrella.\"",
      "Last month the likely next German chancellor Friedrich Merz surprised the country's partners by saying it might be the moment for discussion with Paris and London on the subject.",
      "How a French or Franco-British European nuclear deterrent might operate is still far from clear.",
      "According to Mr Haroche, one option might be to position French nuclear-armed planes in other countries, such as Germany or Poland. The decision to press the trigger would still rest entirely with the French president, but their presence would send a strong signal.",
      "Alternatively, French bombers could patrol European borders, in the same way they regularly do French borders today. Or airfields could be developed in other countries to which French bombers could quickly deploy in an emergency.",
      "Numbers are an issue. Are 300 French warheads enough against Russia's thousands? Maybe not \u2013 but in an alliance with the UK 300 become 550. Also (to repeat the point) the American nuclear deterrent is still in theory in place. There are US nuclear bombs in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.",
      "Another question is whether to reformulate the French nuclear doctrine so as to state unambiguously that \"vital interests\" cover European allies too.",
      "Some say there is no need, because the strategic vagueness that exists already is part of the very deterrent.",
      "But Mr Haroche says there is a political dimension to stating more clearly that France will use its arsenal to defend other European countries.",
      "\"If the US is to be less present, then European countries will be depending much more on each other. Our strategic world becomes more horizontal,\" he says.",
      "\"In this new world it is important to build trust and confidence among ourselves. For France to signal it is prepared to take on risk in support of others \u2013 that helps create a solid front.\"",

    "story": [
      "From speeches watched by millions to a position as her party's deputy leader at Westminster, Mhairi Black appeared to be one of politics rising stars.",
      "However, away from the House of Commons the SNP MP was \"flailing through life\" and became ill through depression and anxiety, she has told the BBC.",
      "Black believes it was only through a \"life-changing\" diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that she was able to regain control of her life.",
      "The former Paisley and Renfrewshire South representative also said her party's performance at last year's general election, where the party dropped from 48 MPs to eight, was due to \"self-inflected\" woes.",
      "Black stood down as an elected politician in 2024 after nine years, having first won her seat aged just 20.",
      "She said her decision came after years in a \"toxic\" and \"bullying\" environment that was \"consuming my entire life\", with her mental health suffering badly until she was diagnosed with ADHD around 2018.",
      "\"Everything was fried - my body, my mind was emotionally fried,\" she told the BBC's Scotcast podcast.",
      "The interview comes ahead of the release of a new BBC documentary, Mhairi Black: Being Me Again.",
      "She said: \"I couldn't go out without throwing up. I would have panic attacks everywhere I went.",
      "\"I didn't understand what was going on and why I was feeling like this, I'm just beating myself up more, because I'm thinking, well, everybody else is managing to get into work okay. Why are you the one that can't cope with it?\"",
      "The documentary - which will air on BBC Scotland at 21:00 on Sunday and is available on iPlayer from Friday -  shows her discussing the condition and her last year at Westminster.",
      "She describes how anxiety became depression, and saw her take time off from Westminster duties - a decision that brought criticism for her attendance record at parliament and holding a lack of surgeries in her constituency.",
      "\"Westminster didn't have a capacity for signing off, so it looked to the rest of the world like I've no been turning up, when in actual fact I was in the foetal position in my house,\" she says.",
      "For Black, the diagnosis of ADHD has had a \"life-changing\" impact on her life.",
      "She told Scotcast: \"It was massive because it felt as though someone had just handed me the instruction manual for my own brain, and suddenly I was able to think like, I'm not mad, I'm just wired differently.",
      "\"It allowed me to stop beating myself up so much because there were times when I would struggle to do things that other folk do effortlessly.\"",
      "Black compares the condition to the BBC's Sherlock series, where Benedict Cumberbatch's famous detective would use his \"mind palace\" to work out cases.",
      "\"It feels like there's constantly three conversations in my head \u2013 and a song,\" she laughs.",
      "However, Black told Scotcast she decided not to go public with her diagnosis at the time as it \"would get used against me\" in Westminster - an aggressive culture that her wife Katie was surprised by.",
      "She recalls: \"When she [Mhairi] started telling me about her experiences since being in parliament, I almost couldn't believe what I was hearing.",
      "\"It was very different to what I'd believed. I was surprised how isolated she was.\"",
      "Black recounts seeing punch-ups and bullying during her time as an MP, and although she raised concerns with her party, the support offered was not enough.",
      "She said: \"I think leadership at all levels have been aware of people who've been unhappy with how they've been treated, and I imagine most people would agree that we could be better at how we handle it.\"",
      "Elected as the SNP dominated the Scottish vote, her departure from Westminster came on a night when, in her own words, \"the SNP got an absolute doing\".",
      "Black felt the SNP's poor result happened due to \"in-fighting that was spilling out into the public domain\".",
      "She added that this was not helped by power being centred around leader Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell who was the party's chief executive.",
      "She said: \"The reason that I think it spilled out into the public was because a lot of people had hit their limit because they felt like their voices weren't being listened to within the party.",
      "\"There were a lot of folk who weren't comfortable with the idea of the chief executive and the leader of the party basically being a couple in one house.\"",
      "Black added she believed the SNP worked best when on the left politically, and that if the views of current deputy Kate Forbes became party policy there would be a \"mass exodus\" of members.",
      "Forbes is known for her conservative views on issues such as gay marriage, abortion and trans rights.",
      "Black was a headline act from her first days in Parliament, when her initial Commons speech saw her decry poverty and was viewed 10 million times within days.",
      "It came after a whirlwind time when she overturned Douglas Alexander's majority in 2015, as part of an SNP surge that saw the party take nearly every constituency in Scotland.",
      "Black had been energised by the independence referendum in 2014, which she calls a \"magical\" time.",
      "Defeat in the independence vote \"felt like a death\" she says, but within months she was standing for election - a time that saw social media posts she made as a teenager resurface, including declarations of love for Smirnoff Ice and views on football.",
      "\"The way it was twisted to make her out be a drunken, bigoted wee lout was one of the worst times of my life,\" recalls her father.",
      "It did not hurt her at the polls though,  and she carried that bluntness into her Westminster career.",
      "'I get death threats all the time'",
      "However, a vulnerability was underneath the surface - at one point the documentary shows a stuffed panda bear given to her by her mum to keep her company in London.",
      "In 2018 she spoke at length about the abuse she had suffered online, repeating some of the many foul-mouthed  slurs sent to her about her appearance and sexuality, including that you \"can't put lipstick on a pig\" and that she was \"too ugly to be raped\".",
      "\"It's difficult to describe how you can feel so alone and unsafe and under attack with nothing more than your phone sitting there,\" she reflects.",
      "\"I get death threats all the time but there was one in particular where the police came to my flat down in London and the house up in Scotland.",
      "\"It was like two in the morning and the phrase used was a 'an imminent death threat'.",
      "\"I don't know what I've done to make you viscerally hate me that much.\"",
      "Since politics she has performed a one-woman show at the Edinburgh festival and spent time talking about politics on various TV shows and podcasts.",
      "There does not appear to be any second guessing about her decision to stand down though, as she enjoys a walk with her dog in the new documentary.",
      "\"People deserve a representative that wants to be there and I don't think that's me anymore.  I've done my bit,\" she says.",

      "Melanie Onn, the MP for Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) is currently doing an evaluation of the contamination risk and working with the owners of both of the vessels to plan a salvage operation.",
      "Prof Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds said: \"The priority, I imagine, for the crews trying to contain the damage, will be to extinguish the fires and keep vessels afloat. This will reduce the quantity of chemicals entering the water and the risk for wildlife downstream.\"",
      "The fire that broke out following the crash will have helped to burn off some of the jet fuel but testing kits are being set to the site to confirm there is no residue remaining.",
      "Frode Vikeb\u00f8, research manager at the Institute of Marine Research said that the UK government will be modelling the spread of any contaminants at sea, considering ocean circulation and weather conditions, as part of \"standard procedure\".",
      "In terms of mitigation, Dr Karen Purnell, former director of ITOPF - which advises governments on maritime pollution, said the first approach would be to let the jet fuel \"dissipate naturally where possible and avoiding deliberate containment.\"",
      "If any jet fuel did make it to shore, she said: \"Flushing the shoreline to remobilise the fuel and perhaps directing it into absorbent booms or mats for later disposal could be an option.\" But she said the approach would differ depending on the different types of environment, for example whether there were wetlands.",

      "Dr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College, London's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar.

      "Dogs that are constantly hungry and prone to being overweight share a common bit of biology with some obesity-prone humans.",
      "This is what UK scientists have discovered - identifying a genetic source of many labradors' - and some people's - tendency to overeat.",
      "Researchers found that changes in a particular gene, one of the building blocks of biological code that produces the blueprint for how our bodies work, alters the chemical signals that tell our brains we've had enough to eat.",
      "The scientists say their findings, published in the journal Science, reveal something \"powerful\" about the biology of obesity risk.",
      "\"By studying dogs, we've honed in on some interesting new biology here,\" explained lead researcher Dr Eleanor Raffan from the University of Cambridge's department of physiology, development and neuroscience.",
      "She added that the discovery showed that \"owners of slim dogs are not morally superior - and the same is true of slim people\".",
      "\"If you have a high genetic risk of obesity, you're prone to gaining weight unless you put a huge effort into not doing so. And those with low genetic risk just don't have to work so hard.\"",
      "This canine-human biological link came from the researchers' examination of the genetics of 250 labradors. The team looked for pieces of genetic code that were common in overweight dogs.",
      "They picked out one gene in particular - called DENND1B - that was associated with a higher body mass in the labradors. And when they searched through a library of genetic information from thousands of humans, they discovered that the same gene was associated with a higher body mass in people, too.",
      "Before this study of labrador genetics, Dr Raffan said, \"no one suspected that gene  had anything to do with obesity\".",
      "The gene interferes with a brain signalling pathway that helps regulate our appetite.",
      "Dr Raffan explained: \"It alters the predisposition to weight gain because it's tweaking a system that is involved in regulating how hungry we feel and how much energy we burn off.\"",
      "The findings could help in the future development of new drugs to tackle obesity. But the scientists say they reveal how much harder people - and owners of dogs - with this genetic predisposition have to work to offset its effects.",
      "Another member of the research team, Alyce McClellan, from Cambridge University  added that the results emphasised \"the importance of fundamental brain pathways in controlling appetite and body weight\".",

      "Why fat labradors can blame their genes",
      "The discovery adds to a developing picture of those pathways and the biological driving forces behind overeating.",
      "A group of weight loss drugs, that includes Ozempic, target some of this biology, and have exploded in popularity in recent years.",
      "What we've identified here is a different pathway [from the one targeted by those drugs],\" explained Dr Raffan.",
      "\"But it all speaks to the same important bit of biology, which is that obesity is not  about having low willpower.",
      "\"It's about the fact that some people are prone to weight gain because they have a genetic risk which increases their responsiveness to food and their appetite.",
      "\"This goes for dogs and humans alike -  they have a genetic drive to overeat.\""

      "A new part of the immune system has been discovered and it is a goldmine of potential antibiotics, scientists have said.",
      "They've shown a part of the body known to recycle proteins has a secret mode that can spew out an arsenal of bacteria-killing chemicals.",
      "The researchers in Israel say it transforms our understanding of how we are protected against infection.",
      "And gives a new place to look for antibiotics to tackle the growing problem of superbugs that resist our current drugs.",
      "The discovery centres on the proteasome \u2013 a tiny structure that is found in every cell of the body.",
      "Its main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones.",
      "But a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria.",
      "It then changes structure and role. It starts transforming old proteins into weapons that can rip open the outer layer of bacteria to kill them.",
      "Prof Yifat Merbl, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, told me: \"This is really exciting, because we never knew that this was happening.",
      "\"We discovered a novel mechanism of immunity that is allowing us to have a defence against bacterial infection.",
      "\"It's happening throughout our body in all the cells, and generates a whole new class of potential natural antibiotics.\"",
      "The research team went through a process they called \"dumpster diving\" to find these natural antibiotics.",
      "They were tested on bacteria growing in the laboratory and on mice with pneumonia and sepsis. The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics.",

    "summary": "Households near new pylons are set to get up to \u00a3250 a year off their energy bills, under government plans.",
    "story": [
      "The cost of reducing energy bills for people who live near pylons will be paid for by increasing average annual bills across the country by 80p, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has told the BBC.",
      "Under the government's plans, households in Great Britain within 500m of new or upgraded pylons will get discounts of up to \u00a32,500 over 10 years, equivalent to \u00a3250 a year.",
      "Miliband said the costs of the scheme were \"more than offset\" by the benefits of the new infrastructure.",
      "He added that the idea was not about buying people off but \"recognising the service\" they were doing for the whole country.",
      "However, rural campaign groups said it was \"impossible to put a price on the loss of a landscape\".",
      "A government-commissioned report found hundreds of miles of new pylons will be needed to meet its clean energy targets.",
      "But new infrastructure proposals have sparked fierce opposition from residents in parts of the country like Norfolk and Suffolk, with campaigners arguing they will destroy the countryside.",
      "The bill discounts, which will be funded by electricity suppliers, are expected to be in place from 2026.",
      "Suppliers are expected to recoup costs by passing them on to other customers.",
      "Miliband told the BBC: \"At the moment, we're having to switch off offshore wind farms because we haven't got the transmission infrastructure.",
      "\"So everybody benefits from this. Everybody gets lower bills, and those who live near pylons are given a recognition of what they're doing.\"",
      "The idea forms part of the government's Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which is due to be published this week.",
      "The legislation aims to speed up the building of new homes and infrastructure by cutting red tape and simplifying the planning process.",
      "The government has put the changes at the heart of its push for economic growth.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said local people would still be \"part of the process\", but it would be \"streamlined\" so development was not \"continually blocked for years and years\".",
      "Battle lines drawn over 'monstrous' pylons and solar farm 'wastelands'",
      "Why more pylons could be headed your way",
      "Can electricity pylons ever be beautiful?",
      "Alongside money off bills, the government will publish new guidance on how developers should provide benefits to communities hosting transmission infrastructure, by funding projects like sports clubs, educational programmes or leisure facilities.",
      "The government said this would mean communities could get \u00a3200,000 worth of funding per km of overhead electricity cable in their area, and \u00a3530,000 per substation.",
      "Initial analysis estimates both bill discounts and community funds could see a total additional cost of between \u00a31-2 a year for the average customer over 10 years.",
      "The government is also looking at how communities near onshore wind farms and other energy infrastructure can receive benefits.",
      "The plans were welcomed by RenewableUK, which represents the sector.",
      "The group's head of policy, James Robottom, said bill discounts would \"help to enable the roll-out of much-needed new grid infrastructure at a faster pace, so that we can make the most of the vast amounts of clean power we're producing\".",
      "However, Jackie Copley, campaign lead at CPRE, the countryside charity, said: \"Investing in local green spaces or improving community infrastructure would be a better way to spend this money.",
      "\"Paying individuals comes with many problems, including questions of fairness, likely legal challenges, and the fact that it's impossible to put a price on the loss of a landscape.\"",
      "The idea of giving people living near new pylons money off their energy bills was also proposed under the previous Conservative government.",
      "A government survey in 2024 suggested 78% of people would find an energy infrastructure project more acceptable if they were offered discounts on their bills.",
      "Some energy companies already offer bill discounts to customers who live near infrastructure like wind turbines, while grants are also available for local communities affected.",
      "The bill also includes measures that would allow \"ready-to-go\" energy projects to jump to the front of the queue for grid connections, replacing the current \"first come, first served\" process.",
      "The government says the existing system is being \"clogged up\" by speculative projects creating 10 year waits for \"viable infrastructure\".",
      "Meanwhile, the government has announced the number of bodies which get a say in planning decisions could be cut.",
      "Officials will consult on removing Sport England, the Theatres Trust and the Garden History Society from the list of \"statutory consultees\", who are legally required to provide advice on decisions.",
      "The government said in some cases organisations were slowing down building, giving the example of a housing development in Bradford which was delayed because the application was thought to have not adequately considered the speed of cricket balls from a nearby club.",

    "story": [
      "Global sales of smartwatches have fallen for the first time, new figures indicate, in large part due to a sharp decline in the popularity of market leader, Apple.",
      "Market research firm Counterpoint says 7% fewer of the devices were shipped in 2024 compared to the year before.",
      "Shipments of Apple Watches fell by 19% in that period, Counterpoint says.",
      "It blames the slump on a lack of new features in Apple's latest devices, and the fact a rumoured high-end Ultra 3 model never materialised.",
      "\"The biggest driver of the decline was North America, where the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,\" said Counterpoint senior research analyst Anshika Jain.",
      "Apple was also hit with sales and import bans in the US in late 2023 and early 2024 over a disputed patent regarding blood oxygen level monitoring - which Ms Jain says also contributed to lower sales figures in the first half of 2024.",
      "It retained 22% of market share in the final three months of 2024, down from 25% a year earlier.",
      "\"We've been through a period where the smartwatch has gone from being a new and exciting gadget, to something now that's stabilising - the feature set isn't changing very dramatically year over year,\" said Leo Gebbie, principal analyst at CCS Insight.",
      "Despite the overall decline, last year did see a massive rise in sales for Chinese-made smartwatches from brands such as Xiaomi, Huawei and Imoo.",
      "Sales in China also grew from 19% of the market to 25% in the year from the last quarter of 2023.",
      "This was the first time it recorded more smartwatch sales than India or North America, according to Counterpoint.",
      "The Chinese manufacturers also appeared to tap into another trend - the growing popularity of smartwatches for children, the only segment of the market to grow in 2024.",
      "Imoo, known in China as \"Little Genius\", specialises in children's smart watches and saw a 22% rise in shipments.",
      "\"The kids' smart watch segment is gaining traction as parents are concerned for their children's safety, and they desire to track and stay constantly connected with their children,\" Counterpoint's Balbir Singh said.",
      "But Imoo was eclipsed by a 135% rise in shipments from Beijing-based tech company Xiaomi.",
      "Its Smart Band activity trackers sell for a fraction of the price of rivals made by Apple and Samsung.",
      "\"We're seeing the large consumer electronics players like Apple and Samsung really just look to drive a way higher margin and not engage in the price war,\" said Mr Gebbie.",
      "\"Xiaomi has done a really good job of selling devices, particularly in regions like southern and eastern Europe where that greater affordability tends to resonate a lot more strongly with customers.\"",
      "Another large contributor to the global sales drop was India, which fell from 30% of the market to 23%.",
      "He said this was partly because of a \"bubble\" in ultra-cheap devices from Indian manufacturers which has now burst.",
      "\"We read and saw a lot in terms of complaints about the quality of devices, with people being unhappy with them,\" he said.",
      "\"For those companies, there's been a sense that from this point onwards they would be better served by maybe making and selling products with a slightly longer lifespan.\"",
      "Counterpoint says it expects a small recovery in the global market, with \"single-digit percentage growth in 2025\".",
      "It predicts the uptick in sales will be driven by the increasing adoption of AI features, and a greater emphasis of providing a wider range of health data.",

      "President Donald Trump's decision to establish official government cryptocurrency reserves in the US has drawn criticism from industry watchers.",
      "He has signed an executive order creating what he calls a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as well as a Digital Asset Stockpile, which will consist of other forms of digital currency.",
      "The funds will be stocked with coins forfeited to the federal government as part of criminal or civil proceedings.",
      "White House AI and crypto tsar David Sacks likened them to a \"a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency\", drawing comparison to the Kentucky military base that stores a significant portion of US gold assets.",
      "However, some crypto enthusiasts have criticised the government for not being bolder, while others have raised question marks about the lack of transparency over the process.",
      "Sacks has ordered a full accounting of the federal government's existing crypto reserves, which he estimated at 200,000 Bitcoin alone. That's worth $17.5bn (\u00a313.6bn) at today's prices.",
      "Speaking to reporters at the White House ahead of a special crypto summit on Friday, Sacks said that it was a \"real shame that we did not maximise value for the American taxpayer.\"",
      "\"What we want to do is make sure that with the remaining Bitcoin that we have,\" he added.",
      "Nonetheless, Charles Edwards of the Capriole Fund, a Bitcoin and digital assets hedge fund, called Thursday's announcement \"a pig in lipstick\" in response to Sacks' post on X.",
      "\"No active buying means this is just a fancy title for Bitcoin holdings that already existed with the government,\" he said.",
      "Trump's executive order says that the Treasury and Commerce secretary will come up with strategies for acquiring more government Bitcoin, provided these are \"budget neutral and do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers\".",
      "That meant, Sacks told reporters, they are only \"allowed to buy more if it doesn't add to the deficit or the debt.\"",
      "Jason Yanowitz, Co-Founder of crypto firm Blockworks, agrees with the idea of a Bitcoin reserve but says the inclusion of other coins sets a \"horrible precedent\" and \"makes no sense.\"",
      "\"Without a clear framework, we risk arbitrary asset selections, which would distort the markets and drive a loss of public trust,\" he suggested.",
      "Other analysts though have been more positive.",
      "\"This approach makes much more sense than buying the assets,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.",
      "\"It would surely be bizarre for the US to sell dollars to buy crypto, when the dollar is the globe's reserve currency and therefore a source of enormous influence.\"",
      "'Won't cost a dime'",
      "Further details are expected when the president speaks to the first crypto summit at the White House.",
      "It is unclear how a crypto reserve would benefit Americans, but Sacks told reporters it \"will not cost taxpayers a dime\".",
      "It is also unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress.",
      "The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset. While the reserve will exclusively contain Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies will go into a separate stockpile.",
      "His implication that the US government would not buy Bitcoin led prices of the world's largest cryptocurrency to fall by more than 5%.",

      "The robot's arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses \u2013 they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance.",
      "Such a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however.",
      "\"Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology,\" says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF.",
      "Deep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. \"If you're not sure what's down there, then leave it alone,\" says John Childs at Lancaster University. \"That's been the widespread position from science [to date].\"",
      "Scars left by mining experiments in the past, using highly disruptive technologies, have been severe.",
      "In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later.",
      "Opposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies.",
      "Nautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019.",
      "Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition.",
      "Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact.",
      "No commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July.",
      "Mr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws.",
      "He adds that \"hundreds\" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land.",
      "Unlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara.",
      "He also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: \"Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining.\"",
      "Jovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology \"in sync\" with the environment.",
      "Some deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process.",
      "\"You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,\" says managing director B\u00e5rd Brekke J\u00f8rgensen. \"You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool.\"",
      "The Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique.",
      "Mr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says \"there's absolutely nothing in it\".",
      "Those calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are \"virtue signalling\" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company.",
      "\"We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,\" says Mr Barron.",
      "The Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities.",
      "Dutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface.",
      "The Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time.",
      "Claims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were \"total nonsense\", says Mr Barron.",
      "Jeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance.",
      "Some sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact.",
      "Mr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. \"If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,\" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind.",
      "Ann Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem.",
      "Dr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests.",
      "And there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics.",

    "summary": "Calin Georgescu loses a bid to overturn a ruling barring him from participating in next May's vote.",
    "story": [
      "Romanian far-right populist Calin Georgescu has lost his appeal against a ruling barring him from participating in May's presidential election.",
      "The Constitutional Court issued the final ruling on Tuesday afternoon after deliberating for two hours. It said the decision was unanimous.",
      "The Central Electoral Bureau had earlier rejected Georgescu's candidacy for a rerun of the presidential election in May.",
      "Georgescu had won the first round of last year's presidential vote, but it was annulled after intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in setting up almost 800 TikTok accounts backing him.",
      "On Sunday, the election bureau said Georgescu's candidacy did not \"meet the conditions of legality\", as he \"violated the very obligation to defend democracy\".",
      "Georgescu appealed that verdict the following day.",
      "In a Facebook video on Tuesday night, Georgescu did not call for further protests - but instead suggested supporters could choose another candidate to back in the re-run election in May.",
      "\"If you want to support anyone by signing new lists for the presidential campaign, please do as your conscience tells you,\" he said. \"It seems democracy and freedom are taking their last breath these days.",
      "\"But we need to show now, more than any other time, that our choice matters in a peaceful and democratic way,\" Georgescu added.",
      "Earlier in the evening, many of the protesters outside the court had Romanian flags draped around their shoulders. Some held up Orthodox Christian icons and one clutched a large wooden crucifix.",
      "A man dressed in a traditional peasant smock scaled a lamppost with a giant Romanian flag and waved it enthusiastically over the crowd.",
      "They chanted \"Calin Georgescu is president\" and \"freedom\", and condemned the judges as traitors. One woman had a sign that read \"Stop dictatorship\".",
      "It took a while for news of the ruling upholding the ban to reach the crowd. When it did, there were loud \"boos\" directed at the judges inside.",
      "The crowd soon became noisy and angry, saying they had come to the streets to defend democracy.",
      "Calin Georgescu, the man they support, has come from the far-right fringes of Romanian politics, but he is now at the forefront and promises to make Romania great again.",
      "On 26 February, he was detained for questioning on his way to register as a candidate for the May election, prompting tens of thousands of Romanians to take to the streets of Bucharest in protest.",
      "Many Romanians believe he is being blocked by a political elite that is corrupt and remote from the people.",
      "George Simion, an ally of Georgescu and the leader of the far-right opposition Alliance for Uniting Romanians (AUR) wrote on Facebook: \"Shame! You will not defeat us. The people of Romania have awoken. They will win.\"",
      "The presidential election was annulled after Georgescu won the first round in November 2024, when intelligence was released suggesting a giant TikTok promotion campaign for Georgescu had been backed by Russia.",
      "To European leaders and many in Romania it looked like Russia was trying to weaken Europe and undermine its liberal values.",

      "Nevertheless, he questioned the basis for the warrant, asking: \"What crime [have] I committed?\" in a video posted online on Tuesday by another daughter, Veronica Duterte.",
      "\"If I committed a sin, prosecute me in Philippine courts, with Filipino judges, and I will allow myself to be jailed in my own nation,\" he said in a later video.",

      "Duterte's arrest marks the \"beginning of a new chapter in Philippine history\", said political scientist Richard Heydarian. \"This is about rule of law and human rights.\"",

      "He cast himself as a tough-talking anti-establishment politician to win the 2016 elections by a landslide.",
      "With fiery rhetoric, he rallied security forces to shoot drug suspects dead. More than 6,000 suspects were killed by police or unknown assailants during the campaign, but rights groups say the number could be higher.",
      "A previous UN report found that most victims were young, poor urban males and that police, who do not need search or arrest warrants to conduct house raids, systematically forced suspects to make self-incriminating statements or risk facing lethal force.",
      "Critics said the campaign targeted street-level pushers and failed to catch big-time drug lords. Many families also claimed that the victims - their sons, brothers or husbands - were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.",
      "Investigations in parliament pointed to a shadowy \"death squad\" of bounty hunters targeting drug suspects. Duterte has denied the allegations of abuse.",
      "\"Do not question my policies because I offer no apologies, no excuses. I did what I had to do, and whether or not you believe it... I did it for my country,\" Duterte told a parliament investigation in October.",
      "\"I hate drugs, make no mistake about it.\"",
      "The ICC first took note of the alleged abuses in 2016 and started its investigation in 2021. It covered cases from November 2011, when Duterte was mayor of Davao, to March 2019, before the Philippines withdrew from the ICC.",

    "story": [
      "Indian Americans are increasingly optimistic about India's future, but hold deep concerns about US-India relations under a second Donald Trump administration, a new survey finds.",
      "The 2024 Indian-American Survey, conducted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and YouGov in October, examined Indian-American political attitudes.",
      "Two pivotal elections happened in India and the US last year, amid a deepening - but occasionally strained - partnership. Tensions between the countries flared over a US federal indictment of Indian billionaire Gautam Adani and allegations of a Delhi-backed assassination plot on American soil.",
      "With more than five million Indian-origin residents in the US, the survey asked some key questions: How do Indian Americans view former president Joe Biden's handling of US-India ties? Do they see Donald Trump as a better option? And how do they assess India's trajectory post the 2024 election?",
      "Here are some key takeaways from the report, which was based on a nationally representative online survey of 1,206 Indian-American adult residents.",
      "Trump v Biden on India",
      "Indian Americans rated the Biden administration's handling of US-India relations more favourably than Trump's first term.",
      "A hypothetical Kamala Harris administration was seen as better for bilateral ties than a second Trump term during the polling.",
      "Partisan polarisation plays a key role: 66% of Indian-American Republicans believe Trump was better for US-India ties, while just 8% of Democrats agree.",
      "Conversely, half of Indian-American Democrats favour Biden, compared to 15% of Republicans.",
      "Since most Indian Americans are Democrats, this gives Biden the overall edge.",
      "During their February meeting at the White House, both Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised each other's leadership, but Trump criticised India's high trade tariffs, calling them a \"big problem.\"",
      "'Murder-for-hire' controversy",
      "The alleged Indian plot to assassinate a separatist on US soil has not widely registered - only half of respondents are aware of it.",
      "In October, the US charged a former Indian intelligence officer with attempted murder and money laundering for allegedly plotting to assassinate Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a US-based advocate for an independent Sikh state, Khalistan.",
      "This marked the first time the Indian government has been directly implicated in an alleged assassination attempt on a dissident. India has stated it is co-operating with the US investigation. In January, a panel set up by India to examine Washington's allegations recommended legal action against an unnamed individual believed to be the former intelligence agent.",
      "A narrow majority of the respondents said that India would \"not be justified in taking such action and hold identical feelings about the US if the positions were reversed\".",
      "Israel and the Palestinians",
      "Indian Americans are split along partisan party lines, with Democrats expressing greater empathy for Palestinians and Republicans leaning pro-Israel.",
      "Four in 10 respondents believe Biden has been too pro-Israel in the ongoing conflict.",
      "The attack in October 2023 by Hamas fighters from Gaza killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and saw 251 people taken hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements.",
      "Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Talks to prolong the fragile ceasefire, the first phase of which ended on 1 March, are expected to resume in Qatar on Monday.",
      "India's outlook brightens",
      "Forty-seven percent of Indian Americans believe India is heading in the right direction, a 10 percentage point increase from four years ago.",
      "The same share approves of Modi's performance as prime minister. Additionally, four in 10 respondents feel that India's 2024 election - where Modi's party did not get a majority - made the country more democratic.",
      "The survey found that many Indian Americans support Modi and believe India is on the right track, yet half are unaware of the alleged assassination attempt on US soil.",
      "Does this indicate a gap in information access, selective engagement or a tendency to overlook certain actions in favour of broader nationalist sentiment?",
      "\"It is hard to tease out the precise reason for this, but our sense is that this has more to do with selective engagement,\" Milan Vaishnav, co-author of the study, said.",
      "Data collected by Carnegie in 2020 shows that around 60% of Indian Americans follow Indian government and public affairs regularly, leaving a significant portion who \"engage only sporadically\".",
      "\"Often people form broad impressions based on a combination of the news, social media and interactions with friends and family. Given the deluge of news in the US of late, it is not entirely surprising that the 'murder-for-hire' plot did not break through for a large section of the community,\" Mr Vaishnav said.",
      "Indian Americans, while cautious about Trump and generally favouring Biden or Harris for US-India relations, continue to strongly support Modi back in India. Given Modi's nationalist policies, what accounts for this divergence? Is it driven more by personal impact than ideology?",
      "\"This is a case of 'where you sit is where you stand',\" Mr Vaishnav said.",
      "He said in related research, \"we've explored this question in depth and found that Indian Americans generally hold more liberal views on US policy issues compared to India\".",
      "\"For instance, while Muslim Indian-Americans \u2013 minorities both in India and the US \u2013 maintain consistently more liberal attitudes, Hindu Indian-Americans express liberal views in the US (where they are a minority) but more conservative stances in India, where they belong to the majority.",

    "story": [
      "The government of Portuguese Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro has lost a vote of confidence, almost certainly pitching the country into its third general election in barely three years.",
      "MPs voted against him by 142 to 88 with no abstentions, toppling his right-of-centre minority government.",
      "While Portugal's President, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, is not obliged to dissolve the assembly, he had made clear that he would if the government lost Tuesday's vote, with fresh elections likely in May.",
      "The confidence motion was tabled by the government itself, after the opposition Socialists announced plans for a parliamentary inquiry into Montenegro's business dealings.",
      "A company called Spinumviva, set up by Lu\u00eds Montenegro, continued to receive sizeable sums from clients he had previously secured, even after he was elected Social Democratic Party (PSD) president and leader of the opposition in 2022, and had transferred ownership to his wife and two sons.",
      "The legality of the transfer to his wife was questioned by the opposition, given that the marriage is one in which assets are jointly held; the couple have since made their sons sole owners.",
      "But questions remain about the sources of the company's income \u2013 which until a few days ago included \u20ac4,500 (\u00a33,800) a month from hotels and casino group Solverde, whose gambling concession is up for review \u2013 as well as the identity of other clients, which the prime minister has declined to reveal, and the services Spinumviva offers.",
      "The prime minister, a trained lawyer, says the firm provides consultancy services relating to data privacy laws, outsourcing work to external experts \u2013 given that his wife is a childminder, one son a student and the other a new graduate.",
      "The Bar Association is now looking into whether the company is illicitly offering services that only lawyers may offer.",
      "In recent days, Montenegro's cabinet has approved a battery of spending and other measures, in what is being seen as a bid to show that it is working hard for the country.",
      "The situation might seem to offer ideal conditions for far-right Chega, the third-largest party in parliament, to renew its attacks on corruption in politics.",
      "Chega also benefited from the resignation of Montenegro's Socialist predecessor, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, who is now president of the European Council. His name had come up in a criminal investigation into government contracts, although he has never been made a suspect.",
      "But in recent weeks, Chega has been hit by scandals of its own, with three of its MPs accused of crimes, including one charged with stealing suitcases at Lisbon airport.",
      "Until recently, Lu\u00eds Montenegro's coalition with the conservative People's Party was still ahead of the Socialists in the opinion polls, having narrowly won the 2024 general election a year ago.",
      "However, they are now trailing the Socialists, led by Pedro Nuno Santos, who served as a minister under Ant\u00f3nio Costa.",
      "None of the major parties appear keen on a snap election \u2013 not least because they fear voters will not be enthusiastic at having to choose a new government when the current one has been in office for less than a year \u2013 and the timing is poor in geopolitical terms.",
      "However, Portugal appears set on an unswerving path for May elections.",
      "Not only has the prime minister chosen to appeal to voters rather than face an inquiry, a stance described as \"cowardly\" by the leader of the opposition.",
      "But Pedro Nuno Santos has long pledged not to vote in favour of any government confidence motion.",

    "story": [
      "Residents of Greenland are going to the polls in a vote that in previous years has drawn little outside attention - but which may prove pivotal for the Arctic territory's future.",
      "US President Donald Trump's repeated interest in acquiring Greenland has put it firmly in the spotlight and fuelled the longstanding debate on the island's future ties with Copenhagen.",
      "\"There's never been a spotlight like this on Greenland before,\" says Nauja Bianco, a Danish-Greenlandic policy expert on the Arctic.",
      "Greenland has been controlled by Denmark \u2013 nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away \u2013 for about 300 years. It governs its own domestic affairs, but decisions on foreign and defence policy are made in Copenhagen.",
      "Now, five out of six parties on the ballot favour Greenland's independence from Denmark, differing only on how quickly that should come about.",
      "Voting takes place over 11 hours at 72 polling stations, and ends at 20:00 local time on Tuesday (22:00G).",
      "The debate over independence has been \"put on steroids by Trump\", says Masaana Egede, editor of Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq.",
      "The island's strategic location and untapped mineral resources have caught the US president's eye. He first floated the idea of buying Greenland during his first term in 2019.",
      "Since taking office again in January, he has reiterated his intention to acquire the territory. Greenland and Denmark's leaders have repeatedly rebuffed his demands.",
      "Addressing the US Congress last week, however, Trump again doubled down. \"We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're gonna get it,\" he said, prompting applause and laughter from a number of politicians, including Vice-President JD Vance.",
      "In Nuuk, his words struck a nerve with politicians who were quick to condemn them. \"We deserve to be treated with respect and I don't think the American president has done that lately since he took office,\" Prime Minister Mute Egede said.",
      "Still, the US interest has stoked calls for Greenland to break away from Denmark, with much of the debate focused on when \u2013 not if \u2013 the process of independence should begin.",
      "Greenland's independence goal is not new, Nauja Bianco points out, and has been decades in the making.",
      "A string of revelations about past mistreatment of Inuit people by the Danes have hurt Greenlandic public opinion about Denmark. Earlier this year, PM Egede said the territory should free itself from \"the shackles of colonialism\".",
      "But it is the first time the subject has taken centre stage in an election.",
      "Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), the party of Prime Minister Mute Egede, favours gradual steps towards autonomy. \"Citizens must feel secure,\" he told local media.",
      "Arctic expert Martin Breum says Egede's handling of the challenge from Trump and strong words against Denmark over past colonial wrongdoings \"will give him a lot of votes\".",
      "Smaller rivals could also gain ground and potentially shake up alliances.",

      "However, the centre-right Demokraatit party believes it is too soon to push for independence.",
      "\"The economy will have to be much stronger than it is today,\" party candidate Justus Hansen told Reuters.",

      "\"It's an election where we should be talking about healthcare, care of the elderly and social problems. Almost everything is about independence.\"",
      "According to recent polls, almost 80% of Greenlanders back moves towards future statehood.",
      "About 44,000 people are eligible to vote, and given the low numbers and few polls, results are difficult to forecast.",
      "Even though a majority of Greenlanders favour independence, a survey has shown that half would be less enthusiastic about independence if that meant lower living standards.",
      "One poll found that 85% of Greenlanders do not wish to become a part of the United States, and nearly half see Trump's interest as a threat.",
      "One fear among some Greenlanders, says Masaana Egede, is how long the Arctic island could remain independent and whether it would break off from Denmark only to have another country \"standing on our coasts and start taking over\".",
      "Experts say it is this worry that could steer votes towards keeping the status quo.",
      "Although Greenland's right to self-determination is enshrined into law by the 2009 Self-Rule Act, there are several steps to take before the territory could break away from Denmark, including holding a referendum.",
      "This means getting full independence could take \"about 10 to 15 years,\" says Kaj Kleist, a veteran Greenlandic politician and civil servant who prepared the Self-Rule Act.",
      "\"There is lot of preparation and negotiations with the Danish government before you can make that a reality,\" he adds.",
      "Whatever the election's outcome, experts do not believe Greenland could become independent before Trump's second term is over in 2028.",
      "The results are expected in the early hours of Wednesday."

    "summary": "Stock market falls, tariffs and other changes are reigniting fear of economic downturn in the US.",
    "story": [
      "During his election campaign last year, Donald Trump promised Americans he would usher in a new era of prosperity.",
      "Now two months into his presidency, he's painting a slightly different picture.",
      "He has warned that it will be hard to bring down prices and the public should be prepared for a \"little disturbance\" before he can bring back wealth to the US.",
      "Meanwhile, analysts say the odds of a downturn are increasing, pointing to his policies.",
      "So is Trump about to trigger a recession in the world's largest economy?",
      "Markets fall and recession risks rise",
      "In the US, a recession is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.",
      "A chorus of economic analysts have warned in recent days that the risks of such a scenario are rising.",
      "A JP Morgan report put the chance of recession at 40%, up from 30% at the start of the year, warning that US policy was \"tilting away from growth\", while Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, upped the odds from 15% to 35%, citing tariffs.",
      "The forecasts came as the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US sank sharply. It has now fallen to its lowest level since September in a sign of fears about the future.",
      "The market turmoil is being driven partly by concerns about new taxes on imports, called tariffs, which Trump has introduced since he took office.",
      "He has hit products from America's three biggest trade partners with the new duties, and threatened them more widely in moves that analysts believe will increase prices and curb growth.",
      "Trump and his economic advisers have been warning the public to be prepared for some economic pain, while appearing to dismiss the market concerns - a marked change from his first term, when he frequently cited the stock market as a measure of his own success.",
      "\"There will always be changes and adjustments,\" he said last week, in response to pleas from businesses for more certainty.",
      "The posture has increased investor worries about his plans.",
      "Goldman Sachs last week raised its recession bets from 15% to 20%, saying it saw policy changes as \"the key risk\" to the economy. But it noted that the White House still had \"the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious\".",
      "\"If the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further,\" the firm's analysts warned.",
      "Tariffs, uncertainty and slowing growth",
      "For many firms, the biggest question mark is tariffs, which raise costs for US businesses by putting taxes on imports. As Trump unveils tariff plans, many companies are now facing lower profit margins, while holding off on investments and hiring as they try to figure out what the future will look like.",
      "Investors are also worried about big cuts to the government workforce and government spending.",
      "Brian Gardner, chief of Washington policy strategy at the investment bank Stifel, said businesses and investors had thought Trump intended tariffs as a negotiating tool.",
      "\"But what the president and his cabinet are signalling is actually a bigger deal. It's a restructuring of the American economy,\" he said. \"And that's what's been driving markets in the last couple of weeks.\"",
      "The US economy was already undergoing a slowdown, engineered in part by the central bank, which has kept interest rates higher to try to cool activity and stabilise prices.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?Six things that could get more expensive",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Six things that could get more expensive",
      "In recent weeks, some data suggests a more rapid weakening.",
      "Retail sales fell in February, confidence - which had popped after Trump's election on several surveys of consumers and businesses - has fallen, and companies including major airlines, retailers such as Walmart and Target, and manufacturers are warning of a pullback.",
      "Some analysts are worried a drop in the stock market could trigger a further clampdown in spending, especially among higher income households.",
      "That could deliver a major hit to the US economy, which is driven by consumer spending and has grown increasingly dependent on those richer households, as lower income families face pressure from inflation.",
      "The head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, offered assurances in a speech last week, noting that sentiment had not been a good indicator of behaviour in recent years.",
      "\"Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,\" he said.",
      "But the US economy is currently deeply linked to the rest of the world, warned Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.",
      "\"The fact that tariffs could disrupt that at the same time that there were signs that the US economy was weakening anyway .. is really fuelling recession fears,\" she says.",
      "Stock market in tech ripe for correction",
      "The unease in the stock market isn't all about Trump.",
      "Investors were already jittery about the possibility of a correction, after big gains over the last two years, driven by the sharp run-up in tech stocks fuelled by investor optimism about artificial intelligence (AI),",
      "Chipmaker Nvidia, for example, saw its share price jump from less than $15 at the start of 2023 to nearly $150 in November of last year.",
      "That type of rise had stirred debate about an \"AI bubble\" - with investors on high alert for signs of it bursting, which would have a big impact on the stock market, regardless of the dynamics in the wider economy.",
      "Now, with views of the US economy darkening, optimism about AI is getting even harder to sustain.",
      "Tech analyst Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management wrote on social media this week that his optimism had \"taken a step back\" as the chance of a recession increased \"measurably\" over the past month.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if we enter a recession, it will be extremely difficult for the AI trade to continue,\" he said."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6253ly20p4o",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:48:45 GMT",
    "summary": "The ex-president is on his way to the International Criminal Court following his arrest in Manila.",
    "story": [
      "Just short of his 80th birthday, Rodrigo Duterte, a man who once vowed to purge his country through a bloody anti-drugs and crime campaign, found himself outmanoeuvred and in custody.",
      "The former president was met by Philippines police as he arrived in Manila on a flight from Hong Kong, where he had been rallying support for his candidates for the upcoming mid-term election among the large Filipino diaspora there.",
      "The much-talked-about warrant for his arrest from the International Criminal Court (ICC) was, it turned out, already in the hands of the Philippines government, which moved swiftly to execute it.",
      "A frail-looking Mr Duterte, walking with a stick, was moved to an air force base within the airport perimeter. A chartered jet was quickly prepared to take him to the ICC in The Hague.",
      "How had this happened? How had a man so powerful and popular, often called \"the Trump of Asia\", been brought so low?",
      "In vain, his lawyers and family members protested that the arrest had no legal basis and complained that Duterte's frail health was being neglected.",
      "Duterte: The provocative but popular Philippine strongman",
      "While in office, Mr Duterte formed an alliance with the Marcos family \u2013 the children of ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos who had long been working on a political comeback. Mr Duterte could not run again in the 2022 election, but his daughter Sara, mayor of southern city of Davao, was also popular and a strong contender to replace him.",
      "However, Ferdinand Marcos's son Bongbong, who had been in politics all his life, was also well placed to win and very well-funded.",
      "The two families struck a deal. They would work together to get Bongbong into the presidency and Sara into the vice-presidency, on the assumption that come the next election in 2028, her turn would come and she would have the formidable Marcos machine behind her.",
      "It worked. Both won their positions by a wide margin. Mr Duterte expected that his alliance would protect him from any blowback over his controversial presidency once he was out of power.",
      "The most serious threat hanging over him was an investigation by the ICC into his culpability for thousands of extrajudicial killings carried out during anti-drugs campaigns he ordered - after he became president in 2016, but also during his tenure as mayor of the southern city of Davao from 2011.",
      "Mr Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the jurisdiction of the ICC in 2019, but its prosecutors argued they still had a mandate to look into alleged crimes against humanity committed before that, and launched a formal investigation in 2021. However, President Marcos initially stated that his government would not co-operate with the ICC.",
      "That position only changed after the dramatic breakdown of the Duterte-Marcos alliance. Strains in their relationship were evident from the earliest days of the administration, when Sara Duterte's request to be given control of the powerful defence ministry was turned down and she was given the education ministry instead.",
      "President Marcos also distanced himself from his predecessor's mercurial policies, mending fences with the US, standing up to China in contested seas, and stopping the blood-curdling threats of retribution against drug dealers.",
      "In the end, these were two ambitious, power-hungry clans aiming to dominate Filipino politics, and there was not enough power for them to share. Relations reached a nadir last year when Sara Duterte announced that she had hired an assassin to kill President Marcos, should anything happen to her.",
      "Late last year, the lower house of Congress, which is controlled by Marcos loyalists, filed a petition to impeach Ms Duterte. That trial is due to take place in the Senate later this year.",
      "If she is impeached, under the constitution, she would be barred from holding high political office, killing her long-standing presidential ambitions and weakening the political power of the Dutertes even further.",
      "President Marcos now appears to have moved deftly to neutralise his main political rival. But his strategy is not risk-free. The Dutertes remain popular in much of the country, and may be able to mobilise protests against the former president's prosecution.",
      "Sara Duterte has issued a statement accusing the government of surrendering her father to \"foreign powers\" and of violating Filipino sovereignty.",
      "An early test of the support enjoyed by both clans will be the mid-term elections in May.",
      "In his comments to journalists after the plane carrying his predecessor had taken off from Manila, President Marcos insisted he was meeting the country's commitments to Interpol, which had delivered the ICC warrant. But he was coy about the fact that it was an ICC warrant he was executing, given that many Filipinos will question what the ICC's remit is in a country which has already left its jurisdiction.",
      "It is not risk-free for the ICC either. The court is an embattled institution these days, with the Trump administration threatening to arrest its top officials should they travel to the US, and few countries willing to extradite those it has indicted. Getting former President Duterte to The Hague might therefore look like a welcome high-profile success.",
      "But there was a warning, from China \u2013 admittedly not a signatory to the ICC and currently at loggerheads with the Philippines \u2013 not to politicise ICC cases. This was a thinly-veiled reference to the fact that this case, which is supposed to be about accountability for serious international crimes, has ended up playing a decisive part in a domestic feud in the Philippines between two rival political forces."

      "The week-long Gada ceremony, which ended on Sunday, sees the official transfer of power from one customary ruler to his successor - something that happens every eight years.",
      "The tradition of regularly appointing a new Abbaa Gadaa has been practised by the Borana community for centuries - and sees them gather at the rural site of Arda Jila Badhasa, near the Ethiopian town of Arero.",
      "It is a time to celebrate their special form of democracy as well as their cultural heritage, with each age group taking the opportunity to wear their different traditional outfits.",
      "These are paraded the day before the official handover during a procession when married women march with wooden batons, called \"siinqee\".",
      "The batons have symbolic values of protection for women, who use them during conflict.",
      "If a siinqee stick is placed on the ground by a married woman between two quarrelling parties, it means the conflict must stop immediately out of respect.",
      "During the procession, younger women lead at the front, distinguished from the married women by the different colour of their clothing.",
      "In this pastoralist society women are excluded from holding the top power of Abbaa Gadaa, sitting on the council of elders or being initiated into the system as a child.",
      "But their important role can be seen during the festival as they build all the accommodation for those staying for the week - and prepare all the food.",
      "And the unique Gada system of governance, which was added to the UN's cultural heritage list in 2016, allows for them to attend regular community meetings and to voice their opinions to the Abbaa Gadaa.",
      "Gada membership is only open to boys whose fathers are already members - young initiates have their heads shaven at the crown to make their rank clear.",
      "The smaller the circle, the older he is.",
      "As the global cultural body Unesco reports, oral historians teach young initiates about \"history, laws, rituals, time reckoning, cosmology, myths, rules of conduct, and the function of the Gada system\".",
      "Training for boys begins as young as eight years old.",
      "Later, they will be assessed for their potential as future leaders.",
      "As they grow up, tests include walking long distances barefoot, slaughtering cattle efficiently and showing kindness to fellow initiates.",
      "Headpieces made from cowrie shells are traditionally worn by young trainees. The only other people allowed to wear them are elderly women.",
      "Both groups are revered by Borana community members.",
      "Men aged between 28 and 32 are identified by the ostrich feathers they wear, which are known in the Afaan Oromo language as \"baalli\".",
      "Their attendance at the Gada ceremony is an opportunity to learn, prepare and bond as it is already known who the Abbaa Gadaa from this age group will be taking power in 2033.",
      "The main event at the recent Gada ceremony was the handover of power, from the outgoing 48-year-old Abbaa Gadaa to his younger successor.",
      "Well-wishers crossed the border from Kenya and others travelled from as far as Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, to witness the spectacle. The governor of Kenya's Marsabit county was among the honoured guests.",
      "Thirty-seven-year-old Guyo Boru Guyo, seen here holding a spear, was chosen to lead because he impressed the council of elders during his teenage years.",
      "He becomes the 72nd Abbaa Gadaa and will now oversee the Borana community across borders - in southern Ethiopia and north-western Kenya.",
      "As their top diplomat, he will also be responsible for solving feuds that rear their heads for pastoralists.",
      "These often involve cattle raiding and disputes over access to water in this drought-prone region.",

      "Never has there been so much international interest in Greenland and its election, after President Donald Trump said he wanted to make the semi-autonomous Danish territory part of the US.",
      "Around 44,000 Greenlanders out of a population of 57,000 are eligible to vote to elect 31 MPs, as well as the country's government.",

      "How does voting work?",
      "There are 72 polling stations scattered around Greenland's coast and voting continues until 20:00 (22:00 GMT), with results expected early on Wednesday.",
      "The sheer size of Greenland and the remoteness of many of its settlements and small towns means delivering ballots on time can be a challenge.",
      "No two towns are connected by road or rail, and the island is exposed to extreme Arctic weather.",
      "Back in 2018, the 55 residents of Savissivik in northern Greenland never received their ballots due to inclement weather, according to Danish reports. So an Air Greenland base manager on his 4x4 and a local hunter on dog sled joined forces to deliver the ballots on time.",
      "Planes, helicopters, ships, speedboats, cars, snowmobiles and dog sleds are routinely employed to ensure ballots reach all corners of the country before the election.",

      "Other parties are more careful and have avoided giving exact timelines.",

      "\"At the moment, [Greenland] is not ready for independence,\" the director of the Bank of Greenland Martin Kviesgaard told Danish media on the eve of the election. \"It will take many years to become completely ready for it, if you are talking about becoming financially self-sufficient...

      "\"I'm extremely proud of it. I put my soul into it and I'm still hurting from making it,\" Mo says.",

      "Mo says he wanted to keep the \"greater context\" in mind and that focusing on 7 October and its aftermath  \"almost insinuates this just started\".",
      "\"That couldn't be further from the truth,\" he says, referring to the long history of the conflict.",

      "He says he wanted to cover \"the main strokes\", which included how difficult it can be to enter and live as a Palestinian once there.",
      "\"Immediately, you're not on vacation,\" he says. \"You're on edge, actually.\"",
      "Mo feels there has generally been limited representation of Palestinians in TV and film, which means more pressure on his shoulders.",
      "\"There's a lot of [pressure] from the fans\u2026 more outside voices of what I should say and not say - both Palestinian and non-Palestinian,\" he says.",

      "An argument in the White House tore apart the US alliance with Ukraine, shook European leaders and highlighted JD Vance's key role in forcefully expressing Donald Trump's foreign policy. The vice-president has come out punching on the global stage - so what is it that drives his worldview?",
      "Vance's first major foreign speech, at the Munich Security Conference in mid-February, caught many by surprise.",
      "Rather than focusing on the war raging in Ukraine, the US vice-president only briefly mentioned the bloodiest European conflict since World War Two.",
      "Instead, he used his debut on the international stage to berate close US allies about immigration and free speech, suggesting the European establishment was anti-democratic. He accused them of ignoring the wills of their people and questioned what shared values they were truly banding together with the US to defend.",
      "\"If you are running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you, nor for that matter is there anything you can do for the American people,\" he warned.",
      "It was a bold and perhaps unexpected way to introduce himself to the world - by angering European allies. But days later he was back in the news, at the centre of a blistering row with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whom he accused of being ungrateful.",
      "For those who have been studying the rise of Vance, these two episodes came as no surprise.",
      "The vice-president has come to represent an intellectual wing of the conservative movement that gives expression to Trumpism and in particular how its America First mantra applies beyond its borders. In writings and interviews, Vance has expressed an ideology that seems to join the dots between American workers, global elites and the role of the US in the wider world.",
      "On the campaign trail with Donald Trump last year, Vance spent much of his time sharply criticising Democrats - the usual attack-dog duties that traditionally get dished out to running mates - and sparring with reporters.",
      "The 'hillbilly' Maga loyalist who became vice-presidentVance took the lead attacking Zelensky. Why?",
      "The 'hillbilly' Maga loyalist who became vice-president",
      "Vance took the lead attacking Zelensky. Why?",
      "And while Elon Musk's outsized and unconventional role in the Trump administration initially overshadowed him, that Munich speech and the Oval Office showdown have raised the profile of Trump's deputy.",
      "It's also led to questions about the winding ideological journey he's made during his years in the conservative movement - and what he truly believes now.",
      "\"He's much more of a pragmatist than an ideologue,\" said James Orr, associate professor of philosophy of religion at the University of Cambridge and a friend whom Vance has described as his \"British sherpa\".",
      "\"He's able to articulate what is and is not in the American interest,\" Orr said. \"And the American interest is not the interest of some abstract utopia or matrix of propositions and ideas, but the American people.\"",
      "Vance has repeatedly returned to this \"America First\" - or perhaps \"Americans First\" - theme in speeches, drawing a line between what he castigates as Washington's economic and foreign policy orthodoxy abroad and the struggles of the left-behind American working class at home.",
      "At the Republican National Convention last summer, for example, he lamented how in small towns across the US \"jobs were sent overseas and children were sent to war\". And he attacked then-President Joe Biden, saying: \"For half a century, he's been a champion of every single policy initiative to make America weaker and poorer.\"",
      "But Vance is also someone who, after a tough upbringing in an Ohio family with Appalachian roots and sudden fame on the back of a bestselling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, has tried out many different views.",
      "Not only is he a former \"Never Trumper\" who described the US president in 2016 as \"reprehensible\" and \"an idiot\", his book places much of the blame for the plight of the rural poor squarely on the choices made by individuals.",
      "More recently he's shifted that blame to elites \u2013 a group he's variously defined as Democrats, conventional Republicans, liberals, corporate leaders, globalists and academics.",
      "In speeches, Vance regularly argues that \"America is not just an idea\u2026 America is a nation.\"",
      "He couples this statement with an anecdote about his family's ancestral graveyard in Kentucky, where he says he, his wife and their children will one day be buried, arguing that family and homeland are more important than some of America's traditional core ideas.",
      "In Vance's view, the Trump administration's priority should be to make life better for Americans who have been in the country for generations, and yet have little of the nation's vast wealth.",
      "Rod Dreher, a conservative American writer who is also a friend of the vice-president, said Vance's thinking arises from a belief that \"moderate normie Republicans\u2026 failed to offer anything to stop the so-called forever wars, and they also failed to offer anything to ordinary Americans like where he comes from, who are suffering economically from globalism and from the effects of mass migration and fentanyl\".",
      "\"He got red-pilled, so to speak, by Donald Trump,\" Dreher told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme this week.",
      "\"Red-pilled\" is internet slang for suddenly waking up to a supposedly hidden truth, as featured in The Matrix movies. It's commonly used by those on the right online who believe they have special access to reality and that people with liberal, centrist or establishment views are uncritical thinkers.",
      "Vance is a vice-president who, more than his boss, seems extremely plugged into internet culture. He's an enthusiastic user of X, often jumping directly into arguments rather than using it, as many politicians do, as a platform for announcements.",
      "His appearances on fringe right-wing podcasts, while he was trying to drum up support for a Senate run, provided fodder for his opponents, as did provocative trollish comments such as that the US was being run by \"childless cat ladies\".",
      "Married to the daughter of Indian immigrants, he has rejected and been rejected by members of the alt-right even if he does echo some of their views. However, he does have friends and allies both at the top of Silicon Valley and in some of its lesser known corners.",
      "After graduating from Yale Law School, he was brought into the world of venture capital by influential Silicon Valley conservative Peter Thiel, who later funded his US Senate campaign.",
      "He has cited people like the blogger Curtis Yarvin, a key guru in the \"neo-reactionary\" movement which dreams up fantasies of technologically-assisted, hyper-capitalist societies led by powerful monarchs.",
      "His familiarity with the internet's fringes was further demonstrated when he spread false rumours about immigrants eating pets and an allegation about Ukrainian corruption - which the BBC traced back to Moscow.",
      "Why the Danes now feel threatened by TrumpGreenland heads to polls as Trump eyes territory",
      "Why the Danes now feel threatened by Trump",
      "Greenland heads to polls as Trump eyes territory",
      "\"He sort of stews in this online world,\" said Cathy Young, a writer for the conservative, anti-Trump media outlet The Bulwark.",
      "At the same time, Young said, his anecdote about family graveyards and homeland suggests another political tendency - a \"disturbing undertone of nativism\".",
      "\"That bothers some people and rightly so,\" she said. \"Part of the American legacy is that we are a nation of immigrants. [Former Republican President] Ronald Reagan talked about that, about one of the distinctive things about this country is that anyone can come here from any part of the world and become an American.\"",
      "Vance's \"Americans First\" thinking clearly extends to the issue of the war in Ukraine. When he was a senator, he was often critical of America's involvement in the war and the huge sums spent on it, his former Senate colleague Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, recalled.",
      "\"His position then was very much like what it is now\u2026 that the conflict must end,\" Hawley told the BBC. \"It needs to end in a way that's maximally advantageous to the security of the United States and it needs to end in a way that gets our European allies to take increased responsibility.\"",
      "Vance regularly accused the Biden administration of being more interested in Ukraine than in stemming illegal immigration. Writing in 2022, during his Senate campaign and after the Russian invasion, he said: \"I will be damned if I am going to prioritise Ukraine's eastern border right now when our own southern border is engulfed by a human tsunami of illegal migrants.\"",
      "His views burst out into the open during that dramatic argument with President Zelensky in the Oval Office. Vance accused Zelensky of lacking respect, of sending politicians on a \"propaganda tour\" of Ukraine and of being insufficiently thankful for US aid.",
      "\"Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country,\" he told the Ukrainian president.",
      "The argument left European leaders scrambling to defend Zelensky, while also trying to maintain negotiations over a possible peace deal.",
      "Vance then prompted widespread outrage from allies when he poured scorn on the idea of security guarantees in the form of troops \"from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\".",
      "He later denied he was talking about the UK or France, the only two European countries that have publicly stated their willingness to send peacekeepers to Ukraine.",
      "But the vice-president's willingness to step on the toes of allies reflect a world view which, in his words, has little time for \"moralisms about 'this country is good', 'this country is bad'\".",
      "\"That doesn't mean you have to have a complete moral blind spot, but it means that you have to be honest about the countries that you're dealing with, and there's a complete failure to do that with most of our foreign policy establishment in this country,\" he told a New York Times columnist last year.",
      "His tone has shifted from the two years he spent in the US Senate before being picked by Trump. Democrat Cory Booker remembered Vance as \"very pragmatic and thoughtful\".",
      "\"That's why some of this stuff surprises me,\" Booker told the BBC.",
      "Vance's cousin criticises him for 'belittling' Zelensky",
      "Vance's cousin criticises him for 'belittling' Zelensky",
      "Others detect the same disconnect.",
      "David Frum, now a writer for The Atlantic magazine, said that Vance's views have changed significantly from when he first commissioned the former marine, who was attending Ohio State University at the time, to write for his website on conservative politics more than 15 years ago.",
      "\"He was not in any way the culture warrior that he is today,\" Frum said.",
      "Frum, a former George W Bush speechwriter and staunch critic of Trump, said that Vance's view of Russia represented \"ideological admiration\".",
      "In Munich, as he spoke about free speech, the vice-president cited cases involving conservatives and Christians in Western countries but avoided any mention of Russia's harsh clampdowns on expression.",
      "Vance and his allies reject that he is sympathetic to Putin.",
      "\"I've never once argued that Putin is a kind and friendly person,\" Vance, then an Ohio senator, said in a speech at the 2024 Munich Security Conference.",
      "\"We don't have to agree with him. We can contest him and we often will contest him,\" he said. \"But the fact that he's a bad guy does not mean we can't engage in basic diplomacy and prioritising America's interests.\"",
      "The BBC has asked the White House for comment on Vance's stance in relation to Ukraine and Russia.",
      "A quick end to the conflict in Ukraine is, in Vance's view, not only about putting a stop to billions of dollars being spent thousands of miles away.",
      "He himself has said that there are bigger issues for the US and its friends to focus on than Ukraine, namely the threat of China, which he has called \"our most significant competitor... for the next 20 or 30 years\".",
      "Vance's views on Ukraine and his willingness to publicly air them provided a dramatic moment in the early days of Trump's second presidential term.",
      "But it also offered a vivid illustration of the vice-president's ideology, his prominence in the Trump administration and how he views America's place in the world.",

    "story": [
      "Actor Gene Hackman was alone.",
      "The two-time Academy Award winner didn't make any calls and missed meals.",
      "Medical experts say it's possible the 95-year-old, who was in declining health and suffering from advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, did not even realise his wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living.",
      "If he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act - a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died.",
      "Officials in New Mexico say Betsy Arakawa, 65, died of a rare virus about seven days before Hackman perished on 18 February of natural causes.",
      "The pair - and one of their dogs - were found dead in their Santa Fe home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through a window.",
      "Authorities, at first, said the grim discovery was \"suspicious enough\" to launch an investigation.",
      "Their remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition. Arakawa was found in a bathroom with scattered pills nearby. Hackman was found near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses. One of their three dogs was found dead in a crate.",
      "But a police investigation found no foul play.",
      "Instead, the case has shed light on the grim realities of Alzheimer's disease, which damages and destroys cells in one's brain over time - taking away memory and other important mental functions.",
      "\"It's like he was living in a reel,\" Catherine V Piersol, PhD, an occupational therapist with decades of experience in dementia care, told the BBC of how Hackman may have experienced the repeated loss of his wife.",
      "She noted patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease like the actor live in the present and are unable to both look back at moments in the past or look forward and act.",
      "\"I imagine he would be trying to wake her up and not being successful. But then [he] could have been distracted in another room because of one of the dogs or something,\" she described.",
      "Then later, he'd again notice his wife on the ground and would \"live through it again\", she said.",
      "Though no one knows how Hackman spent his last days alive, the grim nature of the possibilities were discussed by authorities and the area's medical examiner.",
      "At a press conference last week, Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico's chief medical examiner, said Arakawa died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Hackman's death was the result of significant heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor.",
      "Given Hackman's advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", Dr Jarrell said.",
      "His autopsy indicated he had not eaten recently, though he showed no signs of dehydration. Officials found no evidence that he had communicated with anyone after his wife's death and could not determine whether he was able to care for himself.",
      "Ms Piersol said patients with advanced Alzheimer's aren't able to pick up on environmental cues like light and darkness, making it harder to determine when he should eat, sleep or bathe.",
      "\"Those [cues] are oftentimes just, no longer available to people at this stage of dementia,\" she said.",
      "Dr Brendan Kelley, a neurologist who specialises in memory and cognition at UT Southwestern Medical Center, explained why Hackman may also not have been able to call authorities for help. He said Alzheimer's disease can leave patients caught between emotional discomfort and the inability to act on it.",
      "\"A person might feel worried or frightened, but at the same time they might not be capable to take the actions that you or I might normally think to do in order to alleviate that worry or concern, such as calling somebody else, or going to speak to a neighbour.\"",
      "Dr Kelley says Alzheimer's patients experience emotions like pain and sadness, and experience physical needs like hunger and thirst, it's just harder for them to identify what they are feeling.",
      "He said missing meals could also increase levels of confusion and agitation.",
      "The couple's deaths and the startling details of Hackman living in the home for a week after his wife's passing has shocked the Santa Fe area, where the couple had lived for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's just absolutely devastating,\" says Jeffery Gomez, a long-time resident of the city, who remembers seeing Hackman around town in his different cars, always with a smile on his face.",
      "His partner, Linda, said the details were triggering, explaining she cared for her elderly mother with dementia. \"Even when you have help, it's a lot,\" she said.",
      "\"We know Gene and his wife were very private people and she was probably trying to shield him from the public,\" she added, \"but the thought of doing that alone? It's a lot to shoulder.\"",
      "Laura N Gitlin, PhD, a behavioural scientist who researches ways to support caregivers told the BBC, this is becoming a common problem among caregivers.",
      "\"With the aging of a population, we also simultaneously have a shrinking of the number of people in the family, number of children, or relatives who live nearby,\" she explained.",
      "Ms Gitlin noted along with there being fewer caregivers, there is less support for these individuals on making big decisions - such as when it's time to place a loved one in a home instead of caring for them by yourself.",
      "Jeffery Gomez said he couldn't understand how no one checked in on the couple for such a long while.",

    "story": [
      "Tesla facilities across the US are facing protests and vandalism in response to the political role Elon Musk, who owns the car manufacturer, has played in the Trump administration.",
      "Most \"Tesla Takedown\" protests have been peaceful, but a few have been destructive with fires intentionally set at Tesla showrooms and charging stations in Colorado and Massachusetts last week.",
      "That was followed by six arrests in New York over the weekend when hundreds of protesters occupied a Tesla showroom.",
      "There has also been a spike in Cybertruck vandalism across the US, and some car owners are defacing their own Teslas in protest of Musk.",
      "One woman showed up to a protest outside a Burbank Tesla on Sunday with an expletive and Musk's name scrawled in chalk across her white Model X sedan. Another car carried an \"Anti Elon Tesla Club\" sticker.",
      "The protests illustrate a growing unease over Musk's influence on the US government since President Donald Trump allowed him to create the cost-cutting task force Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "So far, Doge has fired or offered buyouts to about 100,000 federal employees and gained access to the sensitive personal and financial information of millions of Americans.",
      "Critics have resorted to calling the tech billionaire \"President Musk\", arguing that he has too much power in the White House. Some at the protest in Burbank held signs that said \"Deport Elon\" and \"Boycott Swasticar\" - with protesters attempting to connect the car to fascism.",
      "Tesla produced the must-have electric cars for many Americans with progressive views, but several protesters said they regretted their purchase after Musk involved himself with Trump and US politics.",
      "Karen Rabwin, a protester at the Burbank Tesla on Sunday, attended just two days after trading in her Tesla for a Cadillac. She had slapped a bumper sticker on her old vehicle that read \"Bought This Car Before We Knew\" in a veiled reference to Musk, but she felt that wasn't enough.",

      "\"Heartfelt thanks to everyone supporting Tesla, despite many attacks against our stores and offices,\" Musk wrote.",

      "While Tesla's share price surged after Trump was elected - with Musk by his side on election night in Florida - they have tumbled back to pre-election levels following the  backlash to Musk's political involvement.",
      "Some on Sunday also raised concerns that Musk's government involvement is benefiting his businesses.",
      "Critics note that the tech entrepeneur's companies have billions of dollars of contracts with the US government, primarily with Nasa and the Defense Department, which are increasingly reliant on Musk's SpaceX for satellite launches and space exploration.",
      "Last week, reports claimed the Musk had attempted to get the Federal Aviation Administration to cancel a $2.4bn (\u00a31.9bn) contract with Verizon to revamp the agency's telecommunications system and awarding it to Starlink, a company owned by SpaceX, instead.",
      "SpaceX denied that report, posting on X that \"Starlink is a possible partial fix to an aging system. There is no effort or intent for Starlink to 'take over' any existing contract\".",
      "Some constituents are furious at Musk's involvement and the White House's effort to cut certain jobs and programmes. Many have shown up at Republican town halls to protest the cuts and the tech billionaire's growing influence.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republican leaders urged members of their party to stop hosting events in response, claiming without evidence that they were being disrupted by \"professional protesters\"."

    "summary": "Ruth Marcus, a longtime op-ed writer for the Washington Post, quit on Monday after, she said, her column criticizing owner Jeff Bezos was killed by publisher.",
    "story": [
      "A columnist who has worked at The Washington Post for four decades resigned on Monday after she said the newspaper's management decided not to run her commentary critical of owner Jeff Bezos' new editorial policy.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,\" Ruth Marcus, who has\u00a0worked\u00a0at the newspaper since 1984, wrote in a resignation letter.",
      "Her exit is the latest fallout from the billionaire owner's directive that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.",
      "The storied newspaper has been in a free fall, financially and editorially, over the past year. Marcus, who worked in the news and opinion departments during her career, is \"the bedrock of The Washington Post, embodying the history of the place as well as the talent and accomplishments of its journalists,\" said Paul Farhi, a former media reporter there.",
      "Marcus, who was a finalist for the\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for Commentary\u00a0in 2007, said that the Post's publisher, Will Lewis, declined to run her column, which she described as \"respectfully dissenting\" from Bezos' edict. It was the first time in nearly 20 years of writing columns that she's had one killed, she said.",
      "The decision \"underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,\" she wrote. Her resignation letter was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A Post spokesperson said Monday that \"we're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years. We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"",
      "While Bezos and Lewis have the right to make such decisions \u2014 they're the bosses \u2014 \"that has not been the tradition,\" Farhi said. He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.",
      "The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.",
      "Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.",
      "In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.",
      "Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"",
      "The Post's opinion section on Monday included an editorial opposing Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Columnists Max Boot wrote about Trump and Russia, Perry Bacon Jr. about Democratic resistance to Trump centering in the states, Phillip Bump on whether Trump would pay a political price for unpopular policies and Jim Geraghty about violence in Syria.",
      "The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years and its internal strife largely began last June, when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists \u2014 among them Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Matea Gold, Jackie Alemany, Michael Scherer and Will Sommer \u2014 have left for other jobs.",
      "Bezos' decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate \u2014 after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris \u2014 led to an exodus of subscribers that the newspaper is fighting to recover from.",
      "Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor when Bezos bought the paper in 2013, wrote last week in the Atlantic that Bezos \"handled his ownership admirably for more than a decade. But his courage failed him when he needed it the most.\"",
      "Marcus' resignation on Monday overshadowed a newsroom reorganization plan introduced by Murray, including separating workflows for the Post's digital and print products.",

    "story": [
      "Discussion Questions",
      "1. Amy Griffin spent much of her adult life determined to move forward, never letting herself stop to look back. What do you think eventually motivated her to want to revisit her past and then to tell her story? Talk about the courage it takes to confront one's past\u2014and to share it with the world. Have you ever decided to divulge something about yourself that you once felt was impossible to share?",
      "2. Amy was a star student in her small Texas town, and she became a high-achieving businesswoman after arriving in New York. Talk about ambition as a trauma response. Do you think Amy believed she could outwork (and outrun) her past? How can \"The Tell\" serve as a reminder that people who appear to \"have it all\" are not always as they seem?",
      "3. A physical therapist tells Amy: \"There's something your body is telling you that you don't want to hear.\" How did her body's message manifest? What messages has your body sent you over the years? What makes it hard for you to listen to the messages your body sends?",
      "4. John supports Amy's decision to try therapy with Olivia and he works to keep the family's life afloat at home while she takes time to process what she's uncovered. But John also understands his own limits, telling Amy when she needs to find outside support so he can just be her husband. How does he know when to place this boundary? How does Amy react to this? Have you ever had to place a difficult boundary to preserve a relationship?",
      "5. Would you try psychedelic-assisted therapy? Why or why not?",
      "6. \"I needed to find the evidence that would confirm my memories,\" Amy writes in her journal. Why do you think Amy needs others to confirm what she knows to be true?",
      "7. What did you learn from \"The Tell\" and from Amy's sessions with Lauren about how memory works? Consider the distinction between memory storage and memory recall, for instance. What did you find most surprising?",
      "8. \"My daughters were asking me to participate in life, and in our relationship, in a way that I could not.\" How do Amy's children both trigger her memories\u2014and help her heal?",
      "9. For years, Amy remembers so many details around the abuse, but not the abuse itself. She saw clues, but not the full picture of her trauma. How did \"The Tell\" make you consider\u2014or reconsider\u2014your own life events and memories? Is there anything you might be unable or unwilling to remember? Have you ever surprised yourself by \"unlocking\" an unexpected memory?",
      "10. Amy begins to feel that justice will bring her closure. How was Paul's story both a helpful\u2014and unfortunately rare\u2014example for Amy? How does it affect her when she realizes her own story might not have such a tidy or satisfying outcome?",
      "11. What was it like for her to tell her parents? Have you ever had to have a difficult conversation with your parents about your childhood? What did you learn through that conversation\u2014about yourself or about them?",
      "12. Amy was raised in a traditional patriarchal Texas culture. Children were expected to both respect and obey their elders. How do the environments of our childhoods\u2014and the cultures in which we are raised\u2014inform our adult choices? How can our backgrounds influence what we can and cannot face in our personal histories?",
      "13. Amy recognizes the resources and time she was able to devote to both her healing and pursuing her legal case. How are situations of abuse and survival different for those without the same resources? In what ways might financial and class privileges insulate you from pain, or not?",
      "14. At the beginning of her journey, Amy can't \"tell\" her secret to herself. By the end, she's realized \"the telling is the medicine.\" How does telling her story help Amy heal?",
      "15. How does Amy give herself the closure she needs?",
      "16. Who do you think wrote the postcard? Does the writer's identity matter?",
      "17. What was your biggest takeaway from \"The Tell\"?",

The Broadway version is a stand-in for the city's corroded grandeur, and for the studio where, in 1996, a group of old, mostly forgotten Cuban musicians recorded the album.",
      "Justin Cunningham, as Juan de Marcos: \"What follows is the story of a band. Not ours, though we will do our best. Some of what follows is true. Some of it only feels true.\"",
      "The true part: the real person this actor is playing, Juan de Marcos Gonzalez, had already located and brought together the old musicians before music producers Ry Cooder and Nick Gold showed up in Havana. When their plan to make an album pairing Cuban and West African performers fell through, they went with Plan B, and recorded with the group Juan de Marcos had assembled.",
      "\"I was so happy, because they were my idols,\" Juan said. \"You know, I grew up with, you know, listening to their music. And then suddenly, I was the bandleader.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did any of the people involved, including you, have any idea that what became 'Buena Vista Social Club' would be something big?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"They became pop stars. It was like an unbelievable thing.\"",
      "The unexpected and irresistible phenomenon that resulted is the subject of the Oscar-nominated 1999 Wim Wenders documentary.",
      "\"It was just ubiquitous; I mean, you would hear this music everywhere,\" said music journalist and Substack contributor Judy Cantor-Navas, the author of \"Cuba on Record.\" \"To say that, 'Yes, we're listening to this old Cuban music that is suddenly selling millions of albums,' seemed like something that was very unlikely.\"",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think people loved the music so much?\"",
      "\"Cuban music has really appealed to so many different kinds of people,\" said Cantor-Navas. \"They say that it has, you know, the perfect combination of the Afro-Cuban rhythms and the Spanish melodies that came together in Cuba. It's just this very infectious music that, like, gets in your soul.\"",
      "It wasn't just the music they loved. It was who the musicians were \u2013 the improbable last act of their careers. The album won a Grammy, and has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide.",
      "\"And they were so happy, you know, because they came back to the stage,\" said Juan de Marcos. \"Because if you are a musician, and you are an artist, you are always an artist, you know? And even when you're retired, you have this small candle in your heart.\"",
      "Singer-dancer Omara Portuondo was 67; singer Ibrahim Ferrer was 70. Other band members were as old as 90. They began touring the world, even singing to me for a \"Sunday Morning\" story 25 years ago. \"I still have to pinch myself to make sure I'm not asleep and dreaming,\" Ferrer said then. \"I never thought I'd have so much success.\"",

      "Marco Ramirez wrote the Broadway show. \"I'm Cuban American. I was born and raised in Miami, but my parents and my family's Cuban,\" he said. \"And so, for me what brought me to this was the music. It was music that I was raised around my entire life.",
      "He was 14 when the album came out: \"This was a moment of intense pride, of us realizing that the world cared about our music, and that these songs that I was used to hearing on my grandfather's little yellow Sony boom box above the washing machine, these were songs that suddenly the whole world cared about. That meant everything to me.\"",
      "Saheem Ali, the director of the show, grew up in Kenya. His father, an airline pilot, brought the album home. He became obsessed with it. \"I kept listening to it on repeat,\" he said. \"Something about the lyrics spoke to me. I learned the lyrics without knowing what I was talking about, 'cause Swahili's my first language.",
      "\"I knew nothing about their stories, absolutely nothing. The first time I knew about the stories was reading Marco's script. That's what excited me about this musical. People are gonna know about them now in a way that young people like me never had a chance to.\"",

It was shut down after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. The events of the Cuban Revolution lurk at the edges of the show.",
      "Playing yesterday's Cuban music on Broadway are some of today's finest Cuban musicians, most of whom now live outside Cuba, because making a living there is tough.",
      "Juan de Marcos said, \"The people going to see the real Cuba, they are going to get a piece of our country when they attend the musical. We have nothing in our country. We don't have oil, we don't have gold, but we have the music, beautiful ladies, good coffee, the best cigars, and the best rum. And the music, which is the most important thing, like food for us.\"",

    "summary": "Dylan Mulvaney opens up about the challenges of living as a trans woman in America, the fall out of the Bud Light campaign backlash and her new memoir.",
    "story": [
      "Dylan Mulvaney\u00a0burst onto the scene as a TikTok star, but what made her most famous was controversy. The trans influencer and performer was targeted after appearing in a campaign for Bud Light in 2023.",
      "In her new memoir, \"Paper Doll: Notes from a Late Bloomer,\" Mulvaney shares journal entries documenting the first year of her gender transition.",
      "\"I think of the book as like a quarter life crisis. But at the end of the day, I think it has a lot more heart than social media ever can have,\" Mulvaney said.",
      "Her TikTok series \"Days of Girlhood\" became a viral sensation, attracting more than one billion views. As her profile grew, the 28-year-old became a regular on red carpets.",
      "Mulvaney said she knew her gender identity from an early age.",
      "\"I knew I was a girl. That was one of the purest thoughts and intentions I've ever had throughout my entire life was to be brought into this world and to, so clearly, know who I was, and then to be told otherwise, is very conflicting,\" she said.",
      "She first came out as gay at 14, but it took another decade to embrace her identity as a trans woman.",
      "\"I settled into the identity as gay because that was all I saw around me,\" she explained.",
      "In 2023, Mulvaney joined celebrities partnering with Bud Light for a social media campaign. Her content was singled out by conservatives, leading to widespread backlash and\u00a0boycotts. Bud Light's parent company, Anheuser-Busch, saw its revenue fall by more than 10% after the campaign was released.",
      "\"It took a lot to not feel guilty about that experience because I felt like it was my fault. And that me taking this one brand deal was affecting trans people globally,\" Mulvaney said. \"I think extremists and transphobic media needed a poster child, but I would've never done anything or taken any deal that I thought could negatively impact me or the community.\"",
      "The experience affected her mental health, she said.",
      "\"It resulted in a lot of suicidal ideation and dissociation,\" Mulvaney said. \"I'm still battling with some of that guilt and that shame, and that dysphoria that was projected onto me during that time.\"",
      "Her new book comes amid renewed debate over transgender rights in the U.S. Last month, a group of transgender people filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's executive order that halted gender marker changes on passports.",
      "For Mulvaney, the executive order doesn't change how she feels.",
      "\"I'm a woman no matter what my passport says. We are not hurting anyone,\" she said. \"We're less than 1% of the population. And the way that they speak about us so often is as if we're taking over cities like Godzilla.\"",
      "\"I am now realizing that this is life or death for a lot of people,\" she added. \"I want every trans person in this country to have the opportunity to thrive. And unfortunately, we're living in a time where it is very hard to do so.\"",

      "The veteran actor explained that the dual role, where he portrays both Frank and Vito in \"The Alto Knights,\" required precise positioning and careful coordination with cameras on dollies moving around the set.",
      "\"It's a technical thing where you have to be in a certain spot,\" De Niro said.",
      "To make the rapid-fire dialogue between his characters work, he enlisted another actor to read opposite him during filming.",
      "\"When I would do Frank, he would do Vito. When I would do Vito, he would do Frank,\" De Niro explained. \"I couldn't just do it with nothing. I had to have another actor, a person who understood that world.\"",

      "\"I didn't want it to be just a gimmick,\" De Niro said about the eventual decision to have him play both roles. \"But I thought there is something interesting about it.\"",
      "When discussing his approach to character preparation, De Niro noted that requirements vary by role. For his recent political series, \"Zero Day,\" he relied heavily on existing footage of politicians.",

    "summary": "The Emmy Award-winning comedian and former \"SNL\" writer became a superstar as a stand-up; now, he's sitting down, as host of a Netflix talk show, \"Everybody's Live with John Mulaney.\"",
    "story": [
      "John Mulaney is a comedy superstar finding the funny in the familiar.\u00a0 At 42, he already has five highly-rated specials to his name \u2026 three primetime Emmys \u2026 and a reputation as one of the best stand-up guys in the game.",
      "\"Now, I don't know if you've been following the news but I've been keeping my ears open, and it seems like everyone everywhere is super-mad about everything all the time.\"",
      "But for his new job, the stand-up is sitting down. Mulaney is hosting a talk show on Netflix, complete with a couch and celebrity guests. And the whole thing is live, in part because he likes it better that way. \"It feels like there's more at stake,\" he said. \"I love that. It's the best.\"",
      "I asked, \"Explain that feeling \u2013 it's like coming up against a cliff and kind of dangling over it?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"It's dangling over it all the time.\"",
      "It began as an experiment during the Netflix Comedy Festival last year, called \"Everybody's in L.A.,\" talking about \"L.A. things,\" like earthquakes and coyotes. Now the show is back with a broader focus, and a new name, \"Everybody's Live With John Mulaney.\" It will go live every Wednesday night, starting this week. \"It's a fun feeling to know that hopefully a lot of people are watching,\" he said, \"and it's live, globally, with no delays, and you could really damage your career!\"",
      "To watch a teaser for \"Everybody's Live With John Mulaney,\" click on the video player below:",
      "And he knows all about live TV. For Mulaney, \"Saturday Night Live\" is home turf. He started as a writer there in 2008, and helped create some of the show's biggest characters, like Bill Hader's Stefon. Mulaney would often change the script at the last second to throw Hader off, like during this Halloween skit:",
      "Stefon: \"Have you heard of Blacula, the Black Dracula? Well, they have a Jewish Dracula.\"Seth Meyers: \"Oh, what's his name?\"Stefon: \"Sidney Applebaum!\"",
      "Seems like this was the thing John Mulaney was born to do. Raised in Chicago, Mulaney says he grew up feeling that comedy was his destiny. Asked if he has a memory of when he realized that he was funny, Mulaney said, \"Always interesting in these things, 'cause you don't want to sound egotistical, but I don't remember a time when I didn't think I was funny.\"",
      "Not long after graduating from Georgetown, he joined \"SNL,\" and a career was launched. He made his mark in New York, but he's fascinated with Southern California, where he now lives year-round.",
      "He took us record shopping at one of his favorite places, the legendary Amoeba Music in Hollywood.",
      "I asked, \"When you come out to places like this, do people come up to you? Or do they leave you alone?\"",
      "\"A little bit,\" he said. \"My joke is that I'm like Louis Farrakhan: I mean a lot to a small group of people.\"",
      "Truth is, Mulaney is a lot bigger than he'll admit. In his most recent special, \"Baby J,\" he played to a sold-out crowd and focused on his drug addiction, and recovery. He describes a 2020 intervention on his behalf staged by friends like Seth Meyers and Fred Armisen: \"Let me just call this out now, I don't mean to be weird, it was a star-studded intervention.\"",
      "It's funny now, of course: Mulaney says he's been clean for more than four years.",
      "Asked if sobriety is something he thinks about every day, Mulaney replied, \"Well, that's a good question. I don't think about cocaine, opioids, and benzodiazeprine every day. I'll acknowledge that I understand the vigilance I need. I do not think about it every day. I just don't. I do think about the ways that I can lead my life to perhaps never feel the kind of strain that got me there. So, yeah, sobriety maybe being, like, a bigger term than just abstaining from the chemicals, I definitely think about it every day.\"",
      "Mulaney credits his wife, actress Olivia Munn, with helping him navigate his recovery. You might remember her from Aaron Sorkin's \"The Newsroom,\" or \"X-Men: Apocalypse,\" in which she played Psylocke. But she's a bit of a superhero in real life as well; she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2023, and has shared her whole journey online, from the initial test to a double mastectomy. Other women have since credited her with saving their lives.",
      "Mulaney said, \"There's this lifetime risk assessment test that is really the only reason her cancer was discovered. And seeing so many women publicly and privately come to her that [say] they discovered how high their risk was from that, it's astonishing.\"",
      "She's also mom to their two young children, Malcom and Mei. \"I have this feeling a lot of times, I go, 'I can't believe I know this person, let alone am married to her,'\" he said.",
      "Fatherhood has given him not only new material, but also a whole new outlook on life.",
      "From his November 2024 monologue on \"Saturday Night Live\":",
      "\"My wife and I just welcomed a baby girl into our family. \u2026 My wife takes care of the five-week-old, and I take the two-year-old out. And that's not fair. That's not an equal distribution of labor at all. Saying, 'You have a five-week-old, I'll take a two-year-old,' that's like saying, 'I'll transport this convict across state lines. You hold a potato.'\"",
      "John Mulaney has made a good life making people laugh. Now, as a husband and father of two, he says he has something to live for.",
      "Asked how fatherhood has changed how he looks at the world, Mulaney replied, \"I'm in the world now that I'm a father. My head was my only home before that. When my son was born, the first thought I had was, I went, 'Oh, there you are.' And when my daughter was born, I had this \u2013 not to sound 'woo-woo' or anything \u2013 but when she was born, I went, 'Oh!' My thought was like, 'Oh, we've met before. I've collided with you some other time.' So, it's like these people came in that just, I don't know, make me like the world a lot more.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 09:58:42 -0400",
    "summary": "In the world of alpine skiing, few have been more decorated. Fast, fearless and resilient, Lindsey Vonn fought her way back after every crash, until she retired at 34. But now, with a titanium knee replacement, she is eyeing one more trip to the Olympics.",
    "story": [
      "For Lindsey Vonn, it was a reluctant farewell \u2013 the last run of her stellar career, at the Alpine World Ski Championships in Are, Sweden, in 2019. In the world of alpine skiing, few have been more decorated. She's won almost every major title, from World Cup Championships to Olympic medals, as the trophy case in her home proves.",
      "She says when she's racing, she doesn't think about the achievements: \"I think you just have a different perspective. You're focused on the next one, racing and performance, and you never really get to look back and say, 'Hey, good job,' you know?\"",
      "She was fast, reaching speeds of up to 85 mph. She was also fearless, and resilient. Crash after terrible crash, she always fought her way back. But 2013 was one of her hardest seasons. Vonn's right knee bore the brunt of a crash in the World Cup Super-G, and it was never the same. Flash forward almost six years, on the day of her last race \u2013 bum knee and all \u2013 she still managed to take home the bronze.",
      "At 34, Lindsey Vonn was retired.",
      "\"Skiing was always my sun, and everything in my life revolved around it: What time I woke up, what I ate, when I went to bed. It was all dictated around what's best for my skiing career,\" she said. \"And then, I woke up one day and my sun is gone.\"",
      "Ski racing is all Vonn ever wanted. Her dad, a former alpine skier himself, moved the family from Minnesota to Vail, Colorado, just so that Lindsey could train for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Those same slopes she now sees from her home in Park City, Utah.",
      "\"This is kind of just where I go to, you know, re-group and recharge my batteries,\" she said. \"And the dogs love it.\"",
      "In retirement, Vonn has kept many of her corporate sponsors, which helped her buy homes in Miami and Beverly Hills. She continued to wow red carpets, and not racing gave her more time to pour into her foundation, helping under-served girls achieve their own athletic dreams.",
      "But that knee kept getting worse. \"I just couldn't do the things I love to do anymore,\" she said. \"It was really bad. I couldn't straighten it all the way. I couldn't flex it all the way. And so, I was just stuck in this half-state that ended up causing hip pain, back pain, neck pain. It wasn't just my knee, unfortunately. It was kind of everything. It's like you get to the end of your rope and you gotta make a decision. So, I did.\"",
      "A knee replacement \u2013 the outer portion of her right knee is now titanium.",
      "But she didn't do it just to get back into skiing. \"I don't need to ski,\" she said. \"I am Lindsey. I am not a skier; I'm a person that loves to ski. And that's a really big distinction for me, in my mind, in my heart.\"",
      "I asked, \"How soon afterwards did you wonder how far you could push it?\"",
      "\"It was pretty quickly after!\" she laughed.",
      "Only four months, in fact. She took her coaches to New Zealand to acquaint her new knee with her old sport. \"It just was such a drastic difference that I thought, well, if I can do all of these things that used to hurt me before, where would that take me? And my mind starts to wander, and here we are.\"",
      "And where she is, is back on the U.S. ski team, hoping to qualify for one more trip to the Olympics: Italy 2026.",
      "\"I will be at a disadvantage,\" Vonn said. \"I am 40, and at that time next year I will be 41. But I know my skiing is there. I think I'm actually skiing better now than I was last few years of my career.\"",
      "She admits there has been some good-natured ribbing: \"For sure. There's one girl that calls me Grandma, which I don't exactly appreciate! But there's definitely some jokes around the team that, you know, I raced in my first Olympics before one of the girls was born.\"",
      "She knew there would be some raised eyebrows, but she got more than that, with some critics going so far as to question her sanity. \"These past few weeks have been tough,\" she posted on Instagram last month. \"I know they are only a few voices out of many\u2026 But it still hurts.\"",
      "A post shared by L I N D S E Y  \u2022  V O N N (@lindseyvonn)",
      "She told us, \"What I didn't expect was people to criticize me as a person and why I'm doing it, and that I can't handle life outside of ski racing.\"",
      "She dismisses most of it, choosing to concentrate on training smarter, not harder. \"It's not like I'm preparing for another ten years of my skiing career,\" she said. \"I'm just preparing for one year, for literally two races.\"",
      "She's put the rest of her life on hold for the moment \u2013 a single goal does require a singularity of focus, much like making her banana bread does. And there's a purpose to that: \"I need to put on weight, man,\" she said. \"I'm about 20 pounds less than when I was racing before.\"",
      "That brand of determination, she says, came from her mom, Lindy Lund. \"She would have given anything to play tennis, to play squash, to ride a bike, and she couldn't,\" Vonn said.",
      "Her mom suffered a stroke while pregnant with Lindsey in 1984. It was debilitating, but she soldiered on without complaint. When she was diagnosed with ALS (once known as Lou Gehrig's Disease), she \u2013 like her daughter \u2013 wasn't about to give up. \"She thought that she could beat the odds, and she could be the one that would live 20 more years, and she lasted one,\" Vonn said. \"Man, it was hard. I still got her number in my phone. I still message her.\"",
      "She said her mom would want her to be flying high once again, even though winning another downhill will be an uphill battle. In a sport measured in hundredths of a second, the difference between first and last can be miniscule. But on this second go-around, Lindsey Vonn is taking time to savor the view just as much as the chase.",
      "\"The fact that I'm even talking about going to the Olympics right now is something I never thought I would ever do,\" she said. \"So, I'm already winning!\"",

      "Daffodils",
      "Sprouting in beautiful shades of yellow, orange, peach, white, cream, and even pink, daffodils\u2014known by their botanical name Narcissus\u2014are an early sign that spring has sprung.",
      "Some tried-and-true cultivars are the 'Golden Ducat', 'Rip Van Winkle', and 'Petit Four'\u2014all examples of the double daffodil, featuring one or more flowers to a stem. Another common variety is the trumpet daffodil, which has a center that is as long or longer than its petals. Large-cupped daffodils are defined by their prominent cups, while small-cup iterations have short cups that are less than one-third the length of the petals.",
      "Don't worry about recognizing all the different varieties; just choose what you like from your local garden center or online resource. Because no matter the type, daffodils (and other small bulbs) are so rewarding. The blooms last for two or three weeks in the garden and bring such color to your landscape. They are also low maintenance.",
      "Here are some tips to help you make the most of these perennial crowd-pleasers.",
      "Daffodils are winter-hardy in zones 3 through 8 and will return to bloom again year after year so long as they are planted in full or partial sun and in any soil that's not soggy.If your goal is to have drifts of daffodils, include varieties recommended for naturalizing and forming carpets on lawns and into woodlands. That way, the 100 bulbs you plant this fall will gradually multiply to 300, then 600, then 1,000, and so on.When planting en masse, it helps to create a planting \"map\" in advance on paper that can be transferred onto the ground with granular lime, as Martha does (see photo).Daffodil bulbs should be planted about two to three times as deep as the bulbs are high, so if you have one that's 2 inches tall, plant it 4 to 6 inches below the top of the soil.When harvesting for arrangements, grasp the stem at the base and pull rather than cutting, as viruses in bulbs can be passed along to other plants when using pruners to trim stems.Don't cut back daffodils too soon. Once the flowers bloom and fade, allow the whole plant to die back to the ground to create food for the bulbs so they can multiply.After removing spent foliage, apply a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer over the entire area, and then add a layer of mulch. Fertilize the area again in the fall.",

      "It is nowhere you chose to be, and yet here you are. Papa steers your shoulders into the heart of the jack drive. Hundreds of rabbits stare at you through the wire around the fence posts. It feels like looking into the mirror. They do not want to be in this story either. Men have been working since dawn to herd the wild jacks into this pen. The town has gathered to solve the problem of the rabbits, who chew through rangeland and cropland, who eat the golden wheat your papa turns into money. Worse than the locusts, says Papa. Every hide brings a penny bounty. So many turnipy sweating bodies and a festive feeling in the air like a penny rubbed between two fingers, like blood shocked into a socket. A smell that reminds you of the room where babies are born. When you try to turn and run away, Papa grabs you. There's Mr. O'Malley, Mr. Waldowko, Mr. Zalewski, Mrs. Haage. You can't remember any more names. A hundred jointed arms come swinging into the pen that is alive with jackrabbits, the place of no escape. Now there is only madness. Terror of cudgels, terror of ax handles and hammers, terror of being trampled. \"Papa! Help! Stop!\" Rabbits run over your feet. \"Settle down, Harp\u2014\u00ad \" Papa is angry. He pours your name over your head like scalding water. The rabbits are angry. The rabbits are crying and dying, the clubs coming down, down, down. \"If you ain't gonna help, stay clear of us, boy\u2014\u00ad \" You are six today. Your family will have a party after supper. The cake was cooling when you left for town. You feel sick thinking about it. Cherries come slopping out of the rabbits. Gray skins are splitting, slipping under bootheels and wooden bats. Papa shows you what to target: the skulls and the spines of the screaming jacks. It's the fastest way to stop their screaming. There is another way, a voice cries out inside you. Smash it flat. You watch Papa click into his rhythm and begin to kill alongside the rest of the men.",
      "You meet your baby sister's gaze through the fan of her clean fingers. Lada is sitting on your mother's lap. Three girls you know are watching from outside the fence. The girls are allowed to squeal and shield their faces. You wish you were a girl with them. Down, down, down come the clubs and the planks. Your stomach bulges and flattens. You are screaming with the rabbits. Your birthday wish is to get to the end of this sound. Quiet comes at last. The men's arms rest against their sides like tools in a shed. Women are hanging the dead jacks to dry by their long ears. Every twitching rabbit's foot has stilled. Inside of you, the screaming continues. It goes on and on and on. Papa finds you where you have hidden your eyes behind your hands, your tears inside your palms. \"We can't let the jacks overrun the whole prairie. No one likes it, Son.\" This is a lie. Many had liked it. You shut your eyes along with the dead rabbits, because you did not want to see whose faces were smiling.",
      "\"Here,\" says Papa. \"One is still living. You cannot be softhearted, Harp.\"",
      "Your father puts the club in your hands. And after that, you are always afraid.",

      "By the time it occurred to Cece that her mother was dying, she was dead. Even then, it seemed like possibly a mistake, like there was no way in hell her mother would have agreed to it. Cece hunched through the memorial service, unable to speak or move or smile. People hugged her, one after another, a series of random blows. At the national cemetery, she stood on the perfect lawn rolling down to a smudge of ocean in the distance, the tombstones a run of dominoes waiting to be tipped, feeling like she'd been beamed to an alien planet. She could not fathom her own fingers. It was a military burial, with guards of honor and a flag-folding ceremony and a lone bugler playing \"Taps.\" The long, sorrowful notes floated over the cemetery, turning everything into the tragic plot point in a movie: the gravesites and their wilting flowers, the guards of honor frozen like statues, the hole in the ground where her mother would be lowered and transformed into a skeleton. Such was the grace and beauty of the bugler's playing that Cece, returning to Earth for a moment, couldn't help being moved. It seemed to give form to the precious void inside her. Then the bugler stopped in midnote, as if he'd forgotten what song he was performing. He turned red with embarrassment. Finally, he took the bugle from his lips and shook it, and it played the lost note for a second, as if possessed by a ghost. It wasn't a real instrument at all, Cece realized, but a stereo made to look like one. The thing had run out of charge. A couple of the mourners giggled. Cece glanced behind her, startled. Later, in the middle of the eulogy, the bugle began playing again from its case.",
      "Strangeness and sorrow. Strangeness and sorrow. Cece went back to school, amazed that her life still existed.\u00a0My mother is dead,\u00a0she told herself, over and over, not immune to its dramatic value. It was precisely this sense of being in a play or a movie that made her death feel temporary. At any minute the play would end and her mother would be alive again, taking her to the beach like she used to every weekend; Cece would massage her head while they watched stupid shows together, dizzy with the smell of sweat and jojoba oil. (That smell! When Cece was little, she used to suck on her mother's hair, put strands of it in her mouth.) Cece missed her so much it howled through her like a wind. She stopped eating. On the soccer field she stood there shivering, staring at the grass. Her friends, understanding at first, eventually gave up on her, stopped asking her to parties and the Galleria, to bonfires at the beach. When her father wasn't home, Cece sometimes sneaked into his room and stripped the mattress, gazing at the orphaned sweat stain, pale as a shadow, where her mother used to sleep.",
      "Once, the phone rang and Cece picked it up: her mother's hair salon asking to confirm an appointment. \"She died,\" Cece said, perhaps too softly to be heard, because the woman on the phone said, \"I believe so, yes. A coloring. Missed the last one, so wanted to confirm.\" The next day, Cece drove to the hair salon and showed up for the appointment. The hairdresser didn't question who she was. He led her to a chair, then grabbed a book of color swatches and handed it to her. Cece flipped through the book\u2014a rainbow of tiny rabbit's feet\u2014and found one that matched her mother's hair. She smelled the swatch, but of course it smelled like nothing. She cried and cried, for the first time since the funeral. The hairdresser, perhaps used to such things, ignored her. He painted and foiled Cece's hair, then rinsed it out and revealed the hideous product of her grief.",

      "I have always longed to be known, truly known, by another human being. Sometimes we live for years with yearnings that we cannot name. Until a crack appears in the sky and widens and reveals us to ourselves, as the pandemic did, because it was during lockdown that I began to sift through my life and give names to things long unnamed. I vowed at first to make the most of this collective sequestering: if I had no choice but to stay indoors, then I would oil my thinning edges every day, drink eight tall glasses of water, jog on the treadmill, sleep long, luxurious hours, and pat rich serums on my skin. But, only days in, I was spiralling in a bottomless well. Words and warnings swirled and spun, and I felt as if all human progress was swiftly reversing to an ancient stage of confusion: don't touch your face; wash your hands; don't go outside; spray disinfectant; wash your hands; don't go outside; don't touch your face. Did washing my face count as touching? I always used a face towel, but one morning my palm grazed my cheek and I froze, the tap water still running. I was alone in my house in Maryland, in suburban silence, the eerie roads bordered by trees that themselves seemed stilled. No cars drove past. I looked out and saw a herd of deer striding across the clearing of my front yard. About ten deer, or maybe fifteen, nothing like the lone deer I would see from time to time chewing shyly in the grass. I felt frightened of them, their unusual boldness, as though my world was about to be overrun not just by deer but by other lurking creatures I could not imagine. My joints throbbed, and the muscles of my back, and the sides of my neck, as if my body knew too well that we are not made to live like this.",
      "In this new suspended life, I one day found a gray hair on my head. It appeared overnight, near my temple, tightly coiled, and in the bathroom mirror I first thought it was a piece of lint. A single gray hair with a slight sheen to it. I unfurled it to its full length, let it go, and then unfurled it again. I didn't pull it out. I thought: I'm growing old. I'm growing old and the world has changed and I have never been truly known. A rush of raw melancholy brought tears to my eyes. This is all there is, this fragile breathing in and out. Where have all the years gone, and have I made the most of life? But what is the final measure for making the most of life, and how would I know if I have?",

      "New Mexico officials have announced the cause of death for actor\u00a0Gene Hackman\u00a0and his wife Betsy Arakawa, a week after they were found dead\u00a0at their home in Santa Fe. Hackman died of heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor, and Arakawa died several days before him of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Chief Medical Investigator Dr. Heather Jarrell said Friday.",
      "Investigators had been trying to determine a cause of death for the couple since they died in their home last month.",
      "How did Gene Hackman die?",
      "Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 65, were found dead in their home in a gated community in Santa Fe on Feb. 26, but appear to have died earlier in the month.",
      "Hackman likely died around Feb. 18, when the last activity was detected on his pacemaker, Jarrell said during a Friday news conference.",
      "An autopsy determined that Hackman died of heart disease and also suffered from advanced Alzheimer's. He tested negative for hantavirus.",
      "\"He was in a very poor state of health,\" Jarrell said. \"He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that is what resulted in his death.\"",
      "Arakawa likely died first, with Feb. 11 being the last time that she was known to be alive, Jarrell said. People with hantavirus infections can initially feel flu-like symptoms for roughly three to six days and then start to have fluid in and around their lungs.",
      "\"At that point, a person can die very quickly, within 24-48 hours, roughly speaking, without medical treatment,\" Jarrell said. \"It's not uncommon to find someone down on the floor as part of a terminal collapse, so to speak, and that may very well have been what happened.\"",
      "Asked if Hackman was aware of his wife's passing, Jarrell said: \"That question's difficult to answer, but I can tell you that he was in an advanced state of Alzheimer's and it's quite possible that he was not aware that she was deceased.\"",
      "There was no food in Hackman's stomach, meaning he had not eaten recently before he died, Jarrell said. She didn't find evidence of dehydration.",
      "Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said there was no indication of a caretaker at the home.",
      "What is hantavirus?",
      "Hantaviruses are found worldwide, carried by rodents and transmitted from animals to humans, Dr. Erin Phipps, the state public health veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department, told reporters Friday. The hantavirus found in New Mexico is found throughout the state, primarily in deer mice but in other rodents too, Phipps said.",
      "The hantavirus strain in the Southwest has a mortality rate of about 38%-50%, Jarrell said. Hantavirus can be contracted from exposure to excrement from a mouse species that carries the virus.",
      "\"Avoiding contact with or breathing in aerosolized rodent urine or feces, especially in a poorly ventilated area, is key,\" Phipps said.",
      "The various strains in the U.S. aren't transmissible from person to person.",
      "A hantavirus infection is characterized by flu-like symptoms, including fever, muscle aches, cough and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea that can progress to shortness of breath and heart or lung failure, Jarrell said.",
      "The illness is rare, with the state Health Department reporting there were only seven confirmed cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in New Mexico in 2024. In the last 50 years, officials have identified 136 infections in New Mexico residents, including five in Santa Fe County.",
      "\"This is a serious disease \u2014 42% of these infections here in New Mexico were fatal,\" Phipps said. Most infections occur around the home or workplace, she said.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:38:30 -0400",
    "summary": "If deciding what to do with an old 401(k) plan has been on your to-do list, here are the key steps you should take to get it done.",
    "story": [
      "Aging 401(k)s are a little like the old clothes in the back of your closet. You know you should do something about them, but there they sit, mostly out of sight and mind.",
      "And so it is with your old 401(k). If deciding what to do with an old 401(k) plan has been on your to-do list for a while, here are the key steps you should take to get it done.",
      "Step 1: See how much you have saved",
      "If your balance in your former employer's 401(k) plan is over $7,000, you can leave the money behind in the old plan or roll the assets into an IRA or your new employer's 401(k).",
      "But if your balance falls below that $7,000 threshold, some of the decision-making may be out of your hands.",
      "Step 2: Decide whether to roll the money or leave it alone",
      "Assuming your balance is over $7,000, your next task is to decide whether to roll the money into an IRA or keep it inside a 401(k).",
      "I often recommend rolling over the assets from a former 401(k) into a no-fee IRA with a topnotch mutual fund company or discount broker. But some people value the extra creditor protections that can accompany 401(k) assets versus IRA assets, while others may prize 401(k)-specific investment options.",
      "If you think you will be better off leaving your money inside a 401(k) rather than rolling it over to an IRA, the next job is to conduct some research on your own 401(k) options.",
      "Even if you do decide to stay with a 401(k), you may need to decide whether you're better off staying put in your former employer's plan or that of your new employer.",
      "Step 3: If rolling over into an IRA, find the right options",
      "If a rollover to an IRA is the way to go, the next step is to identify the right brokerage firm or mutual fund company. Look for a firm that offers a breadth of high-quality investment options with no additional layers of fees for IRA investors. Target-date funds are an elegant, low-maintenance, and underutilized option.",
      "If you decide to roll Roth 401(k) contributions to an IRA or your current employer's 401(k), your new account will be Roth, too, meaning that you won't owe tax on qualified withdrawals.",
      "If you have traditional 401(k) assets, a rollover is also a good time to consider whether to convert those assets to a Roth account at the same time.",
      "Step 4: Fill out the necessary paperwork",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets to an IRA, fill out the paperwork or online form to open the IRA. You'll then request a direct rollover from your 401(k) plan to the new IRA provider.",
      "The process may be a bit more cumbersome if you're rolling over to your current employer's 401(k).",
      "In both cases, make sure your 401(k) provider makes the check payable to the provider and sends it directly to them, rather than to you. If the check is made out to you, 20% of the balance will be withheld for income tax. You'll then have 60 days to get that money deposited into an IRA or another 401(k); if that deadline comes and goes, the distribution will count as a withdrawal and you'll owe ordinary income tax and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're not 55 or older.",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets from an old 401(k) to another 401(k) or IRA, you'll also have to determine how you'll allocate those assets.",
      "If all of your retirement assets were in your old 401(k), a sturdy target-date fund is a one-stop, low-maintenance choice that you can hold into retirement. If your old 401(k) is just one of several accounts geared toward retirement, a rollover can be an ideal time to check up on how all the pieces fit together\u2014and where you have holes.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-overpayment-clawback-100-percent-medicare-trump-doge-waiver/",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:24:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The policy could lead to hardship for some elderly Americans, Social Security advocates say. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Getting overpaid by Social Security will soon come at a high cost, with the agency saying Friday it's reinstating a plan to take 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check to claw back the money, up from the current 10% rate.",
      "The policy change highlights an issue that had caused financial hardship for some beneficiaries in years past, prompting the Social Security Administration under the Biden administration to limit clawbacks to 10% of a person's monthly benefit check.",
      "But the Trump administration's reversal could lead to deep financial strain for some senior citizens who find themselves caught up in the overpayment issue. While overpayments are rare, they are often the result of Social Security's own miscalculations \u2014 and can come as a surprise to beneficiaries, given that it can be difficult to know if you have been overpaid.",
      "\"People generally do not know they are overpaid \u2014 you were receiving benefits, assuming that the government was giving you the proper amount,\" Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the benefit, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"People are really desperate when they get a letter from the government saying, 'You owe $10,000' that they don't have.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How many people get overpayments from Social Security?",
      "Fewer than 1% of the Social Security Administration's payments are what the agency terms as \"improper,\" which can include both over- and underpayments, according to a 2024 report from its inspector general. As the report noted, while it's a small share of the overall $1.6 trillion in benefits paid each year, it still adds up to billions of dollars.",
      "From fiscal year 2015 to 2022, the Social Security Agency paid about $72 billion in improper payments, most of which were overpayments, the report noted. That represents 0.84% of total Social Security payments during that time.",
      "How do overpayments occur?",
      "The agency says that they are usually due to two issues:",
      "Beneficiaries don't update their earnings data or alert the agency to other changesSocial Security employees don't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way",
      "Beneficiaries don't update their earnings data or alert the agency to other changes",
      "Social Security employees don't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way",
      "Sometimes beneficiaries may not understand that they need to update the agency with new information, partly due to the complexity of the Social Security system, which has more than 20,000 pages of rules, the inspector general said in its 2024 report.",
      "And sometimes SSA employees, who must in some cases manually calculate complex benefits, also make mistakes, the report added.",
      "However, there are cases where seniors receive \"strategic overpayments,\" said Ed Weir, a former Social Security manager who runs a YouTube channel about the benefit.",
      "In a recent webcast about the issue, Weir noted that sometimes seniors who are under the full retirement age but who are still working after having claimed Social Security aren't sure if they'll bump up against the earnings limit of $23,400. Under its rules, Social Security will hold back $1 in benefits for every $2 in earnings above that threshold.",
      "Some seniors decide, \"'I'll let it ride, because I won't know until November or December if I'm going over\" that limit, Weir said.",
      "But seniors who now opt for a \"strategic overpayment\" could end up losing one or two months of benefits due to the new clawback policy, Weir added.",
      "When will the new policy go into effect?",
      "The SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments starting on March 27.",
      "The withholding rate for people who had been overpaid before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.",
      "What happens to Medicare if your Social Security check is clawed back?",
      "Medicare coverage could be another pitfall for seniors whose benefit checks are subject to the 100% clawback, experts said. That's because most seniors pay for their Medicare Part B premiums by having it automatically deducted from their Social Security monthly checks.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't respond to requests for clarification about the issue.",
      "It's unclear if seniors would have to arrange to pay for their Medicare premiums through another payment system, or if the SSA would allow them to pay for their health care first before clawing back the remaining money, Altman of Social Security Works said.",
      "\"If you are on Medicare, it means you might not pay your Medicare possibly, so you might lose your Medicare,\" Weir said. \"It's a trickle down effect.\"",
      "What if the clawback causes financial hardship?",
      "Prior to the Biden reform to pare clawbacks to 10% of a person's benefit check, some Americans had encountered financial hardship after receiving shock bills amounting to\u00a0thousands of dollars. Some people were even driven into homelessness after their benefits were stripped away, KFF reported in 2023.",
      "Beneficiaries have the right to request a waiver of overpayment recovery through\u00a0SSA form 632, Weir noted.",
      "\"Two things have to be met for the payment to be waived: No. 1, it's not your fault, and No. 2, you don't have the ability to pay,\" he said.",
      "You can also appeal the overpayment, in case you think the overpayment amount is incorrect or you disagree that you were overpaid, through SSA form 561.",
      "Lastly, you can also request a different payment amount if you can't meet your living expenses due to the repayments, the SSA says.",
      "\"With Social Security, if you disagree with the decision, appeal it,\" Weir said on his webcast. \"Always appeal everything.\"",

    "story": [
      "Americans hoping for good news on inflation with Wednesday's release of Consumer Price Index data for February may have to wait a little longer for relief.",
      "Prices across the U.S. likely rose 2.9% last month from a year ago, which would remain well above the Federal Reserve's target of a 2% annual rate, according to the average estimate from economists polled by FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers that tracks the change in those prices over time, has cooled considerably from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but continues to eclipse the index's pre-pandemic levels.",
      "February's data reflects the first full month of the Trump administration, although some of Mr. Trump's economic policies have yet to take effect, such as his 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, now set to kick in on April 2 after a one-month reprieve. Economists now predict that inflation could tick upwards in 2025 due to Mr. Trump's tariff regime, which means the latest inflation data could prove to be the calm before the storm.",
      "The ongoing rise in food prices is posing a challenge to some U.S. households, particularly among lower-income consumers who spend a greater share of their income on groceries than higher-earning Americans, according to a new Bank of America Institute analysis of consumer spending.",
      "Egg prices",
      "Egg prices were one of the main inflation drivers in January, with the cost jumping 53% from a year earlier. Overall grocery prices rose 1.9% over the same period, with declines in some foods, such as bread and tomatoes, offsetting the surge in egg prices.",
      "Since then, egg prices have receded, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. In a March 11 Fox Business interview, Rollins said egg Prices have declined to an average of $1.85 per dozen, which she credited to the Trump administration's five-point plan to battle the bird flu. A dozen eggs cost about $5 in January, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "But while egg prices could see some relief in Wednesday's inflation report, food prices are still on the rise, economists say. On a month-over-month basis, food costs likely rose 0.3%, Vanguard said on Tuesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans themselves are bracing for higher grocery costs, according to the March 10 release of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations. Households are now predicting that food costs could accelerate to an annual rate of 5.1%, the highest level since May 2024, it found.",
      "Consumers bracing for a reignition of inflation could be feeding into a sharp downturn of consumer confidence, which plummeted in February to its lowest level in four years. More Americans say they're gloomy about their financial prospects for the year ahead, the New York Fed found in its survey.",
      "\"Households expressed more pessimism about their year-ahead financial situations in February, while unemployment, delinquency and credit access expectations deteriorated notably,\" the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said. \"Meanwhile, spending growth expectations rose significantly.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:23:14 -0400",
    "summary": "The Social Security Administration said it will restart a policy that had caused financial distress for some beneficiaries.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) said it is reinstating a plan to recover 100% of overpayments to beneficiaries, a policy the agency abandoned last year after an outcry over cases in which the practice led some Americans to receive shock bills amounting to thousands of dollars.",
      "In a statement, SSA said late Friday that it will increase the default overpayment withholding rate for Social Security recipients to 100% of a person's monthly benefit, the same level that it had in place before last year's reform. The agency is required by law to claw back overpaid benefits.",
      "Because of public backlash over the 100% recovery policy, the agency last year had capped\u00a0the withholding rate for someone who had been overpaid at 10% of the person's monthly benefit. On Friday, the SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments, while the withholding rate for people with overpayments before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.",
      "\"People who are overpaid after March 27 will automatically be placed in full recovery at a rate of 100% of the Social Security payment,\" the agency said.",
      "The 100% clawback policy had sparked an outcry after instances in which beneficiaries were hit with surprise bills that demanded repayment within 30 days. In some cases, the bills were for tens of thousands of dollars. If beneficiaries were unable to immediately pay the bill, the agency could dock their entire monthly Social Security payment, leaving some people financially destitute, as reported by \"60 Minutes,\"\u00a0KFF Health News\u00a0and other media outlets,",
      "In many cases, the overpayments were the fault of SSA. A\u00a02022 report\u00a0by the agency's inspector general found that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "In the agency's new statement, SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek said it is the agency's \"duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding.\"",
      "He added, \"We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people.\"",
      "Raising the clawback rate to 100% from its current 10% will increase the amount of recovered funds by $7 billion over the next decade, the agency said. SSA pays out about $1.6 trillion in benefits each year.",
      "The revised policy will lead to financial hardships for many people faced with Social Security overpayments, according to the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare.",
      "\"This action, ostensibly taken to cut costs at SSA, needlessly punishes beneficiaries who receive overpayment notices \u2014 usually through no fault of their own,\" a spokesperson for the advocacy group said in a statement. \"Many overpayments are the result of errors on SSA's part.\"",
      "Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, noted the advocacy group supports the government recouping improper overpayments, but said an immediate 100% cut in benefits would take a toll on older Americans.",
      "\"The 'clawback' of payments is especially unfair to seniors who do not have external support to help manage their finances and track their benefits,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"Many beneficiaries may not be aware of an overpayment and could suddenly find themselves without a check.\"",
      "Social Security cuts",
      "The reversal comes as the Social Security Administration is undergoing widespread job cuts and a reorganization under the Trump administration. With its staff already at a 50-year low, employees at the agency have told CBS News that the cuts could disrupt or delay services, including customer service delays and longer waits to qualify for some benefits.",
      "While on the campaign trail, President Trump vowed not to touch Social Security, a promise he repeated Sunday on Fox News, although he added that his administration wants to root out \"fraud\" from the benefit system.",
      "\"I'm not going to touch Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. Now, we're going to get fraud out of there,\" he said. \"We have people 250 years old and all, you know, tremendous fraud,\" he added, referring to a false claim that people who are beyond the human lifespan are receiving benefits.\"",
      "The cuts to Social Security's workforce could mean that more beneficiaries are subject to overpayment errors, the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare said in the statement.",
      "\"Trump's SSA also is closing field offices across the country, meaning beneficiaries will have to wait longer and possibly travel farther to resolve their overpayment cases,\" the group said.",

      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture is cutting two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers, part of what the agency said was a decision to \"return to long-term, fiscally responsible initiatives.\"",
      "The move cancels about $660 million in funding this year for the Local Food for Schools program, which is active in 40 U.S. states, as well as about $420 million for a second program called the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, which helps food banks and other local groups provide food to their communities.",
      "The decision comes as the Trump administration and Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, say they are slashing federal spending to reduce government waste. The USDA programs were funded through the agency's Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era fund created to buy products directly from farmers.",
      "\"Unlike the Biden Administration, which funneled billions in [Commodity Credit Corporation] funds into short-term programs with no plan for longevity, USDA is prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact,\" a USDA spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",

The withdrawal of funding will affect schools across the U.S. at a time when they're already grappling with high food costs, she said.",
      "\"It's a pretty big hit\"",

      "\"It's a pretty big hit, and that's mostly fresh fruits and vegetables,\" said Patti Bilbrey, director of nutrition services at the Scottsdale Unified School District in Arizona. \"It wasn't just about keeping food costs low \u2014 it meant supporting your community and your local farmers in your state.\"",
      "While the $100,000 represents about 2% of the school district's roughly $6 million in annual spending on food, Bilbrey noted that it allowed the district to buy food ffrom small farmers and introduce produce like microgreens to their students. She added that the funding loss comes as her district, like many others, are struggling to keep school meals affordable amid rising food and labor costs.",

    "summary": "Ruth Marcus, a longtime op-ed writer for the Washington Post, quit on Monday after, she said, her column criticizing owner Jeff Bezos was killed by publisher.",
    "story": [
      "A columnist who has worked at The Washington Post for four decades resigned on Monday after she said the newspaper's management decided not to run her commentary critical of owner Jeff Bezos' new editorial policy.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,\" Ruth Marcus, who has\u00a0worked\u00a0at the newspaper since 1984, wrote in a resignation letter.",
      "Her exit is the latest fallout from the billionaire owner's directive that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.",
      "The storied newspaper has been in a free fall, financially and editorially, over the past year. Marcus, who worked in the news and opinion departments during her career, is \"the bedrock of The Washington Post, embodying the history of the place as well as the talent and accomplishments of its journalists,\" said Paul Farhi, a former media reporter there.",
      "Marcus, who was a finalist for the\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for Commentary\u00a0in 2007, said that the Post's publisher, Will Lewis, declined to run her column, which she described as \"respectfully dissenting\" from Bezos' edict. It was the first time in nearly 20 years of writing columns that she's had one killed, she said.",
      "The decision \"underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,\" she wrote. Her resignation letter was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A Post spokesperson said Monday that \"we're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years. We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"",
      "While Bezos and Lewis have the right to make such decisions \u2014 they're the bosses \u2014 \"that has not been the tradition,\" Farhi said. He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.",
      "The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.",
      "Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.",
      "In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.",
      "Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"",
      "The Post's opinion section on Monday included an editorial opposing Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Columnists Max Boot wrote about Trump and Russia, Perry Bacon Jr. about Democratic resistance to Trump centering in the states, Phillip Bump on whether Trump would pay a political price for unpopular policies and Jim Geraghty about violence in Syria.",
      "The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years and its internal strife largely began last June, when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists \u2014 among them Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Matea Gold, Jackie Alemany, Michael Scherer and Will Sommer \u2014 have left for other jobs.",
      "Bezos' decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate \u2014 after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris \u2014 led to an exodus of subscribers that the newspaper is fighting to recover from.",
      "Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor when Bezos bought the paper in 2013, wrote last week in the Atlantic that Bezos \"handled his ownership admirably for more than a decade. But his courage failed him when he needed it the most.\"",
      "Marcus' resignation on Monday overshadowed a newsroom reorganization plan introduced by Murray, including separating workflows for the Post's digital and print products.",

    "summary": "Corrosion issues have been found on what Airbus calls a \"limited population\" of its A220 passenger jets, including some operated by U.S. airlines.",
    "story": [
      "Airbus is investigating corrosion issues on some of its A220 passenger jets. The issue has been found on what the manufacturer calls a \"limited population\" of A220s, including some operated by U.S. airlines. The manufacturer and multiple airlines said the issue does not constitute an immediate safety issue.",
      "\"Regular maintenance checks are scheduled to ensure it is captured early and the right corrective actions are put in place in a timely manner to mitigate the situation,\" an Airbus spokeswoman told CBS News in a statement. \"The A220 fleet's airworthiness remains intact.\"",
      "Sources familiar with the problem said the corrosion has been found on some passenger seat fittings and certain wing components, including what's known as the wing-to-body fairing, which is designed to minimize drag where the wing and body of the plane meet. It essentially acts as an aerodynamic cover over that junction and is not structural in nature.",
      "\"The FAA is aware of the issue and is ensuring airlines address it,\" an agency spokesman confirmed to CBS News in a brief statement.",
      "Delta Air Lines, the world's largest A220 operator, told CBS News it has observed the issue with some passenger seat fittings that require additional inspection and lubrication.",
      "The Atlanta-based carrier said the issue is not impacting scheduled A220 flights and has not resulted in cancellations.",
      "\"Delta has a sophisticated aircraft maintenance apparatus that is always-on and has many layers to ensure that every aircraft in our fleet is safe to fly by meeting or exceeding standards governed by our regulators,\" a company spokesman told CBS News. \"There is broad consensus by our technical experts that these issues aren't surprising especially for a new, clean-sheet aircraft and pose no major concerns.\"",
      "The airline said while it is aware some A220 carriers may be finding corrosion in the wing-to-body fairing structure, so far Delta mechanics have not found it on their fleet.",
      "JetBlue and Breeze Airways also fly dozens of A220s along with a host of international carriers, including Air Canada, Air France and Swiss Air.",
      "\"We are aware that some areas of the A220 have experienced corrosion and are proactively taking measures to mitigate these concerns,\" a Breeze spokesman told CBS News. \"The safety of our Guests is our first priority, which is why Breeze performs regular maintenance inspections on all of its aircraft to ensure airworthiness.\"",
      "And a JetBlue spokesperson told CBS News, \"All JetBlue aircraft are regularly inspected and maintained to ensure their safety and reliability. JetBlue is working closely with Airbus to proactively address corrosion on certain areas of some A220 aircraft. This does not impact the reliability of our A220 fleet.\"",
      "The A220 was subject to a 2021 airworthiness directive to address corrosion and wear in wing components known as slat tracks that were likely caused by insufficient grease being applied to the component during production. The directive called for additional inspections to monitor the amount of grease applied to the slat tracks.",
      "Sources told CBS News the new issues go beyond the focus of that 2021 order from Transport Canada.",
      "The plane was originally developed by Bombardier as the C-series before being sold to Airbus due to financial headwinds facing Bombardier. The plane is built in Quebec and Mobile, Alabama.",
      "The A220 seats between 100 and 150 passengers with five-seat rows. It's seen as a replacement for larger regional jets like the Embraer 190 and aging Boeing 717 jets.",
      "Because the plane was developed in Canada, it was initially certified by regulators there. The FAA and European Union Aviation Safety Agency validated the certification but would not typically be the lead agency on an issue like this.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 09:24:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Southwest Airlines is ending its free checked bags policy for many passengers. Some experts think customer loyalty could suffer.",
    "story": [
      "Southwest Airlines boasts that its passengers' \"bags fly free\" \u2014 but not for long.",
      "Starting May 28 \u2014 just in time for the busy summer travel season \u2014 only Southwest's most elite Rapid Rewards A-List Preferred members and passengers who book their top-tier Business Select fares will receive two free checked bags. Frequent flyer A-List Members, Southwest-branded credit card holders and other select customers will be allowed one checked bag.",
      "Everyone else will be charged for their first and second checked bags on flights booked on or after May 28, the carrier says.",
      "\"Just another airline\"?",
      "It's a break with Southwest's 54 year history \u2014 one that could undermine customer loyalty to the carrier, according to experts.",
      "\"This is how you destroy a brand. This is how you destroy customer preference. This is how you destroy loyalty. And this, I think, is going to send Southwest into a financial tailspin,\" airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt, of Atmosphere Research Group, told CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"Southwest, with these changes, becomes just another airline.\"",
      "Just last September, Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told Van Cleave bags would continue to fly without charge.",
      "\"Bags will still fly free,\" Jordan said. \"It's the third thing customers look for after fare and schedule: Bags fly free, on us. Ninety-seven percent are people who are aware of our policies. So it's a huge consumer advantage. So bags will absolutely fly free.\"",
      "But when pressed if they'd always fly free, he acknowledged, \"Well, never say never. \u2026 It's like saying open seating would never change 20 years ago. Consumer preferences change, but from everything that we see, there's no reason to reconsider this at all, especially right now.\"",
      "\"When 97% of your customers say they fly you because of your 'bags fly free' policy and you make dramatic changes to it, you are telling almost all of your customers, 'Your business doesn't matter to us anymore,'\" Harteveldt said. \"We are watching an airline self-destruct. This is the equivalent of deliberately sailing a ship into an iceberg.\"",
      "The cost of a checked bag hasn't been announced but airline sources say it will be competitive with other carriers.",
      "In comments at a JPMorgan Chase online event, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said Tuesday that Southwest's baggage policy shift is like \"the slaying of a sacred cow,\" while adding that it could boost the discount carrier's profit margins.",
      "\"I view it as a big deal because it feels more a financially driven, results driven airline than it's ever been before,\" he said.",
      "Delta President Glen Hauenstein, who also spoke at the JPMorgan conference, added that he thinks some Southwest customers could now be \"up for grabs\" because of its move away from free bags.",
      "Mounting financial pressure",
      "The move comes as Southwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, has been under intense pressure from an activist investor to improve its financial performance after struggling to keep pace with changing customer preferences post-pandemic.",
      "Southwest recently announced its first ever layoffs, launched its first redeye flights, and intends to end its long-running open seating policy next year. Instead, the airline will offer seat assignments and sell extra legroom seats for an additional fee.",
      "Also announced Tuesday are changes to Southwest's Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program \u2014 increasing the points flyers get for booking higher-priced Business Select fares while reducing the points earned on less expensive \"Wanna Get Away\" and \"Wanna Get Away Plus\" fares. The airline will also start dynamic or variable pricing for points redemption across higher and lower demand flights.",
      "What's more, starting May 28, Southwest will add a heavily discounted basic economy fare class that will guarantee a flyer a seat on a plane but will likely come with restrictions similar to other carriers' basic economy offerings.",
      "In a video statement Tuesday morning, Jordan said the changes \"will help us return to the levels of profitability we all expect, and to support our collective long term success. It's also about adapting to what our customers want.",
      "\"Many things have changed post-Covid: the loss of short-haul demand, a rise in premium demand, and a change in customer preferences.\"",
      "Jordan said the goal is to secure Southwest's future.",
      "\"We are more than the logo on our planes,\" he said. \"Our DNA isn't open seating, or even bags fly free. It's a dedication to service.\"",
      "Harteveldt says, \"More choice is always a good thing. More low fares are always a good thing. And Southwest is large enough that if they use their basic economy fares in the right way, and I believe they will, they may force other airlines to be more aggressive in their pricing.\"",
      "Southwest is the last major U.S. airline to offer a basic economy product, which carriers launched to compete with ultra-low cost airlines like Frontier and Spirit.",
      "While the offerings vary by airline, basic economy tickets often come without an advance seat assignment, tend to be in the last boarding group and may limit the number or size of carry-on luggage. Checked bags and other perks come with a cost. It's been a hit for airlines. United Airlines reported basic economy revenue jumped 20% last year.",
      "\"Southwest Airlines remains committed to its core tenets \u2014 amazing people who deliver great hospitality to all Southwest customers, a strong network with the most nonstop flights within the U.S., and a loyalty program that gives real value to Rapid Rewards Members,\" the carrier said in a statement.",
      "But is that the Southwest that people know?",
      "\"Yes,\" Harteveldt said. \"This change is just so unlike Southwest. And it really is something that I worry could be far more financially damaging to the airline than helpful.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Mar 2025 10:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As bird flu continues to spread, impacting poultry farms and the price of eggs, the Agriculture Department says it's almost doubling the amount spent to combat it.",
    "story": [
      "Despite a major federal investment to help egg and poultry producers bounce back from bird flu losses, finding eggs at a reasonable price \u2014 or any eggs at all \u2014 remains a tough task for shoppers across the U.S.",
      "In January, egg prices rose 15.2%, and economists say they expect prices to continue to rise this year.",
      "The increase is due to the limited number of hens laying eggs right now. There are fewer hens because of federal bird flu control measures. They require farmers to kill their chickens if they discover a bird flu case in a flock \u2014 a process known as \"culling\" \u2014 to try to prevent the viral disease from spreading.",
      "When farmers cull their flocks to prevent the spread of a disease like the bird flu, they are eligible for public money to help them replace the flocks.",
      "Since 2020, the Department of Agriculture has paid $1.1 billion to hundreds of egg producers who had to cull their flocks to stop bird flu from spreading, according to a CBS News analysis of federal data.",
      "Now, the USDA says it will\u00a0send $400 million more to farmers who need new chickens. The agency also says it will pay $500 million for biosecurity measures and $100 million \"for vaccine research, action to reduce regulatory burdens, and exploring temporary import options.\"",
      "Frank Singleton, a spokesperson for Wayne-Sanderson Farms \u2014 the third largest poultry producer in the nation \u2014 is glad the USDA is helping.",
      "He says his company has 23 plants and 2,000 partner farms in seven states, employing 26,000 people across the Southeast and processing 21 million broiler chickens a week for sale of their meat into the consumer market.",
      "Wayne-Sanderson Farms received more than $600,000 from the USDA's bird flu assistance program to replace three flocks the company culled after discovering bird flu cases in 2023 and 2024.",
      "Singleton says the checks are an important investment to help the farms his company sponsors get back on track.",
      "\"It's a partnership with the farmers, and the consumer, and our company, to make sure we can continue to feed America,\" he says. \"It would be very difficult to get a farmer to take a risk like that without a farm partner like Wayne-Sanderson Farms. So that's where we step in. We make sure that we do our part, our due diligence, help them get back up to speed, and work to make sure those funds are available to them.\"",
      "Culling flocks and shielding them from bird flu",
      "The process of culling is arduous. Singleton says his company sprays a foam agent over the affected chickens to kill them quickly.",
      "\"Different farms and different companies have different methods,\" he said. \"We use a humane method to euthanize all the birds. It's all supervised by regulatory folks and our teams.\"",
      "\"Ours is an approved, USDA-approved method where a foaming agent used, and it's very quick,\" Singleton continued. \"So, those birds have to be disposed of. The house itself has to be cleaned up and sanitized. So it's a long process, and it takes awhile for the farmer to get back up and running. So we work with them directly to make sure that happens.\"",
      "Singleton says there are several proactive measures his company is taking to protect farms from exposure in the first place.",
      "Biosecurity measures are so tight for Wayne-Sanderson Farms, our CBS News cameras were not allowed inside a farm or facility.",
      "\"It just takes one vector to infect a flock so, from the time people come to the farm, using disinfectant sprays, wearing coveralls, wearing personal protective gear, goggles, those kinds of things \u2014 limiting the type of people, the number of people,\" Singleton explained. \"We make sure our people have the equipment, they have the chemicals, the disinfectants, and they have the knowledge. ... It's very critical. Every individual has to do their part to make sure that this doesn't happen.\"",
      "His company supports a recent proposal from other egg and poultry industry leaders to allow broiler eggs \u2014 eggs typically used to hatch chicks \u2014 to be used in consumer products amid the national shortage of traditional eggs.",
      "After a law change in 2009 that stipulated that eggs must be refrigerated sooner if sold into the consumer market, broiler egg producers were no longer able to send excess broiler eggs to consumer companies needing them for things like cakes and pies, because broiler eggs are typically stored at a higher temperature during the first 48 hours prior to shipment.",
      "Singleton says his company throws out 560,000 broiler eggs a week \u2014 about 2% of the total 26 million broiler eggs Wayne-Sanderson Farms produces.",
      "If the Food and Drug Administration were to allow the broiler eggs to be used in consumer products, Singleton says, it would be a win-win.",
      "\"We certainly want to do our part to help feed the country and (solve) a need where a need is there; certainly (that) would help us from a waste standpoint and just from employees having to work on that particular aspect of it,\" Singleton said. \"So, it's really just a cost savings and an efficiency savings and putting food back into the marketplace for consumers.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Food and Drug Administration says it is still considering the proposal.",
      "A smaller farm's approach in the bird flu saga",
      "Another company currently able to fill the need is a small independent farm in the northern Alabama city of Madison called Southard Farms.",
      "It has been in co-owner Keith Southard's family for five generations. Southard turned the farm into a pasture-raised poultry, egg and pork production operation in 2019 and never dreamed his business would be booming so soon.",
      "He says over the last month, his phone has been ringing off the hook with restaurants seeking eggs.",
      "\"It's been it's been crazy. It's been busy. My phone rings constantly,\" Southard said. \"Huge, huge opportunity for growth, and people are searching now ... not just to find eggs but something different \u2014 to find good eggs, fresh, local, that they don't just depend on a store to provide them; they know where it's coming from.\"",
      "Southard's father grows grows crops on the farm and they in turn use the crops as feed for his chickens.",
      "He has 900 laying hens for eggs and 700 broiler chickens \u2014 or chickens used for meat.",
      "Right now, Southard's hens lay about 400 eggs a week. A few weeks ago, Southard signed a contract with a restaurant in Birmingham to sell it 500 dozen eggs a week. Southard says he expects his total egg production in the next few months will be just under 1,000 dozen a week to meet the demand.",
      "Unlike in traditional egg farms, where laying hens are kept in an indoor warehouse, Southard's chickens live an outdoor lifestyle, rotating regularly onto fresh grass to graze. He says the pasture-raised format keeps his chickens' immune systems stronger.",
      "\"No medicines needed to keep them going. So, we just use nature's benefits,\" Southard says.",
      "However, the outdoor living could make them more susceptible to coming into contact with wild birds that could be carrying the avian (bird) flu.",
      "\"There's always that risk,\" Southard says. \"We just hope that it doesn't affect us.\"",
      "Last year, Southard had to cull his flock after chickens got hit with a bacterial infection, different than bird flu, called mycoplasma. He says the experience was devastating.",
      "\"I noticed a few symptoms, and then within three days, we went from a normal amount of eggs per day to almost zero, and it was very similar symptoms to the avian flu, so (we) immediately took the hens to the state lab for testing ... and once we got the results in, there really wasn't any answer but to just cull the flock and start over,\" Southard recalled.",
      "He said he and his farmhand had to personally kill each chicken by cutting their throats to make it as quick and painless for the birds as possible.",
      "\"Nothing I want to see again, that's for sure,\" Southard said.",
      "Because mycoplasma is not considered a \"highly-pathogenic\" disease, he did not qualify for the USDA's program to receive a check to help him finance the replacement of his chickens.",
      "\"We just bared through it and kept going,\" Southard says.",
      "And kept going he did.",
      "Southard took us to Farm Burger in Huntsville, Alabama, one of the restaurants that uses his chicken meat and eggs. The staff affectionately calls out, \"The Chicken Man's here!\" upon his arrival to deliver his product in person each week.",
      "The restaurant's co-owner and manager says Southard has been a blessing to his business because Southard has kept his prices low at a time when other restaurants in neighboring states have seen egg prices more than double in the last few months.",
      "Low prices for the restaurant also mean costs don't have to be passed on to customers.",
      "A CBS News analysis of federal data found some farms received large checks from the USDA indemnity and reimbursement program after culling their flocks last year \u2014 one egg producer received $10 million.",
      "Asked his thoughts about the taxpayer expense, Southard said, \"I think there's probably, there's definitely a question there about when USDA should get involved or not. So, I think that should be looked into to some more, because obviously we see still these big supply problems. So, I don't think we have the right answer yet, but it should be looked into some more.\"",
      "With supply issues and high egg costs expected at least another year, Southard says it's important to protect small farms.",
      "\"Small farmers like us, family farms, play a key role, because it takes away the big consolidation that's happened and spreads out the risk where you have more farms across the state or country and more farmers,\" Southard says. \"So, if one gets hit, it's not as big of an effect on the whole supply chain.\"",

    "summary": "Faced with the need to cut carbon emissions, and an increasing energy demand to power AI, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are investing in nuclear, from restarting Three Mile Island, to creating \"small modular reactors.\"",
    "story": [
      "It might have seemed like one of the weirder headlines of 2024: Microsoft is paying $1.6 billion to restart Three Mile Island. That's the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania whose reactor #2 had a partial meltdown in 1979. There were no injuries, and nobody died, but it set the nuclear industry back years. Only two new plants have been started since that accident.",
      "\"This is hallowed ground in the nuclear industry,\" said Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, which owns about half of America's 54 nuclear plants (including Three Mile Island). \"This is a place where we learned and got better.\"",
      "He says that, as a result of the 1979 accident, there have been thousands of changes in protocols and procedures regarding nuclear power. \"The thing that people forget is that there was another reactor at the site,\" he said. \"That site, that reactor, continued to operate until 2019, when it was closed for economic reasons. Cheap natural gas, low demand, subsidization of different technologies in the business, [and] no policy supporting nuclear caused plants to start retiring.\"",
      "So, what is Microsoft's interest?",
      "All  of the Big Tech companies have ambitious goals to fight the climate  crisis. That includes Google and Microsoft, which have each  pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions. They were making progress, too; each has invested billions in wind and solar energy.",
      "And then, then artificial intelligence came along. AI data centers require huge amounts of electricity. \u00a0Big Tech realized that they wouldn't make their emissions goals without taking power into their own hands.",
      "Dominguez said, \"Microsoft is going to enjoy the benefit of the reliable, clean energy for 20 years.\"",
      "He says reopening the existing Three Mile Island facility would be quicker and less expensive than constructing a brand-new nuclear plant. \"At least 10 times cheaper than building a new plant,\" he said. \"And we think we could get it going in about three years, versus the last plant that was built, [which] took almost 10 years.\"",
      "But if you're a tech company, what do you do if you don't have a recently-retired nuclear plant handy? You develop new ones. Only weeks after Microsoft's announcement, both Amazon and Google announced major investments in nuclear power.",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google is supplementing its already enormous green energy investments with a new kind of nuclear, called small modular reactors. \"These are not the nuclear power plants of yesterday, with the very large cooling towers,\" said Michael Terrell, who heads Google's decarbonization efforts. \"These are much smaller facilities. But because they're modular, you can stack them together to make bigger power plants.",
      "He anticipates the first advanced nuclear reactor will be online by 2030. \"And we're not going to do just one reactor, but we hope to buy from what will be a series of reactors that follow that,\" Terrell said.",
      "Nuclear power still isn't perfect; it still produces waste that has to be safely stored. But unlike solar and wind, nuclear power is always on, which is essential to those AI data centers.",
      "So, Google is funding a company called Kairos Power to design and build this new generation of reactors. Kairos is building three small demonstration plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the very spot where uranium was processed for the first atomic bomb.",
      "CEO Mike Laufer says that his reactors don't use fuel rods; they use fuel pebbles, about the size of golf balls \u2013 mostly graphite, with tiny kernels of uranium. And each pebble has as much power capacity as four tons of coal.",
      "And how much carbon dioxide emissions, compared to coal? \"Zero,\" Laufer said.",
      "The Kairos reactors also run at lower power and lower pressure than traditional reactors, which means lower risk.",
      "Well, this all sounds great! But what's the catch?",
      "\"There's only one problem with small modular reactors: They don't really exist,\" said George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni, who spent 15 years researching nuclear safety for the government. She thinks Big Tech companies might be in over their heads. \"I think they're going to find out pretty quickly that it takes way too long and it's way too expensive,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see just how strong their commitments are to clean energy futures.\"",
      "\"So, you're saying they may have to turn to burning stuff [for power]?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure they will,\" Squassoni replied.",
      "\"Do you think there's a little bit of tech-bro overconfidence therein?\"",
      "\"Oh, completely, completely!\" she laughed.",
      "Kairos' Mike Laufer admitted, \"Yes, it's really hard. I will totally agree with anyone. But we're doing it at smaller scale to start, and then building on that in the future.\"",
      "Joe Dominguez's team is getting Three Mile Island ready for Microsoft, including renaming the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. And if AI is igniting a renaissance in American nuclear, he says: full steam ahead.",
      "I asked, \"Why do all new plants take so much longer and cost so much more than projected?\"",
      "\"Honest answer? We don't build enough of them,\" Dominguez said. \"You don't want to build a unique design; you want to do kind of a cookie-cutter, one-after-another design.\"",
      "\"Is it well understood in government and the industry that if you start doing the same design over and over, we can get there faster and cheaper?\"",
      "\"It's probably the best understood idea,\" Dominguez said. \"It's understood by both Republicans and Democrats, which is a hard thing to say about anything! Everybody understands that if you build a common design, you build a bunch of them.\"",
      "\"So, you think we'll get there?\"",
      "\"I do.\"",
      "Google's Michael Terrell agrees, and believes his company will make its zero-carbon goal by 2030. \"It is an incredibly ambitious goal: 24/7 carbon-free energy everywhere we operate every way around the world,\" he said. \"But it's something we're working very hard to achieve, and we hope to get there.\"",

      "The unemployment rate last month was 4.1%, slightly higher than the 4% rate forecast by economists polled by FactSet.",
      "Hiring has eased since December's blowout number of 323,000 new jobs, but the labor market has remained resilient at the start of 2025, experts say.",

      "He added, \"Deteriorating indicators like hiring intentions, new job listings and temporary staffing suggest a potential slowdown in employment growth.\"",
      "Notably, the widespread, ongoing cuts across the government sector also aren't reflected in today's report, according to Andy Stettner, an unemployment insurance expert at The Century Foundation. That's because unemployment claims for federal workers can take several weeks to appear in the official government data, he noted.",
      "Although the full impact of those cuts aren't yet visible in the data, federal employment declined by 10,000 last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday. The U.S. has more than 2 million federal workers.",

      "Employers cut more than 172,000 jobs last month, a 245% increase from January and double the number announced during the same month a year ago, the company said. That marks the highest monthly number of layoffs since July 2020, when nearly 263,000 cuts were announced, the firm added.",
      "What the experts say",
      "The slightly weaker-than-expected February jobs report could prompt the Federal Reserve to resume cutting its benchmark rate, noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multi sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "The Fed in January hit the brakes on interest rate cuts, citing persistent inflation. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled the central bank is closely watching the labor market for signs of weakness, which could prompt additional rate cuts.",
      "The Fed will receive one more piece of major economic data ahead of its next rate decision meeting, scheduled for March 19, with the Consumer Price Index set to be released on March 12. The CPI likely rose 2.9% last month, slightly easing from January's 3% pace, according to FactSet.",

    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that the central bank can remain patient in adjusting its benchmark interest rate, citing uncertainty around the potential impact of President Trump's economic policies.",
      "Powell said the Trump administration is making policy changes in several areas, including trade, taxes, government spending, immigration and regulation, and added that the \"net effect\" of those changes are what will matter for the economy and the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"While there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high,\" Powell said at a conference in New York. \"As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\"",
      "Most economists say that Trump's plans to slap tariffs on a wide array of imports, including 25% duties on goods from Canada and Mexico that he partially delayed Thursday, will push up prices and slow growth. But many also expect that tax cuts and deregulation could boost the economy.",
      "Powell's comments pushed some traders to pare back their forecasts for how many interest rate cuts the Fed may deliver this year. They had been banking on at least three following a stream of weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy. But Powell reiterated the Fed is likely on hold for a while. That sent Treasury yields higher in the bond market.",

      "President Trump in January pressed the Fed to ease borrowing costs, saying in a speech at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland that he planned to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Inflation expectations are key",
      "In a question and answer session, Powell acknowledged that typically tariffs would cause a \"one-time\" price increase, rather than persistent inflation, and the Fed could ignore such a temporary effect. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday made a similar argument: \"We could get a one-time price adjustment,\" Bessent said, before adding, \"I'm not worried about inflation.\"",
      "Yet Powell also said there were other considerations the Fed has to take into account when deciding whether to keep its rate unchanged, or even raise rates. For example, Powell suggested tariffs might have more than just a one-time impact \"if it turns into a series\" of tariff hikes, or \"if the increases are larger, that would matter.\"",
      "\"What really does matter is what is happening with long-term inflation expectations,\" Powell added. Powell noted that shorter-term expectations have risen, partly out of concern about tariffs, though longer-term expectations have been stable.",
      "Expectations that prices will rise can worsen inflation if they cause consumers and businesses to change their behavior in anticipation. Some companies might charge more when they expect their own costs to increase.",
      "When Trump imposed tariffs in his last administration, Powell noted, the Fed ended up reducing its key rate, \"because growth weakened so much.\"",
      "Economists with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley this week forecast that inflation is likely to edge up in 2025, citing the potential impact of tariffs and other Trump administration policies.",
      "\"Larger tariffs are also likely to hit GDP harder through their tax-like effect on disposable income and consumer spending and their effect on financial conditions and uncertainty for businesses,\" Goldman analysts wrote in a report.",
      "The cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the\u00a0soaring cost of eggs\u00a0becoming a national talking point. A recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation.",
      "Powell says economy remains solid",
      "Powell said the economy remains mostly healthy despite \"elevated uncertainty.\" He characterized Friday's jobs report, which showed employers added 151,000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%, as in line with the \"solid\" gains of the past six months.",
      "He also noted that there were signs consumer spending has slowed compared with the healthy gains in the second half of last year, and said surveys of consumers and businesses \"point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.\" Further complicating matters, he acknowledged that measures of consumer sentiment \"have not been a good predictor\" of consumer spending in recent years.",
      "The Fed's own beige book, a collection of anecdotes from hundreds of businesses, mentioned uncertainty 47 times in its latest edition released Wednesday, up from just 17 times in January. The Fed publishes the beige book eight times a year.",
      "Powell spoke at a conference organized by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.",
      "President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policy and rapid-fire layoffs of government workers has created a spike in uncertainty among businesses and caused a sharp drop in consumer confidence. Many economists have marked down their estimates for the economy's growth to as low as 1% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.3% in last year's final quarter.",
      "Yet as Fed governor Christopher Waller noted Thursday, there are \"good news\" cuts and \"bad news\" cuts. \"Bad news\" cuts occur if the Fed reduces rates out of concern that the economy is slowing, while \"good news\" reductions are those that reflect a sense by the Fed that inflation is returning to its target of 2%.",
      "Waller added that he still believes it will be possible for the Fed to engineer \"good news\" rate cuts later this year, though he dismissed the potential for a cut at the Fed's next meeting this month.",
      "After cutting its key rate three times last year to about 4.3%, Powell indicated in January that the Fed would pause any further cuts amid signs that inflation has remained stuck above its target. The central bank's preferred inflation gauge shows that prices rose 2.5% in January compared with a year ago. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.6%, the smallest increase since June.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/auto-tariffs-should-you-buy-a-car-now-2025-prices/",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 15:52:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts say you could save thousands of dollars by buying a car now, versus later in 2025 if tariffs are enacted.",
    "story": [
      "Buying a car can be a fraught financial decision even in the best of times. Now, car shoppers are facing the added pressure of deciphering U.S. tariff policy.",
      "On Wednesday, President Trump issued a one-month delay for U.S. automakers on tariffs placed on imports from Canada and Mexico, trading partners that provide many of the car makers' vehicle parts and components. If the 25% levies are enacted, auto manufacturers will face higher costs and are likely to\u00a0pass on some of those price hikes to consumers, industry players say.",
      "The upshot, according to experts, is that consumers who are thinking of buying a car in the next year may want to consider buying a car sooner in 2025 rather than later. If the tariffs eventually take effect, car prices could rise by between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, according to a recent estimate from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it, will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them,\" AEG CEO Patrick Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The timing of the tariffs remain uncertain, and it's possible that Mr. Trump could further delay the import duties on Canada and Mexico, while the U.S. could also shelve the trade measures if the sides reach agreement. Even if the tariffs are ultimately deployed in April, it's unclear how long they might remain in place, which adds to the uncertainty surrounding the import duties, according to Morningstar equity strategist David Whiston.",
      "Spreading the costs",
      "While certain car models source a greater share of their components from Canada and Mexico than others, automakers are expected to spread any added costs they incur across their vehicle lineups.",
      "\"If the tariffs are here, and permanent, by the time we get to summer we'd expect to see higher prices everywhere,\" Tyson Jominy, vice president of analytics at J.D. Power, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That means even U.S.-sourced and assembled vehicles with components that aren't subject to tariffs could see moderate price hikes.",
      "\"If we are talking about 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, prices will go up, and we are expecting most automakers to peanut-butter spread the impact across their entire portfolio, even if the vehicle is built in the U.S.,\" Jominy explained. \"The reality is that every automaker, regardless of where they final assemble, is likely to be affected if these parts tariffs go into effect.\"",
      "Automakers are likely to be strategic about how they implement price hikes in order to mitigate the effect on sales, experts say.",
      "\"Automakers will smooth costs out across their vehicle lineups,\" Edmunds head of insights Jessica Caldwell told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They won't increase one model's price by 40%. They'll figure out ways to spread out the costs in a way that doesn't harm profitability as much, and doesn't kill sales at the same time.\"",
      "When could car prices rise?",
      "Although vehicle prices wouldn't skyrocket overnight if the Canada and Mexico tariffs kick in, they could start to rise by summer, industry analysts say. That means car buyers should seriously consider starting their search now.",
      "Manufacturers with more inventory in stock could push off price hikes for some time, whereas those that are running low could be forced to incorporate them into sales prices earlier. Jominy said the range could be a few weeks to \"many months\" from the time tariffs take effect.",
      "\"If you think you'll need a car within the next several months, you should probably get into the market sooner rather than later,\" Jominy said.",
      "That doesn't mean buying on impulse, and experts urge consumers to do their homework before signing on the dotted line for what is, after all, a major financial decision for most people.",
      "\"But if you're planning to be in market the first half of year, it probably makes sense to speed up what you can and make sure you're ready to go,\" he said.",
      "What about used cars?",
      "When new vehicle prices rise, some buyers turn to the used car market, which in turn can drive up costs in that segment.",
      "\"If something comes to pass on tariffs, we'd expected higher prices on both new and used vehicles,\" Jominy said.",
      "Demand for cars \u2014 and other products impacted by tariffs \u2014 may be pulled forward, experts say. \"Because we don't know what's doing to happen, I would be buying everything that I needed that's an appliance that could have content coming from Canada or Mexico,\" Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's a little bit like eating your lunch at recess. You get the same amount of food \u2014 you just get it earlier,\" he added.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs more than once already, it's unclear if and when auto tariffs will hit. But Robert Handfield, professor of supply chain management at North Carolina State University, said for the risk-averse, buying an automobile now versus later in the year is a wise move.",
      "\"He postponed the tariffs for a month to give automakers a little breathing room,\" he said. \"I think it's a good idea to buy now. You'd be able to get in under the wire and save around $4,000 for a regular sedan or up to $10,000 to $12,000 for a truck, which are significant savings.\"",
      "Even if the tariffs never come to fruition, consumers wishing to play it safe can't go wrong by making purchases now, according to Edmunds' Caldwell.",
      "\"Some people don't have the finances to get it wrong. We are stretched thin financially as a country and new vehicle prices aren't cheap, so I can see a lot of people don't want to take the risk,\" she said. \"Sure, it might not happen. But what if it does? Now you're paying how much more that you can't afford.\"",

    "summary": "Union representing TSA workers calls the Department of Homeland Security's decision an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security said Friday it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with the union representing thousands of frontline workers with the Transportation Security Administration, a decision the TSA union called an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
      "In announcing the decision, DHS criticized the union \u2014 which represents worker responsible for screening airline passengers \u2014 claiming TSA employs more people working full-time on union issues than those \"performing screening functions at 86% of our airports.\"",
      "\"This action will ensure Americans will have more effective and modernized workforces across the nation's transportation networks,\" Homeland Security said in a statement. \"TSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\"",
      "The decision to end collective bargaining was criticized by the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing flight attendants, and Democratic lawmakers, with both claiming that the action will make flying less safe. DHS's decision comes after the agency last year pushed to boost TSA workers' pay, which has historically lagged that of other government employees.",
      "In May 2024, the TSA administrator at the time, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement and credited\u00a0pay increases\u00a0that went into effect in 2023 for helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",
      "\"Attempting to negate [TSA workers'] legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2013 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, in a statement on Friday.",
      "In the announcement, DHS said poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \"to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from Thompson and the union.",
      "The decision is \"terrible for aviation security and everyone who depends on safe travel,\" the Association of Flight Attendants said. The group added, \"This will take us back to the days of security at the lowest price with the highest costs for our country.\"",
      "Impact on 47,000 TSA workers",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the TSA workers, said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \"completely fabricated.\"",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers.",
      "AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\"Our union has been out in front challenging this administration's unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \"Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\"",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers' collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration's \"vision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\"",
      "\"By removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\" Stahl wrote. \"This determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\"",
      "Stahl said the agency \"will establish alternative procedures\" to address employee concerns and grievances \"in a fair and transparent manner.\"",
      "\"Anti-union talking points\"",
      "Rep. Thompson criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \"flat out wrong anti-union talking points.\" He said the real aim was \"diminishing\" the workforce so \"they can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\"",
      "\"Attempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" Thompson said. \"Since the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA's attrition rates have plummeted.\"",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's barrage of tariffs on key U.S. trading partners and ongoing crackdown on immigration are likely to result in higher prices for American consumers and businesses, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "Economists with Morgan Stanley Research said in a report on Friday that they expect inflation in 2025 to rise 2.5%, up from their previous forecast in December of 2.3%. Another key gauge that strips out volatile food and energy costs is now projected to reach 2.7%, up from 2.5% in the bank's earlier forecast.",
      "\"We now see higher inflation in 2025 with a more pronounced and sooner re-acceleration in goods prices,\" the analysts wrote.",
      "\"If our narrative entering the year was 'slower growth, stickier inflation' then we now think 'slower growth, firmer inflation,'\" they added.",
      "Analysts at Goldman Sachs also said on Friday they're now projecting higher inflation, largely due to Mr. Trump's tariffs. Core PCE inflation, or price increases excluding food and energy costs, could rise to 3% this year, rather than sinking to 2.1% by year-end if there were no tariffs in place.",
      "The cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the soaring cost of eggs\u00a0becoming a national talking point. A recent CBS News poll\u00a0found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation.",
      "Inflation during the pandemic soared to its highest level since 1981, peaking at 9.1% in June 2022. The pace of price increases has cooled since then, but costs remain roughly 10% higher than before the COVID crisis, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0data shows.",
      "Recently, inflation has been moving in the wrong direction. After dipping to 2.4% in September, the closely watched Consumer Price Index has nosed up, and in January rose to an annual rate of 3% \u2014 higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target and the fourth straight monthly increase. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release CPI data for February on March 12.",
      "Many businesses are also expecting higher prices. As of early February, manufacturers and service firms expected inflation over the next year of 3.5% and 4%, respectively, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey out this week. Companies pointed to stiffer U.S. tariffs on foreign imports, which raise their operating costs, as a major reason they're bracing for higher inflation.",
      "President Trump on Friday again suspended 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the second time he has paused steeper levies on the two largest U.S. trade partners. The White House\u00a0also recently raised tariffs on China by an additional 10% and has vowed to deploy broader \"reciprocal tariffs\" against other nations on April 2.",
      "Although the delays leave open the possibility of a breakthrough in trade talks, the whipsaw in policy makes it more challenging for businesses to plan in advance.",
      "Tighter immigration restrictions can contribute to inflation by reducing the nation's supply of labor, according to economists.",
      "\"One factor that we think limits services disinflation is reduced immigration, which could lead to labor shortages in many face-to-face service sectors (retail, restaurants, leisure, hospitals) that could result in supply-side driven inflation,\" the Morgan Stanley analysts said in their report.",

      "Funding public charter schools",
      "Overseeing the the college accreditation system by reviewing all federally recognized accrediting agencies",
      "Collecting data on education and student outcomes, from early to higher education",
      "The Department of Education is \"primarily about ensuring who can access the classroom \u2014 it's not so much about what is being talked about in the classroom,\" Peter Granville, a fellow at The Century Foundation and expert on higher education, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "One major misconception held by many Americans is that the Education Department oversees school curriculums and learning, which are instead overseen by states and local school districts. Rather than setting public school curriculums, the Education Department's role is primarily financial, distributing billions in government money to colleges and schools and managing the federal student loan portfolio.",
      "\"Curriculum is handled by states and local governance \u2014 the Department of Education has historically had no role in setting curriculum,\" Granville said. \"The primary role of the Department of Education has been as a grant maker and a loan lender.\"",
      "For instance, the Education Department operates the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which is used by about 17 million students each year to apply for federal loans, grants and scholarships to attend college or vocational programs. The agency also manages $1.5 trillion in student loans, including repayment programs.",
      "Additionally, the Education Department handles Title I funding for low-income schools as well as for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Here's what to know about the agency.",
      "Why does the Trump administration want to close the Education Department?",
      "Mr. Trump is a vocal critic of the Education Department, describing\u00a0it last month as \"a big con job\" and falsely claiming the U.S. is ranked 40th in education internationally but spends the most per pupil. (Spending on K-12 education is largely determined by local school boards and funded by property taxes.)",
      "One of the president's executive orders, signed Jan. 30,\u00a0directed the Education Department to investigate \"school choice programs,\" saying that parents need \"opportunities for students to attend the school that best fits their needs.\" Vouchers that allow families to pay for private K-12 schools are a priority of conservatives, as such programs allow parents to use tax credits to pay for private schools, including Christian-based institutions.",
      "In an email earlier this month to the agency's staff entitled \"Our Department's Final Mission,\" McMahon wrote that her goal is to \"restore the rightful role of state oversight in education and to end the overreach from Washington.\" That echoes language from Project 2025, the blueprint for a conservative administration written by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "\"Federal money is inevitably accompanied by rules and regulations that keep the influx of funds from having much, if any, impact on student outcomes,\" Project 2025's section on the Education Department claims. \"Eventually, policymaking and funding should take place at the state and local level, closest to the affected families.\"",
      "Can Mr. Trump abolish the Education Department?",
      "Complete elimination of the Education Department would need congressional approval and 60 votes in the Senate, which is unlikely given the current makeup.",
      "However, the Trump administration could make changes to the agency, such as by cutting staff, without closing the entire department. The Trump administration is currently making massive employment cuts at several other federal agencies, such as the Social Security Administration and Veterans Affairs Department, describing the efforts as a way to reduce federal waste.",
      "The Trump administration could change some of the department's oversight duties, such as those carried out by its Office for Civil Rights, which issues guidance on how civil rights laws should be applied. Trump has suggested a different interpretation of the office's civil rights role.",
      "Under his administration, the department has instructed the office to prioritize complaints of\u00a0antisemitism, and has opened investigations into colleges and school sports leagues for allowing transgender athletes to\u00a0compete on women's teams, according to the Associated Press.",
      "The Trump administration isn't expected to defend the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness and repayment programs, which have been tied up in court cases, experts say. Last month, the Education Department removed the online application for income-driven repayment plans, according to Business Insider.",
      "What would happen to student loans?",
      "The Education Department manages $1.5 trillion in student loan debt for more than 40 million borrowers. Although the Trump administration hasn't outlined how it might want to reallocate the Education Department's responsibilities, student loans could be moved to the Treasury Department, Granville noted.",
      "\"If this is going to be a smooth handoff, some other agency has to pick up what the Education Department is setting down,\" he said. \"The most logical destination is the Treasury, but I worry about the risk of disruption from any handoff.\"",
      "Project 2025 posits that student loans should be handled by a \"new government corporation with professional governance and management.\" The blueprint calls for federal loans \"to be assigned directly to the Treasury Department, which would manage collections.\"",
      "Project 2025 also favors phasing out income-based repayment plans, which help borrowers lower their monthly loan payments by making them proportional to their wages and salaries, and creating a new repayment plan that would require people earning above poverty wages to pay 10% of their income toward their loans.",
      "\"[T]here should be no loan forgiveness,\" Project 2025 states.",
      "What would happen to the FAFSA if the Education Department is abolished?",
      "The Education Department required by law to release the FAFSA on or close to Oct. 1, allowing students and their families to apply for loans and other student aid during the college application season.

      "\"Congress passed a law that created the FAFSA, and unless Congress creates a new law, the FAFSA has to continue,\" Granville said.",
      "Still, it's unclear which agency would handle the FAFSA if the Department of Education is dismantled, he added.",
      "What would happen to federal funding for public K-12 schools?",
      "Much of the Education Department's money for K-12 schools is funneled through large federal programs, such as Title I for low-income schools and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Those programs support services for students with disabilities, smaller class sizes with additional teaching positions, and pay for social workers and other non-teaching roles in schools.",
      "During his campaign, Mr. Trump called for shifting those functions to the states. He has not offered details on how the agency's core functions of sending federal money to local districts and schools would be handled.",

      "There's concern that making massive changes to the Education Department could impact millions of families and students who rely on the agency for loans, grants and other support, experts say.",

      "\"That will mean higher local and state taxes to fill the void,\" Sanders said at a Thursday press conference organized by the Senate Democrats about the potential dismantling of the Education Department. \"In other words, shutting down the Department of Education would be a disaster for low income and working class families in every state of our country.\"",

      "\"The directive to 'return decision-making to the states' fails the smell test,\" said AFT President Randi Weingarten in a statement. \"States and districts already govern schools through locally elected school boards, as they should.

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday said he will pause 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada that are covered under a 2020 trade agreement, delaying levies\u00a0imposed on the nations\u00a0earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the delay in the Mexico tariffs in a social media post after a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. On Thursday afternoon, he signed two executive orders stating the exemptions would apply to U.S. imports of products from both Mexico and Canada that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Goods that are not covered by the agreement remain subject to tariffs.",
      "\"After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement,\" Mr. Trump wrote, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. He characterized the move \"as an accommodation\" for the Mexican leader.",
      "\"Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl. Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "When asked if any concessions had been offered by Canada or Mexico to lead to the pause, a White House official told CBS News that during leader-to-leader discussions, Mexico brought up progress it had made cracking down on cartels and drugs, including cocaine.",
      "The USMCA agreement covers the vast majority of imports from Mexico. In a press conference Thursday, Sheinbaum said that nearly all of Mexico's trade with the U.S. is covered under the trade pact which is in effect until April 2.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. imported more than $45 billion worth of agricultural products from Mexico. Almost three-quarters of such imports consisted of vegetables, fruit, beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Canadian energy, which is not included in the USMCA, is expected to be tariffed at 10%, which could boost gas prices and heating and electricity costs in the U.S. Potash that U.S. farmers import from Canada would be tariffed at the same rate.",
      "According to a White House official, in 2024, 38% of all imports from Canada were covered by the USMCA and therefore exempt from tariffs, while 49.6% of all imports from Mexico were covered under the agreement.",
      "International trade expert Barry Appleton, a senior fellow at the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that \"a massive amount of goods\" fall under the brief exemption from tariffs on imports from Canada. They include auto parts, steel and aluminum, beef and other products.",
      "Despite the brief reprieve. uncertainty around the tariffs have \"broken complex supply chains that will never be fixed,\" Appleton said.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, underlined the importance of cooperation on trade.",
      "\"Though today's delay mitigates some of economic damage U.S. tariffs will cause, this is not a moment to celebrate. The economy is not a toy to play with. Constant threats and economic uncertainty have taken their toll. We see it in delayed business investments, shaky consumer confidence, stalled capital flows and a volatile stock market. People's livelihoods are at stake,\" he said in a statement provided to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The only outcome that makes sense for both economies is for all tariffs to be taken off the table, without exception,\" Holmes added.",
      "Economists have warned that tariffs are likely to lead to price increases on an array of goods, from vegetables and fruit to automobiles. Levies on materials from Canada and Mexico used in car production won't go into effect immediately after Mr. Trump also issued one-month exemption from tariffs for automakers Wednesday, following conversations with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram.",
      "Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs before, and business leaders say uncertainty around which policies will actually take effect has created confusion for businesses and consumers.",
      "Some of the most prominent retail executives in the U.S. have spoken out about the tariffs, saying they'd almost certainly lead to increased costs, some of which will be passed along to American consumers.",

      "Walgreens Boots Alliance says it has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners as the struggling retailer looks to turn itself around after years of losing money.",
      "Walgreens said Thursday that Sycamore will pay $11.45 per share, giving the deal an equity value just under $10 billion. Shareholders could eventually receive up to another $3 per share under certain conditions.",
      "A buyout to take the drugstore chain private would give it more flexibility to make changes to improve its business without worrying about Wall Street's reaction. The company has already been making some big changes as it seeks to turn around its business. Walgreens has been a public company since 1927.",
      "Walgreens, founded in 1901, has been dealing with thin prescription reimbursement, rising costs, persistent theft and inflation-sensitive shoppers who are looking for bargains elsewhere. Walgreens is in the early stages of a plan to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 U.S. locations.",
      "The Deerfield, Illinois, company had already shed about a thousand U.S. stores since it grew to nearly 9,500 after buying some Rite Aid locations in 2018.",
      "The company also said last August that it was reviewing a U.S. health care operation it had expanded aggressively, and it might sell all or part of its VillageMD clinic business. That announcement came less than two years after the company said it would spend billions to expand it.",
      "Shares of Walgreens shed nearly two thirds of their value last year. Walgreens said the transaction price represents a nearly 30% premium to the share price in December when reports of a deal first surfaced. Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth confirmed in January that a sale process for the business was underway. Including debt, the value of the deal is just under $24 billion, the company said.",
      "Walgreens said earlier this year it was making progress improving prescription reimbursement.",
      "Walgreens has also taken steps to preserve cash. It said in January that it was suspending a quarterly dividend it has offered for more than 90 years, and it's been reducing its stake in the drug distributor Cencora this year to get cash in part to pay down debt.",
      "Ultimately, the company has to improve its cash flow, whether it remains publicly traded or goes private, Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny said in a Feb. 23 research note.",
      "\"Management has not been shy about its push to improve the cash flow generation profile as part of the turnaround plan,\" the analyst wrote. \"Without cash flow, none of the value cases work.\"",
      "Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. also runs nearly 3,700 international stores, with locations in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Thailand and Ireland.",
      "The Walgreens buyout comes after competitor Rite Aid emerged last September as a private company from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Remaining publicly traded drugstore operators include the nation's largest, CVS Health Corp., and retailers like Walmart and the grocer Kroger that run pharmacies at many of their locations.",

    "story": [
      "Health care is so expensive that 31 million U.S. adults, or 12%, had to borrow a total of $74 billion last year to obtain medical care, new data shows. That includes people with health insurance, making such numbers even more troubling.",
      "Almost one-third of the more than 3,500 people surveyed by Gallup and West Health, a group of nonprofit health care organizations, said they're \"very concerned\" that a major health event would lead to medical debt despite most of them having some form of health care coverage.",
      "The survey results underscore how exposed individuals and families can be to financial hardship just to pay for essential health care services.",
      "\"What's very visible here is families are forced to take out loans and borrow to cover expensive care that is needed,\" Tim Lash, president of West Health, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These big numbers are concerning, but the humanity is lost in the billions and trillions as we reduce this down to what the lived experience is of the American individual and families.\"",
      "To avoid taking on debt, families sometimes make tradeoffs, such as purchasing fewer groceries or not paying rent in order to get the care they need, Lash added.",
      "Nearly one in five adults between the ages of 18 and 28 reported borrowing money to pay for health care, according to the survey. Only 9% of Americans between 50 and 64 and 2% of those 65 or older reported having to borrow money to obtain needed medical care.",
      "\"There are a lot of disparities in terms of who borrows,\" Lash said. That's in part because Medicare, which is available to people who are 65 or older, provides enrollees with relatively comprehensive coverage.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0An\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that was sent to lawmakers this week showed that budget goals outlined in a House GOP plan could not be reached without reducing spending on Medicaid, clashing with commitments from Republicans not to cut the popular entitlement program.",
      "House Republicans adopted a budget proposal last week that serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. The resolution must be adopted by the Senate before the chambers can move forward with the budget reconciliation process, a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But opponents of the resolution have warned that the proposed cuts implicate key programs that Americans rely on, concerns that the CBO analysis backed up.",
      "Republicans want to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending over a 10-year period to pay for trillions in tax cuts, while increasing funding in some areas. The budget resolution directs congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview.",
      "The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with finding at least $880 billion in cuts over the next decade. A pair of House Democrats asked the CBO for the projected mandatory spending on programs under the committee's jurisdiction, excluding Medicare, which offers health coverage for seniors. Medicaid provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans, with costs split between the federal government and the states.",
      "CBO found that Medicaid accounts for 93% of all remaining non-Medicare mandatory spending, with $581 billion going to other programs. That means the committee couldn't meet its $880 billion target without touching the program. GOP leaders have not proposed cutting Medicare, leaving Medicaid as the source of potential cuts.",
      "House Republican leaders have stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution and said benefits would not be cut, noting that last week's vote was merely to begin the reconciliation process. But Republicans have said they plan to remove \"fraud, waste and abuse\" within the program, and many members support work requirements that could limit eligibility for benefits. Other GOP lawmakers have expressed concerns about making cuts to the program, since many of their constituents and voters rely on coverage.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Thursday that the CBO findings \"confirmed what we have long understood to be the case with the reckless Republican budget.\"",
      "\"Republicans are trying to rip healthcare away from tens of millions of Americans,\" the New York Democrat said, pledging that \"every single Democrat\" will stand against the House plan.",

      "The House passed the bill in a 217 to 213 vote, with one Republican opposing it and one Democrat supporting it. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky was the sole Republican \"no\" vote, while Rep. Jared Golden of Maine was the lone Democratic \"yes.\"",
      "House Republican leadership unveiled the legislation on Saturday. The bill increases defense spending and funding for veterans' health care, while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels. It also includes more funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Congress faces a deadline to fund the government by the end of the day Friday. With the House passage, the bill now goes to the Senate. But the measure will require Democratic support in the GOP-controlled upper chamber, where 60 votes are needed for passage, and some Democrats have held their cards close to their vest.",
      "The House vote",
      "House Republicans, with a razor-thin majority, opted to forge ahead on their own on the continuing resolution, as House Democratic leadership expressed staunch opposition to the measure. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said ahead of the vote that the caucus \"will not be complicit in the Republican effort to hurt the American people.\"",
      "Jeffries called the continuing resolution a \"partisan, reckless spending bill\" and \"an attack\" on veterans, families and seniors.",
      "\"Bipartisan negotiations were underway,\" Jeffries said. \"But when Donald Trump says jump, extreme MAGA Republicans say how high, and he ordered the Republicans to leave the negotiating table to try to jam this far-right extremist bill down the throats of the American people.\"",

      "\"But they have so far been unable and unwilling to do that,\" Aguilar said.",
      "With narrow Republican majorities in the House in recent years, Democrats have repeatedly helped prevent a government shutdown. And historically, the effort to get government funding over the finish line has been bipartisan. But many Democrats had reservations about the GOP-led six-month stopgap measure, warning that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts.",
      "While a number of House Republicans said they were on the fence about supporting the continuing resolution ahead of the vote, ultimately only Massie voted against the continuing resolution. His opposition earned him a primary threat from President Trump, who wrote in a post on Truth Social that he would \"lead the charge against him.\"",
      "Given Massie's stance, House Republicans couldn't afford to lose any additional votes. Johnson huddled with possible holdouts on the House floor ahead of the vote, including Rep. Andy Ogles and Tim Burchett of Tennessee. The White House worked to rally possible holdouts around the measure, with the president himself making calls to lawmakers, a White House official confirmed to CBS News. Vice President JD Vance also attended the House Republican conference meeting Tuesday morning to make the case for backing the continuing resolution.",
      "Meanwhile, Johnson projected confidence heading into the vote, saying at a news conference Tuesday morning that Republicans would have the necessary support for the measure despite the opposition from Democrats. And House leaders told members to leave town after the vote, adding to pressure on the Senate to approve the funding measure.",
      "\"We're going to pass the CR,\" Johnson said, while criticizing Democrats for what he called a \"striking new posture\" on government funding. \"We can do it on our own.\"",
      "Johnson could breathe a sigh of relief on Monday night when the House Freedom Caucus, a group of hard-liners who often oppose continuing resolutions on principle, said its members would back the stopgap funding measure.",
      "\"Contrary to Congress' longtime abuse of this legislative tool, this CR is a paradigm shift,\" the group said in a statement.",
      "The group argued in the statement that the stopgap bill would eliminate the need for an omnibus bill, a massive package filled with earmarks that lawmakers often turn to under time pressure to fund the government. And they said that the temporary funding measure will \"reduce and then freeze spending for the next six months to allow President Trump and his Administration to continue their critical work within the Executive Branch to find and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse.\" Some of the hard-liners met with Mr. Trump last week at the White House.",
      "The path forward",
      "With the approval in the House, the measure now goes to the Senate, where support from a number of Democrats will be necessary to pass the continuing resolution and send it to the president's desk. Though many Senate Democrats have spoken out against the stopgap measure, some have kept their powder dry \u2014 keeping the door open to preventing a shutdown if no other options are on the table.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wouldn't weigh in on his caucus' stance, saying ahead of the vote on Tuesday that Senate Democrats would \"wait and see what the House does first.\" Senate Democrats are expected to meet Wednesday to determine their next moves.",
      "Democrats have signaled in recent days that they would prefer a shorter-term funding measure that would give appropriators more time to flesh out new spending bills. The top Democratic appropriators, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, introduced a continuing resolution that would fund the government through April 11 on Monday. But after the House approved the six-month continuing resolution, and with plans to leave town, their options remain limited.",
      "Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, told CBS News that he supports a short-term \"proper\" stopgap measure to continue the appropriations process, adding in response to the House planning to leave town that \"they like to bully and threaten.\"",

In response, Ontario agreed to suspend its 25 per cent surcharge on exports of electricity to Michigan, New York and Minnesota.\"",
      "Moments after the Ford-Lutnick joint statement was issued, the president told reporters he's considering dialing back the 50% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports he announced earlier, saying he's \"looking at it\" and could \"make a different decision.\"",

      "The president also called on Canada to drop tariffs on various U.S. dairy products, and said he will be declaring a \"national emergency on electricity\" in the areas affected by Canada's electricity surcharge.

      "The president also reiterated his desire for Canada to become the United States' 51st state, a proposal Canadians oppose, suggesting the northern neighbor won't face tariff pressure if they acquiesce.",
      "\"The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.

      "\"Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation,\"\u00a0 the U.S. and Ukraine said in a joint statement released by the State Department. \"The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace.\"",
      "The agreement came after more than eight hours of\u00a0negotiations\u00a0between Ukrainian officials and a U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the Saudi city of Jeddah.",
      "The statement said the U.S. \"will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine.\" Both were frozen\u00a0in the wake of an explosive meeting between Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Trump at the White House on Feb. 28.",
      "The now-unfrozen military aid includes roughly $1 billion in equipment that was approved by the Biden administration and has not yet been delivered. The Trump administration has the authority to provide another $3.8 billion in aid but has not announced any further aid packages. Ukraine has been buoyed by the U.S. and other Western allies in its fight against Russia since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion in 2022, and the move to cut off aid left Kyiv at a disadvantage and European allies scrambling.",

      "\"We'll take this offer now to the Russians. And we hope that they'll say yes, that they'll say yes to peace,\" Rubio said. \"The president's objective here is, number one, above everything else, he wants the war to end, and I think today Ukraine has taken a concrete step in that regard. We hope the Russians will reciprocate.\"",
      "The statement from the U.S. and Ukraine said they would each \"name their negotiating teams and immediately begin negotiations toward an enduring peace that provides for Ukraine's long-term security.\"",
      "It also said Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy would \"conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine's critical mineral resources to expand Ukraine's economy and guarantee Ukraine's long-term prosperity and security.\" Washington has been pushing Kyiv to sign a deal which would grant the U.S. access to its mineral reserves, and Zelenskyy indicated his readiness to sign a deal ahead of the talks.",
      "Rubio led the U.S. delegation to Saudi Arabia, supported by Witkoff and national security adviser Mike Waltz. Zelenskyy was visiting Saudi Arabia at the time of the talks, but did not participate.",
      "Ahead of the talks, a senior Ukrainian official said his message to the U.S. team was the Kyiv was ready to make a peace deal with Russia, and that while Zelenskyy might still want Western security guarantees as part of the deal to deter any future Russian aggression, the focus was \"how to start this process.\"",
      "Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, said his delegation's central message for the U.S. was that \"Ukrainians want a peace,\" and that Ukraine was \"ready to go\" to work toward that goal.",
      "When asked about security guarantees, Yermak said they were \"very important, because we want that never, this aggression, [is] never repeated in the future again.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A pair of federal judges warned Tuesday of continued threats against members of the judiciary amid criticism leveled by Elon Musk and threats of impeachment by Republicans in Congress. They warned such attacks strike at judicial independence.",
      "Judges Jeffrey Sutton and Richard Sullivan, who sit on the federal appeals courts, raised concerns about the increase in threats against judges in a call with reporters hosted by the Judicial Conference, the policymaking body for the federal judiciary.",
      "Sullivan, who chairs the committee on judicial security, said the protection of judges and federal courthouses around the country is a top priority for the judiciary and recent cuts to the U.S. Marshals Service's budget is a concern. The agency provides security for federal courts and judges.",
      "\"Our system of government is premised on three independent branches and a judiciary that can function independently,\" he said. \"That's what makes it work, and so it's crucial that people understand that.\"",
      "Sutton, meanwhile, said that while the types of threats against judges have evolved over time, they arise directly from the fact that they're doing their jobs.",
      "\"We're supposed to say what the law means, and there's 1,000 federal judges out there, we each take that responsibility seriously,\" he said, adding that judges take an oath to interpret the law neutrally and dispassionately. \"It's a shame to see people attacking judges simply for doing their level best to do their job.\"",
      "Sutton and Sullivan both noted that the justice system allows the losing party to appeal an adverse decision from the trial court to an appeals court and then the Supreme Court.",
      "\"We allocate disappointment to half the people that come before us,\" Sutton said. \"Criticism is no surprise. It's part of the job. But I do think when it gets to the level of a threat, it really is about attacking judicial independence, and that's just not good for the system or the country.\"",
      "Sutton is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, and Sullivan sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. Sutton was appointed by President George W. Bush, and Sullivan was named to the appeals court by President Trump during his first term.",

Musk, who the president said is leading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, has called some members of the judiciary \"evil\" and said they should be \"fired.\"",
      "In a post last month to X, the social media company he owns, Musk claimed the country is witnessing \"an attempted coup of American democracy by radical left activists posing as judges\" and said in another post that there \"need to be some repercussions above zero for judges who make truly terrible decisions.\"",
      "Republicans in the House have also introduced impeachment resolutions against U.S. District Judges Paul Engelmayer, Amir Ali and John Bates because of decisions they dislike, which were issued in the early stages of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "The impeachment efforts are unlikely to succeed. Just 15 federal judges have been impeached by the House and eight were convicted by the Senate and removed from office, according to the Federal Judicial Center.",
      "\"Threats to judges are threats to judicial independence. They've been around for a long time. There's lots of different mechanisms. Threats of impeachment \u2014 this is not the first time this has happened,\" Sutton said. \"One thing worth keeping in mind is if we dilute the standards for impeachment, that's not just a problem for judges, that's a problem for all three branches of government.\"",
      "Sullivan said that amid the evolving threat landscape, and as there are more threats to judges, public officials must be responsible in their comments about the system of justice.",
      "\"The reality is that there are a lot of folks who will respond and react perhaps inappropriately based on something they heard or read, and so, I just think it's important for everyone to be responsible in what they say about our process,\" he said.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts separately spoke of the importance of preserving judicial independence in his year-end report closing out 2024. He highlighted four areas that he said threatened the independence of judges: violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments.",
      "When it comes to protecting judges from threats, the federal judiciary's Vulnerability Management Program provided services to more than 1,700 judges, 114 retired judges and 235 family members last year, according to the Judicial Conference's annual report, released Tuesday.",
      "The program was established after Congress passed legislation responding to the 2020 killing of the son of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas at her home in New Jersey. The gunman found the judge's address, pictures of her house and vehicle information online.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 09:34:23 -0400",
    "summary": "Congress is staring down a deadline to fund the government by the end of the week, as the familiar threat of a shutdown looms over Washington.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress is staring down a deadline to fund the government by the end of the week, as the familiar threat of a shutdown looms over Washington.",
      "Lawmakers have until the end of the day on Friday, March 14, to fund the government. But it remains to be seen whether House Republicans will be able to muster the near-unanimous GOP support they'll need to pass the short-term funding bill, known as a continuing resolution.",
      "Here's what to know about the funding fight:",
      "What is a government shutdown, exactly?",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding or funding extensions for federal agencies and programs, resulting in a funding gap that prompts federal agencies to shut down projects and activities. During a shutdown, agencies halt nonessential functions until Congress approves funding and the president signs it into law. Essential services, like air traffic control and law enforcement, continue during a shutdown, but workers go without pay until funding is passed. Shutdowns can also disrupt processing of government benefits, loans and applications and shutter national parks.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans have used funding deadlines to their advantage in recent decades, leveraging the threat of a government shutdown to pass spending bills with their priorities attached. But lawmakers generally have strong incentives to avoid shutdowns, since they can be economically and politically costly. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the last funding lapse caused a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "How does Congress fund the government?",
      "Article I of the Constitution gives \u00a0Congress the power to approve any money spent by the federal government. Bills to approve that spending must originate in the House, pass the Senate and be signed by the president before departments and agencies can use the funds.",
      "Congress is tasked annually with approving spending bills before the beginning of the fiscal year on Oct. 1. Under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the president is supposed to submit a budget to Congress by the first Monday of February, outlining how much the executive branch needs for the coming year. The House and Senate budget committees then go on to pass a budget resolution by the middle of April, before the House begins considering the 12 individual appropriations bills drafted by subcommittees to fund different areas of the government, to be concluded by the end of June.",
      "In recent decades, Congress has hardly ever stuck to that timeline. Instead, lawmakers opt almost every year for continuing resolutions that extend funding before ultimately adopting massive bills, known as omnibus packages, in lieu of the 12 appropriations bills to get the new funding over the finish line. Tucked within those omnibus packages are often policies or programs that wouldn't pass if they were taken up in isolation, making them appealing to some lawmakers.",
      "Currently, Congress is still working on the funding process that was meant to be resolved by October of last year. Lawmakers passed a funding patch just ahead of the deadline in late September, giving themselves three more months to reach an agreement on new government funding and pass appropriations bills. Then in December, Congress approved another extension, setting up the March 14 deadline.",
      "What needs to happen this week to prevent a shutdown?",
      "To fund the government and avert a shutdown, both the House and Senate need to pass a stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution, extending funding. The measure would then go to President Trump for his signature.",
      "House Republicans unveiled a continuing resolution over the weekend, which would extend government funding through September. The stopgap measure would increase defense spending, along with additional funding for veterans' health care, while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels. The bill also includes more funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "The House Rules Committee advanced the measure Monday night, setting up a vote on the floor on Tuesday. Republicans, who have a razor-thin majority in the House, are working to shore up support on the measure, as House Democratic leaders project widespread, if not unanimous, opposition from members of their caucus. Already at least one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, has pledged to oppose the continuing resolution.",
      "In response, Mr. Trump said on Truth Social that Massie should be primaried. The president has also been making calls to potential GOP holdouts on the continuing resolution, a White House official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "If the House is unable to find the necessary support for the six-month continuing resolution, lawmakers would likely move to a shorter-term funding measure that would give appropriators more time to flesh out new spending bills. Democrats have signaled in recent days that they prefer the latter approach. The top Democratic appropriators, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, introduced a continuing resolution that would fund the government through April 11 on Monday. The bill would likely find wide bipartisan margins in both chambers, while frustrating conservatives.",
      "Many Democrats have reservations about the six-month stopgap measure, warning that it would give the Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts. That's because a continuing resolution, unlike regular appropriations bills, lacks a congressional statement of direction on how funds are to be spent by a department or agency. Democrats have also expressed frustration with the spending reductions in the continuing resolution. But Democrats generally aren't inclined to let the government shut down, and House Republicans \u2014 expected to leave town after the stopgap measure passes \u2014 are exerting pressure to avoid a shutdown.",
      "Should the House find enough support to approve the six-month stopgap measure, it would then go to the Senate. But the upper chamber poses its own hurdles. Republicans have a 53-seat majority in the Senate, but 60 votes are necessary to propel the bill to passage, meaning support from Democrats will be needed. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has also pledged to oppose the measure, making support from at least eight Democrats necessary to pass the measure and send it to the president's desk.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "Since the current budget process was enacted in 1976, Congress has prompted 20 funding gaps lasting at least one full day, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "Many of those funding lapses were short lived and didn't prompt a shutdown, while a handful have been lengthy funding fights with major political significance and impact. In 2013, a feud over the Affordable Care Act prompted a shutdown. And disagreements over immigration prompted two shutdowns in 2018 \u2014 the second of which marked the most recent government shutdown, and the longest on record.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history started in 2018 and lasted 34 days. The shutdown occurred over an impasse on funding for Mr. Trump's border wall during his first term. But as the fight stretched into the new year, the president signed a bill to reopen the government without his demands being met.",
      "Before the 2018-2019 shutdown, a 1995-1996 shutdown held the record for the longest, at 21 days. The dispute concerned disagreement over spending cuts between President Bill Clinton and then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

The same day, a federal judge blocked Khalil's deportation and scheduled a court hearing after Khalil's attorney filed a petition challenging the arrest.",
      "The president wrote in a post on his social media platform Truth Social that his administration \"will not tolerate\" what he said is \"pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American\" activity on college campuses across the country, and claimed the protests are being waged by \"paid agitators\" rather than students. As a student at Columbia University last spring, Khalil helped lead demonstrations protesting Israel and the war in Gaza.",
      "\"We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country \u2014 never to return again,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"If you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here. We expect every one of America's Colleges and Universities to comply.\"",
      "The president said the Saturday night arrest of Khalil is \"the first arrest of many to come.\"",
      "Last year, Khalil and other Columbia students set up an encampment on the school's main lawn to protest the ongoing war in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, which Israel launched in response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack. More than 1,200 people in southern Israel were killed in the massacre and another 251 were taken hostage. Tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in the fighting since, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.",
      "Khalil's lawyer, Amy Greer, said in a statement that he was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents Saturday night. Greer said the ICE agents said Khalil's student visa had been revoked, but Greer noted that he is a U.S. green card holder.",

      "\"We will vigorously be pursuing Mahmoud's rights in court, and will continue our efforts to right this terrible and inexcusable \u2014 and calculated \u2014 wrong committed against him,\" Greer said. \"ICE's arrest and detention of Mahmoud follows the U.S. government's open repression of student activism and political speech, specifically targeting students at Columbia University for criticism of Israel's assault on Gaza.

Rand Paul of Kentucky, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Ted Budd of North Carolina were the only Republicans to oppose her.

      "Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three Republicans who supported the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, a bill that would have made it easier for workers to unionize that was introduced in the last Congress.

      "Though Paul's opposition threatened to tank Chavez-DeRemer's advancement out of committee last month, three Democrats on the committee ultimately voted to move her nomination forward. And although Democrats haven't been eager to support some of Mr. Trump's nominees amid intense criticism of the administration's work so far, they didn't mount serious opposition to Chavez-DeRemer's confirmation.",

    "summary": "\"CANCELLED: $600,000 grant to study 'menstrual cycles in transgender men,'\" Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said on X last week. That's not what it was.",
    "story": [
      "Last Friday, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins stated on X that a $600,000 grant to Southern University in Louisiana was being revoked for studying \"menstrual cycles in transgender men,\" in the latest mischaracterization of a grant that was then canceled by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency team, known as DOGE.",
      "DOGE highlighted the Rollins post, reposting it on the official doge.gov website and on X.",
      "The grant was actually intended for research on the potential health risks posed by synthetic feminine hygiene products and for developing alternatives using natural fibers and fabrics, according to the project's documentation, which was publicly filed on the USDA website.",
      "According to that documentation, the goals of the grant were to develop sustainable feminine hygiene products using regenerative cotton, wool, and industrial hemp while enhancing education through an extension program that teaches women and girls about menstrual health and reusable products. It also would have funded a fiber processing center for locally grown fibers in Louisiana \u2014 potentially benefiting a state with some of the highest unemployment and poverty rates in the country.",
      "The USDA's decision to cancel the grant appears to have been a result of the grant being flagged to the Trump administration by the American Principles Project, a conservative think tank.",
      "Cailey Myers, a spokesperson for the American Principles Project, said in an email to CBS News, \"This grant clearly denies biological reality \u2014 men don't menstruate,\" but did not provide any evidence the grant funded research into \"menstrual cycles in transgender men.\"",
      "A USDA spokesperson confirmed this reasoning in a statement emailed to CBS News, saying the taxpayer-funded education component of the grant \"prioritized women identifying as men who might menstruate.\"",
      "\"This mission certainly does not align with the priorities and policies of the Trump Administration, which maintains that there are two sexes: male and female,\" the statement said.",
      "While the grant language does include a single sentence acknowledging that transgender men are among those who menstruate, there was no indication that they were the focus of the grant or even part of it. The passing reference to transgender men in the original grant application appears to be the sole justification for its cancellation.",
      "The description of the grant's goals, objectives and project methods contains no mention of prioritizing transgender men and focuses solely on the development of menstrual products made from natural fibers. The grant repeatedly notes that it would focus on efforts to \"educate young women and adolescent girls\" about menstrual hygiene products.",
      "The USDA, asked in a follow-up question whether it had any evidence that the study prioritized transgender men, did not respond.",
      "The true purpose of the project, according to the grant, was to \"address the growing concerns and issues surrounding menstruation, including the potential health risks posed to users of synthetic feminine hygiene products.\"",
      "According to 2022 study published in the journal Current Environmental Health Reports, there have only been limited studies on the risks of environmental contamination from synthetic hygiene products, despite the potential for toxic chemical exposure. Some of the concerns include whether exposure to heavy metals and PFAS chemicals could be harmful or cancer causing.",
      "Dr. Samii Kennedy Benson, who oversaw the program, told the local NBC affiliate WVLA the program held potential for U.S. farmers.",
      "\"Our local fiber processing facility will benefit local farmers who often grow fibers on a smaller scale and so we'll also have that ability to provide something local,\" Benson said.",
      "CBS affiliate WAFB in Baton Rouge also covered the project.",
      "In an email, Benson told CBS News that she received notification her grant had been canceled on Saturday but had not been aware of why until contacted by CBS News.",
      "Southern University, which is a public historically Black land-grant university in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told CBS News \"the term 'transgender men' was only used once to state that this project, through the development of safer and healthier FHPs [feminine hygiene products], would benefit all biological women.\"",
      "A statement from Southern University said the grant was reviewed by researchers from throughout the country before going forward.",
      "Although the overall dollar amount of the grant is small in the larger context of government spending, it was posted by a Trump Cabinet secretary and re-shared by DOGE. As a result, the tweets reached over 5 million people on X by Sunday evening. It was also covered by Fox News and other conservative outlets.",
      "Since DOGE first began posting to its \"wall of receipts,\" news organizations have found numerous mistakes in both the claims of money saved and the descriptions of programs being shut down.",
      "In one instance, a contract was alleged to have been worth $8 billion, but was in fact worth just $8 million. Additionally, hundreds of millions of contracts and grants have been removed from the \"wall of receipts\" after reporters exposed errors including double or triple postings of the same contract.",
      "DOGE has also claimed credit for the sale of a building in Washington, D.C., that was sold at auction under the Biden administration.",
      "Hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts have been canceled due to inclusion of phrases or words that the Trump administration believes are associated with diversity, equity or inclusion, or DEI \u2014 initiatives Mr. Trump is seeking to ban by executive order \u2014 or for conflicting with his executive order declaring that the federal government recognizes only \"two sexes, male and female.\""

DOGE is supposed to be tasked with eliminating government waste and posted in February a \"wall of receipts\" outlining the money allegedly saved by cutting government programs. CBS News has found that the \"wall of receipts\" contained multiple errors, and DOGE's purges have faced numerous challenges in court.",
      "USAID, which was founded in 1961 by President Kennedy, provided humanitarian aid to more than 100 countries, including disaster relief, health and medical aid, and emergency food programs. In fiscal year 2023, USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations, the Congressional Research Service said, a figure that is less than 1% of the federal budget.",

      "In early February, two top security officials were placed on administrative leave after they refused to allow DOGE access to classified information, sources confirmed to CBS News. Matt Hopson, tapped by Mr. Trump to be USAID chief of staff just two weeks earlier, resigned shortly afterward and USAID's website went dark. By the end of that week, nearly all of the agency's staff were put on administrative leave and all of its overseas staff were ordered to be shuttered.",
      "Meanwhile, a USAID deputy administrator was put on administrative leave in February for issuing memos saying the agency had failed to implement humanitarian assistance due to \"political leadership\" at the agency and DOGE.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order his first day in office that froze federal funding for foreign assistance for 90 days amid a review of foreign aid, although the State Department later issued a waiver for \"life-saving \"life-saving humanitarian assistance,\" defined as \"life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter, and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies and reasonable administrative costs as necessary to deliver such assistance.\"",
      "The Supreme Court last week declined to halt a lower court order that required the Trump administration to unfreeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid funding, which could clear the way for reimbursements for organizations that have done work for USAID overseas.

    "summary": "The dispute will be heard by the Supreme Court in its next term, which begins in October.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to take up a challenge to state and local laws that ban so-called \"conversion therapy\" for LGBTQ children.",
      "The dispute before the court arose out of a Colorado law that prohibits licensed mental health professionals from engaging in conversion therapy on children who may be questioning their sexual orientation or gender identity. More than 20 states and the District of Columbia have similar laws on the books. The case will be heard in the Supreme Court's next term, which begins in October. A decision is expected by the end of June 2026.",
      "Colorado enacted the Minor Conversion Therapy Law in 2019 following what the state said was a growing mental health crisis among young people in the state and \"mounting evidence\" that conversion therapy is tied to increased depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation.",
      "The law prohibits \"any practice or treatment [upon minors] \u2026 that attempts or purports to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attraction or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\"",
      "The state joined more than a dozen others in disciplining mental health professionals who practice conversion therapy on minors. Those who are found to engage in this practice face a range of punishments, from fines to a letter of admonition to having their license revoked.",
      "The challenge to Colorado's law was brought by Kaley Chiles, a professional counselor who is licensed by the state and uses talk therapy in her practice. A practicing Christian, Chiles works with adults and young people, and many of her clients are also Christian.",
      "According to court papers, some of Chiles' clients seek Christian-based counseling \"to reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with [their] physical body.\"",
      "Chiles' sued the state of Colorado in September 2022 and sought to block enforcement of the state's restriction on conversion therapy. She argued that the measure violates her free speech rights under the First Amendment and censors her conversations with clients based on viewpoint.",
      "A federal district court declined to block the law, finding that it regulates professional conduct that incidentally involves speech. The court also found that conversion therapy is \"ineffective and harms minors.\"",
      "Chiles' appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which upheld the lower court's decision. The 10th Circuit said that the restriction on conversion therapy implicates speech solely as to the practice of mental health treatment, which can be licensed by the state. The appeals court also concluded that Colorado's law advances its interests in protecting minors and the integrity of the mental health profession.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, lawyers for Chiles argued that she does not seek to \"cure\" her clients of same-sex attractions or change their sexual orientation. Instead, they said she aims to help her clients \"with their stated desires and objectives in counseling, which sometimes includes clients seeking to reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with one's physical body.\"",
      "\"Colorado disagrees with Chiles's beliefs on gender and sexuality. So much so that the State puts itself in Chiles's counseling room, forbidding her from discussing the values she and her clients share,\" her lawyers wrote in a Supreme Court filing. She is represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group.",
      "But Colorado officials said that the First Amendment allows states to regulate professional conduct to protect patients from \"substandard treatment,\"even when that rule \"incidentally\" burdens speech. They argued that efforts to change a young person's sexual orientation or gender identity are \"unsafe and ineffective.\"",
      "\"A professional's treatment of her patients and clients is fundamentally different, for First Amendment purposes, from laypersons' interactions with each other,\" Colorado officials wrote in a filing. \"Unlike laypersons, those who choose to practice as health professionals are required, among various other responsibilities, to provide treatment to their patients consistent with their field's standard of care.\"",
      "The state argued that Chiles' claim undercut the ability of states to protect patients and clients from \"harmful professional conduct.\"",
      "The Supreme Court has been asked before to jump into the debate over conversion therapy, but had previously declined to intervene. In 2023, the court turned away a First Amendment challenge to a Washington state law that prohibits licensed therapists from performing conversion therapy on patients under the age of 18.",

The states claim that oil and gas companies engaged in deceptive marketing by misrepresenting the dangers of their fossil fuel products, which caused consumers to use more of them.",
      "The oil and gas companies sought to move nearly all the cases to federal court, arguing that federal law governs interstate emissions, but the efforts were rejected by U.S. courts of appeals.",

They asked the high court to block the civil suits filed by the Democratic-led states and prevent other litigation seeking similar relief in the future.",
      "The red states allege that the claims pending in state court seek to regulate activity outside of the blue states' borders and involve an area governed by federal law.",
      "They argued in a Supreme Court filing that the blue states are seeking \"massive\" penalties and relief against energy producers that are not based in their states. If the Democratic-led states succeed, they warned it would have sweeping impacts on the national energy system.",
      "\"If defendant states are right about the substance and reach of state law, their actions imperil access to affordable energy everywhere and inculpate every state and indeed every person on the planet,\" the red states wrote. \"Consequently, defendant states threaten not only our system of federalism and equal sovereignty among States, but our basic way of life.\"",
      "But the attorneys general for the blue states told the court\u00a0that their state-court actions seek to address local harms resulting from allegedly unlawful deceptive conduct by the oil and gas companies.",

    "story": [
      "Seven years ago, Erica Green learned through a Facebook post that her brother had been shot.",
      "She rushed to check on him at a hospital run by Denver Health, the city's safety-net system, but she was unable to get information from emergency room workers, who complained that she was creating a disturbance.",
      "\"I was distraught and outside, crying, and Jerry came out of the front doors,\" she said.",
      "Jerry Morgan is a familiar face from Green's Denver neighborhood. He had rushed to the hospital after his pager alerted him to the shooting. As a violence prevention professional with the At-Risk Intervention and Mentoring program, or AIM, Morgan supports gun-violence patients and their families at the hospital \u2014 as he did the day Green's brother was shot.",
      "\"It made the situation of that traumatic experience so much better. After that, I was, like, I want to do this work,\" Green said.",
      "Today, Green works with Morgan as the program manager for AIM, a hospital-linked violence intervention program launched in 2010 as a partnership between Denver Health and the nonprofit Denver Youth Program. It since has expanded to include Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado Hospital.",
      "AIM is one of dozens of hospital-linked violence intervention programs around the country. The programs aim to uncover the social and economic factors that contributed to someone ending up in the ER with a bullet wound: inadequate housing, job loss, or feeling unsafe in one's neighborhood, for example.",
      "Such programs that take a public health approach to stopping gun violence have had success \u2014 one in San Francisco reported a fourfold reduction in violent injury recidivism rates over six years. But President Trump's executive orders calling for the review of the Biden administration's gun policies and trillions of dollars in federal grants and loans have created uncertainty around the programs' long-term federal funding. Some organizers believe their programs will be just fine, but others are looking to shore up alternative funding sources.",
      "\"We've been worried about, if a domino does fall, how is it going to impact us? There's a lot of unknowns,\" said John Torres, associate director for Youth Alive, an Oakland, California-based nonprofit.",
      "Federal data shows that gun violence became a leading cause of death among children and young adults at the start of this decade and was tied to more than 48,000 deaths among people of all ages in 2022. New York-based pediatric trauma surgeon Chethan Sathya, a National Institutes of Health-funded firearms injury prevention researcher, believes those statistics show that gun violence can't be ignored as a health care issue. \"It's killing so many people,\" Sathya said.",
      "Research shows that a violent injury puts someone at heightened risk for future ones, and the risk of death goes up significantly by the third violent injury, according to a 2006 study published in The Journal of Trauma: Injury, Infection and Critical Care.",
      "Benjamin Li, an emergency medicine physician at Denver Health and the health system's AIM medical director, said the ER is an ideal setting to intervene in gun violence by working to reverse-engineer what led to a patient's injuries.",
      "\"If you are just seeing the person, patching them up, and then sending them right back into the exact same circumstances, we know it's going to lead to them being hurt again,\" Li said. \"It's critical we address the social determinants of health and then try to change the equation.\"",
      "That might mean providing alternative solutions to gunshot victims who might otherwise seek retaliation, said Paris Davis, the intervention programs director for Youth Alive.",
      "\"If that's helping them relocate out of the area, if that's allowing them to gain housing, if that's shifting that energy into education or job or, you know, family therapy, whatever the needs are for that particular case and individual, that is what we provide,\" Davis said.",
      "AIM outreach workers meet gunshot wound victims at their hospital bedsides to have what Morgan, AIM's lead outreach worker, calls a tough, nonjudgmental conversation on how the patients ended up there.",
      "AIM uses that information to help patients access the resources they need to navigate their biggest challenges after they're discharged, Morgan said. Those challenges can include returning to school or work, or finding housing. AIM outreach workers might also attend court proceedings and assist with transportation to health care appointments.",
      "\"We try to help in whatever capacity we can, but it's interdependent on whatever the client needs,\" Morgan said.",
      "Since 2010, AIM has grown from three full-time outreach workers to nine, and this year opened the REACH Clinic in Denver's Five Points neighborhood. The community-based clinic provides wound-care kits; physical therapy; and behavioral, mental and occupational health care. In the coming months, it plans to add bullet removal to its services. It's part of a growing movement of community-based clinics focused on violent injuries, including the Bullet Related Injury Clinic in St. Louis.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 11:29:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Intuitive Machines says its Athena lunar lander was unable to recharge its batteries while resting on its side, bringing the moon mission to an early end.",
    "story": [
      "A dramatic photograph from Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander shows it touched down Thursday in a crater near the lunar south pole and tipped over on its side. Given a low sun angle and the orientation of the lander's solar cells, the spacecraft's battery quickly drained, bringing the mission to an early end, company officials said Friday",
      "\"Images downlinked from Athena on the lunar surface confirmed that Athena was on her side,\" the company said on its website.",
      "\"After landing, mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones, including NASA's PRIME-1 (drill) suite, before the lander's batteries depleted,\" the statement continued. \"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge. The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.\"",
      "Launched Feb. 26 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",
      "The landing mishap was the second such disappointment for Intuitive Machines. The company's first moon lander, named Odysseus, touched down on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected and a landing leg failed. The vehicle ended up on its side and unable to complete its mission.",
      "Athena's arrival was preceded by the successful touchdown of a commercial lander built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace that also carried NASA-sponsored payloads to the surface. That spacecraft, known as Blue Ghost, landed Sunday in a different region of the moon with much more forgiving terrain.",
      "A third privately-built lander, this one from Tokyo-based ispace, was launched atop the same Falcon 9 that boosted Blue Ghost into space. The Japanese Resilience lander is taking a longer, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to land in June.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 20:35:21 -0500",
    "summary": "A study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Butterflies, known for their beauty and vital role in pollination, are vanishing from U.S. landscapes at an alarming rate. A comprehensive study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
      "The new research offers a stark warning about the potential future of these cherished insects.",
      "\"Losing one out of every five butterflies over 20 years should be a big wake-up call to people,\" said Dr. Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University and co-author of the study. \"These declines are not stopping.\"",
      "While butterflies are the most extensively monitored insect group in the U.S., most past studies have been limited by geography or focused on specific species, a news release on the study said. The researchers behind the Science study used data from more than 12.6 million butterflies spanning 342 individual species, drawing from 76,000 surveys across 35 nationwide monitoring programs.",
      "Funded by the U.S. Geological Survey, the study was the first to integrate such a vast dataset, its authors said. The findings revealed that 33% of butterfly species have experienced significant population declines over the past two decades, with 107 out of the 342 species examined losing more than half of their population \u2014 including 22 species that declined by more than 90%. Meanwhile, only 3% of species showed population increases.",
      "One of the most striking examples is the monarch butterfly. In December 2024, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the monarch under the Endangered Species Act, saying the species' eastern population has declined by about 80% and the western population has dropped by more than 95% since the 1980s.",
      "The species was already designated an endangered species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in 2022.",
      "Ultimately, the butterfly decline is part of a larger global trend of insect population loss, with insects declining by about 1-2% annually, the study's authors said.",
      "Butterflies play an essential role in ecosystems, pollinating flowers, crops, and other plants. Their decline could have far-reaching impacts on plant reproduction and the health of ecosystems.",
      "According to the Science study, habitat loss, climate change, and pesticide use are driving their declines. Rising temperatures and changing climates threaten butterfly populations by disrupting breeding cycles, reducing food sources, and increasing habitat stress. Insecticides have been identified as leading causes of butterfly decline, which can be tackled with policy intervention such as restricting harmful insecticides, promoting integrated pest management and encouraging diversified cropping, according to the study.",
      "Despite the declines, individuals can take steps to help butterfly populations recover, Grames said.",
      "\"One of the really positive messages about insect conservation is that the things we do in our own backyards actually make a difference,\" she said.",
      "She recommends allowing a portion of yards to grow wild with native plants, reducing pesticide use, and creating habitat spaces like small brush piles for insects. \"Even simple actions \u2014 like leaving a strip of wildflowers or planting species that support pollinators \u2014 can provide crucial resources for butterflies and other insects.\"",
      "On a larger scale, experts say conservation efforts, including habitat preservation and climate adaptation strategies, are also essential to protecting vulnerable species and ensuring butterfly populations remain resilient in the face of ongoing environmental changes.",

    "story": [
      "A second commercially-built moon lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, landed near the moon's south pole Thursday, but telemetry indicated it ended up on its side.",
      "The lander is \"alive,\" Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
      "\"We don't believe we're in the correct attitude (orientation) on the surface of the moon yet again,\" Altemus disclosed. \"I don't have all the data yet to say exactly what the attitude of the vehicle is. We're collecting photos now and downlinking those, and we're going to get a picture from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera from above, from orbit, and we'll confirm that over the coming days as we get that data down.\"",
      "The touchdown came one year after Intuitive's first moon lander, named Odysseus, landed on the moon while still moving sideways. A landing leg broke and the spacecraft tipped over on its side, limiting the mission's scientific return. Intuitive's stock fell 20% in the wake of the latest landing problem.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft from Intuitive Machines\u00a0was launched eight days ago by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sharing the ride to space were three other spacecraft: a moon-bound NASA orbiter known as the Lunar Trailblazer, a commercial deep space asteroid prospecting probe named Odin, and a privately-built space tug designed to work in Earth orbit.",
      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",
      "The innovative \"Grace\" hopper was designed to jump into one of those dark craters about a quarter of a mile from Athena for in situ measurements, radioing its observations back to the lander using 4G/LTE cellular network equipment provided by Nokia.",
      "Other instruments on the lander were expected to look for the chemical traces of water and other compounds, along with taking measurements of soil temperature and composition. Two small rovers were on board to explore the landing site and to test innovative mobility systems.",
      "Altemus said it may still be possible to deploy the hopper and the rovers, but that will depend on the lander's orientation.",
      "Second lunar lander to reach moon this year",
      "Athena's arrival is the second of three to reach the moon this year.",
      "A lander built by Austin-based\u00a0Firefly Aerospace successfully touched down on the moon early Sunday, March 2. The commercially-developed Blue Ghost lander is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments designed to collect data needed for the Artemis program.",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million for delivery of the agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations to the moon's surface. The instruments cost NASA another $44 million.",

      "In a 2023 interview, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti told Lamm, \"I hear mammoth and dodo in the same sentence and, you know, it's science fiction to me.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it is,\" said Lamm, \"until it's not.\"",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\"You're not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you're not bringing back the ancient past,\" said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \"Colossal woolly mouse.\"",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\" said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \"make it a lot more efficient and easier,\" said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \"present already in some living mice,\" said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \"we put them all together in a single mouse.\"",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Independent experts skeptical of \"de-extinction\"",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \"a lot of processes and red tape\" before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",

      "March's full moon, known as the Worm Moon, will pass into Earth's shadow on the night of March 13, or early on March 14, depending on the time zone, according to NASA. This eclipse will be visible from Earth's Western Hemisphere.",
      "The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for ZIP codes across the U.S. Local forecasts also include detailed information on how clear the night sky will be in various locations.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse?",
      "A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the Earth's shadow. During a total lunar eclipse, like the one happening this March, the entire moon will fall within the darkest part of Earth's shadow.",
      "Each lunar eclipse is visible from half of Earth.",
      "There are also partial and penumbral eclipses, which are when the sun, Earth and moon are not perfectly aligned.",
      "Why does the moon look red during the lunar eclipse?",
      "With the moon in the shadow of the Earth, it will appear red-orange, according to NASA. Lunar eclipses are sometimes called blood moons because of the phenomenon.",
      "During a lunar eclipse, the moon gets its red coloration because any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth is filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. The more dust or clouds in Earth's atmosphere during the total lunar eclipse, the redder the moon will appear.",
      "\"It's as if all the world's sunrises and sunsets are projected onto the Moon,\" NASA explains in a blog post.",
      "This is the same phenomenon that makes the sky appear blue during the day.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "The Worm Moon nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the\u00a0Old Farmer's Almanac. Other research suggests the name may date back to writings from the 1760s about worms, or beetle larvae, coming out from bark as trees thaw from the winter.",
      "There are also other names for March's full moon related to the transition from winter to spring. The first day of spring will be on March 20, just days after the Worm Moon.",
      "Other names for March's full moon are the Eagle Moon, Goose Moon, Crow Comes Back Moon, Sugar Moon, Wind Strong Moon and Sore Eyes Moon.",
      "What else can you see during the full Blood Worm Moon?",
      "If there's a bit of rain during the full moon, there may be a rare moonbow, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. It's like a rainbow, but created by moonlight, rather than sunlight. Moonbows only happen when the full Moon is fairly low in the sky, so the phenomenon would be most apparent in the hours after sunset when the sky is dark.",
      "Viewers can also look to the western sky on the night of the total lunar eclipse to catch a glimpse of Jupiter and Mars, according to NASA. Constellations may also be easier to spot than usual as Earth's shadow dims the Moon's glow.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 11:29:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Intuitive Machines says its Athena lunar lander was unable to recharge its batteries while resting on its side, bringing the moon mission to an early end.",
    "story": [
      "A dramatic photograph from Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander shows it touched down Thursday in a crater near the lunar south pole and tipped over on its side. Given a low sun angle and the orientation of the lander's solar cells, the spacecraft's battery quickly drained, bringing the mission to an early end, company officials said Friday",
      "\"Images downlinked from Athena on the lunar surface confirmed that Athena was on her side,\" the company said on its website.",
      "\"After landing, mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones, including NASA's PRIME-1 (drill) suite, before the lander's batteries depleted,\" the statement continued. \"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge. The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.\"",
      "Launched Feb. 26 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",
      "The landing mishap was the second such disappointment for Intuitive Machines. The company's first moon lander, named Odysseus, touched down on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected and a landing leg failed. The vehicle ended up on its side and unable to complete its mission.",
      "Athena's arrival was preceded by the successful touchdown of a commercial lander built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace that also carried NASA-sponsored payloads to the surface. That spacecraft, known as Blue Ghost, landed Sunday in a different region of the moon with much more forgiving terrain.",
      "A third privately-built lander, this one from Tokyo-based ispace, was launched atop the same Falcon 9 that boosted Blue Ghost into space. The Japanese Resilience lander is taking a longer, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to land in June.",

      "SpaceX launched its huge Starship rocket on the program's eighth test flight Thursday, but a malfunction of some sort triggered multiple upper stage engine shutdowns and the vehicle failed to reach its planned sub-orbital altitude, breaking apart in a spectacular shower of debris.",
      "It was the second failure in a row for a Starship upper stage, a vehicle critical to NASA's plans to return astronauts to the moon in the next few years.",
      "\"During Starship's ascent burn, the vehicle experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly and contact was lost. Our team immediately began coordination with safety officials to implement pre-planned contingency responses,\" SpaceX said in a statement.",
      "\"We will review the data from today's flight test to better understand root cause. As always, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will offer additional lessons to improve Starship's reliability.\"",
      "\"Obviously, a lot to go through, a lot to dig through. We're going to go right at it,\" said SpaceX launch commentator Dan Huot. \"The primary reason we do these flight tests is to learn. We have some more to learn about this vehicle, but we're going to be right back here in the not-too-distant future, and we're going to get a ship to space.\"",

      "The chopsticks closed around the slowly descending booster, locking onto structural capture fixtures on both sides of the rocket. The dramatic launch pad capture, SpaceX's third, is a key element in the company's plan to enable rapid refurbishment and reuse.",
      "The 160-foot-tall Starship upper stage, meanwhile, climbed toward space as planned on the power of six Raptor engines, appearing to work flawlessly as it soared skyward toward the planned sub-orbital trajectory.",
      "Trouble 8 minutes after liftoff",
      "But a little more than eight minutes after liftoff, telemetry shown on SpaceX's live webcast indicated four of the six engines had prematurely shut down. A camera on the Starship showed the spacecraft starting to spin about and several seconds later contact was lost.",
      "Multiple videos posted on social media showed a dramatic shower of debris arcing back toward Earth after the vehicle broke up. It wasn't immediately clear if the breakup was triggered by the Starship's self-destruct system or by extreme structural loads as it fell back into the lower atmosphere.",
      "While SpaceX will no doubt attempt its usual rapid recovery, the Federal Aviation Administration will almost certainly order another failure investigation. Given two destructive breakups in a row, it could take longer to return to flight status this time around.",

      "At the conclusion of the sub-orbital flight, the Starship was expected fall back into the atmosphere belly first.

      "Telemetry indicated the fire broke out after propellant lines leading to one of the Raptors ruptured due to unexpected harmonic vibrations. SpaceX carried out a 60-second engine test firing of the Starship launched Monday, studying responses to various thrust levels.",
      "Based on the test results, propellant feed lines were modified, fuel temperatures were changed and thrust levels were adjusted to avoid any such harmonic responses. Additional vents were installed in the area where the fire broke out and a nitrogen purge system was added to minimize the chance of fire.",

The crew will transfer to the waiting Starship for the descent to the lunar surface. NASA hopes to send the first woman and the next man to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe, after an unpiloted Starship moon landing.",
      "Rapid reusability is a key element of the program given the number of Super Heavy-Starships that will be required for a single moon landing. Multiple successful test flights will be needed to perfect the system and demonstrate the reliability required to carry astronauts.",
      "The latest mishap comes amid ambitious SpaceX plans for major upgrades to the company's facilities at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, building a 380-foot-tall building where Super Heavy boosters and Starships can be refurbished and processed for launch from one and possibly two Florida launch pads.",

    "story": [
      "A second commercially-built moon lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, landed near the moon's south pole Thursday, but telemetry indicated it ended up on its side.",
      "The lander is \"alive,\" Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
      "\"We don't believe we're in the correct attitude (orientation) on the surface of the moon yet again,\" Altemus disclosed. \"I don't have all the data yet to say exactly what the attitude of the vehicle is. We're collecting photos now and downlinking those, and we're going to get a picture from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera from above, from orbit, and we'll confirm that over the coming days as we get that data down.\"",
      "The touchdown came one year after Intuitive's first moon lander, named Odysseus, landed on the moon while still moving sideways. A landing leg broke and the spacecraft tipped over on its side, limiting the mission's scientific return. Intuitive's stock fell 20% in the wake of the latest landing problem.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft from Intuitive Machines\u00a0was launched eight days ago by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sharing the ride to space were three other spacecraft: a moon-bound NASA orbiter known as the Lunar Trailblazer, a commercial deep space asteroid prospecting probe named Odin, and a privately-built space tug designed to work in Earth orbit.",
      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",
      "The innovative \"Grace\" hopper was designed to jump into one of those dark craters about a quarter of a mile from Athena for in situ measurements, radioing its observations back to the lander using 4G/LTE cellular network equipment provided by Nokia.",
      "Other instruments on the lander were expected to look for the chemical traces of water and other compounds, along with taking measurements of soil temperature and composition. Two small rovers were on board to explore the landing site and to test innovative mobility systems.",
      "Altemus said it may still be possible to deploy the hopper and the rovers, but that will depend on the lander's orientation.",
      "Second lunar lander to reach moon this year",
      "Athena's arrival is the second of three to reach the moon this year.",
      "A lander built by Austin-based\u00a0Firefly Aerospace successfully touched down on the moon early Sunday, March 2. The commercially-developed Blue Ghost lander is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments designed to collect data needed for the Artemis program.",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million for delivery of the agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations to the moon's surface. The instruments cost NASA another $44 million.",
      "Athena's instruments and technology demonstrations also were funded by NASA. The agency paid the company $62.5 million to deliver a powerful drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon's surface.",
      "NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million went to Intuitive Machines to help finance the \"Grace\" hopper.",
      "Another $89 million paid for a lunar satellite built by Lockheed Martin that was launched on the same Falcon 9 rocket as Athena. But the Lunar Trailblazer satellite dropped out of contact with Earth shortly after launch and has not been heard from since.",
      "Blue Ghost and Athena were both funded in large part by NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. The CLPS initiative is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface later this decade.",
      "In the meantime, a Japanese lander known as Resilience was launched in January atop the same Falcon 9 rocket that boosted the Blue Ghost into space. Built by Tokyo-based ispace, Resilience took a longer, low-energy route to the moon and will not arrive until early June.",

      "Appearing on \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday, Nguyen said she is not afraid about her upcoming Blue Origin flight.",
      "\"I really think back to my family and how they were refugees in Vietnam. If they could go through that journey, I can go through this, too,\" she said.",
      "Nguyen will join a historic all-female crew that includes \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King, pop star Katy Perry, philanthropist Lauren Sanchez, aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe and producer Kerrianne Flynn. During the mission, Nguyen plans to conduct two science experiments \u2014 one in partnership with the Vietnamese National Space Center and another focused on women's health.",
      "\"Women were barred from becoming astronauts at NASA early on because of menstruation. They didn't have the data to back that up,\" Nguyen explained.",

      "\"I picked 5-year-old and 80-year-old because really I think the purpose in our lives is to live out our full potential and to make ourselves proud,\" Nguyen said. \"Truly what I want people to know is that their dreams matter and can still come true.\"",
      "Nguyen discussed how she put her dreams on hold after experiencing sexual assault, choosing to pursue justice rather than her career. She subsequently drafted the Sexual Assault Survivor Bill of Rights, which was passed unanimously by chambers of Congress.",
      "The legislation she championed extended the preservation period for rape kits, which were previously destroyed after just six months in Massachusetts and 30 days in New York.",
      "\"After ten years of fighting for my rights, I finally get to honor the person that I was before I was hurt,\" Nguyen said.",

    "summary": "Faced with the need to cut carbon emissions, and an increasing energy demand to power AI, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are investing in nuclear, from restarting Three Mile Island, to creating \"small modular reactors.\"",
    "story": [
      "It might have seemed like one of the weirder headlines of 2024: Microsoft is paying $1.6 billion to restart Three Mile Island. That's the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania whose reactor #2 had a partial meltdown in 1979. There were no injuries, and nobody died, but it set the nuclear industry back years. Only two new plants have been started since that accident.",
      "\"This is hallowed ground in the nuclear industry,\" said Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, which owns about half of America's 54 nuclear plants (including Three Mile Island). \"This is a place where we learned and got better.\"",
      "He says that, as a result of the 1979 accident, there have been thousands of changes in protocols and procedures regarding nuclear power. \"The thing that people forget is that there was another reactor at the site,\" he said. \"That site, that reactor, continued to operate until 2019, when it was closed for economic reasons. Cheap natural gas, low demand, subsidization of different technologies in the business, [and] no policy supporting nuclear caused plants to start retiring.\"",
      "So, what is Microsoft's interest?",
      "All  of the Big Tech companies have ambitious goals to fight the climate  crisis. That includes Google and Microsoft, which have each  pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions. They were making progress, too; each has invested billions in wind and solar energy.",
      "And then, then artificial intelligence came along. AI data centers require huge amounts of electricity. \u00a0Big Tech realized that they wouldn't make their emissions goals without taking power into their own hands.",
      "Dominguez said, \"Microsoft is going to enjoy the benefit of the reliable, clean energy for 20 years.\"",
      "He says reopening the existing Three Mile Island facility would be quicker and less expensive than constructing a brand-new nuclear plant. \"At least 10 times cheaper than building a new plant,\" he said. \"And we think we could get it going in about three years, versus the last plant that was built, [which] took almost 10 years.\"",
      "But if you're a tech company, what do you do if you don't have a recently-retired nuclear plant handy? You develop new ones. Only weeks after Microsoft's announcement, both Amazon and Google announced major investments in nuclear power.",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google is supplementing its already enormous green energy investments with a new kind of nuclear, called small modular reactors. \"These are not the nuclear power plants of yesterday, with the very large cooling towers,\" said Michael Terrell, who heads Google's decarbonization efforts. \"These are much smaller facilities. But because they're modular, you can stack them together to make bigger power plants.",
      "He anticipates the first advanced nuclear reactor will be online by 2030. \"And we're not going to do just one reactor, but we hope to buy from what will be a series of reactors that follow that,\" Terrell said.",
      "Nuclear power still isn't perfect; it still produces waste that has to be safely stored. But unlike solar and wind, nuclear power is always on, which is essential to those AI data centers.",
      "So, Google is funding a company called Kairos Power to design and build this new generation of reactors. Kairos is building three small demonstration plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the very spot where uranium was processed for the first atomic bomb.",
      "CEO Mike Laufer says that his reactors don't use fuel rods; they use fuel pebbles, about the size of golf balls \u2013 mostly graphite, with tiny kernels of uranium. And each pebble has as much power capacity as four tons of coal.",
      "And how much carbon dioxide emissions, compared to coal? \"Zero,\" Laufer said.",
      "The Kairos reactors also run at lower power and lower pressure than traditional reactors, which means lower risk.",
      "Well, this all sounds great! But what's the catch?",
      "\"There's only one problem with small modular reactors: They don't really exist,\" said George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni, who spent 15 years researching nuclear safety for the government. She thinks Big Tech companies might be in over their heads. \"I think they're going to find out pretty quickly that it takes way too long and it's way too expensive,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see just how strong their commitments are to clean energy futures.\"",
      "\"So, you're saying they may have to turn to burning stuff [for power]?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure they will,\" Squassoni replied.",
      "\"Do you think there's a little bit of tech-bro overconfidence therein?\"",
      "\"Oh, completely, completely!\" she laughed.",
      "Kairos' Mike Laufer admitted, \"Yes, it's really hard. I will totally agree with anyone. But we're doing it at smaller scale to start, and then building on that in the future.\"",
      "Joe Dominguez's team is getting Three Mile Island ready for Microsoft, including renaming the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. And if AI is igniting a renaissance in American nuclear, he says: full steam ahead.",
      "I asked, \"Why do all new plants take so much longer and cost so much more than projected?\"",
      "\"Honest answer? We don't build enough of them,\" Dominguez said. \"You don't want to build a unique design; you want to do kind of a cookie-cutter, one-after-another design.\"",
      "\"Is it well understood in government and the industry that if you start doing the same design over and over, we can get there faster and cheaper?\"",
      "\"It's probably the best understood idea,\" Dominguez said. \"It's understood by both Republicans and Democrats, which is a hard thing to say about anything! Everybody understands that if you build a common design, you build a bunch of them.\"",
      "\"So, you think we'll get there?\"",
      "\"I do.\"",
      "Google's Michael Terrell agrees, and believes his company will make its zero-carbon goal by 2030. \"It is an incredibly ambitious goal: 24/7 carbon-free energy everywhere we operate every way around the world,\" he said. \"But it's something we're working very hard to achieve, and we hope to get there.\"",

      "Vanderwall said Cassell told him she had been dipping a green cardigan sweater into the ditch to get water.",

      "The collision between a military helicopter and an American Airlines plane left 67 people dead. It was the first major commercial airline crash in the United States since 2009. The American Airlines flight, which was coming from Wichita, Kansas, was preparing to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport\u00a0when it was struck by an Army Black Hawk helicopter on a training mission. Both fell into the Potomac River after the collision.",
      "NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy began a news conference Tuesday with an urgent recommendation to ban helicopter operations on a specific route near the airport when runways 15 and 33 are in use. When helicopters are flying that route at the maximum authorized altitude of 200 feet, they may have just 75 feet of vertical separation from an airplane on landing approach to runway 33.",
      "Homendy said she and other NTSB members determined that posed an \"intolerable risk to aviation safety.\" The vertical separation could be even less, depending on the helicopter's lateral distance from the Potomac River shoreline or if an approaching airplane was below its designated visual glidepath, Homendy said.",
      "At a press conference later in the day, Duffy confirmed, \"We are going to continue with our restrictions.\"",
      "Duffy had temporarily banned the route after the disaster, but that ban had been set to expire at the end of the month.",
      "\"As that deadline nears we remain concerned about the significant potential for future midair collision at DCA, which is why we are recommending a permanent solution today,\" Homendy said.",
      "Duffy noted there would be exceptions for travel for the president and vice president and for life-saving or law enforcement missions.",
      "Homendy said that the NTSB is also recommending that the Federal Aviation Administration designate an alternative helicopter route that can be used when those runways are in use. She said the NTSB will not prescribe a particular route.",
      "Homendy said the NTSB developed the recommendations after looking at nearly 15 years' worth of incidents at DCA. Between 2011 and 2024, at least one traffic alert and collision avoidance system was triggered per month due to the proximity of a helicopter to a plane, Homendy said. In over half of the reviewed encounters, the helicopters may have been above the route altitude restriction of 200 feet, Homendy said. The Black Hawk helicopter in the January crash was above the altitude restriction. About two-thirds of the events occurred at night.",
      "Between October 2021 and December 2024, there were 15,214 close proximity events between commercial airplanes and helicopters, where there was lateral separation of less than 1 nautical mile, or around 6,000 feet, and vertical separation of less than 400 feet. There were 85 events that involved a lateral separation of less than 1,500 feet and vertical separation of less than 200 feet, Homendy said.",
      "\"The NTSB report provides ample data that this helicopter route and the commercial aviation landing route never should have been allowed to co-exist,\" Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate commerce committee, which oversees civil aviation, said in a statement. \"A permanent restriction of this helicopter route needs to be urgently implemented by the FAA today. The data also raises serious questions as to how such a route was allowed to continue when alarm bells were literally going off.\"",
      "American Airlines said Tuesday in a statement it was \"grateful for the National Transportation Safety Board's urgent safety recommendations to restrict helicopter traffic near DCA and for its thorough investigation.\"",
      "Duffy said the Transportation Department has \"deployed AI tools\" to help find other hotspots with similar military and commercial cross-traffic at airports across the country. He said that effort began several weeks ago and has been used at 12 airports.",
      "Duffy also said the entire country's air traffic control system should be updated.",
      "\"I want to be clear, our system is safe. It's old. But it's safe,\" he said.",
      "Duffy said he believed a full system overhaul could be completed within three-and-a-half to four years, but noted it would cost \"tens of billions of dollars,\" and said he wants to present his plan to Congress soon. He said part of the plan is to move from copper wire to a combination of \"fiber, wireless and satellite.\" Duffy said the system would also use brand new radar and new terminals for air traffic controllers. He also said the Transportation Department would \"deploy resources for runway safety\" so air traffic controllers would have more accurate data on where various planes are as they land, take off and taxi.",
      "Verizon had already been contracted to lay the fiber cables, and Duffy said that contract was \"still in play. How we move forward is a question we're gonna grapple with,\" saying the effort would require multiple companies.",
      "Homendy said the NTSB's preliminary report will include information about the crew of both aircraft and the history of the flights, much of which has already been made public. Full NTSB investigations typically take at least a year.",
      "\"I often say that the easiest and quickest part of the investigation is determining what happened,\" Homendy said. \"The part that takes longer is the how and why.\"",
      "Federal investigators have been working to\u00a0piece together the events\u00a0that led to the crash. Investigator in charge Brice Banning\u00a0previously described\u00a0it as \"a complex investigation\" with \"a lot of pieces\" that NTSB members were working to gather.",
      "Wreckage from the plane and helicopter has been recovered. Investigators also recovered black boxes from both aircraft. Black boxes record flight data, including altitude and speed, as well as audio from the flight.",
      "Investigators said in mid-February that it's possible the helicopter crew did not hear instructions from an air traffic controller to pass behind the plane. Seventeen seconds before the collision, a radio transmission from the air traffic control tower directed the helicopter to pass behind the airliner, but because the helicopter's microphone key was pressed down during part of the transmission, they may have not heard the words \"pass behind the,\" NTSB chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said.",
      "The NTSB has determined that the collision likely occurred at an altitude of about 325 feet, which would have put the Black Hawk above its 200-foot limit for the area. Cockpit conversations from a few minutes before the crash indicate conflicting altitude data. The type of Black Hawk helicopter involved in the crash typically has two systems for measuring altitude, which may explain the discrepancy.",
      "Investigators believe that the helicopter crew, who the Army has described as highly experienced, were wearing night-vision goggles at the time of the incident.",

      "Last month, Hoffman filed a lawsuit against the state and sought to block his March 18 execution date. During a hearing last week, attorneys for Hoffman argued that the execution method of nitrogen hypoxia is cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. Constitution and infringes on Hoffman's freedom to practice his religion, specifically Buddhist breathing and meditation exercises.",

      "Cecelia Kappel, Hoffman's attorney, applauded Dick's ruling and said that she looks forward to presenting the evidence that that nitrogen hypoxia would inflict \"torture on Jessie at the time of his death.\"",

      "The execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith, the first person put to death by nitrogen hypoxia, was described as prolonged, horrific and torturous by some witnesses, including journalists, who said he writhed and thrashed for several minutes on the gurney once the nitrogen system switched on.",
      "At a media briefing once he was pronounced dead, Alabama Corrections Commissioner John Hamm called the execution\u00a0\"textbook,\"\u00a0even though it had never been done.",
      "Hoffman, who did not challenge his conviction or sentence during the hearing, asked that he be put to death using a \"humane\" method. He asked to be executed by a firing squad or consuming a drug cocktail typically used for physician-assisted death, but neither of those methods is approved by Louisiana law.",

      "Murrill told The Associated Press last month that she expects at least four people will be executed this year. There are 56 people on Louisiana's death row.",
      "Louisiana is following in the footsteps of Alabama, which has executed four people using nitrogen gas. In January 2024, Smith, a former death row inmate, was the first inmate to die by\u00a0nitrogen hypoxia, a controversial and at the time untested method that prompted\u00a0legal pushback\u00a0and public scrutiny from critics within the United States and abroad.",
      "During last week's hearing, state officials described Louisiana's execution protocol using nitrogen gas to be nearly identical to Alabama's.",
      "Under the protocol, the subject is strapped to a gurney, forced to breathe pure nitrogen gas through a mask placed on their face, depriving them of oxygen. The procedure is a relatively new alternative to more common forms of capital punishment, such as lethal injection and electrocution, which are the two methods used most prevalently across the U.S.,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Death Penalty Information Center.",

      "Mr. Trump in a recent interview with Fox News declined to rule out that his policies, including increasing tariffs, could cause a recession.",
      "\"I hate to predict things like that,\" Mr. Trump told Fox News. \"There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing, and there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's tariff announcements on Canada, Mexico and China have rocked the stock markets and fueled concerns of an economic downturn. Canada received some welcome news Tuesday, after Lutnick told CBS News that the U.S. no longer plans to double tariffs against its northern neighbor on aluminum and steel.",
      "Asked whether the president plans to proceed with the 50% tariffs, Lutnick replied, \"No, that's off, too. So, we're at 25% for steel and aluminum because that's where we were.\"",
      "The one- or two-day tariffs that are ultimately withdrawn have their purpose, Lutnick argued.",
      "\"When you're negotiating with someone and they're not paying attention and they're disagreeing, the president, who's the best dealmaker ever to sit in that chair, he's going to say, 'here's my response,'\" Lutnick said. \"And then all of a sudden, shockingly, they respond.\"",

      "He denied that there's any chaos in the way the president has been using tariffs to pressure U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"It is not chaotic, and the only one who thinks it's chaotic is someone who's being silly,\" Lutnick said, pointing out that Mr. Trump had warned he'd impose reciprocal tariffs.",
      "As for the sudden announcement of the 50% tariffs on Canada Tuesday morning, Lutnick said, \"He needed to break some guy in Ontario who said he was going to tax American energy 25%. The president of the United States, in the White House says, 'Oh no, you won't,' and breaks him. Breaks him \u2026 by a tweet and a truth (social post). And you think that's chaotic?\"",
      "\"Let the dealmaker make his deals,\" Lutnick said, adding that \"within a short period of time,\" any country negotiating with the U.S. will come to \"realize it doesn't need to do it this way.\"",
      "\"Let's just do it the grown-up way,\" he continued, \"where the biggest economy in the world says, 'I don't like the way you're treating us. How about a little respect? How about a little dignity?'\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:38:30 -0400",
    "summary": "If deciding what to do with an old 401(k) plan has been on your to-do list, here are the key steps you should take to get it done.",
    "story": [
      "Aging 401(k)s are a little like the old clothes in the back of your closet. You know you should do something about them, but there they sit, mostly out of sight and mind.",
      "And so it is with your old 401(k). If deciding what to do with an old 401(k) plan has been on your to-do list for a while, here are the key steps you should take to get it done.",
      "Step 1: See how much you have saved",
      "If your balance in your former employer's 401(k) plan is over $7,000, you can leave the money behind in the old plan or roll the assets into an IRA or your new employer's 401(k).",
      "But if your balance falls below that $7,000 threshold, some of the decision-making may be out of your hands.",
      "Step 2: Decide whether to roll the money or leave it alone",
      "Assuming your balance is over $7,000, your next task is to decide whether to roll the money into an IRA or keep it inside a 401(k).",
      "I often recommend rolling over the assets from a former 401(k) into a no-fee IRA with a topnotch mutual fund company or discount broker. But some people value the extra creditor protections that can accompany 401(k) assets versus IRA assets, while others may prize 401(k)-specific investment options.",
      "If you think you will be better off leaving your money inside a 401(k) rather than rolling it over to an IRA, the next job is to conduct some research on your own 401(k) options.",
      "Even if you do decide to stay with a 401(k), you may need to decide whether you're better off staying put in your former employer's plan or that of your new employer.",
      "Step 3: If rolling over into an IRA, find the right options",
      "If a rollover to an IRA is the way to go, the next step is to identify the right brokerage firm or mutual fund company. Look for a firm that offers a breadth of high-quality investment options with no additional layers of fees for IRA investors. Target-date funds are an elegant, low-maintenance, and underutilized option.",
      "If you decide to roll Roth 401(k) contributions to an IRA or your current employer's 401(k), your new account will be Roth, too, meaning that you won't owe tax on qualified withdrawals.",
      "If you have traditional 401(k) assets, a rollover is also a good time to consider whether to convert those assets to a Roth account at the same time.",
      "Step 4: Fill out the necessary paperwork",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets to an IRA, fill out the paperwork or online form to open the IRA. You'll then request a direct rollover from your 401(k) plan to the new IRA provider.",
      "The process may be a bit more cumbersome if you're rolling over to your current employer's 401(k).",
      "In both cases, make sure your 401(k) provider makes the check payable to the provider and sends it directly to them, rather than to you. If the check is made out to you, 20% of the balance will be withheld for income tax. You'll then have 60 days to get that money deposited into an IRA or another 401(k); if that deadline comes and goes, the distribution will count as a withdrawal and you'll owe ordinary income tax and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're not 55 or older.",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets from an old 401(k) to another 401(k) or IRA, you'll also have to determine how you'll allocate those assets.",
      "If all of your retirement assets were in your old 401(k), a sturdy target-date fund is a one-stop, low-maintenance choice that you can hold into retirement. If your old 401(k) is just one of several accounts geared toward retirement, a rollover can be an ideal time to check up on how all the pieces fit together\u2014and where you have holes.",

      "Prices across the U.S. likely rose 2.9% last month from a year ago, which would remain well above the Federal Reserve's target of a 2% annual rate, according to the average estimate from economists polled by FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers that tracks the change in those prices over time, has cooled considerably from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but continues to eclipse the index's pre-pandemic levels.",
      "February's data reflects the first full month of the Trump administration, although some of Mr. Trump's economic policies have yet to take effect, such as his 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, now set to kick in on April 2 after a one-month reprieve. Economists now predict that inflation could tick upwards in 2025 due to Mr. Trump's tariff regime, which means the latest inflation data could prove to be the calm before the storm.",

      "Egg prices were one of the main inflation drivers in January, with the cost jumping 53% from a year earlier. Overall grocery prices rose 1.9% over the same period, with declines in some foods, such as bread and tomatoes, offsetting the surge in egg prices.",
      "Since then, egg prices have receded, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.

Households are now predicting that food costs could accelerate to an annual rate of 5.1%, the highest level since May 2024, it found.",
      "Consumers bracing for a reignition of inflation could be feeding into a sharp downturn of consumer confidence, which plummeted in February to its lowest level in four years. More Americans say they're gloomy about their financial prospects for the year ahead, the New York Fed found in its survey.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A pair of federal judges warned Tuesday of continued threats against members of the judiciary amid criticism leveled by Elon Musk and threats of impeachment by Republicans in Congress. They warned such attacks strike at judicial independence.",
      "Judges Jeffrey Sutton and Richard Sullivan, who sit on the federal appeals courts, raised concerns about the increase in threats against judges in a call with reporters hosted by the Judicial Conference, the policymaking body for the federal judiciary.",
      "Sullivan, who chairs the committee on judicial security, said the protection of judges and federal courthouses around the country is a top priority for the judiciary and recent cuts to the U.S. Marshals Service's budget is a concern. The agency provides security for federal courts and judges.",
      "\"Our system of government is premised on three independent branches and a judiciary that can function independently,\" he said. \"That's what makes it work, and so it's crucial that people understand that.\"",
      "Sutton, meanwhile, said that while the types of threats against judges have evolved over time, they arise directly from the fact that they're doing their jobs.",
      "\"We're supposed to say what the law means, and there's 1,000 federal judges out there, we each take that responsibility seriously,\" he said, adding that judges take an oath to interpret the law neutrally and dispassionately. \"It's a shame to see people attacking judges simply for doing their level best to do their job.\"",
      "Sutton and Sullivan both noted that the justice system allows the losing party to appeal an adverse decision from the trial court to an appeals court and then the Supreme Court.",
      "\"We allocate disappointment to half the people that come before us,\" Sutton said. \"Criticism is no surprise. It's part of the job. But I do think when it gets to the level of a threat, it really is about attacking judicial independence, and that's just not good for the system or the country.\"",
      "Sutton is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, and Sullivan sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. Sutton was appointed by President George W. Bush, and Sullivan was named to the appeals court by President Trump during his first term.",
      "The concerns from the two GOP-appointed judges come as Musk and allies of Mr. Trump have attacked judges who have issued preliminary rulings against the administration. Musk, who the president said is leading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, has called some members of the judiciary \"evil\" and said they should be \"fired.\"",
      "In a post last month to X, the social media company he owns, Musk claimed the country is witnessing \"an attempted coup of American democracy by radical left activists posing as judges\" and said in another post that there \"need to be some repercussions above zero for judges who make truly terrible decisions.\"",
      "Republicans in the House have also introduced impeachment resolutions against U.S. District Judges Paul Engelmayer, Amir Ali and John Bates because of decisions they dislike, which were issued in the early stages of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "The impeachment efforts are unlikely to succeed. Just 15 federal judges have been impeached by the House and eight were convicted by the Senate and removed from office, according to the Federal Judicial Center.",
      "\"Threats to judges are threats to judicial independence. They've been around for a long time. There's lots of different mechanisms. Threats of impeachment \u2014 this is not the first time this has happened,\" Sutton said. \"One thing worth keeping in mind is if we dilute the standards for impeachment, that's not just a problem for judges, that's a problem for all three branches of government.\"",
      "Sullivan said that amid the evolving threat landscape, and as there are more threats to judges, public officials must be responsible in their comments about the system of justice.",
      "\"The reality is that there are a lot of folks who will respond and react perhaps inappropriately based on something they heard or read, and so, I just think it's important for everyone to be responsible in what they say about our process,\" he said.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts separately spoke of the importance of preserving judicial independence in his year-end report closing out 2024. He highlighted four areas that he said threatened the independence of judges: violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments.",
      "When it comes to protecting judges from threats, the federal judiciary's Vulnerability Management Program provided services to more than 1,700 judges, 114 retired judges and 235 family members last year, according to the Judicial Conference's annual report, released Tuesday.",
      "The program was established after Congress passed legislation responding to the 2020 killing of the son of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas at her home in New Jersey. The gunman found the judge's address, pictures of her house and vehicle information online.",

McCray is accused of punching Wilson in the chest multiple times as part of a hazing ritual for the Omega Psi Phi fraternity, according to investigators.

      "Democrats noted that the executive order grounds its directive in the Article II authority of the president, but they argue that under controlling precedent, \"Congress may create expert commissions like the FEC that are insulated from direct Presidential control, and therefore confirms the constitutionality of the relevant provisions of FECA.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 15:11:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A hurricane modeling specialist fired from the National Weather Service said progress on forecast accuracy may \"go backwards\" if job cuts continue.",
    "story": [
      "Andy Hazelton learned he'd been fired the same way everyone else did. Like hundreds of his colleagues at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, he received a mass email from the head of the agency at around 3:45 p.m. on Feb. 27 confirming his termination, effective immediately.",
      "\"They gave us 'til 5,\" said Hazelton, a scientist who specialized in hurricane research and modeling at the National Weather Service, the meteorological branch of NOAA responsible for weather forecasts. \"That was our cutoff. And then our email access was lost later that night, too.\"",
      "More than 800 employees were dismissed in February's initial sweep across NOAA, a congressional source told CBS News after the firings. And more job cuts could be coming \u2014 all as part of a federal cost-cutting initiative by the Trump administration and the Elon Musk-led\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "As the nation's primary hub for weather and climate information and a leading source of\u00a0environmental data overseas, NOAA is considered the authority on forecasting, storm tracking and climate monitoring. Many are warning that slashing its workforce could compromise the quality and accuracy of extreme weather forecasts that guide government responses to hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes and floods, often providing life-saving predictions and warnings that don't exist anywhere else.",
      "The job cuts at NOAA \"jeopardize our ability to forecast and respond to extreme weather events like hurricanes, wildfires, and floods\u2014putting communities in harm's way,\" said Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state who chairs the Senate subcommittee that oversees NOAA, in a statement responding to the agency's job cuts.",
      "The American Meteorological Society, an organization that partners with NOAA, warned in a separate statement that \"the consequences to the American people will be large and wide-ranging, including increased vulnerability to hazardous weather.\"",
      "Peak tornado season is now in full swing in the United States, where wildfire and hurricane seasons typically pick up in May and June but have started sooner and stretched on longer in recent years. Natural disasters are occurring with increasing frequency and strength\u00a0because of climate change.",
      "Hazelton's termination came about four months into his tenure as a full-time federal employee at the weather service's National Hurricane Center in Miami. On his first day, back in October, Hurricane Milton slammed into Florida's west coast, and during his time at the agency he worked on a storm prediction program that provided data to inform track forecasts, hazard warnings and evacuation orders for storms like it.",
      "\"It's hard to say for sure, but with fewer people working on upgrades to the models, and fewer people working on collecting the data that goes into these models, I think it's quite possible that the model accuracy will not have continued the improvement that we've seen over the last five, 10, 15 years for hurricanes,\" Hazelton said. \"We may start to lose those improvements or even potentially reverse some of the skill and go backwards if we're not careful. You know, especially if these cuts continue.\"",
      "A Trump administration official told CBS News the first round of job cuts at NOAA shrunk its staff by 5% and largely spared employees with critical roles, such as weather service meteorologists. But a source at the National Weather Service disputed that, saying some meteorologists including radar specialists were impacted, as were staff of the Hurricane Hunters crew, which fly airplanes into storms during hurricanes to help forecasters make accurate predications.",
      "At least a significant portion of the cuts impacted workers in the \"probation\" period of their employment, which usually lasts 1 to 3 years after starting a full-time role, according to a NOAA source. Probationary employees aren't necessarily novices, though. A weather service source said staff with 15 years of experience at NOAA, or more, could technically be categorized that way if they were recently promoted to a higher position.",
      "NOAA is now preparing to lose more than 1,000 additional workers in a second round of firings, sources told CBS News this week. The agency could ultimately lose about 20% of its staff along with some of the programs they work on, although it's not known which will be impacted.",
      "DOGE has also announced it might terminate the leases of 19 NOAA offices nationwide, including key buildings that generate vital weather forecasts and maintain radar operations. Individual offices have already paused some operations because of a lack of workers. The weather service office in Kotzebue, Alaska, said shortly after the first wave of layoffs that it would stop launching weather balloons, which collect weather observations from the atmosphere, indefinitely, while NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory shut down its communications services due to staff reductions there.",
      "Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, called the firings \"shortsighted.\" Without a means to replace lost employees or their work, Swain told CBS News he believes the situation could quickly devolve into a public safety threat.",
      "\"These literally are the people who are responsible for issuing a tornado warning during a tornado outbreak, or a flash flood warning during a flash flood, and we've seen plenty of deadly iterations of those kinds of things in recent years,\" he said of NOAA staffers. \"Same thing, by the way, when it comes to extreme wildfire conditions. The weather service office in L.A. was very active in the days leading up to and following the catastrophic fires just a couple of months ago.\"",
      "Swain said the reduction in NOAA's workforce will make nearly every aspect of his job as a weather and climate scientist more challenging, and the firings stand to influence a broader network of industries, too.",
      "\"It will affect every single colleague that I have, working in any type of weather or climate institution, whether it's public, private or academic,\" he said. \"It will really affect every single American, and, frankly, many people around the world, because NOAA is the backbone for providing virtually all of the basic weather information that is needed to produce global weather forecasts to observe and understand climate change, essentially, to predict the future, to lessen the impacts of disasters, you name it.\"",
      "Swain and almost 150 other scientists signed an open letter to Congress and the Trump administration before NOAA's layoffs last month, calling for a stop to what they deemed an \"increasing assault\" on science conducted at U.S. agencies and institutions as earlier federal cuts hit the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy.",
      "\"Without a strong NOAA, a cornerstone of the U.S. scientific research enterprise, the world will be flying blind into the growing perils of global climate change,\" read the letter, which urged Congress and the Trump administration to keep NOAA fully staffed.",
      "Later, in a video shared to his YouTube channel the day of the NOAA firings, Swain said, \"There will be people who die in extreme weather events and related disasters who would not have otherwise.\"",
      "NOAA declined to comment on the layoffs. In a statement emailed to CBS News, a spokesperson for the agency said \"we are not discussing internal personnel and management matters.\"",
      "\"NOAA remains dedicated to its mission, providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public and ensure our nation's environmental and economic resilience. We continue to provide weather information, forecasts and warnings pursuant to our public safety mission,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Rick Spinrad, who was NOAA's administrator during the Biden administration, is worried about the impact on the National Weather Service, saying job cuts will \"most assuredly\" affect the availability, frequency and accuracy of weather warnings.",
      "\"I think at some point people are going to recognize we need these capabilities for the public good, which, after all, is the role of government,\" he said. \"The question is: how much damage will we sustain before we're able to turn around the damage that's already been done?\"",
      "Rob Marciano, \n                                                  \n                                  Jordan Freiman and \n                                                  \n                                  Tracy J. Wholf\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "The USDA said it is promoting wiser government spending, but schools say it will make it tougher to serve healthy meals.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture is cutting two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers, part of what the agency said was a decision to \"return to long-term, fiscally responsible initiatives.\"",
      "The move cancels about $660 million in funding this year for the Local Food for Schools program, which is active in 40 U.S. states, as well as about $420 million for a second program called the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, which helps food banks and other local groups provide food to their communities.",
      "The decision comes as the Trump administration and Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, say they are slashing federal spending to reduce government waste. The USDA programs were funded through the agency's Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era fund created to buy products directly from farmers.",
      "\"Unlike the Biden Administration, which funneled billions in [Commodity Credit Corporation] funds into short-term programs with no plan for longevity, USDA is prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact,\" a USDA spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In recent days, schools were alerted that they were set to lose $660 million in federal funding for the current year, according to Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations for the School Nutrition Association, which represents thousands of school meal employees. The withdrawal of funding will affect schools across the U.S. at a time when they're already grappling with high food costs, she said.",
      "\"It's a pretty big hit\"",
      "One of those school districts said the USDA's decision will wipe out $100,000 in funding that it had planned to spend on local beef and produce for students' school meals.",
      "\"It's a pretty big hit, and that's mostly fresh fruits and vegetables,\" said Patti Bilbrey, director of nutrition services at the Scottsdale Unified School District in Arizona. \"It wasn't just about keeping food costs low \u2014 it meant supporting your community and your local farmers in your state.\"",
      "While the $100,000 represents about 2% of the school district's roughly $6 million in annual spending on food, Bilbrey noted that it allowed the district to buy food ffrom small farmers and introduce produce like microgreens to their students. She added that the funding loss comes as her district, like many others, are struggling to keep school meals affordable amid rising food and labor costs.",
      "The Local Food for Schools program \"was a godsend to us,\" Bilbrey said. \"It keeps our meal costs down, and we're helping our community, which improves the perception of school meals.\"",

    "story": [
      "A columnist who has worked at The Washington Post for four decades resigned on Monday after she said the newspaper's management decided not to run her commentary critical of owner Jeff Bezos' new editorial policy.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,\" Ruth Marcus, who has\u00a0worked\u00a0at the newspaper since 1984, wrote in a resignation letter.",
      "Her exit is the latest fallout from the billionaire owner's directive that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.",
      "The storied newspaper has been in a free fall, financially and editorially, over the past year. Marcus, who worked in the news and opinion departments during her career, is \"the bedrock of The Washington Post, embodying the history of the place as well as the talent and accomplishments of its journalists,\" said Paul Farhi, a former media reporter there.",
      "Marcus, who was a finalist for the\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for Commentary\u00a0in 2007, said that the Post's publisher, Will Lewis, declined to run her column, which she described as \"respectfully dissenting\" from Bezos' edict. It was the first time in nearly 20 years of writing columns that she's had one killed, she said.",
      "The decision \"underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,\" she wrote. Her resignation letter was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A Post spokesperson said Monday that \"we're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years. We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"",
      "While Bezos and Lewis have the right to make such decisions \u2014 they're the bosses \u2014 \"that has not been the tradition,\" Farhi said. He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.",
      "The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.",
      "Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.",
      "In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.",
      "Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"",
      "The Post's opinion section on Monday included an editorial opposing Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Columnists Max Boot wrote about Trump and Russia, Perry Bacon Jr. about Democratic resistance to Trump centering in the states, Phillip Bump on whether Trump would pay a political price for unpopular policies and Jim Geraghty about violence in Syria.",
      "The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years and its internal strife largely began last June, when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists \u2014 among them Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Matea Gold, Jackie Alemany, Michael Scherer and Will Sommer \u2014 have left for other jobs.",
      "Bezos' decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate \u2014 after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris \u2014 led to an exodus of subscribers that the newspaper is fighting to recover from.",
      "Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor when Bezos bought the paper in 2013, wrote last week in the Atlantic that Bezos \"handled his ownership admirably for more than a decade. But his courage failed him when he needed it the most.\"",

      "Airbus is investigating corrosion issues on some of its A220 passenger jets. The issue has been found on what the manufacturer calls a \"limited population\" of A220s, including some operated by U.S. airlines. The manufacturer and multiple airlines said the issue does not constitute an immediate safety issue.",
      "\"Regular maintenance checks are scheduled to ensure it is captured early and the right corrective actions are put in place in a timely manner to mitigate the situation,\" an Airbus spokeswoman told CBS News in a statement. \"The A220 fleet's airworthiness remains intact.\"",
      "Sources familiar with the problem said the corrosion has been found on some passenger seat fittings and certain wing components, including what's known as the wing-to-body fairing, which is designed to minimize drag where the wing and body of the plane meet. It essentially acts as an aerodynamic cover over that junction and is not structural in nature.",
      "\"The FAA is aware of the issue and is ensuring airlines address it,\" an agency spokesman confirmed to CBS News in a brief statement.",
      "Delta Air Lines, the world's largest A220 operator, told CBS News it has observed the issue with some passenger seat fittings that require additional inspection and lubrication.",
      "The Atlanta-based carrier said the issue is not impacting scheduled A220 flights and has not resulted in cancellations.",
      "\"Delta has a sophisticated aircraft maintenance apparatus that is always-on and has many layers to ensure that every aircraft in our fleet is safe to fly by meeting or exceeding standards governed by our regulators,\" a company spokesman told CBS News. \"There is broad consensus by our technical experts that these issues aren't surprising especially for a new, clean-sheet aircraft and pose no major concerns.\"",
      "The airline said while it is aware some A220 carriers may be finding corrosion in the wing-to-body fairing structure, so far Delta mechanics have not found it on their fleet.",
      "JetBlue and Breeze Airways also fly dozens of A220s along with a host of international carriers, including Air Canada, Air France and Swiss Air.",
      "\"We are aware that some areas of the A220 have experienced corrosion and are proactively taking measures to mitigate these concerns,\" a Breeze spokesman told CBS News. \"The safety of our Guests is our first priority, which is why Breeze performs regular maintenance inspections on all of its aircraft to ensure airworthiness.\"",
      "And a JetBlue spokesperson told CBS News, \"All JetBlue aircraft are regularly inspected and maintained to ensure their safety and reliability. JetBlue is working closely with Airbus to proactively address corrosion on certain areas of some A220 aircraft. This does not impact the reliability of our A220 fleet.\"",
      "The A220 was subject to a 2021 airworthiness directive to address corrosion and wear in wing components known as slat tracks that were likely caused by insufficient grease being applied to the component during production. The directive called for additional inspections to monitor the amount of grease applied to the slat tracks.",
      "Sources told CBS News the new issues go beyond the focus of that 2021 order from Transport Canada.",
      "The plane was originally developed by Bombardier as the C-series before being sold to Airbus due to financial headwinds facing Bombardier. The plane is built in Quebec and Mobile, Alabama.",
      "The A220 seats between 100 and 150 passengers with five-seat rows. It's seen as a replacement for larger regional jets like the Embraer 190 and aging Boeing 717 jets.",

      "\"It's a really important area of breeding and a really large portion of the global population is found in that area,\" she told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "The owner of the Solong said that contrary to earlier reports, the vessel wasn't carrying containers of sodium cyanide, which can produce harmful gas when combined with water. It said that four empty containers had previously contained the chemical.",

      "London \u2014\u00a0An American man who said he was among the crew on the MV Stena Immaculate tanker when it was hit Monday by a cargo ship, causing both vessels to burst into flames off England's east coast, told CBS News the other ship \"came from out of the blue\" and rammed the Stena.",
      "The man, who asked to remain anonymous because he wasn't permitted to speak with media about the crash, said the Stena had been anchored on the spot where the collision occurred and had relayed its coordinates, meaning all other vessels in the area should have known its position.",
      "He said he was near to the part of the Stena Immaculate where the Portugal-flagged container ship Solong made its impact, and that he had only seconds to react when he heard shouts to brace before impact. Then, all of a sudden, he said \"a massive ship came from out of the blue.\"",
      "The man said the Solong didn't immediately stop after smashing into the Stena, and that it felt like it continued to drive into the ship for about 10 minutes after the initial impact. The man said other crew members on the Stena, which was apparently carrying jet fuel for the U.S. military, described how it appeared as though nobody was on the bridge of the Solong at the moment of the crash.",
      "Flames erupted from the Stena and the crew immediately jumped into action, the man said. He said they put on protective gear and tried to fight the fire, but quickly determined it wouldn't be possible and decided to abandon ship.",
      "Crew members went to their rooms to gather essential belongings, also grabbing life jackets and emergency gear. They then went to the mustering point and sounded off. When all had been accounted for, they entered the lifeboat, and mustered again. When it was verified that everyone was onboard the lifeboat, they launched. The captain was the last person to leave the Stena, he said.",
      "The man described flames lapping at the crew as they boarded the lifeboat, and said some of the sailors even had singed hair because the fire was so close. He said they couldn't have waited any longer to get off the vessel, and the whole incident from impact to evacuation lasted about 30 minutes.",
      "The man said the crew had been trained for disasters like this, and that everything from the moment of impact to the evacuation had been \"textbook\" and carried out according to procedure.",
      "A U.S. official confirmed to CBS News national defense correspondent Charlie D'Agata on Monday that the Stena was carrying cargo in support of the U.S. Department of Defense, but they said the incident would not impact U.S. military operations or combat readiness.",
      "What is the latest on the cargo ship crash?",
      "CBS News' partner network BBC News\u00a0said it had received a statement from a spokesperson for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office Tuesday, saying they \"understand there doesn't appear to be any suggestions of foul play at this time\" related to the collision of the two vessels about 10 miles off the East Yorkshire coast.",
      "Later in the day, the captain of the Solong was detained \"on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision,\" the Associated Press reported. The 59-year-old captain wasn't named, and he hasn't been charged, Humberside police said.",
      "There were ongoing concerns Tuesday, as the Solong continued to burn, about the potential environmental impact of the incident, but one of the worst fears \u2014 that the Portuguese-flagged vessel could have been carrying a highly toxic chemical \u2014 appeared to be put to rest.",
      "\"We are able to confirm that there are no containers on board ladened with sodium cyanide, as has been misreported,\" the Solong's operator, international shipping firm Ernst Russ, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "The company said there were \"four empty containers that have previously contained the hazardous chemical, and these containers will continue to be monitored.\"",
      "British Chief Coastguard Pat O'Callaghan said in a statement Tuesday that while the Solong was still burning, it had separated from the Stena, and the fire on the U.S.-contracted vessel \"has greatly diminished.\"",
      "\"The Counter Pollution and Salvage Team is assessing the situation and is developing a plan ready for implementation as soon as the situation allows,\" OCallaghan said, adding that Britain's environmental agency was \"monitoring the situation closely and has confirmed that air quality at ground level is currently within normal levels for the weather conditions.\"",

      "Jeddah, Saudi Arabia \u2014 The U.S. and Ukraine said Kyiv would accept a 30-day ceasefire with Russia after talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, with Washington pledging to immediately lift a freeze on intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine.",
      "\"Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation,\"\u00a0 the U.S. and Ukraine said in a joint statement released by the State Department. \"The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace.\"",
      "The agreement came after more than eight hours of\u00a0negotiations\u00a0between Ukrainian officials and a U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the Saudi city of Jeddah.",
      "The statement said the U.S. \"will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine.\" Both were frozen\u00a0in the wake of an explosive meeting between Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Trump at the White House on Feb. 28.",
      "The now-unfrozen military aid includes roughly $1 billion in equipment that was approved by the Biden administration and has not yet been delivered. The Trump administration has the authority to provide another $3.8 billion in aid but has not announced any further aid packages. Ukraine has been buoyed by the U.S. and other Western allies in its fight against Russia since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion in 2022, and the move to cut off aid left Kyiv at a disadvantage and European allies scrambling.",
      "Whether Russia will support a ceasefire remains to be seen. Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy, plans to visit Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, sources familiar with the planning told CBS News. Witkoff met with Putin for more than three hours in February.",
      "In a press briefing following the meeting, Rubio said \"the ball is now in [Russia's] court.\"",
      "\"We'll take this offer now to the Russians. And we hope that they'll say yes, that they'll say yes to peace,\" Rubio said. \"The president's objective here is, number one, above everything else, he wants the war to end, and I think today Ukraine has taken a concrete step in that regard. We hope the Russians will reciprocate.\"",
      "The statement from the U.S. and Ukraine said they would each \"name their negotiating teams and immediately begin negotiations toward an enduring peace that provides for Ukraine's long-term security.\"",
      "It also said Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy would \"conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine's critical mineral resources to expand Ukraine's economy and guarantee Ukraine's long-term prosperity and security.\" Washington has been pushing Kyiv to sign a deal which would grant the U.S. access to its mineral reserves, and Zelenskyy indicated his readiness to sign a deal ahead of the talks.",
      "Rubio led the U.S. delegation to Saudi Arabia, supported by Witkoff and national security adviser Mike Waltz. Zelenskyy was visiting Saudi Arabia at the time of the talks, but did not participate.",
      "Ahead of the talks, a senior Ukrainian official said his message to the U.S. team was the Kyiv was ready to make a peace deal with Russia, and that while Zelenskyy might still want Western security guarantees as part of the deal to deter any future Russian aggression, the focus was \"how to start this process.\"",
      "Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, said his delegation's central message for the U.S. was that \"Ukrainians want a peace,\" and that Ukraine was \"ready to go\" to work toward that goal.",
      "When asked about security guarantees, Yermak said they were \"very important, because we want that never, this aggression, [is] never repeated in the future again.

      "\"At this stage, it's too early to assess the extent of any environmental damage,\" Greenpeace U.K. said in a statement early Tuesday, explaining that the severity of any impact would depend on a number of factors, including \"the amount and type of oil carried by the tanker, the fuel carried by both ships, and how much of that, if any, has entered the water.\"",
      "The U.K. Coastguard said its Counter Pollution and Salvage Team was \"assessing the situation\" and \"developing a plan ready for implementation as soon as the situation allows.\"",

      "\"It's really hard to know at this stage what is in the water and how that's going to behave, but almost in any circumstances, it's bad news,\" Tilley told CBS News.",

      "The North Sea is home to a number of protected marine animals, as well as vital fishing stocks for the U.K. and other European countries.",
      "Oceana U.K. believes the collision took place near two protected areas in particular, including the Southern North Sea marine protected area, which is designated to protect the harbor porpoise, Tilley said.",

      "The harbor porpoise is a \"species that needs to come to the surface to breathe, so it won't easily be able to avoid slicks on the surface,\" Tilley told CBS News.",

      "Possible contaminants",
      "Both of the vessels involved in the collision would have had their own fuel for propulsion, and the American tanker that was hit, the MV Stena Immaculate, was also transporting jet fuel, according to Crowley, the U.S. logistics group that operates the vessel.",
      "Jet fuel is toxic for marine life, and Crowley said some of it had been released in the crash.",
      "\"The Stena Immaculate sustained a ruptured cargo tank containing Jet-A1 fuel due to the collision,\" Crowley said in a statement to the Reuters news agency. \"A fire occurred as a result.\"",
      "It was still unclear Tuesday how much jet fuel had been released and how much might already have burned off in the fire.",
      "Initial reports indicated that containers carrying sodium cyanide were on board the other ship, a Portuguese-flagged cargo ship called the MV Solong. Sodium cyanide is a toxic substance that evaporates quickly and could have created dangerous air conditions on the surface of the water for cleanup crews and animals.",
      "The shipping company that operates the vessel, however, Ernst Rust, said Tuesday that there were no containers containing sodium cyanide on the Solong, but that there were four that had previously contained the chemical and they were being monitored.",
      "Potential risks to fishing industry - and consumers",
      "Tilley said pollution from the collision could impact fish stocks in the North Sea and the people that rely on them.",
      "\"The North Sea is a hugely important area for U.K. fishing fleets, but also European fishing fleets,\" Tilley said.",
      "The extent of any environmental contamination is still unknown, she said, but it \"could have really long-term impacts for the community, like whether the chemicals end up in the water. If that impacts the fish stocks and the population of fish that we eat, then that could have an impact on the fishing industry.\"",

      "Duterte was arrested after arriving from Hong Kong and police took him into custody on orders of the ICC, which has been investigating the mass killings that happened under the former president's deadly crackdown against illegal drugs, President Ferdinand Marcos' office said in a statement.",
      "\"Upon his arrival, the prosecutor general served the ICC notification for an arrest warrant to the former president for the crime of crime against humanity,\" the government said. \"He's now in the custody of authorities.\"",
      "The surprise arrest sparked a commotion at the airport when lawyers and Duterte aides loudly protested that they, along with a doctor and lawyers, were prevented from coming close to him after he was taken into police custody. \"This is a violation of his constitutional right,\" Sen. Bong Go, a close Duterte ally, told reporters.",
      "Duterte's former lawyer and spokesperson, Salvador Panelo, asserted in a statement that the warrant came from \"a spurious source,\" since the ICC has no jurisdiction in the Philippines, the Reuters news agency reported. The ICC says it has jurisdiction there over alleged crimes committed before the country withdrew as a member.",
      "The arrest warrant sent by the ICC to Philippine officials, a copy of which was seen by The AP, said, \"There are reasonable grounds to believe\" the attack on victims \"was both widespread and systematic: The attack took place over a period of several years and thousands people appear to have been killed.\"",

      "\"Now we feel that justice is rolling. We hope that top police officials and the hundreds of police officers who were involved in the illegal killings should also be placed in custody and punished,\" delos Santos said.",
      "Three of the police officers who killed his nephew, Kian delos Santos, were convicted in 2018 for the high-profile murder, which prompted Duterte at the time to temporarily suspend his brutal anti-drugs crackdown.",
      "The conviction was one of at least three, so far, against law enforcement personnel involved in the anti-drugs campaign, reflecting the concerns of families of victims of suspected extrajudicial killings that they wouldn't get justice in the Philippines, which led to their decision to seek the help of the ICC.",
      "Long history of drug killings under Duterte",
      "The ICC investigated drug killings under Duterte from Nov. 1, 2011, when he was still mayor of the southern city of Davao, to March 16, 2019, as possible crimes against humanity. In 2019, Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the Rome Statute in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability.",
      "The Duterte administration moved to suspend the global court's investigation in late 2021 by noting that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations, arguing the ICC \u2014 a court of last resort \u2014 didn't have jurisdiction.",
      "Appeals judges at the ICC ruled in 2023 that the investigation could resume and rejected the Duterte administration's objections. Based in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICC can step in when countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects in the most heinous international crimes including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who succeeded Duterte in 2022 and became entangled in a bitter political dispute with the former president, has decided not to rejoin the global court. But the Marcos administration has said it would cooperate if the ICC asked international police to take Duterte into custody through a so-called Red Notice, a request for law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and temporarily arrest a criminal suspect.",

      "Officials received reports of the attack around 12:10 p.m. local time on Monday, the Western Australia Police Force said. The reported attack took place off Wharton Beach in Esperance, a town in southwestern Australia.",
      "Police have recovered a surfboard with evidence of bite marks, the Western Australia Police Force said. Police, marine rescue and emergency responders searched the area on Monday, paused their efforts overnight, and resumed on Tuesday morning.",
      "At around 5 p.m. local time Tuesday, police said the surfer was presumed dead.",
      "\"Unfortunately, our search has not recovered the surfer's body,\" said Esperance Police Station senior sergeant Christoper Taylor in a video police shared online. \"I can also confirm that our search is a recovery, not a rescue.\"",
      "Taylor called the situation \"heartbreaking.\" He told local media that police have reviewed drone footage that captured the aftermath of the incident.",
      "\"There was a lot of blood, the shark, and some other things that I don't think any others need to see,\" Taylor told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.",
      "Police did not identify the surfer, except to say that he was a man in his 30s. ABC identified him as Steven Jeffrey Payne, who was visiting from Melbourne. He was traveling with his partner and his dog, his brother told the publication. Taylor told ABC Australia that Payne's\u00a0 partner witnessed the attack.",
      "The family \"is distraught and trying to come to terms with what happened yesterday,\" Taylor said in the police video. \"It is heartbreaking, obviously, and the whole community of Esperance feels the pain.\"",
      "Taylor told ABC that the search would likely be called off after Tuesday.",
      "Wharton Beach was closed Monday and Tuesday, but will likely be reopened Wednesday, Taylor told ABC. Police said there have been no further shark sightings in the area. Australian officials recommend beachgoers monitor local shark alerts to stay safe. Swimmers and surfers should also stay inside beach enclosure areas, which include barriers that to deter sharks.",
      "There are about 100 shark species in Western Australia, according to SharkSmart, a website run by Australian officials that warns about shark activity and gives tips on how to stay safe. Most of the species are capable of injuring humans, but an \"overwhelming majority of them are not aggressive under most circumstances.\" Police did not specify what kind of shark attacked the surfer.",

      "China is the largest market for such products, and if prices of foreign-grown goods rise in China, locals will turn to less expensive alternatives either from China or other countries. American farmers that deal in chicken and more will likely lose market share as a result.",

      "The\u00a0Vatican said the doctors had lifted their previous \"guarded\" prognosis, meaning they determined he was no longer in imminent danger as a result of the original respiratory infection he arrived with on Feb. 14. But their caution remained.",
      "\"However, in view of the complexity of the clinical picture and the important infectious picture presented on admission, it will be necessary to continue medical drug therapy in a hospital setting for additional days,\" according to the Vatican statement.",

      "As he did on Sunday, Francis participated in the retreat remotely from the Rome hospital where he is being treated. He could see and hear the Rev. Roberto Pasolini, preacher of the papal household, but the priests, bishops and cardinals gathered for the retreat in the Vatican auditorium could not see or hear him.",
      "Pasolini is delivering a series of meditations this week on \"The hope of eternal life,\" a theme that was chosen well before\u00a0Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 with a complex lung infection.",
      "The retreat, an annual gathering that kicks off the\u00a0Catholic Church's solemn Lenten season\u00a0leading to Easter, continues through the week. The Vatican has said Francis would participate \"in spiritual communion\" with the rest of the hierarchy, from afar.",
      "Francis also resumed his physical and respiratory therapy at the Gemelli hospital, and rested and prayed in between. Francis has been using a nasal tube for supplemental oxygen to help him breathe during the day and a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night, therapy that he was continuing Monday.",
      "The 88-year-old pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, had what was just a bad case of bronchitis when he was hospitalized last month. The infection progressed into a\u00a0complex respiratory tract infection\u00a0and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future.",
      "Francis was still keeping his eye on things. The Vatican said he had been informed about the floods in his native Argentina and expressed his closeness to the affected population. In addition, a Vatican cardinal close to Francis spoke out Monday to refute some negative media reports that have circulated in his absence.",
      "The Vatican development office released a letter written by Cardinal Michael Czerny to one of Francis' close friends, the Argentine social justice activist Juan Grabois. Grabois had travelled to Rome to pray for Francis at Gemelli hospital, and some Italian media reported last month that he had tried to forcibly get into Francis' 10th floor hospital suite, a claim he denied.",
      "In the March 6 letter, Czerny told Grabois that Francis \"knew of your presence in Rome and your daily vigils of prayer and spiritual solidarity at Gemelli Polyclinic and I'm sure this gave him a true comfort and support.\"",
      "\"Additionally, I know that you join me in strongly repudiating the unfounded versions that have circulated in some media about alleged inappropriate behavior in the hospital,\" Czerny wrote.",
      "The Vatican is always abuzz with rumor but has gone into overdrive with speculation about Francis' health and talk of conclaves, even though Francis is very much alive and in charge. The fact that Czerny felt it necessary to defend one of Francis' friends suggested that the rumor and maneuvering in Francis' absence had crossed a line.",
      "On Thursday, the Vatican will mark the 12th anniversary of Francis' election, the first with the pope out of sight but still in charge. Francis was elected the 266th pope,\u00a0the first Jesuit pope\u00a0and first from Latin America on March 13, 2013, following the resignation of\u00a0Pope Benedict XVI.",

      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0President Trump doubled down Friday on his offer to grant U.S. citizenship to White Afrikaner farmers in South Africa, accusing their government of treating them \"terribly.\" Mr. Trump said the U.S. would offer them \"safety\" and that they would be given a \"rapid pathway to citizenship.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had previously pointed to new land expropriation laws in South Africa that he claims are racist and a breach of the White farmers' human rights. In reaction to the laws, he has halted all foreign aid to South Africa.",
      "Diplomatic relations between the two countries have been cool for several years, since then-U.S. Ambassador Reuben Brigety, during a May 2023 news conference, accused South Africa of loading weapons onto a U.S.-sanctioned Russian ship in Simon's Town harbor which then sailed back to Russia, where the weapons were allegedly used to help in the invasion of Ukraine.",

      "In a Friday post on his own Truth social platform, Mr. Trump once again offered \"safe refuge\" to Afrikaner farmers who feel unsafe in South Africa. That came after, on Feb. 7, Mr. Trump signed an executive order accusing the South African government of adopting racist laws that discriminate against Afrikaners, an ethnic group made up primarily of the descendants of Dutch settlers who started arriving in the country hundreds of years ago and now amount to about 13% of the population.",
      "He specifically called out a law that was passed to allow the government expropriation of some privately owned land without compensation.",
      "South Africa's government hit back at the time, saying the law pertained to unused land or land that was not serving the public interest. Mr. Trump ordered Secretary of State Marco Rubio to prioritize the resettlement program in the U.S. for Afrikaners who feel they have been the victims of racial discrimination. He also cut off all aid and assistance to South Africa for as long as the land expropriation law remains on the books.",

      "He added, however, that he and many other Afrikaner leaders do not want to leave the country, and do not necessarily support the blanket sanctions being imposed by the Trump administration. He said there should be targeted sanctions against \"specific leaders\" who act against the South Africa's constitution \"by discriminating against the Afrikaner with racist laws.\"",

      "Flip Buys, who chairs the Solidarity Movement and who was among those to visit Washington, told News 24 that the possibility of targeted U.S. sanctions under the Magnitsky Act, which would require a determination of serious human rights violations, was discussed at the meetings.",

      "Ontario, Canada's most populous province, is adding a 25% surcharge to all electricity exports sent to the U.S. as part of retaliation against the Trump administration's tariffs on Canadian products.",
      "The 25% surcharge will be effective as of March 10, and will affect consumers and businesses in Michigan, Minnesota and New York, the province said in a Monday statement. The new fee will add as much as $400,000 Canadian dollars ($277,000) in daily costs for 1.5 million U.S. homes and businesses, it added.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford estimated it will add about CA$100, or $69 a month, to the bills of each American affected.",
      "On March 8, Ford told CBS News' Ed O'Keefe that President Trump's tariff plan was creating \"mass chaos,\" and added that a trade war between the U.S. and Canada was \"unacceptable.\" During the interview, he also said that while he has a great relationship with the governments of Michigan, Minnesota and New York, he planned to impose a 25% surcharge on energy products starting March 10 unless the trade dispute came to an end.",
      "\"President Trump's tariffs are a disaster for the U.S. economy. They're making life more expensive for American families and businesses,\" Premier Doug Ford said in Monday's statement. \"Until the threat of tariffs is gone for good, Ontario won't back down. We'll stand strong, use every tool in our toolkit and do whatever it takes to protect Ontario.\"",
      "On Monday, the Michigan Public Service Commission said it was concerned about the surcharge, \"including both pricing and reliability concerns.\"",
      "\"While the vast majority of Michigan's electricity is either produced by the electric utilities or purchased under long-term power contracts, the imposition of these tariffs could have some impact on prices in the regional energy markets, though the ultimate impact on Michigan customers is likely to be small,\" the regulatory agency said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump's 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico went into effect last week, although on Thursday he said he would delay the levies by one month, until April 2. On Monday, Ford said Ontario's electricity surcharge would remain in place despite the one-month reprieve from Trump, noting a one-month pause means nothing but more uncertainty.",
      "On March 8, Ford told CBS News that Mr. Trump has declared \"an economic war on his closest friends.\"",
      "Ford's office said the new market rules require any generator selling electricity to the U.S. to add a 25% surcharge. Ontario's government expects it to generate revenue of CA$300,000 ($208,000) to CA$400,000 ($277,000) per day, \"which will be used to support Ontario workers, families and businesses.\"",

      "\"If you are healthy, it's almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease, in modern times \u2014 because we have nutrition \u2026 and access to medicines. What we need is good science on all of these things so that people can make rational choices.\"",
      "As measles cases continue to spread in several U.S. states, the spotlight is on prevention of the highly contagious disease. (iStock)",

      "\"Almost all of them were malnourished children,\" RFK said. \"Measles still is a very, very lethal disease in foreign countries and developed countries where there is low malnutrition.\"",
      "He added, \"The best thing Americans can do is to keep themselves healthy. It is very, very difficult for measles to kill a healthy, well-nourished person.\"",
      "\"We see a correlation between people who get hurt by measles and people who don't have good nutrition.\"",

      "\"While better nutrition is important for American children, it\u2019s unlikely to make a difference when it comes to measles infection or severity \u2014 90% of well-fed but unvaccinated American children exposed to measles will become infected, around 20% of those children will be hospitalized, and 0.1-1% of those children will die.\"",

      "Dr. Trish Perl, an infectious disease expert at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, noted that malnutrition can impair some of the immune system responses to many infections \u2014 but in the case of measles, the answer is \"complicated.\"",

      "The CDC recommends that adults and teens are up-to-date on MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccinations with either one or two doses, depending on individual risk factors. (iStock)",
      "\"There is no treatment for measles beyond supportive care,\" she said. \"However, in low- and middle-income countries \u2014 whose mortality is greater than 1% \u2014 the World Health Organization recommends vitamin A (two doses) to reduce the severity of measles and prevent complications.\"",

    "summary": "Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., introduced the WISH Act Tuesday, which seeks to help seniors obtain long-term home care insurance. Suozzi fears the country&apos;s growing population of older folks will face a crisis on this front if nothing is done.",
    "story": [
      "Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss how House Republicans' narrowly-passed budget bill will help advance Trump's agenda and how she is responding to Democrats' 'fearmongering' over the possibility of Medicaid cuts.",
      "Democratic New York Rep. Tom Suozzi said Tuesday that there is a catastrophe brewing for the country's aging population, and he wants to do something about it.",
      "Alongside Republican Rep. John Moolenaar, Suozzi introduced the \"Well-Being Insurance for Seniors to be at Home Act\" on Tuesday, which seeks to help more of the country's increasingly older population obtain long-term home care insurance.",
      "\"Currently, 10,000 Americans every day are turning 65-years-old,\" Suozzi told reporters during a press call on Tuesday, and, in five years, 6,000 Americans will turn 85 every day. Suozzi also noted that right now, only about 4% of seniors are covered by long-term care insurance.",
      "AGING MAY SPEED UP IN AREAS WITH EXTREME HEAT, RESEARCH SUGGESTS",
      "\"One of the main causes of people becoming homeless \u2014 new homeless people \u2014 is turning 80 years old, because a lot of people are becoming destitute as they get old, and they face what are called, \u2018Their inability to conduct daily activities of living,'\" Suozzi said. \"And right now, very few people have long-term care insurance, and people will end up going into nursing homes. And not only can the nursing homes not handle this volume of people, but the Medicaid system will go bust, and two thirds of the people in America that are in nursing homes are paid for with Medicaid.\"",
      "(Democratic New York Rep. Tom Suozzi said Tuesday that there is a catastrophe brewing for the country's aging population, and he wants to do something about it.)",
      "In addition to the increasingly growing senior population in the U.S., Suozzi also cited societal factors that are making it harder for aging and disabled seniors to receive the at-home care they need. One is the fact that Americans are having fewer kids, so there will be fewer of them to take care of their aging or disabled parents. Another was the fact that kids are increasingly moving to other parts of the country away from their parents, again increasing the burden for seniors to figure things out on their own.",
      "\"There's a lot of people becoming senior citizens right now because the baby boomers, there's less kids available to take care of them, and the kids that are alive don't necessarily live where their parents live. So we've got this big perfect storm brewing, and Medicaid will never be able to solve this problem,\" according to Suozzi. \"And nursing homes \u2014 there's just not enough nursing homes. There's not enough money to pay for the nursing homes for all these people. So my legislation is designed to try and encourage the private sector to create long-term care insurance that is affordable.\"",
      "DEMS WEAPONIZE MEDICAID ANXIETY IN BID TO TAKE DOWN TRUMP-BACKED FEDERAL FUNDING PLAN",
      "In five years, 6,000 Americans will turn 85 every day. (iStock)",
      "Known by its acronym, WISH, Suozzi and Moolenaar's new bill seeks to create a federal \"Catastrophic Care Fund\" that will help cover some of the cost-burden of long-term care. The goal is to encourage private insurers to develop and market affordable and accessible long-term care insurance, which, overtime, they have ceased providing more broadly. The reason, Suozzi said, is it was just not profitable enough for them, as most seniors with long-term care insurance were outliving their expected life terms and costing insurance companies a lot of money as a result.",
      "Suozzi likened his new plan to Medicare Part B, another similar cost-sharing program that has pushed insurers to incentivize customers to enroll. Seniors would be able to benefit from the newly created fund on a tiered basis, according to each person's income level.",
      "MEASLES MORE LIKELY TO BE SEVERE AMONG MALNOURISHED, RFK SAYS",
      "The Democrat lawmaker pointed out how the WISH Act will help reduce the cost burden of federal healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which can help pay for the fund. He also suggested a payment plan involving an increased income tax shared by both employees and employers, but Suozzi noted that plan was unlikely to get the GOP support necessary. Another potential payment option for the new long-term care fund could stem from reforms to Social Security, the congressman added.",
      "Suozzi introduced the \"Well-Being Insurance for Seniors to be at Home Act\" on Tuesday, which seeks to help more of the country's increasingly older population obtain long-term home care insurance. (Mary Altaffer/AP Photo)",
      "Besides the \"perfect storm\" that is brewing for seniors, a second storm is also brewing on Capitol Hill right now in regard to how to fund the federal government. Republicans are ramping up reconciliation efforts and, as part of that framework, they are looking for roughly $800 billion in Medicaid cuts. While the Wish Act could help lower the amount of necessary cuts during reconciliation, Suozzi said he feared it was too tight of a window to get enough lawmakers on board.",
      "\"I guess there's an argument that it could go in there, if we could demonstrate between now and then that it'll be a big savings in Medicaid,\" Suozzi told reporters. \"I see this is taking the full term of getting people educated about the issue, getting more people interested in the issue, and getting senior advocacy groups and private insurers to advocate on behalf of this idea. So it's not going to happen on its own. It will have to be part of something bigger, but not, I think, until we've educated people about the seriousness of the issue.\"",

      "The app surged from 50,000 to 100,000 downloads in a single week despite red flags in user reviews about harassment and blackmail.",
      "Once downloaded, the app requested excessive permissions far beyond what a typical financial app would need, including access to contacts, SMS messages, call logs, photos and location data. This allowed the malware to silently collect personal information from users' devices.",
      "The stolen data fueled a vicious cycle of scams and extortion. SpyLoan apps like SpyLend lure users with attractive loan terms, only to exploit their data for predatory lending practices. If users fail to meet repayment demands, the operators weaponize their information by harassing them, blackmailing them with threats of leaking private photos or contacting their friends and family, and creating a climate of fear and coercion.",

You might say I am contradicting myself, but Play Store is still safer than other options out there. They have strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. However, even with the security measures provided by Google Play, downloading apps from the store does not guarantee 100% protection against malware or harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Never trust download links that you get through SMS.",
      "4) Review app permissions carefully: If an app asks for unnecessary permissions, like access to your contacts, call logs or storage, do not install it. A legitimate loan app should only require essential permissions related to financial transactions.",
      "5) Check reviews and red flags: Before installing any financial app, read user reviews carefully. If multiple people report harassment, blackmail or excessive permissions, avoid the app entirely.",
      "6) Report and uninstall suspicious apps: If you encounter a SpyLoan app, immediately\u00a0uninstall it and revoke its permissions. Report it to the Google Play Store, cybersecurity authorities and financial regulators to help prevent further victims.",

      "Urgency as a weapon: Scammers exploit our fear of financial loss to prompt hasty actions. They use phrases like, in this case, \"Act now\" or \"Cancel Now\" and warn of dire consequences if immediate action isn't taken. This urgency is designed to bypass rational thinking and prevent you from verifying the legitimacy of the request.",
      "Suspicious links: Legitimate banks avoid sending security-sensitive links via text. These links could download viruses to your device or lead you to a fake website designed to steal your personal information. Always verify the URL before entering any sensitive data.",
      "Specific yet unfamiliar details: The mention of \"Bryana White\" and the precise amount of $950.44 is a clever tactic.

This approach aims to instill doubt and urgency, increasing the chances that the victim will act hastily.",

This deceptive strategy is designed to manipulate you into believing you are interacting with a trusted institution, thereby increasing the likelihood of falling for their scam.",
      "Unsolicited contact: Be wary of unexpected texts claiming to be from your bank, especially if you haven't signed up for text alerts.",
      "Spelling and grammatical errors: Look for mistakes in spelling, grammar or punctuation. Legitimate messages from banks are usually written by professionals and are free of errors.",

The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "3. Contact your bank directly using official channels: Jane should call Kinecta's official number to verify if there's any real issue with her account, rather than responding to the text.",
      "4. Report the text to your bank and forward it to 7726 (SPAM): By reporting this text, Jane can help Kinecta and her mobile carrier protect other customers from similar scams.",
      "5. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) on your accounts: This extra layer of security could prevent scammers from accessing Jane's account even if they obtained her password.",
      "6. Use SMS filtering tools provided by your mobile carrier: These tools might have caught and flagged the suspicious \"Kinect\" text before it reached Jane's inbox.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: This can help reduce the amount of personal information available online, making it harder for scammers to target Jane and you with personalized attacks in the future. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Remember, legitimate financial institutions will never pressure you to act immediately or click on links in text messages. When in doubt, always reach out to your bank directly using official channels. Thank you, Jane, for bringing this to our attention. Your vigilance not only protected you but also helps educate others. Together, we can stay one step ahead of scammers and protect our finances.",

      "Since people tend to trust tools that seem legitimate, attackers use them to spread malware or steal sensitive data. A new report reveals that over 3.2 million users have been affected by a security breach involving malicious browser extensions.",

      "How were the extensions compromised?",
      "GitLab Security has uncovered a major security breach affecting over 3.2 million users through a network of compromised browser extensions, including some linked to GitLab. The attack stemmed from a supply chain breach, where threat actors infiltrated legitimate extensions and pushed malicious updates. These updates embedded hidden scripts that allowed unauthorized data collection, altered HTTP requests and injected ads into web pages, all without users noticing.",
      "Originally built for tasks like ad blocking, emoji input and screen recording, these extensions were repurposed through covert updates that exploited the extensive permissions users had granted, enabling real-time manipulation of web activity.",
      "Typically, malicious extensions or apps are created solely to steal data, with their advertised functionality being an afterthought or simply a way to get listed in an official store. That was not the case here. These were legitimate extensions that became harmful only after attackers injected malicious updates into them.",

      "The malicious extensions bypassed Content Security Policy protections, which are designed to prevent cross-site scripting attacks, allowing attackers to modify web content without detection. They also communicated with command-and-control servers to receive further instructions, showing a high level of coordination. The attackers exploited the trust users place in the Chrome Web Store and its automatic update system. Investigations suggest this activity has been ongoing since at least July 2024.",
      "Some of the compromised extensions listed above have generic names that may resemble well-known and legitimate tools, but they are not the same. For example, \"Password Manager\" in our list refers to a malicious extension identified in the breach,\u00a0not to reputable password manager services we mention here.\u00a0Similarly, extensions named \"AdBlock Plus\" or \"VPN Extension\" in this context are not necessarily the widely trusted versions but rather imitations or malicious variants.",
      "To ensure you're using a legitimate extension, follow these steps.",

      "Check the reviews and downloads \u2013 Malicious extensions often have lower ratings, generic reviews or a small number of downloads compared to their legitimate counterparts.",
      "Avoid third-party sites \u2013 Only install browser extensions directly from trusted sources like the\u00a0Chrome Web Store,\u00a0Mozilla Add-ons or the official website of the developer.",

Bugs or security gaps in old versions of your browser or extensions can be exploited to inject malicious code, steal data or take control of your system. Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense. Turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2. Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser. Don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Be skeptical of extensions requesting unnecessary access: Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag.",
      "Before installing, ask, \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer is no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension has been sold or hacked.",
      "5. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the incident, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this security incident, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Browser extensions can improve functionality but also pose significant security risks if not carefully managed.

      "Why should you store your driver's license in Apple Wallet?",
      "Storing your Apple ID in your Apple Wallet may be more secure than carrying a physical card that can be lost easily. Additionally, your digital ID doesn't contain as much visible personal information as a physical ID card. Digital IDs stored in your Apple Wallet do not display personal information other than your full name. To display things such as your address, date of birth and so on, you must sign in with Face ID or Touch ID.",
      "Information is only ever transferred from your Apple Wallet via NFC, which uses an encrypted Bluetooth data connection. This means nothing can be easily or quickly copied. Whenever you have to hand your phone over to a police officer or TSA agent, they won't see your personal information without authentication from you.",
      "Using your digital ID with Apple Wallet from your iPhone or Apple Watch works similarly to Apple Pay. You hold the device near the reader, and a screen will appear telling you exactly which information you will share.

For example, a security guard who needs to check your ID at a venue entrance would have a reader that shows your ID photo and confirms if you're over 21. They wouldn't see things like your ID number, address or actual date of birth, simplifying the process for you and the worker and preventing your personal info from being copied.",
      "At the time of publishing, police agencies do not accept digital IDs as driver's licenses, so you'll need to have your physical ID when driving. However, the TSA does accept digital IDs with digital ID readers at\u00a0several airports, and a few concert venues have begun accepting digital IDs.

      "If you are unable to add your driver's license to your Apple ID, it's most likely because your state doesn't yet support the feature. If your state is on the list above, but you can't add your license, it may be because of a temporary Apple server outage.\u00a0Apple recommends that you contact the local DMV or state office that issued your card in the event that the servers are not down.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Thousands of sick, exhausted and terrified young men and women, from countries all over the world squat in rows, packed shoulder to shoulder, surgical masks covering their mouths and eyes.",
      "Their nightmare was supposed to be over.",
      "UN WARNS OF 'FRIGHTENING AND DISTURBING' ACTIVITY BY MILITARY, REBELS IN WESTERN BURMA",
      "Last month, a dramatic and highly publicized operation by Thai, Chinese and Myanmar authorities led to the release of more than 7,000 people from locked compounds in Myanmar where they were forced to trick Americans and others out of their life savings. But survivors have found themselves trapped once again, this time in overcrowded facilities with no medical care, limited food and no idea when they\u2019ll be sent home.",
      "One young man from India said about 800 people were being held in the same facility as him, sharing 10 dirty toilets. He said many of the people there were feverish and coughing. Like all former enslaved scammers who talked to The Associated Press, he spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern for his safety.",
      "\"If we die here with health issues, who is responsible for that?\" he asked.",
      "The armed groups who are holding the survivors, as well as Thai officials across the border, say they are awaiting action from the detainees\u2019 home governments.",
      "It\u2019s one of the largest potential rescues of forced laborers in modern history, but advocates say the first major effort to crack down on the cyber scam industry has turned into a growing humanitarian crisis.",
      "The people released are just a small fraction of what could be 300,000 people working in similar scam operations across the region, according to an estimate from the United States Institute of Peace. Human rights groups and analysts add that the networks that run these illegal scams will continue to operate unless much broader action is taken against them.",
      "A high-profile crackdown",
      "The trapped people, some of whom are highly educated and fluent in English, were initially lured to Thailand with promises of lucrative office jobs, only to find themselves locked in buildings where they describe being forced to sit at computers up to 16 hours a day running scams. Refusing to work could bring beatings, starvation and electric shocks.",
      "People from China, Vietnam and Ethiopia, believed to have been trafficked and forced to work in scam centers, sit with their faces masked while in detention after being released from the centers in Myawaddy district in eastern Myanmar, Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Thanaphon Wuttison)",
      "\"Your passport is confiscated, you cannot go outside and everything is like hell, a living hell,\" a trapped Pakistani man told The Associated Press.",
      "Cyber scams run from compounds have flourished during the pandemic, targeting people around the world. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes estimates that between $18 billion and $37 billion was lost in Asia alone in 2023, with minimal government action against the criminal industry\u2019s spread.",
      "Beijing began pushing the region's governments to crack down this year after a young Chinese actor was trafficked to Myanmar by people who promised him an acting job in Thailand. His girlfriend spearheaded a viral social media campaign that led to his release.",
      "Following that rescue, a senior Chinese government official visited Thailand and Myanmar demanding an end to the scams. In response, Thailand cut electricity, internet and gas supplies to five border towns in Myanmar.",
      "Shortly after, the ethnic militia groups that rule this part of Myanmar \u2014 the Kayin Border Guard Force and the Democratic Kayin Buddhist Army \u2014 asked some of the trapped scammers if they wanted to leave, and then escorted them out of their compounds.",
      "From forced labor to detention",
      "As the number of people released grew into the thousands, formerly enslaved scammers found themselves caught in indefinite detention just across a narrow, slow-moving river\u2019s width from freedom.",
      "Most are being held either in army camps controlled by the Kayin Border Guard Force, or repurposed scam compounds, where many have been since early February.",
      "For weeks, men and women have shared unsanitary conditions, sleeping on the floor and eating what their captors provide. At one point, the Border Guard Force said that over 7,000 people were crammed into these facilities, as China began busing citizens across the border for flights.",
      "Exclusive photos obtained by AP underscore the detainees' desperation: Surgical masks, often two per face, cover their eyes, noses and mouths as they huddle under the watchful eyes of armed guards.",
      "\"It felt like a blessing that we came out of that trap, but the actual thing is that every person just wants to go back home,\" said another Indian man, 24, speaking softly on a contraband phone from inside a makeshift detention center. He asked to not publish his name out of concern for his safety and because the militias guarding them had confiscated their phones.",
      "Last week, fights broke out between Chinese citizens waiting to go home and the security forces guarding them, two detainees told the AP.",
      "An unconfirmed list provided by authorities in Myanmar says they\u2019re holding citizens from 29 countries including Philippines, Kenya and the Czech Republic.",
      "Waiting for a $600 plane ticket",
      "Authorities in Thailand say they cannot allow foreigners to cross the border from Myanmar unless they can be sent home immediately, leaving many to wait for help from embassies that has been long in coming.",
      "China sent a chartered flight Thursday to the tiny Mae Sot airport to pick up a group of its citizens, but few other governments have matched that. There are roughly 130 Ethiopians waiting in a Thai military base, stuck for want of a $600 plane ticket. Dozens of Indonesians were bused out one morning last week, pushing suitcases and carrying plastic bags with their meager possessions as they headed to Bangkok for a flight home.",
      "Thai officials held a meeting this week with representatives from foreign embassies, promising to move \"as quickly as possible\" to allow them to rescue their trapped citizens. But they warned that Thailand can only manage to receive 300 people per day, down from 500 previously, Monday through Fridays. It also announced it would let embassy staff cross over into Myanmar.",
      "\"The ministry attaches very high importance to this and is aware that there are sick people, and that they need to be repatriated,\" Nikorndej Balankura, spokesman for Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Thursday.",
      "The Indian Embassy in Bangkok did not respond to requests for comment. The Czech Foreign Ministry says it cannot confirm a Czech citizen is among those repatriated. It says it is in touch with the embassies in Bangkok and Yangon over the issue and that the embassies have not been asked for assistance.",
      "Amy Miller, the Southeast Asia director of Acts of Mercy International who is based at the Thai-Myanmar border, says it\u2019s hard for the world to understand why all of the released workers aren\u2019t free.",
      "\"You can literally, with your naked eye, stand at the border and see people inside, on their balconies, in these compounds, and yet we cannot reach them,\" she said. Pausing a moment, she gestured out a nearby window toward the Friendship Bridge to Myanmar just blocks away. \"I think what people don\u2019t understand is that to enter into another country is an act of war. You cannot just go in and receive these people out.\"",
      "Assistance is scarce",
      "Aiding the work on the front lines, especially for those countries with fewer resources, are a handful of small nonprofit groups with very limited funds.",
      "In a nondescript Mae Sot home, Miller\u2019s organization receives escapees and a trickle of survivors who have made it across the river with comfortable couches, clean water, food and working phones to reach their families. She said today\u2019s unprecedented numbers are overwhelming the aid available across the river.",
      "\"When we\u2019re looking at numbers in the thousands, the ability to get them over to Thailand and process them and house them and feed them would be impossible for most governments,\" said Miller. \"It really does require a kind of a global response.\"",
      "The recent abrupt halt to U.S. foreign aid funding has made it even harder to get help to released scam center workers.",
      "The United Nations\u2019 International Organization for Migration, for example, previously funded care for victims of trafficking in scam compounds in one shelter in Cambodia, but was forced to halt that work by the Trump Administration\u2019s funding freeze announced in January, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. The halt to funding has also impacted a network of civil society groups that worked to stop human trafficking and rescue survivors in Thailand.",
      "\"It\u2019s really heartbreaking to see that there\u2019s such an immense amount of people that are in need of assistance,\" said Saskia Kok, Head of Protection Unit in Thailand for the IOM.",
      "In a statement, U.S. officials acknowledged the high pressure impasse.",
      "\"The United States remains deeply concerned about online scam operations throughout Southeast Asia, which affect thousands of Americans and individuals from many other countries,\" said a State Department spokesperson in a statement sent to the AP.",
      "A bigger problem",
      "While advocates estimate some 50 million people are living in modern slavery, mass rescues of enslaved workers are rare. In 2015, more than 2,000 fishermen were rescued from brutal conditions at sea, liberated after an Associated Press investigation exposed their plight. That same year hundreds of Indians were rescued from brick factories in India. And last year Brazilian prosecutors rescued 163 Chinese nationals working in \"slavery-like\" conditions at an electric vehicle factory construction site in northeastern Brazil.",
      "\"What we are seeing at the Thai-Myanmar border now is the result of years of inaction on a trafficking crisis that has had a devastating impact on thousands of people, many of whom were simply seeking better economic prospect, but were lured to these compounds on false pretenses,\" said Amnesty International Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman.",
      "Being forced to commit a crime under threat of violence should not be criminalized, said Freeman. \"However, in general we are aware of countries in the region repatriating their nationals from scam compounds only to then charge them with crimes.\"",
      "Business as usual",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much of an effect these releases will have on the criminal groups that run the scam centers.",
      "February marked the third time the Thais have cut internet or electricity to towns across the river. Each time, the compounds have managed to work around the cuts. Large compounds have access to diesel-powered generators, as well as access to internet provider Starlink, experts working with law enforcement say.",
      "\"The resources is the one thing that they are not lacking and they\u2019ve been able to bring them to bear in the past,\" said Benedikt Hoffman, acting representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in the region.",
      "The armed groups that staged the crackdown have also been accused of helping to run scam compounds in Myawaddy. The head of the Kayin Border Guard Force, General Saw Chit Thu, has been sanctioned by the European Union and the United Kingdom for profiting from scam compounds and human trafficking, respectively. Compounds in the DKBA\u2019s control are less well-documented in the public record, but activists say they also control a fair number.",
      "\"There is clearly a lot of pressure on the Border Guard Force to take action and helping people to leave is one of the most visible ways to do so,\" Hoffman said. \"That said, it likely also reflects an adjustment to the business model, reducing the number of people involved \u2014 and with less attention, continuing lower key operations.\"",
      "It will take simultaneous pressure exerted in multiple areas to truly shut down the compounds, said Hoffman.",
      "In this crackdown, there have been no major prosecutions or compounds shut down.",

      "\"This doesn\u2019t affect anything,\" said a 23-year-old Pakistani man who had hoped to be freed only to be trapped in an army camp. The bosses, he said, are \"rich as hell\" and can buy anything they need to keep the lucrative operations going. Meanwhile, he said, conditions are worsening.",
      "\"My friends are in really bad condition, we can\u2019t survive here,\" he said, requesting anonymity out of fear for retribution from his guards. He asks a question that's been haunting him day in and day out for weeks: \"Is anyone coming for us?\""

      "The crime?",
      "Her teenage brother was caught handing out leaflets that said, \"Lithuania is free.\" After 50 years of Soviet occupation during the Cold War, many Lithuanians today are wary of any negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and are watching the Kremlin\u2019s next moves closely.",
      "\"In my opinion, the only efficient diplomacy with Russia was what Al Capone said, the only good negotiation is when you have a gun on the table. So that's probably the kind of diplomacy that would work with Russia,\" \u0160akalien\u0117 warned during an interview at the Lithuanian Embassy in Washington Friday.",

After what was done to my family and by Russia for generations, I don't think you would find any Lithuanian who could trust Vladimir Putin.\"",

      "Located in Eastern Europe with a population of 2.8 million in an area roughly the size of West Virginia, Lithuania cannot afford to ignore Russia. It shares a 184-mile border with Russia (Kaliningrad) as well as a 420-mile border with Belarus, which she says is \"now just a platform for the Russian army.\"",
      "She said, \"They are trying to frighten us. They are trying to make us feel insecure,\" about the Russian forces next door.",
      "Lithuania is ramping up defense spending as a result of Russia launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and plans to exceed Trump\u2019s demand that NATO allies spend 5% of GDP on defense. \u0160akalien\u0117 said her country hopes to reach 6% by next year. The U.S. currently spends 3.4%.",

      "When asked for her reaction to a report that Trump is considering not defending NATO allies who do not spend enough on defense, \u0160akalien\u0117 applauded the harsh rhetoric from Trump, calling it \"painful\" but justified. \"Everyone needs to contribute, burden sharing is the main rule if you really want to have a strong alliance.\"",
      "She pointed to the Baltic States and Poland as leading NATO members in defense spending as a percentage of GDP.",

      "Just last week, as a result of Hamas terrorists' refusal to extend the ceasefire deal and start releasing the 59 hostages still held in Gaza, the Israeli government decided to halt all goods and supplies going into Gaza.",

      "Retired Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a former IDF international spokesperson and now a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, dismissed claims of starvation, telling Fox News Digital that Hamas hoards supplies while Israel ensures aid enters. \"Over 25,200 trucks arrived during the ceasefire \u2013 enough for four months. If there\u2019s hunger, it\u2019s because of Hamas corruption, not a lack of food,\" he said.",

      "\"We didn't enter politics,\" said professor Ronit Endevelt. \"We just wanted to know if, from a nutritional perspective, the food entering Gaza was sufficient. We double-checked our data multiple times to avoid exaggeration.\"",
      "Between January and April 2024, 14,916 trucks carrying 227,854 tons of food entered Gaza, averaging 124 food trucks per day. The study found that the daily per capita caloric supply averaged 3,374 kcal, with 101 grams of protein and 80.6 grams of fat \u2013 meeting or exceeding international humanitarian food aid standards.",

      "\"In March 2024, the United Nations Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warned of imminent famine in Gaza. Within days, cautious technical language gave way to media headlines and political statements claiming mass starvation was already underway,\" professor Troen told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"One of the most persistent falsehoods has been the claim that before the war, 500 or more humanitarian trucks entered Gaza daily, and that this number was necessary to meet the population\u2019s needs. In reality, the number of food trucks was around or fewer than 100 per day before the war, and has since increased substantially,\" he continued. \"Our study aimed to address that gap by analyzing verified food shipments. The numbers show that while there were variations, at no point did the food supply drop to starvation levels.\"",

      "When asked specifically about testimonies obtained by Fox News Digital from Gazans who reported struggling to find food on certain days, Endevelt acknowledged the study did not track final distribution within Gaza. \"We can\u2019t say there was no hunger, but we can confirm enough food entered,\" she said. \"Most of the time, in most months, there was enough food available.\"",
      "A key finding of the study is the distinction between food supply and distribution. \"Hamas systematically weaponized food distribution, using it as a tool of control,\" said Endevelt. \"Aid often didn\u2019t reach those in need because Hamas seized supplies, sold them on the black market, or prioritized its own fighters. Reports of famine are not due to a lack of aid but Hamas\u2019 deliberate strategy of restricting access to maintain power and profit.\"",
      "Despite these findings, the ICC investigation and global criticism continued. \"IPC reports, widely cited as evidence against Israel, failed to mention Hamas\u2019 role in manipulating aid,\" Troen said.",

However, the political climate made the review process unusually intense.\"",
      "\"This was one of the most rigorously reviewed studies I\u2019ve ever worked on,\" Endevelt added. \"We had five reviewers, far more than usual, and months of back-and-forth revisions to ensure absolute accuracy.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:32:01 GMT",
    "summary": "Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republicans voiced confidence that they can push through a stopgap funding bill and avert a government shutdown at the end of this week.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican-led House voted Tuesday to pass a six-month funding bill that would prevent a government shutdown at the end of the week, overcoming fierce Democratic objections.",
      "The vote was 217-213, with all Republicans but Thomas Massie, of Kentucky, supporting the legislation. One Democrat, Jared Golden, of Maine, voted for it.",
      "The measure now heads to the Senate, where its fate is uncertain. Republicans control 53 seats, and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has made clear he\u2019s firmly against it. That means at least eight Democratic senators would have to support the bill to cross the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold and send it to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk.",
      "The government is set to run out of money late Friday.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who shepherded the bill through the House, took a victory lap after the vote, saying that House Republicans \"stood together\" with one Democrat to keep the government's lights on.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., \"is the leader of the Democrats on that side and he must determine whether he wants to fund the government and do the responsible thing or he wants to shut the government down,\" Johnson told reporters, \"and I certainly hope that there are enough Democrats in the Senate who have a conscience, who will do the right thing by the American people and take care of business over there.\"",
      "Ahead of the vote, Senate Democrats criticized the partisan approach House Republicans took on the funding bill. But a significant number of them kept the door open to supporting it.",
      "And after an unusually long, private Senate Democratic lunch meeting Tuesday, Schumer declined to say whether he\u2019d block the bill \u2014 a sign that his members lack consensus on the path forward.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to wait and see what the House does first,\u201d Schumer told reporters.",
      "The legislation is not a typical stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution or CR, that extends funding at current levels. This spending bill includes a slight increase in military spending and a moderate $13 billion cut in domestic nondefense spending. It was crafted by GOP leaders, who took input from the White House and excluded Democrats from the process. House Democratic leaders strongly objected to the bill.",
      "Ahead of the vote, House Republicans also approved a \u201crule\u201d that would prohibit a vote in the first session of this Congress to terminate the \u201cnational emergency\u201d Trump declared Feb. 1 to impose tariffs on U.S. imports from Canada, Mexico and China.",
      "Over the past several days, Trump and his top aides called undecided Republicans, including Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., to urge them to back the funding bill, multiple sources familiar with the calls said. And before the vote Tuesday morning, Vice President JD Vance huddled with House Republicans at the Capitol to rally support for the bill.",
      "Rep. Kat Cammack, of Florida, one of the Republicans who were on the fence Tuesday morning, voted for the bill after, she said, she visited the White House earlier in the day.",
      "A positive sign for Johnson coming into Tuesday was that the far-right House Freedom Caucus, which is frequently a thorn in the side of leadership, had endorsed the stopgap bill.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m 100% behind this continuing resolution,\u201d the caucus chairman, Andy Harris, R-Md., said in a rare appearance at Johnson\u2019s leadership news conference Tuesday morning. \u201cThis is not your grandfather\u2019s continuing resolution. This is a different type of spending bill.\u201d",
      "Democratic leaders staunchly opposed the six-month funding patch, blasting Republicans for pushing a bill they had no part in shaping. Democrats also objected to how the bill was structured, saying it gave the Trump administration too much discretion in how to spend certain pots of money.",
      "And Democrats have pushed for guardrails on Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk\u2019s attempts to slash or freeze some federal spending.",
      "\u201cThe House Republican spending bill is an attack on everyday Americans. It will cut health care, cut veterans benefits and cut nutritional assistance to children and families,\u201d House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said at a news conference with his leadership team after the vote. \u201cIt is unacceptable, and that is why there was a strong showing of opposition amongst House Democrats.\u201d",
      "It's unclear what will now happen on the other side of the Capitol. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., said before Tuesday's House vote that he would vote for the GOP's funding bill.",
      "\"I refuse to burn the village down and to claim to save it,\" Fetterman said. \"I probably won't agree with many facets of that CR, but when the choice is about shutting the government down, I don't want to be involved with that.\"",
      "Other Democrats said they were watching to see what happens in the House vote before they announce their positions.",
      "\u201cI've got to wait to see the impact it has on Arizona,\u201d Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., said Tuesday.",
      "Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, said Tuesday he was concerned that the Trump administration might try to make a shutdown as painful as possible. He is also undecided on the bill.",
      "\"That's one of the things we have to consider. We're dealing with people, many of whom, I suspect, think a shutdown would be a good thing,\" King said, \"and they could prolong it and use it to expand the president's power even beyond what they're already considering. ... This isn't normal.\"",
      "Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., also kept his powder dry.",
      "\"I haven't come out publicly at this point, just because I want to see what the House does,\" he said, aligning with top Democratic appropriators who want a one-month extension to negotiate a new funding agreement. \"I'm still hoping that there's space for the 30-day extension,\" he said."

      "The 11-count indictment issued last week outlined Nordquist's gruesome torment, which included beatings, hitting, kicking, punching, inserting an object into his anus, starvation, forced consumption of feces, urine and tobacco juice. Two young children were also coerced to partake in his torture, according to the indictment.",
      "Prosecutors said last week that Nordquist, 24, was tortured from Jan. 1 to Feb. 2. Authorities found Nordquist\u2019s body in a farmer\u2019s field in Yates County, New York, on Feb. 13.",

In September, Nordquist left his home in Oakdale, Minnesota, and traveled to Canandaigua, New York, to pursue the romantic relationship, his family said.

      "Republicans came up with a plan to take control of the chamber after they got their temporary one-seat majority following the court ruling against Johnson. But state House Democrats staged a walkout in January to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to move forward with that plan. The party\u2019s lawmakers declined to show up for the first day of the legislative session on Jan. 14. (Later, the state Supreme Court blocked Republicans\u2019 attempt to convene their own session.)",
      "State House Democrats boycotted the chamber for close to three weeks.",
      "In February, Democrats and Republicans settled on a new power-sharing arrangement that presumed Democrats would win the special election Tuesday and result in a 67-67 tie in the chamber.",
      "Under that deal, Republican Rep. Lisa Demuth will be the speaker for the next two years. The parties agreed to co-chair the House's committees, with each committee requiring an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.",
      "Another part of the deal was that House Republicans said they wouldn\u2019t take action to remove Democratic Rep. Brad Tabke, whose narrow 14-vote win in November was called into question when election officials discovered they\u2019d accidentally thrown out 21 absentee ballots without counting them."

      "Caneiro, who was 51 at the time of the killings, has pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder in the slaying of Keith Caneiro, 50; Jennifer Caneiro, 45; and their two children, Jesse, 11, and Sophia, 8.",

      "There are a few key patterns and trends that enabled President Donald Trump to flip the state in November that will be under the microscope next month.",
      "Eight of the 10 counties where Trump improved his performance the most from the 2020 elections are in the southwestern part of the state, in what is called the \u201cDriftless Area\u201d (a nod to the unique topography that resulted from the lack of glacial coverage more than 10,000 years ago).",
      "Politically, it represents a significant growth opportunity for the GOP, having remained loyal to Democrats until more recently than other small towns and rural parts of the state. It was Trump\u2019s emergence in 2016 that triggered the area\u2019s movement toward the GOP.",
      "Does this represent a partisan realignment that is ongoing and that will allow Republicans to build an even bigger advantage here going forward? Or is it more tentative and Trump-specific, offering Democrats a chance to stabilize and improve their performance without Trump on the ballot? Notably, the area did return to its Democratic roots in recent state Supreme Court races.",
      "The \u201cWOW\u201d counties of Washington, Ozaukee and Waukesha outside of Milwaukee have historically been the biggest vote bank in the state for Republican candidates, and all favored Trump by double digits last year. But the GOP\u2019s advantage has been receding.",
      "The GOP\u2019s declines here match the national trend of the last generation or so of highly educated, professional-class, white suburbanites shedding their previous Republican allegiance \u2014 which accelerated drastically with Trump\u2019s emergence.",
      "Even while losing ground statewide, Democrats modestly improved their performance in the WOW counties last November. In Ozaukee and Waukesha, Harris won a higher share of the vote than any Democratic presidential nominee there since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.",
      "That the Democratic gains have been particularly stark in Ozaukee is no surprise. Outside of Dane County (home of the University of Wisconsin-Madison), it has the highest concentration of white, college-educated voters in the state.",
      "Last November, Democrats were banking on even bigger gains in the WOW counties, which could have pushed Harris over the top statewide.

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/explorers-find-wreckage-ship-sank-lake-superior-130-years-ago-rcna195946",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 22:59:08 GMT",
    "summary": "Explorers have discovered the wreckage of the Western Reserve, a 300-foot freighter that sank in Lake Superior in 1892, killing 27 people aboard.",
    "story": [
      "MADISON, Wis. \u2014 Twenty years before the Titanic changed maritime history, another ship touted as the next great technological feat set sail on the Great Lakes.",
      "The Western Reserve was one of the first all-steel cargo ships to traverse the lakes. Built to break speed records, the 300-foot freighter dubbed \u201cthe inland greyhound\u201d by newspapers was supposed to be one of the safest ships afloat. Owner Peter Minch was so proud of her that he brought his wife and young children aboard for a summer joyride in August 1892.",
      "As the ship entered Lake Superior\u2019s Whitefish Bay between Michigan and Canada on Aug. 30, a gale came up. With no cargo, the ship was floating high in the water. The storm battered it until it cracked in half. Twenty-seven people perished, including the Minch family. The only survivor was wheelsman Harry W. Stewart, who swam a mile to shore after his lifeboat capsized.",
      "For almost 132 years, the lake hid the wreckage. In July, explorers from the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society pinpointed the Western Reserve off Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. The society announced the discovery Saturday at the annual Ghost Ships Festival in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a number of concurrent stories that make this important,\u201d the society\u2019s executive director, Bruce Lynn, said in a telephone interview. \u201cMost ships were still wooden. It was a technologically advanced ship. They were kind of a famous family at the time. You have this new ship, considered one of the safest on the lake, new tech, a big, big ship. [The discovery] is another way for us to keep this history alive.\u201d",
      "Search lasted more than two years",
      "Darryl Ertel, the society\u2019s marine operations director, and his brother, Dan Ertel, spent more than two years looking for the Western Reserve. On July 22, they set out on the David Boyd, the society\u2019s research vessel. Heavy ship traffic that day forced them to alter their course, though, and search an area adjacent to their original search grid, Lynn said.",
      "The brothers towed a side-scanning sonar array behind their ship. Side sonar scans starboard and port, providing a more expansive picture of the bottom than sonar mounted beneath a ship. About 60 miles northwest of Whitefish Point on the Upper Peninsula, they picked up a line with a shadow behind it in 600 feet of water. They dialed up the resolution and spotted a large ship broken in two with the bow resting on the stern.",
      "Confirmation day",
      "Eight days later, the brothers returned to the site along with Lynn and other researchers. They deployed a submersible drone that returned clear images of a portside running light that matched a Western Reserve\u2019s starboard running light that had washed ashore in Canada after the ship went down. That light was the only artifact recovered from the ship.",
      "\u201cThat was confirmation day,\u201d said Lynn, the society\u2019s executive director.",
      "Darryl Ertel said that discovery gave him chills \u2014 and not in a good way. \u201cKnowing how the 300-foot Western Reserve was caught in a storm this far from shore made a uneasy feeling in the back of my neck,\u201d he said in a society news release. \u201cA squall can come up unexpectedly\u2026anywhere, and anytime.\u201d",
      "Lynn said the ship was \u201cpretty torn up,\u201d but the wreckage appeared well-preserved in the frigid fresh water.",
      "The Great Lakes can be more dangerous than the oceans",
      "The Great Lakes have claimed thousands of ships since the 1700s. Perhaps the most famous is the Edmund Fitzgerald, an ore carrier that got caught in a storm in November 1975 and went down off Whitefish Point within 100 miles of the Western Reserve. All hands were killed. The incident was immortalized in the Gordon Lightfoot song, \u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.\u201d",
      "Assistant Wisconsin State Climatologist Ed Hopkins said that storm season on the lakes begins in November, when warm water meets cold air and winds blow unimpeded across open water, generating waves as high as 30 feet. The lakes at that time can be more dangerous than the oceans because they\u2019re smaller, making it harder for ships to out-maneuver the storms, he said.",
      "Brittle steel may have played a role in sinking",
      "But it\u2019s rare to see such gales form in August, Hopkins said. A National Weather Service report called the storm that sank the Western Reserve a \u201crelatively minor gale,\u201d he noted.",
      "A Wisconsin Marine Historical Society summary of the Western Reserve sinking noted that the maritime steel age had just begun and the Western Reserve\u2019s hull might have been weak and couldn\u2019t handle the bending and twisting in the storm. The steel also becomes brittle in low temperatures like those of Great Lakes waters. The average water temperature in Lake Superior in late August is about 60 degrees, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "The summary notes the Titanic used the same type of steel as the Western Reserve and that it may have played a role in speeding up the luxury liner\u2019s sinking."

    "story": [
      "Other men have accused the Louisiana woman linked to the death of a Super Bowl reporter of drugging and robbing them \u2014 and she shouldn\u2019t have been on probation when the reporter was found dead last month, the state\u2019s top prosecutor said.",
      "Danette Colbert, 48, was convicted in October of computer fraud, theft and illegal transmission of monetary funds in connection with a November 2021 scheme that the victim said targeted his life savings.",
      "David Butler said in court records and an interview with NBC News that Colbert left him for dead after she drugged and robbed him of more than $80,000 in cryptocurrency in New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter. He didn\u2019t get drug tested, and no charges linked to that drugging allegation were filed.",
      "Last fall, Colbert was sentenced to five years of probation and ordered to pay Butler $50,000 in restitution, court records in the case show.",
      "The Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office is working to revoke that sentence and impose a harsher one, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement Monday. She said Colbert \u201cwas not eligible for probation\u201d when she was sentenced.",
      "In the statement, Murrill noted Colbert\u2019s status as a \u201chabitual offender\u201d \u2014 a classification that allows prosecutors in the state to pursue stiffer penalties based on a defendant\u2019s criminal history.",
      "In a separate statement, Jefferson Parish District Attorney Jason Williams said he requested Murrill\u2019s help because Colbert\u2019s alleged crimes span multiple jurisdictions.",
      "\u201cI firmly believe this approach will ensure the most unified and focused prosecution of each of these serious cases,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Colbert\u2019s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A lawyer representing her in a separate case said last month that she shouldn\u2019t be judged on her criminal history.",
      "A spokesperson for the judge who handed down the sentence in November has declined to comment and directed NBC News to Butler\u2019s victim impact statement.",
      "In the statement, Butler said Colbert\u2019s \u201ccontinued disregard for others\u201d should have prompted the maximum prison sentence.",
      "Before Colbert\u2019s October conviction, she had pleaded guilty in two previous cases that involved similar allegations of fraud and theft in nearby Jefferson Parish, court records show. While she was awaiting trial in Butler\u2019s case, she was charged in Clark County, Nevada, with grand larceny and administering a drug to aid in the commission of a felony in two separate cases.",
      "According to Daniel Lippmann, the attorney who represented her, the charges in Nevada were dismissed after the victims said they didn\u2019t want to testify in court, The Associated Press reported.",
      "In two other cases, alleged victims told NBC News that they believe Colbert targeted them in October 2021 after she posed as an Uber driver in the French Quarter. The men went to authorities, according to a police report and a New Orleans police spokesperson, but no charges have been filed in either case.",
      "New Orleans police have said they investigates each and every case filed with them. A suspect has not been identified in either case.",
      "Last month, Colbert was accused of fraud and other property crimes linked to the death of the Telemundo reporter, Adan Manzano. She has been charged with simple robbery, purse snatching, computer fraud, illegal transfer of monetary funds, access device fraud and bank fraud.",
      "Manzano\u2019s body was discovered in a hotel room in Kenner, west of New Orleans, on Feb. 5, and a preliminary toxicology report showed he had a drug commonly sold under the brand Xanax in his system. He didn\u2019t have a prescription for the drug, a police investigator said at a hearing last month, and the drug was found at Colbert\u2019s Slidell home.",
      "Authorities have said Colbert could face additional charges after an autopsy and toxicology testing in the case are complete.",
      "After Manzano\u2019s death, authorities in Kenner said they fielded a dozen complaints from people who believe they or loved ones may have been victims of Colbert, including the death of a Maryland man who was found unresponsive in a French Quarter hotel room in December. That investigation continues."

    "summary": "The Trump administration is slashing the size of the Justice Department's unit that oversees prosecutions of public officials accused of corruption, three sources told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is gutting the Justice Department's unit that oversees prosecutions of public officials accused of corruption, three sources who spoke on condition of anonymity told NBC News.",
      "The unit, the Public Integrity Section, has overseen some of the country\u2019s most high-profile and sensitive prosecutions. Now, though, only a small fraction of its employees\u00a0will remain, and the unit will no longer directly handle investigations or prosecutions, two sources said.",
      "Prosecutors in the unit, which had housed dozens of employees, are being told to take details to other positions within the department. Its current cases will be reassigned to U.S. attorneys\u2019 offices around the country.",
      "David Laufman, a former head of the DOJ\u2019s counterintelligence section who served in both Republican and Democratic administrations, questioned the move.",
      "\u201cThe only reasonable interpretation of this extraordinary action is that the administration wants to transfer responsibility for public corruption cases from career attorneys at Main Justice to political appointees heading U.S. attorney\u2019s offices,\u201d Laufman said.",
      "The decision, he added, raises \u201cserious questions about whether future investigations and prosecutions will be motivated by improper partisan considerations.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department's leaders are \"taking a broad look\" at its structure, a spokesperson for the department said, but cautioned that nothing had been finalized.",
      "Throughout the 2024 campaign, President Donald Trump accused the Justice Department of conducting politically motivated criminal investigations of him. After he took office, Trump signed an executive order calling for ending the \u201cweaponization\u201d of the Justice Department and other federal law enforcement agencies.",
      "Biden administration Justice Department officials denied Trump\u2019s claims. They said that their investigations were conducted fairly and that they were caused by Trump's own actions. They also noted the convictions of multiple Democrats, including former Sen. Robert Menendez, of New Jersey, on corruption charges during President Joe Biden's term.",
      "Several officials resigned from the Public Integrity Section last month when the Justice Department moved to drop its corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "After federal prosecutors in New York refused to drop the charges, Trump appointees at Justice Department headquarters in Washington asked members of the Public Integrity Section to do so.",
      "John Keller, the acting head of the section, refused to drop the Adams charges and resigned, two sources said. Three other members of the section also resigned.",
      "The next day, Emil Bove, then the acting deputy attorney general, held a video meeting with other members of the Public Integrity Section. Bove urged one of them to sign a filing asking a judge to dismiss the charges against Adams.",
      "A senior litigation counsel with the section, Edward Sullivan, ultimately signed the filing. Sullivan decided to sign it to protect his colleagues, a person familiar with the matter said.",
      "Prosecutors noted that Trump administration Justice Department officials were not permanently dropping the charges against Adams. Instead, they were\u00a0moving to dismiss the indictment \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d a legal maneuver that\u00a0would allow federal prosecutors to restore the charges at any time \u2014 for instance, if Adams were to stop cooperating with Trump\u2019s immigration policies.",
      "Long-standing Justice Department guidelines bar prosecutors from using the\u00a0threat of federal criminal prosecution to blackmail\u00a0Americans \u2014 from ordinary citizens to powerful elected officials \u2014 into carrying out their wishes.",
      "Created in 1976 after the Watergate scandal, the Public Integrity Unit supervises investigations and prosecutions of allegations of corruption in federal, state and local government by elected and appointed officials, including judges.",
      "It also supervises investigations and prosecutions of election crimes, including voter fraud and campaign finance offenses."

      "He also said that there had been unfettered access to the evidence room, that some evidence was unusable and that any pending cases would go through a review process.",
      "At the news conference, Crocker showed photos of a hole in the wall of the room and a broomstick that he said was used to jimmy open the door.",
      "Crocker released preliminary results Monday of an audit of the evidence room. Among the missing items were: 1.5 grams of cocaine, 67 oxycodone pills, 4 Adderall pills, 0.5 grams of heroin, a .25-caliber handgun and about 30 undocumented firearms, according to a copy of the audit obtained by NBC News.",
      "\u201cThese results of the evidence audit are shocking but not surprising,\u201d Crocker wrote to the mayor in a letter Monday. \u201cThe security camera footage revealed how unsecure the evidence room was \u2014\u00a0with various individuals going in and out, routinely sticking a broomstick through the hole in the wall to gain access.\u201d",
      "Crocker also wrote in the letter that after Willingham\u2019s death, he recommended that Marlin, who was still the police chief, call the State Bureau of Investigation for assistance. But Marlin declined to do so, he said.",
      "Crocker said he then asked the State Bureau of Investigation to review Willingham\u2019s death.",
      "At the City Council meeting Monday night, some people said they welcomed the decision to rebuild the department. Others said it was unfair to employees who had done nothing wrong.",

      "Williams and Wilmore have been the focus of public attention since they launched on the first crewed test flight of Boeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft in June. Although the plan called for them to stay on the space station for roughly a week, they have now spent nine months in orbit.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked Louisiana's first execution in 15 years after lawyers for the condemned man argued a new method known as nitrogen hypoxia would violate his constitutional rights.",
      "The inmate, Jessie Hoffman Jr., 46, said the use of a mask to deliver only nitrogen gas, depriving him of oxygen, \"substantially burdens\" his ability to engage in his Buddhist breathing practices and creates \"superadded pain and suffering.\"",
      "Hoffman's execution, scheduled for March 18, was set to be the first in Louisiana using nitrogen hypoxia.",
      "Chief U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick of the Middle Louisiana District ruled in partial favor of Hoffman, writing that it is in the \"best interests of the public\" to be able to examine the state's \"newly proposed method of execution on a fully developed record.\" She said she was particularly troubled that the state released only a redacted protocol to the public until the day before the preliminary injunction hearing Friday.",
      "\"The public has paramount interest in a legal process that enables thoughtful and well-informed deliberations, particularly when the ultimate fundamental right, the right to life, is placed in the government's hands,\" she wrote.",
      "She said Hoffman cannot be executed until his claims are \"decided after a trial on the merits and a final judgment is issued.\"",
      "Attorney General Liz Murrill posted on X that \"we disagree with the district court's decision and will immediately appeal to the Fifth Circuit,\" which her office did.",
      "Hoffman's planned execution was set for a particularly busy week of executions in America, with five states, including Louisiana, expected to carry out punishment.",
      "In 1996, Hoffman was 18 when, prosecutors say, he abducted his victim, Mary Elliott, at gunpoint from a New Orleans parking garage on the night before Thanksgiving Day, forced her to withdraw $200 from an ATM, then raped and shot her to death.",
      "State Corrections Secretary Gary Westcott selected nitrogen hypoxia as Hoffman's method of execution. Last year, the state legalized the use of nitrogen gas in addition to the more widely used method of lethal injection, but officials have had trouble procuring the necessary lethal injection drugs since the state\u2019s last execution in 2010. More than 50 people are on Louisiana's death row.",
      "Alabama has had similar trouble sourcing lethal injection drugs, and last year it became the first state to administer nitrogen hypoxia. It has executed four prisoners using the method, one of them last month.",
      "Louisiana corrections officials said they traveled to Alabama to study how its nitrogen system functions. Louisiana subsequently built a nitrogen hypoxia facility at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola consisting of an execution chamber, a valve and storage room, and an observation area.",
      "The state said in a court filing Sunday that \"breathing in the mask is 'very comfortabl[e]'\" and that \"the mask is very similar, if not identical, to the one used in Alabama's system.\"",
      "At a hearing last week seeking a preliminary injunction, Hoffman testified that he began practicing Buddhism in 2002 after his grandmother died. He said he believed having a mask on his face would only worsen his trauma and claustrophobia stemming from having been locked in a closet as a young child by his brother.",
      "He said that his breathing recently helped him to remain calm when he was moved to a smaller cell in anticipation of his execution and that the surroundings \"triggered anxiety of small spaces.\"",
      "Dr. Philip Bickler, the chief of neuro-anesthesia at the University of California, San Francisco, testified that the sensation nitrogen hypoxia provides is \"very similar to drowning.\"",
      "\"I think for someone like Mr. Hoffman, nitrogen asphyxiation would be a particularly horrible method, a really inhumane choice for an individual who has a history of PTSD,\" Bickler said.",
      "The state's experts rejected the idea that death by nitrogen hypoxia would subject Hoffman to unconstitutional pain and said the \"only material dispute\" is how long it may take for him to become unconscious as he begins to breathe nitrogen.",
      "At the hearing, the state also cross-examined a Zen Buddhist priest testifying for Hoffman and noted that while she \"maintained that air is important to the practice, she was unable to identify any doctrine within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition that required oxygen in particular.\"",
      "Critics of nitrogen hypoxia have included the Louisiana group Jews Against Gassing, whose members have said the method \"echoes\" the Holocaust.",
      "Medical experts have also warned that if the procedure is not done properly, even a small amount of oxygen getting into the mask could lead to slow asphyxiation and prolong the time it would take to die.",
      "In previous nitrogen hypoxia executions, media witnesses have described inmates appearing to remain conscious longer than expected and thrashing and shaking on the gurney.",
      "Last month, Gov. Jeff Landry said Louisiana would remain undeterred.",
      "\"We will carry out these sentences and justice will be dispensed,\" he said.",
      "In opposing nitrogen hypoxia, Hoffman's lawyers offered other methods they believed would reduce his \"risk of harm,\" including a firing squad. The option is not legal in Louisiana.",
      "Last week, South Carolina executed its first inmate by firing squad after the prisoner, Brad Sigmon, chose not to die by the alternative methods lethal injection or electrocution."

      "If there was one thing President Donald Trump was supposed to represent to many voters, it was the prospect of an upturn in their economic fortunes.",
      "Yet, less than three months into his second administration, Americans are being asked to reset their expectations about the trajectory of the U.S. economy \u2014 in the near term and beyond.",
      "Rather than reignite the economy, Trump\u2019s unusual and unprecedented economic policies, like tariffs, tax cuts and spending reductions, are raising the specter of not only a recession, but also stagflation: sustained price increases, but no growth to go along with it.",
      "It would be the worst of both worlds: Consumers get hit with higher costs alongside declining employment and wages.",
      "Investors, not to mention electoral pollsters who were active in the 1970s, remain scarred by the stagflation that took root during that decade. It caused both inflation and unemployment to average around 6% for the decade, setting the stage for a period of economic \u201cmalaise\u201d in America that helped cost Democratic President Jimmy Carter a second term in the White House.",
      "The lackluster economic conditions lasted well into the first term of Carter\u2019s opponent, Ronald Reagan. Indeed, at least one commentator is already positing an analogy between Reagan and Trump as two presidents who inherited flagging economies.",
      "Charles Gasparino, a business columnist for the New York Post and a Fox News contributor, expressed the argument recently.",
      "\u201cIgnore the puke,\u201d he wrote Monday, referring to the significant market sell-off over the past week or so.",
      "Fiscal and monetary stimulus, he said, has become like \u201cheroin\u201d to the economy, Gasparino said. He compared the adjustment the United States is undergoing to the early years of Reagan\u2019s presidency.",
      "\u201cThe markets hated the uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economy experienced plenty of pain during a three-year transition when the Reaganistas cut taxes and de-emphasized government. As history shows, it all paid off for American workers and even for the fat cats in the stock market.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s an ideological argument and an emotional appeal that many mainstream economists say fails to stand up to logic or fundamentals.",
      "In a note to clients Sunday, analysts with the Evercore investment firm raised the prospect that the United States could enter a stagflationary period as a result of Trump\u2019s tariff policy and the actions of Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency. That outcome is still not a foregone conclusion, the analysts said.",
      "Others are more certain of negative consequences. Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at the Renaissance Macroeconomics research group and consultancy, said in a note that in addition to the unwinding of the post-electoral \u201cTrump bump\u201d for the economy, pre-existing negative economic trends are still playing out.",
      "Notably, he said, the jobs market continues to soften, with the share of people working part-time for economic reasons \u2014 meaning those who want more work but cannot find it \u2014 rising to a post-pandemic high of 8%, while a measure of\u00a0typical workweek hours fell to the lowest level since June 2010.",
      "\u201cIn short, there is more slack in the jobs market and that will weigh on wages and salaries,\u201d Dutta wrote.",
      "On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will report inflation data for February. Yet the Federal Reserve is already predicting the pace of price growth to remain elevated.",
      "\u201cThe path to sustainably returning inflation to our target has been bumpy, and we expect that to continue,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week."

      "And while he doesn\u2019t consider himself Mormon, he told the magazine that he still abstains from alcohol and drugs. He has, however, had coffee, which is forbidden in the religion, but doesn\u2019t enjoy it.",

      "\u201c\u200aI just think for me personally, like, dude, I would die,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019Cause I have such an addictive personality. I feel like if I started, I would do it so much that my health would just decline and I wouldn\u2019t enjoy touring as much.\u201d",
      "And when it comes to making decisions outside of his former religion, the Grammy-nominated artist said he considers his biggest weakness to be his biggest strength, which is, \u201cWhen I convince my brain of something, I have to do it. There\u2019s no backing out or stepping down.\u201d",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Boone attended Brigham Young University, a private Mormon university, for a semester before dropping out to pursue a music career.",
      "He would go on to audition for Season 19 of \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d making it to the top 24 \u2014 before also exiting the show. At the time, Boone felt that the show would hold him back than help him have a real music career.",

      "Robinson recalled, \u201cMy initial concern was that Barack would be so far out of his element that I\u2019d have to protect him on the court \u2014 not wanting him in any way to lose face. The other worry was that he might turn out to be one of those jerks who is oblivious to everyone else on the floor but himself. Almost as soon as we started playing, it was clear that I didn\u2019t have to worry about his competence.\u201d",
      "The president-to-be\u2019s performance was all Robinson needed to see to know he was \u201cgenerous,\u201d \u201cintelligent\u201d and possessed \u201cintegrity.\""

      "Vanna White has become a beloved fixture on our screens over the years, turning over letters on the \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d board night after night for more than four decades.",
      "So, it may surprise some viewers to learn that White, 68, does not actually appear in the \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d studio every weekday.",
      "In fact, all of the show\u2019s roughly 200 annual episodes are filmed over a limited number of days, she revealed in a recent interview.",
      "\u201cWe film about 34 days a year,\u201d she said during an appearance on \u201cElvis Durant and the Morning Show,\u201d causing Duran and co-host Danielle Morano to exclaim their surprise.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s it. But (we film) six shows a day. Come on,\u201d White added with a laugh. \u201cFeel bad for me.\u201d",
      "Cramming all those episodes into one day does require some speedy outfit changes.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s six different dresses a day,\u201d Monaro pointed out, to which White replied, \u201cIt is!\u201d",
      "Co-host Nate Marino teased White good-naturedly about her work schedule, asking her if this meant that she had 331 days off per year.",
      "\u201cYes, I guess so. I\u2019ve never looked at it like that,\u201d White answered.",
      "\u201cAnd no one deserves it more than you. You\u2019re just the best,\u201d Duran said.",
      "White didn\u2019t elaborate on whether those 34 days of filming are spaced out throughout the year, or whether they take place within a shorter timespan.",
      "In an interview last year with Parade, White revealed that she has dress fittings every two weeks for the show.",
      "\u201cI probably try on 40 or 50 dresses every two weeks. So for the 8,000 dresses that I\u2019ve worn, I\u2019ve tried on about 100,000,\u201d she said.",
      "White has co-hosted \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d since 1982. She appeared on the show alongside Pat Sajak until his retirement in 2024, and the pair became known for their friendship and easy chemistry on screen.",
      "\u201cI think when (show creator) Merv Griffin chose both of us ... he saw something between us \u2014 a brother-sister type relationship,\u201d White told People in 2022. \u201cAnd I think that is kind of what it is. He saw that we would be able to get along, and we do. We are like a brother and sister team.\u201d",
      "Host Ryan Seacrest replaced Sajak, 78, after he left the show.",
      "\u201cWhen they said Ryan\u2019s going to be the next one and I said, \u2018Great,\u2019\u201d White told E! News in September. \u201cBecause he\u2019s so talented, he\u2019s so professional, he\u2019s so good at what he does. I\u2019m so thankful.\u201d",
      "Seacrest has called White \u201csuper generous and sweet and kind.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe is an institution, an icon,\u201d he told People in December. \u201cShe\u2019s amazing. She\u2019s everything you think Vanna White will be when you meet her!\u201d",
      "In 2023, White extended her \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d contract, meaning she will continue on the syndicated game show through the 2025-2026 season."

      "When asked if he had ever considered dying his hair at that point, he answered, \"No, clearly I haven't. Clearly it's never been an issue or an option, I don't think it would make much sense.\"",

      "Chuck E. Cheese Entertainment CEO David McKillips explained why the furry friends are no longer at every location and if they could make a return in a recent interview with NBC News correspondent Savannah Sellers.",
      "McKillips, who has been the CEO of the company since January 2020, navigating Chuck E. Cheese through bankruptcy, corporate restructuring and the COVID-19 pandemic. After McKillips and his team received a $350 million investment, they decided to use the money to attract younger and older generations. In response, ticketing became electronic, more adult menu items were offered and new play areas with obstacle courses and trampoline zones were installed.",

It didn\u2019t align with the more modern vision, McKillips said. He revealed that there were \u201cmany meetings and debates and conversations\u201d before the decision was made to get rid of the singing group.",
      "\u201cOf course, if you think about entertainment 47 years ago, it was incredible to have the animatronic band and new music,\u201d he told Sellers. \u201cBut in reality, the animatronics were getting tired.\u201d",

      "In May 2024, The New York Times reported that fans would need to bid farewell to the animatronic band. The newspaper shared that\u00a0 Munch\u2019s Make Believe Band was being phased out by the end of 2024. At the time, the Times said only two locations, one in Los Angeles and a second in Nanuet, New York, would keep the band.",
      "A couple weeks later, the company announced that Munch\u2019s Make Believe Band would remain at three more locations \u2014 Pineville, North Carolina, Hicksville, New York and Springfield, Illinois \u2014 following public disapproval, according to the Times.",
      "The news came after the success of the horror mystery film \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s,\u201d which was based on a popular video game series and features animatronics. The film, starring Josh Hutcherson, was released in October 2023 and grossed over $290 million worldwide. Variety reported in May 2024 that a sequel will arrive in December 2025.",
      "McKillips said that the decision to remove Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s animatronics came \u201cwell before\u201d the horror movie\u2019s box office triumph. But, he acknowledged \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d did affect the restaurant chain.",
      "\u201cIt had some impact regarding the brand overall,\u201d he said about the film. \u201cObviously, the inspiration from the movie was based on, you know, the legacy of Chuck E. Cheese.\u201d",
      "Unlike the flick, however, he assured, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing scary about our animatronics whatsoever.\u201d (Sure, McKillips, sure.)",
      "So, where did the Munch\u2019s Make Believe Bands in the other hundreds of locations relocate to? McKillips only told Sellers that they went \u201caway\u201d after she asked if they were being stored in a warehouse people would not want to visit at night.",
      "He encouraged devoted Chuck E. Cheese fans who wish to see them again to visit the restaurant chain in Northridge, California for a special show.",
      "\u201cIf you get out there, it\u2019s really spectacular,\u201d McKillips said before adding that the Munch\u2019s Make Believe Band could come back to other locations in the future.",

Informed by the attorney that Khalil was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too, according to the lawyer.",
      "The arrest appears to be among the first known actions under President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to deport international students who joined the protests against the war in Gaza that swept college campuses last spring. His administration has claimed participants forfeited their rights to remain in the country by supporting Hamas, a terror organization.",
      "When ICE agents arrived at the campus building Saturday, they also threatened to arrest Khalil\u2019s wife, an American citizen who is eight months pregnant, Greer said. The authorities declined to say why Khalil was being arrested, according to the attorney.",

      "DHS can initiate deportation proceedings against green card holders for a broad range alleged criminal activity, including supporting a terror group. It would ultimately be up to an immigration judge to revoke someone\u2019s permanent resident status, according to Camille Mackler, founder of Immigrant ARC, a coalition of legal service providers in New York.",
      "\u201cThis has the appearance of a retaliatory action against someone who expressed an opinion the Trump administration didn\u2019t like,\u201d Mackler said.",
      "Khalil served as a negotiator for students as they bargained with university officials over an end to the tent encampment erected on campus last spring, a role that made him one of the most visible activists in support of the movement.",

      "NBC News has not independently verified the death toll or methods of execution.",
      "The Associated Press reported that Sunni gunmen, perhaps loyal to the government, initiated revenge killings Friday, with residents saying that Alawites were being killed in the streets or at the gates of their homes and that their houses were looted and set on fire.",

      "\u201cSyrian families across the country are yearning for a respite after long years of uncertainty and fear,\u201d he said, calling on all parties to protect civilians.",

      "The once-ruling minority is a tight-knit Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs. Under Assad, Alawites were appointed to key positions in the military and security forces, positioning them as the elite within Syria\u2019s state bureaucracy and security apparatus.",
      "The rise of HTS, a former Al Qaeda affiliate with an extremist past, raised deep concerns among the Alawite community as it took power.",
      "Sunni dominance has inflicted deep scars on the region, and minorities like the Alawites, as well as Christians, Druze and Yazidis, all have reasons to fear the rise of extremist governance.",
      "Sharaa had tried to quell such fears, telling CNN in December, \u201cNo one has the right to erase another group.\u201d",

      "What does this mean for Syria?",
      "Unifying Syria\u2019s diverse ethnic and religious groups has been one of the major challenges of a post-Assad Syria. A significant escalation of violence could threaten the country\u2019s fragile stability and at worst threaten to tip the country back into civil war should the interim government lose control of some areas.",
      "Sharaa has actively sought to rebrand himself as a unifier willing to put down his previous extremist affiliations. For a time, this strategy appeared successful, generating a surge of goodwill and optimism.",
      "In February, a video surfaced showing Sharaa waving from the sunroof of a black vehicle, surrounded by a jubilant crowd during his first visit to Latakia, where he appeared receive a hero\u2019s welcome.",
      "Internationally, the explosion of violence may derail the progress Sharaa has made in reassuring Western leaders that he can ferry in a Syria free of threats."

      "BEIJING \u2014 As President Donald Trump gave a fiery and divisive speech to a joint session of Congress last week, a much more staid political event was underway on the other side of the world.",
      "The annual gathering of the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s parliament, is tightly choreographed, with all decisions made in advance by the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Security is even tighter than usual around central Beijing and armies of volunteers wearing red armbands are stationed on street corners and at subway stations.",
      "Though there are few surprises and no debate, the weeklong National People\u2019s Congress does offer clues to China\u2019s priorities at home and how it plans to approach the world.",
      "Even as it faces a slowing economy, China appears to be making a strategic decision to present itself as a global stalwart amid a world in turmoil as Trump upends international trade and long-standing alliances, eroding U.S. prestige and creating an opportunity for China to fill the void.",
      "As if to underscore China\u2019s relative steadfastness,\u00a0Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi rarely gestured or moved his hands at his annual news conference on Friday.\u00a0He used the word \u201cstability\u201d at least 14 times during 90 minutes in front of reporters, according to Chinese transcripts.",
      "Some of his sharpest language was directed at the Trump administration, which last week doubled tariffs on Chinese imports to 20% and said there could be more to come.",
      "\u201cNo country should expect to suppress and contain China on one hand while developing good relations with China on the other,\u201d Wang said, slamming what he called a \u201ctwo-faced approach.\u201d",
      "China has long complained about U.S. tariffs, which in the first Trump administration set off a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. But at least outwardly, China doesn\u2019t appear overly concerned about the impact of the new tariffs or in a rush to placate Trump to stave off more.",
      "\u201cNobody worries about it,\u201d tech executive Yao Lijun told NBC News on Wednesday as he walked out of the Great Hall of the People, an ornate building next to Tiananmen Square in Beijing where some 3,000 Chinese leaders and lawmakers were gathered for the NPC.",
      "\u201cWe only focus on ourselves, how we can do much better,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t worry about others.\u201d",
      "China responded to the new tariff on Tuesday by announcing targeted tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. goods, mostly agricultural products, in a measured move similar to the levies it imposed when the first 10% tariff took effect last month.",
      "\u201cAppearing alarmed or alarmist is not something Beijing wants to communicate, because that\u2019s precisely what Trump is trying to elicit,\u201d said Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of politics and international relations at East China Normal University in Shanghai.",
      "Though Wang avoided saying anything too provocative on Friday, earlier in the week Beijing called back to its more aggressive \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomacy of the past, with the Foreign Ministry saying, \u201cIf war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we\u2019re ready to fight till the end.\u201d",
      "It was the harshest rhetoric from Beijing since Trump returned to office in January.",
      "The message from those comments is clear, said Wang Dong, a professor at the School of International Studies at Peking University in Beijing. China will resolutely defend its national interests, and any U.S. attempt to force it into submission \u201cwill backfire and fail,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cChina will use a \u2018tit for tat\u2019 strategy, meaning if the U.S. shifts to conflict, China will follow suit and retaliate,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the U.S. reverts back to cooperation, China will do the same.\u201d",
      "Cooperation did not appear to be on Trump\u2019s mind on Tuesday as he told Congress he would impose reciprocal tariffs on \u201cfriend and foe\u201d starting April 2.",
      "His \u201cAmerica First\u201d speech sent the message that \u201cthe U.S. only cares about its own interests and will pursue them in a relentless and ruthless manner, without caring about international rules or norms,\u201d Wang, the professor, said in written comments.",
      "He noted that Trump had withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization, both of which he touted in his address to Congress. Such moves signal the U.S. is no longer interested in upholding the liberal values and rules-based international order it has championed since the end of World War II, Prof. Wang said.",
      "\u201cBy contrast, China\u2019s message is it is willing to work with other stakeholders and the international community to tackle common global challenges such as climate change,\u201d he said.",
      "In keeping with the stability theme, Chinese officials announced the same target for economic growth as last year: 5%. Likewise, China\u2019s 2025 increase in defense spending is staying the same as last year at 7.2%.",
      "Delivering a government work report at the opening session on Wednesday, Premier Li Qiang, China\u2019s No. 2 official, did not mention Trump but noted rising unilateralism and protectionism around the world and indicated China would pursue the opposite.",
      "\u201cChina is ready to work with other members of the international community to promote an equal and orderly multipolar world,\u201d he said.",
      "Li acknowledged China\u2019s significant economic challenges, which include a persistent property crisis, high youth unemployment and sluggish consumer spending. And in a nod to U.S. tariffs and other measures, he said, \u201cAn increasingly complex and severe external environment may exert a greater impact on China in areas such as trade, science and technology.\u201d",
      "\u201cRegardless of changes in the external environment, we should remain steadfast in our commitment to opening up,\u201d Li said. \u201cWe will continue to expand our globally oriented network of high-standard free trade areas.\u201d",
      "China is counting on its trade relationships with other countries to help its export-dependent economy withstand Trump\u2019s tariffs, the cost of which U.S. and other experts say will be almost entirely passed on to American consumers and importers.",
      "\u201cTo be frank, with this kind of tariff war, both countries suffer,\u201d said Zhang Weiwei, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai and the director of its China Institute.",
      "\u201cBut the U.S. will suffer more.\u201d",
      "Janis Mackey Frayer reported from Beijing and Jennifer Jett and Peter Guo from Hong Kong."

    "story": [
      "The Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurdish-led coalition that joined with U.S. troops to fight the Islamic State terrorist group, has agreed to integrate with the same interim Syrian government forces that were previously affiliated with\u00a0Al Qaeda, officials said.",
      "The two groups struck the deal Monday after days of deadly sectarian violence between government forces and those loyal to the deposed Assad regime rocked Syria and killed hundreds of civilians.",
      "While the SDF was largely uninvolved with those clashes, it has long been opposed to both the old and the new Syrian leadership. The new truce will see two of Syria's largest warring groups join forces despite the apparently contradictory allies both previously kept.",
      "The agreement, which was reached following a meeting in Damascus on Monday between interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa and SDF leader Mazloum Abdi, will see the SDF cede control of the civil and military institutions it controls in northeastern Syria, including an airport and oil and gas fields, the Syrian government said in a statement.",
      "The deal also outlines the guarantee for the rights of all Syrians to \"representation and participation in the political process\" regardless of \"religious and ethnic backgrounds,\" a statement from the Syrian government said.",
      "The SDF's Abdi on Monday hailed the agreement as a \"real opportunity to build a new Syria.\"",
      "\"We are committed to building a better future that guarantees the rights of all Syrians and fulfils their aspirations for peace and dignity,\" he said in a post on X.",
      "The deal marks a significant step for Sharaa, who has vowed to lead a more unified and inclusive Syria representative of the country's myriad ethnic and religious groups.",
      "It could also help assuage mounting fears on the international stage that Sharaa may backslide into his former identity as a jihadist leader with links to ISIS and Al Qaeda.",
      "Those concerns had risen in recent days, with a deadly outbreak of violence across Syria killing hundreds of civilians, mostly from the Alawite community \u2014 the small Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs \u2014 according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.",
      "The pact is \"the right step forward and it\u2019s giving reassurance to Syrians and it symbolizes unity,\" said Rahaf Aldoughli, a lecturer in Middle East and North African studies at Lancaster University in England.",
      "\"Still, there are so many challenges,\" she said in a phone interview Tuesday.",
      "Sharaa has vowed to hold to account those responsible for the violence, in which attacks on security forces by Assad loyalists appeared to trigger a wave of retaliation.",
      "The eruption of the worst violence since the Assad regime was swept from power late last year highlighted the many complex challenges Sharaa faces in seeking to unify and ensure the security of a nation fractured and scarred by more than a decade of civil war.",
      "Syria's Kurds, who were denied basic rights under the Assad regime, have been among the minority groups anxiously awaiting clarity on what the future will hold under Sharaa's leadership.",
      "The deal between the SDF and the Syrian government could also help de-escalate the militia alliance's ongoing conflict with Turkey and Turkish-backed Syrian rebel groups connected to the government, though the SDF on Tuesday reported an \"unprecedented escalation of attacks\" in parts of northern and eastern Syria.",
      "Turkey did not appear to immediately comment on the deal struck between the SDF and the Syrian government. In a statement Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u00a0said his country condemned \"all kinds of attacks targeting Syria's unity, prosperity and social peace in the strongest way.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Arab neighbors welcomed news of the deal, with the Qatari Foreign Affairs Ministry calling it an \"important step towards consolidating civil peace, enhancing security and stability, and building a state of institutions and law.\""

      "New Delhi was the most polluted capital city globally, followed by N\u2019Djamena, the capital of Chad, a country in central Africa with the world\u2019s worst air pollution, according to the 2024 World Air Quality Report published Tuesday by IQAir, a Swiss air monitoring company.",
      "Ten of the 15 most polluted cities in North America, including Ontario and Bloomington, are in California as the United States reclaimed the top spot as the most polluted country in the region in 2024, the report said.",
      "India, the world\u2019s most populous country, with more than 1.4 billion people, had a 7% decline in PM2.5 concentration last year, but air pollution remains a \u201csignificant health burden\u201d that reduces life expectancy there by an estimated 5.2 years, the report said. The country\u2019s major pollution sources include industrial discharge, construction dust and the burning of crop residues.",
      "PM2.5 refers to tiny particles with diameters of 2.5 micrometers or less that can go deep into lungs and even enter the bloodstream. Deriving from emission sources such as the combustion of gasoline and oil, it is linked to premature death, heart attacks and breathing difficulties.",
      "Though the World Health Organization recommends that average annual concentrations of PM2.5 should not exceed 5 micrograms per cubic meter, only 17% of cities worldwide meet its air quality standard, the report said.",
      "Chad\u2019s PM2.5 levels were more than 18 times higher than the WHO guideline, with mineral dust in the Sahara Desert as the primary source of air pollutants. Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand and Pacific island nations, is the world\u2019s cleanest region, with 57% of cities meeting the WHO standard.",
      "Bangladesh and Pakistan, both of which neighbor India, ranked as the second and third most polluted countries. In November, air quality in Pakistan reached \u201chazardous\u201d levels because of a combination of festival celebrations, brick kiln emissions and adverse weather.",

      "While noting Chinese authorities\u2019 \u201cambitious\u201d goal to reduce the country\u2019s annual average PM2.5 concentration levels to below 25 micrograms per cubic meter, the report said that is still \u201csignificantly\u201d above the WHO guideline of 5 micrograms.",
      "A senior Chinese environmental official said last month that China aimed to effectively eliminate severe air pollution by the end of this year. China announced its \u201cwar against pollution\u201d in 2014.",
      "The report also noted the \u201cconsiderable\u201d gaps in air quality that still exist in many parts of the world. Only 21% of the world population has access to hyperlocal, real-time air quality information, according to IQAir estimates.",
      "Cambodia had no official government monitoring, while many critical regions in Africa and West Asia lack sufficient monitoring. In comparison, North America has a \u201crobust\u201d air quality monitoring infrastructure that accounts for 56% of ground-based stations.",
      "\u201cAir pollution remains a critical threat to both human health and environmental stability, yet vast populations remain unaware of their exposure levels,\u201d Frank Hammes, IQAir\u2019s global chief executive, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAir quality data saves lives,\u201d Hammes said. \u201cIt creates much needed awareness, informs policy decisions, guiding public health interventions, and empowers communities to take action to reduce air pollution and protect future generations.\u201d",
      "Last week, U.S. embassies and consulates said they had stopped monitoring\u00a0air quality\u00a0abroad, ending a program that had provided essential public health data for more than a decade.",
      "Data the United States provided in dozens of countries had led to noticeable improvements in local air quality in China and elsewhere, reducing premature deaths and generating cost savings associated with lower mortality, studies found.",
      "Air pollution accounted for 8.1 million deaths worldwide in 2021, according to the WHO.\u00a0Children under age 5 are considered especially vulnerable, with health effects including premature birth, low birth weight, asthma and lung disease."

    "summary": "With President Donald Trump setting his sights on acquiring Greenland, voters in the general election were thinking about the future status of the Arctic island.",
    "story": [
      "With President Donald Trump aggressively setting his sights on acquiring Greenland and growing calls in the territory for independence from Denmark, the future status of the Arctic island was firmly at the front of voters' minds as they headed to the polls Tuesday.",
      "Just 31 lawmakers will be elected to Greenland\u2019s parliament or Inatsisartut, but the vote, which has drawn little attention in previous years, will be watched the world over.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a different election this time around,\u201d said Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, which provides training, research and advice to Denmark\u2019s military.",
      "Politicians in Greenland had previously talked about independence from Denmark as \u201ca goal for future generations,\u201d he told NBC News in a telephone interview Monday.",
      "\"Trump\u2019s interest has made it really tangible\u201d because voters can see what independence looks like, he said. This could be close collaboration or \u201cperhaps even annexation by the U.S.\u201d and could happen in a few years, he added.",
      "While Greenland is the world\u2019s largest island, it is also one of the most sparsely populated, home to just more than 56,000 people.",
      "Controlled by Denmark for almost 300 years, it became a formal territory of the country in 1953 before gaining home rule in 1979, though Copenhagen still controls its foreign and defense policy. It also contributes just under $1 billion to Greenland's economy.",
      "Denmark has nonetheless benefited from the arrangement too, according to Dwayne Menezes, managing director of the Polar Research and Policy Initiative, a London-based think tank. Menezes  said it had \u201cprofited enormously from Greenland over the decades, not just in terms of significant economic gains, but also the geopolitical advantage it has enjoyed globally as a result.\u201d",
      "Still, Trump has repeatedly stated an interest in acquiring the island, which is technically part of North America and two-thirds of which sits above the rapidly melting Arctic Circle, where deposits of rare-earth minerals and potential offshore oil and natural gas remain largely untapped, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Having broached the issue in his first term and on multiple occasions after his return to the White House in January, in last week's lengthy speech to Congress, Trump said the United States would acquire Greenland, which is already home to an American military base, \u201cone way or the other.\u201d",
      "However, his overtures have been repeatedly rebuffed by both lawmakers in Greenland and Danish politicians.",
      "Greenlanders \u201cdeserve to be treated with respect, and I don\u2019t think the U.S. president has done that recently since he took office,\u201d Prime Minister Mute Egede told the Danish public broadcaster, DR, on Monday.",
      "Egede, whose Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) party favors a gradual transition to autonomy, added that he thought Trump\u2019s actions meant \u201cpeople don\u2019t want to get as close to (the U.S.) as they might have wanted in the past.\u201d",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has also repeatedly ruled out transferring the territory to the U.S.",
      "Greenland's citizens also seemed less than enamored with the idea. A recent poll commissioned by the Danish newspaper Berlingske and Greenlandic daily Sermitsiaq found that 85% of respondents did not wish to become a part of the U.S., with nearly half seeing Trump\u2019s interest as a threat.",
      "In a pre-emptive move to curb U.S. interference, Greenland\u2019s parliament last month passed a new law banning foreign contributions to political parties.",
      "However, some parties, like the left-wing Naleraq and the center-right Demokraatit party, have campaigned for a quick transition to full independence, along with a defense agreement with Washington that would see the island get U.S. support without becoming an American territory.",
      "Others, like the social democratic Siumut party, which has dominated the country\u2019s politics and previously shared power with Egede's IA, have previously called for an independence referendum before backtracking.",
      "Ahead of the results which are expected during the early hours of Wednesday, \u201cthe big question is whether they see this as staying status quo within the Kingdom of Denmark, or perhaps with slightly more autonomy, or the other option of having a very close relationship with the U.S.,\u201d said Rahbek-Clemmensen from the Royal Danish Defence College.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also very obvious that the choice has to be made right now,\u201d he added."

      "Norman Foster, the company's founder, said it was an umbrella that would \"harvest energy and rainwater\" and cover a public plaza twice the size of London's Trafalgar Square.",

      "The club is still one of the world's most recognizable, but those dreams have turned to nightmares for United in recent years is its fortunes have dwindled dramatically since the departure of Alex Ferguson, the team's most successful and longest-serving manager.",
      "The team is 14th in the Premier League Table after just nine wins in 28 games this season.",
      "Thousands of fans gathered outside Old Trafford on Saturday to protest against the club's ownership, the more than 1 billion pounds ($1.29 billion) of debt it holds and an increase in ticket prices.",
      "United still holds the record for the most top-flight league titles, with 20, although it may soon be forced to share the record with bitter rival Liverpool, which is behind United on 19 and is 15 points clear at the top of the Premier League table.",
      "Ferguson said in the news release: \"Old Trafford holds so many special memories for me personally, but we must be brave and seize this opportunity to build a new home, fit for the future, where new history can be made.\""
