      "Frederick Forsyth, the author of \u201cThe Day of the Jackal\u201d and other bestselling thrillers, has died after a brief illness",
      "LONDON -- Frederick Forsyth, the British author of \u201cThe Day of the Jackal\" and other bestselling thrillers, has died after a brief illness, his literary agent said Monday. He was 86.",
      "Jonathan Lloyd, his agent, said Forsyth died at home early Monday surrounded by his family.",
      "\u201cWe mourn the passing of one of the world\u2019s greatest thriller writers,\" Lloyd said.",
      "Forsyth served as a Royal Air Force pilot before becoming a foreign correspondent and a novelist. In 2015, he told the BBC that he had also worked for the British intelligence agency MI6 for many years, starting from when he covered a civil war in Nigeria in the 1960s.",
      "\u201cThe Day of the Jackal,\u201d published in 1971, propelled him into global fame. The political thriller about a professional assassin was made into a film in 1973 and more recently a television series starring Eddie Redmayne and Lashana Lynch.",
      "He wrote more than 25 books including \u201cThe Afghan,\u201d \u201cThe Kill List,\u201d \u201cThe Dogs of War\" and \u201cThe Fist of God\" that have sold over 75 million copies, Lloyd said.",
      "His publisher, Bill Scott-Kerr, said that \u201cRevenge of Odessa,\u201d a sequel to the 1974 book \u201cThe Odessa File\" that Forsyth worked on with fellow thriller author Tony Kent, will be published in August.",

    "story": [
      "Trailblazing ballerina Misty Copeland has decided to move on to what she calls \u201cthe next stage\u201d in her career",
      "NEW YORK -- Ten years ago this month, Misty Copeland sat in front of a hastily arranged news conference at American Ballet Theatre, fighting back tears of pride over her new role: principal dancer.",
      "\u201cThis is it,\u201d she said, with emotion. \u201cThis has been my dream since I was 13.\u201d",
      "The occasion was highly unusual \u2014 normally, when a dancer is promoted, a brief press release is issued. But this was Copeland, a crossover star with fame far beyond the insular world of ballet. And now she was becoming the first Black female principal in the company\u2019s 75-year history \u2014 just days after her New York debut as the lead in \u201cSwan Lake\u201d brought a refreshingly diverse, packed audience to the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "Now, a decade and many accomplishments later, Copeland is retiring from the company she joined as a teenager.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years at ABT, and I think it\u2019s time,\u201d Copeland, 42, told the Associated Press last week ahead of Monday\u2019s official announcement of her move. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to move to the next stage.\u201d",
      "The company is planning a splashy farewell on Oct. 22, featuring performances by Copeland \u2014 for the first time in five years \u2014 and other dancers. There will be speeches and film clips. And Copeland, who's been heavily involved in the planning, will get a chance to venture one more time onto that balcony in Verona; she\u2019ll dance again in the beautiful \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d pas de deux. Honorary chairs for the evening will be Caroline Kennedy and Oprah Winfrey.",
      "A lot has happened in a quarter-century. Copeland, whose success brought new energy to an art form that has always been overwhelmingly white, has authored a number of books, including a memoir and and several works for young people. The second installment of \u201cBunheads\u201d arrives in September, and more are already planned in a series she calls \u201ca reflection of my journey, showing the range of cultures and types of people that can be a part of the ballet world.\u201d",
      "Copeland has also made a short film with her production company. And her philanthropic organization, The Misty Copeland Foundation, works on increasing diversity in the dance world and giving more kids who grew up economically disadvantaged, like she did, the chance to dance.",
      "\u201cIt was so important for children growing up and seeing somebody like Misty and saying, \u2018Oh my gosh, she looks like I do,\u2019\u201d says Susan Jaffe, ABT\u2019s artistic director, who is overseeing the farewell performance. \u201cThrough her books, through her lectures, even her endorsements, she has really been a trailblazer.\"",
      "Still, progress moves slowly. When Copeland exits ABT, there will no longer be a Black female principal dancer at the company \u2014 nor at many ballet companies around the globe. Copeland discussed that continued challenge in the dance world, among other topics, in the AP interview last week. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "COPELAND: You know, I\u2019ve become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying thank you to the company. So it\u2019s a farewell. (But) it won\u2019t be the end of me dancing. \u2026 Never say never.",
      "COPELAND: I\u2019ve noticed that the conversation is not something we shy away from anymore in terms of the lack of equity, the lack of diversity in this (dance) world. That\u2019s one of the biggest shifts I\u2019ve seen \u2026 a lot of young people that just can imagine being part of it in some way. They can imagine stepping into Lincoln Center and being at the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "COPELAND: It's definitely concerning, and I think I\u2019ve just gotten to a place in my career where there\u2019s only so much I can do on a stage. There\u2019s only so much that visual representation like that can do. I feel like it\u2019s the perfect timing for me to be stepping into a new role, and hopefully still shaping and shifting the ballet world and culture.",
      "COPELAND: I think about my partnership with (former ABT principal) Roberto Bolle and him giving me so many opportunities to travel the world with him \u2026 (Former ABT principal) Marcelo Gomes, he\u2019s been such a such a big part of my journey, and of course Herman Cornejo. We\u2019ve had a beautiful partnership throughout my career and I\u2019m excited to dance with him again (at the October farewell,)",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s made me even more patient. I just have a lighter and brighter outlook on life because it\u2019s just such an incredible thing to experience and witness... I think ballet has prepared me for being a mother in so many ways. I think it\u2019s ... prepared me for life and being resilient and patient and sensitive and empathetic and strong, and all of these things.",
      "COPELAND: He doesn\u2019t understand at all! (laughs) He\u2019s seen very little of me dancing. \u2026 But he\u2019s very drawn to it. He is a mover. He\u2019s very athletic. He is so drawn to music. He started violin on Monday. We live in the museums. He really is drawn to art. I think he\u2019s definitely on the artist\u2019s track.",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s been pretty evenly split between all of then. I think it just depends on what\u2019s at the forefront and what needs my focus. ... But it\u2019s exciting to be able to utilize dance in so many different mediums, and to me, that\u2019s how you get true diversity \u2014 by giving people different entry points into learning about dance and feeling like they can be a part of it, which has been my goal. How do I bring dance to as many people as possible in a way that really works for them?",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s a difficult time. And I think all we can really do is keep our heads down and keep doing the work. \u2026 we\u2019re fortunate in that way that we\u2019ve built great relationships and can continue to do the work right now through my foundation. There\u2019s no way to stop the people that feel passionate about this work. We will continue doing it. It is so necessary for the well-being of our societies and communities. I think there are times to speak out and yell from the rooftops. And for me, I feel like this is a time to keep my head down and really stay focused and do the work.",

      "Cole Escola of \u201cOh, Mary!\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- Even the ushers at Radio City Music Hall seemed thrilled to be in the room where it happened.",
      "A few of them could be seen grooving, like everyone else at Sunday\u2019s Tony Awards, to the \u201cHamilton\u201d reunion performance \u2014 a medley of some of that blockbuster musical\u2019s biggest songs, performed by the original cast. The occasion was the 10th Broadway anniversary of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s juggernaut that spawned multiple touring companies, a West End production and a live-capture film \u2014 and is still going strong.",
      "But while the theater was buzzing to songs like \u201cMy Shot,\u201d \u201cThe Schuyler Sisters,\u201d \u201cHistory Has Its Eyes on You\u201d and \u201cThe Room Where It Happens,\u201d some people were unfortunately NOT in the room where, er, it was happening. They were the ones who\u2019d taken a trip to the bar or a stroll around the lobby, and were then held from entering until the next commercial break \u2014 missing perhaps the night\u2019s most anticipated highlight.",
      "They also missed the entire audience singing along with Jonathan Groff, aka King George, \u201cDa-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da, Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya-da.\u201d Note for next year: Exit at your own peril!",
      "Some other notable moments from Tony night:",
      "Most award winners thank Mom, their agents, their co-stars and their spouses.",
      "Cole Escola, one of the major stars of this Tony night, promised Mom a call, but also decided to thank \u201cTeebo from Grindr\u201d \u2014 the dating app \u2014 when accepting the award for lead actor in a play.",
      "Escola is star and writer of the riotous \u201cOh, Mary!\u201d \u2014 a reimagining of the life of Mary Todd Lincoln (and her beleaguered husband, Abe) that addresses the question: What if the Lincoln assassination wasn\u2019t such a bad thing for Mary? (Mary wants to be a cabaret star, you see.) The show is seeing audiences collapse in laughter for 80 minutes every night on Broadway.",
      "Escola, a downtown cabaret star, beat out high-wattage competitors like George Clooney and Daniel Dae Kim for the acting award. They mentioned their co-nominees in their speech, saying they had enjoyed sharing \u201cwarm salads\u201d at pre-awards lunches.",
      "Escola is the first nonbinary actor to win a Tony in the category.",
      "When \u201cMaybe Happy Ending\u201d writers Hue Park and Will Aronson accepted the award for best book of a musical, the first handed out, Park felt it necessary to point out that they weren\u2019t an actual couple. \u201cI am very much single,\u201d he clarified, for anyone wondering.",
      "Then later, when the duo won for best score, Park deemed a reminder necessary: \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m still single.\u201d",
      "And then at the end of the night, \u201cMaybe Happy Ending,\u201d the charming and quirky romance between decommissioned robots in a futuristic Korea, won the big prize: best musical. Park did not get the mic. But producer Jeffrey Richards did, and he reminded the crowd: \u201cHue is still single.\u201d",
      "Cynthia Erivo, the \u201cWicked\u201d star and powerhouse vocalist hosting the evening, said it first: \u201cAs they apparently say in a very fertile piece of intellectual property,\" she said with a wink, \u201cthere\u2019s no place like home. And Broadway has always been mine.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a familiar theme on Tony night: the theater community as a welcoming haven for those who may feel different or unseen. It was echoed by Harvey Fierstein, winner of a lifetime achievement award, describing how he joined the theater after being welcomed by a company in Brooklyn. And it was expressed very emotionally by Nicole Scherzinger, winning best actress in a musical for \u201cSunset Blvd.\u201d",
      "\u201cGrowing up, I always felt like I didn\u2019t belong,\u201d said Scherzinger, former lead singer of the pop group Pussycat Dolls who plays Norma Desmond in the minimalist version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber show. \u201cBut you all have made me feel like I belong, and I have come home at last.\u201d Those last words echo the lyrics of one of Desmond\u2019s big numbers, \u201cAs If We Never Said Goodbye.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo if there\u2019s anyone out there who feels like they don\u2019t belong, or your time hasn\u2019t come, don\u2019t give up,\u201d Scherzinger continued. \u201cJust keep on giving and giving because the world needs your love and your light now more than ever.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s always lots of chatter going on during an awards show. But the way the crowd quieted down during Audra McDonald\u2019s powerful, agonized performance of \u201cRose\u2019s Turn\u201d from \u201cGypsy\u201d was striking. In the song's quiet moments, you heard utter silence in the vast room.",
      "McDonald, the Tonys' most awarded actor, is clearly revered by the theater community, who cheered her with standing ovations. But the award she was up for went to Scherzinger.",
      "It\u2019s been two years since HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession\u201d ended, but its stars keep turning up at awards shows \u2014 and often winning. Jeremy Strong won a Tony last year and was nominated for an Oscar this year. Kieran Culkin won an Oscar this year and is appearing on Broadway this season, though he wasn\u2019t nominated. And now it was the turn of Sarah Snook \u2014 Emmy and Golden Globe winner \u2014 to win a Tony.",
      "Snook, who played mercurial sibling Shiv Roy in the series, took the Tony for best actress in a play for \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray,\u201d in which she plays all 26 roles.",
      "Tony winner and musical theater regular Gavin Creel, who died last year of cancer, was a friend to many in the theater community, and was remembered more than once on Tony evening.",
      "During the early pre-show, actor Celia Keenan-Bolger was honored with the Isabelle Stevenson award, for her advocacy work in the arts. She spoke movingly of her deep friendship with Creel and their advocacy work together.",
      "Later, singer and actor Sara Bareilles performed a soulful duet of \u201cTomorrow\u201d from \u201cAnnie,\u201d harmonizing with Erivo, during the memorial segment. That segment ended with a photo of Creel, also a dear friend to Bareilles, who teared up.",
      "Both Bareilles and Keenan-Bolger are involved with the Gavin Creel Fellowship, an initiative that plans to provide $25,000 grants to five emerging theater actors each year.",
      "The final award had been announced by presenter Miranda \u2014 best musical to \u201cMaybe Happy Ending\u201d \u2014 and the audience started to disperse. But Erivo had another idea.",
      "Riffing on the concept of leaving, she launched into the famous \u201cDreamgirls\u201d ballad \u201cAnd I Am Telling You I\u2019m Not Going\u201d \u2014 with rewritten lyrics.",
      "It was a yet another powerhouse performance from someone who has one of the best voices on the planet. The audience stopped dispersing \u2014 and started cheering.",

      "Most big collections have only a fraction of their items on display, with the rest locked away in storage",
      "LONDON -- A museum is like an iceberg. Most of it is out of sight.",
      "Most big collections have only a fraction of their items on display, with the rest locked away in storage. But not at the new V&A East Storehouse, where London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum has opened up its storerooms for visitors to view \u2014 and in many cases touch \u2014 the items within.",
      "The 16,000-square-meter (170,000-square-foot) building, bigger than 30 basketball courts, holds more than 250,000 objects, 350,000 books and 1,000 archives. Wandering its huge, three-story collections hall feels like a trip to IKEA, but with treasures at every turn.",
      "The V&A is Britain\u2019s national museum of design, performance and applied arts, and the storehouse holds aisle after aisle of open shelves lined with everything from ancient Egyptian shoes to Roman pottery, ancient Indian sculptures, Japanese armor, Modernist furniture, a Piaggio scooter and a brightly painted garbage can from the Glastonbury Festival.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 5,000 years of creativity,\u201d said Kate Parsons, the museum\u2019s director of collection care and access. It took more than a year, and 379 truckloads, to move the objects from the museum\u2019s former storage facility in west London to the new site.",
      "In the museum\u2019s biggest innovation, anyone can book a one-on-one appointment with any object, from a Vivienne Westwood mohair sweater to a tiny Japanese netsuke figurine. Most of the items can even be handled, with exceptions for hazardous materials, such as Victorian wallpaper that contains arsenic.",
      "The Order an Object service offers \u201ca behind-the-scenes, very personal, close interaction\u201d with the collection, Parsons said as she showed off one of the most requested items so far: a 1954 pink silk taffeta Balenciaga evening gown. Nearby in one of the study rooms were a Bob Mackie-designed military tunic worn by Elton John on his 1981 world tour and two silk kimonos laid out ready for a visit.",
      "Parsons said there has been \u201ca phenomenal response\u201d from the public since the building opened at the end of May. Visitors have ranged from people seeking inspiration for their weddings to art students and \u201csomeone last week who was using equipment to measure the thread count of an 1850 dress.\u201d She says strangers who have come to view different objects often strike up conversations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just wonderful,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cYou never quite know. \u2026 We have this entirely new concept and of course we hope and we believe and we do audience research and we think that people are going to come. But until they actually did, and came through the doors, we didn\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "The V&A\u2019s flagship museum in London\u2019s affluent South Kensington district, founded in the 1850s, is one of Britain\u2019s biggest tourist attractions. The Storehouse is across town in the Olympic Park, a post-industrial swath of east London that hosted the 2012 summer games.",
      "As part of post-Olympic regeneration, the area is now home to a new cultural quarter that includes arts and fashion colleges, a dance theater and another V&A branch, due to open next year. The Storehouse has hired dozens of young people recruited from the surrounding area, which includes some of London\u2019s most deprived districts.",
      "Designed by Diller, Scofidio and Renfro, the firm behind New York\u2019s High Line park, the building has space to show off objects too big to have been displayed very often before, including a 17th-century Mughal colonnade from India, a 1930s modernist office designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and a Pablo Picasso-designed stage curtain for a 1924 ballet, some 10 meters (more than 30 feet) high.",
      "Also on a monumental scale are large chunks of vanished buildings, including a gilded 15th-century ceiling from the Torrijos Palace in Spain and a slab of the concrete fa\u00e7ade of Robin Hood Gardens, a demolished London housing estate.",
      "Not a hushed temple of art, this is a working facility. Conversation is encouraged and forklifts beep in the background. Workers are finishing the David Bowie Center, a home for the late London-born musician\u2019s archive of costumes, musical instruments, letters, lyrics and photos that is due to open at the Storehouse in September.",
      "One aim of the Storehouse is to expose the museum\u2019s inner workings, through displays delving into all aspects of the conservators\u2019 job \u2013 from the eternal battle against insects to the numbering system for museum contents \u2014 and a viewing gallery to watch staff at work.",
      "The increased openness comes as museums in the U.K. are under increasing scrutiny over the origins of their collections. They face pressure to return objects acquired in sometimes contested circumstances during the days of the British Empire",
      "Senior curator Georgia Haseldine said the V&A is adopting a policy of transparency, \u201cso that we can talk very openly about where things have come from, how they ended up in the V&A\u2019s collection, and also make sure that researchers, as well as local people and people visiting from all around the world, have free and equitable access to these objects.",
      "\u201cOn average, museums have one to five percent of their collections on show,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is saying, \u2018No, this whole collection belongs to all of us. This is a national collection and you should have access to it.\u2019 That is our fundamental principle.\u201d",

      "Filmmaker Dean DeBlois returns to the world of \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d for a new live-action adaptation, in theaters Friday",
      "Ever wanted to soar through the skies on the back of a friendly dragon? The new \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d may be the ticket, from a decidedly safer, though possibly still vertigo-inducing, distance.",
      "This live-action adaption of the underdog adventure story sends the audience cascading through the clouds with the teenage Viking boy Hiccup and his dragon friend Toothless. It\u2019s the kind of immersive sensation and giddy wish fulfillment that might just have you forgetting momentarily to breathe and, maybe more importantly, that you\u2019re still in a movie theater. Credit to veteran cinematographer Bill Pope, no stranger to fantasy worlds, whether it\u2019s \u201cThe Matrix\u201d or \u201cScott Pilgrim vs. The World.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d doesn\u2019t stray far from the original, from shots to story beats. Gerard Butler once again plays Berk\u2019s Chief Stoick the Vast. The new Hiccup, actor Mason Thames, even sounds a bit like Jay Baruchel. But unlike so many live-action remakes of animated films, it also doesn\u2019t feel superfluous, or, worse, like a poor imitation of its predecessor that trades the magic of animation for photorealism.",
      "Perhaps that\u2019s because filmmaker Dean DeBlois, who made the three animated films, stayed in the director\u2019s chair. Who better to kill their darlings than the one who brought them to the screen in the first place? And, crucially, to know where live-action might actually enhance the fabric of the world created by author Cressida Cowell.",
      "It helps that dragon technology has come a long way since, say, \u201cDragonHeart.\u201d These fire-breathing CG creatures feel disarmingly real. And though it might look like \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d or \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the tone stays light enough for younger filmgoers. There are a few intense sequences, but none that takes it any further than the animated film did 15 years ago.",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d does start a little slow, however, which is odd because it also begins with a fiery battle between the Vikings and the dragons on the Isle of Berk. There\u2019s a lot of exposition and introduction that needs to happen before you can just give yourself over to the story. In this more multicultural version, the warriors on Berk have been recruited from tribes around the globe to try to defeat the dragons.",
      "Hiccup is a Viking nepo baby. As the chief's son, he sits in a place of privilege, but he\u2019s also a general outcast in this world of ruthless warriors \u2014 skinny and weak, he just longs to be part of the action, not sharpening the weapons. Killing dragons is currency in this society, and his crush Astrid (Nico Parker) happens to be one of the most promising up-and-comers. His sole champion is Gobber (a delightful Nick Frost), the blacksmith and dragon slayer teacher, who convinces the chief to give the clever Hiccup a shot.",
      "The film finds its internal engine when Hiccup finds Toothless, the wide-eyed \u201cNight Fury\u201d dragon whom he can\u2019t bring himself to kill. Instead, he decides to study this discovery, who he finds is not as nearly fearsome as everyone assumes. \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d teaches empathy and ingenuity without a sermon.",
      "Thames, a teenager himself, is the perfect embodiment of adolescent awkwardness and boldness. You can have all the cute dragons you want, but the audience would be lost if the human conduit to the relationship isn\u2019t up to the task. Butler seems to be having a good time, resplendent in fur and chest-thumping ideas about ancient duties. And Parker gives Astrid a relatable depth \u2014 the best in the bunch who is outshone in an unequal fight.",
      "Kids deserve movies that are made on the biggest possible canvas. \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d is one that's worth the trip to the theater. It might just spark some young imaginations, whether it\u2019s to go back and read the books or dream up their own worlds. And, chances are, no one is going to be yelling \u201cchicken jockey.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csequences of intense action and peril.\u201d Running time: 125 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

      "In the box office showdown between a deadly assassin and a chaotic CG alien, \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d still had the edge. The Disney juggernaut celebrated a third weekend at the top of the charts, while the John Wick spinoff \u201cBallerina\u201d did not jet\u00e9 as high as expected.",
      "According to studio estimates Sunday, \u201cFrom the World of John Wick: Ballerina\u201d earned $25 million from 3,409 theaters in the U.S. and Canada. Several weeks ago it was tracking to open in the $35 to $40 million range, but that was adjusted down several times. Ultimately, it still came in lower than forecasts. The movie, directed by Len Wiseman, makes a sideline character out of Keanu Reeves\u2019 John Wick and focuses on Ana de Armas. It takes place during the events of \u201cJohn Wick 3.\u201d",
      "The box office performance is a bit perplexing result considering that \u201cBallerina\u201d got good critic reviews and audience exit polls. Conventional wisdom would say that word of mouth might have given it a boost over the weekend. But, recently, opening weekend isn\u2019t the end all that it used to be. \u201cBallerina\u201d could be in the game for the long haul.",
      "The Lionsgate release, a Thunder Road Films and 87Eleven Entertainment production, had a hefty production price tag reported to be in the $90 million range. But much of that cost has already been offset by foreign pre-sales. Internationally, it earned $26 million from 82 countries, bringing its global opening to $51 million.",
      "As the first spinoff, it\u2019s the second lowest opening of the five-film franchise \u2013 above only the first film which opened just over $14 million in 2014, which does not account for inflation. The franchise overall has grossed more than $1 billion worldwide.",
      "First place once again went to \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d which added another $32.5 million in North America, bringing its domestic total to $335.8 and global tally to $772.6 million. In just 17 days, it's already made more domestically than the live-action \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d did in its entire run ($298 million).",
      "\u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 The Final Reckoning\u201d slid to third place with $15 million, bringing its worldwide total to $450.4 million. \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d earned $8.7 million to take fourth place. And \u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines\" rounded out the top five with $6.5 million.",
      "The new Wes Anderson movie \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d expanded beyond New York and Los Angeles to 1,678 theaters nationwide. The Focus Features release starring Benicio del Toro made an estimated $6.3 million and landed in sixth place.",

      "Audra McDonald, the most recognized performer in the theater awards\u2019 history, could possibly extend her Tony lead.

      "Edmund White, a pioneer of contemporary gay literature, died this week at age 85",
      "NEW YORK -- Andrew Sean Greer, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist, remembers the first time he read Edmund White. It was the summer of 1989, he was beginning his second year at Brown University and he had just come out.",
      "Having learned that White would be teaching at Brown, he found a copy of White's celebrated coming-of-age novel, \u201cA Boy's Own Story.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never read anything like it \u2014 nobody had \u2014 and what strikes me looking back is the lack of shame or self-hatred or misery that imbued so many other gay male works of fiction of that time,\u201d says Greer, whose \u201cLess\u201d won the Pulitzer for fiction in 2018. \"I, of course, did not know then I was reading a truly important literary work. All I knew is I wanted to read more.",
      "\u201cReading was all we had in those days \u2014 the private, unshared experience that could help you explore your private life,\" he said. \"Ed invented so many of us.\"",
      "White, a pioneer of contemporary gay literature, died this week at age 85. He left behind such widely read works as \u201cA Boy\u2019s Own Story\u201d and \u201cThe Beautiful Room Is Empty\u201d and a gift to countless younger writers: Validation of their lives, the discovery of themselves through the stories of others.",
      "Greer and other authors speak of White's work as more than just an influence, but as a rite of passage: \"How a queer man might begin to question all of the deeply held, deeply religious, deeply American assumptions about desire, love, and sex \u2014 who is entitled to have it, how it must be had, what it looks like,\u201d says Robert Jones Jr., whose novel above love between two enslaved men, \u201c The Prophets,\u201d was a National Book Award finalist in 2021.",
      "Jones remembers being a teenager in the 1980s when he read \u201dA Boy's Own Story.\" He found the book at a store in a gay neighborhood in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, \u201cthe safest place for a person to be openly queer in New York City,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt was a scary time for me because all the news stories about queer men revolved around AIDS and dying, and how the disease was the Christian god\u2019s vengeance against the 'sin of homosexuality,'\u201d Jones added.",
      "\u201cIt was the first time that I had come across any literature that confirmed that queer men have a childhood; that my own desires were not, in fact, some aberration, but were natural; and that any suffering and loneliness I was experiencing wasn\u2019t divine retribution, but was the intention of a human-made bigotry that could be, if I had the courage and the community, confronted and perhaps defeated,\" he said.",
      "Starting in the 1970s, White published more than 25 books, including novels, memoirs, plays, biographies and \u201cThe Joy of Gay Sex,\u201d a response to the 1970s bestseller \u201cThe Joy of Sex.\" He held the rare stature for a living author of having a prize named for him, the Edmund White Award for Debut Fiction, as presented by the Publishing Triangle.",
      "\u201cWhite was very supportive of young writers, encouraging them to explore and expand new and individual visions,\u201d said Carol Rosenfeld, chair of the Triangle. The award was \u201cone way of honoring that support.\u201d",
      "Winners such the prize was founded, in 2006, have included \u201cThe Prophets,\u201d Myriam Gurba 's \u201cDahlia Season\u201d and Joe Okonkwo's \u201cJazz Moon.\u201d Earlier this year, the award was given to Jiaming Tang's \u201c Cinema Love,\u201d a story of gay men in rural China.",
      "Tang remembered reading \u201cA Boy's Own Story\u201d in his early 20s, and said that both the book and White were \u201cessential touchpoints in my gay coming-of-age.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe writes with intimate specificity and humor, and no other writer has captured the electric excitement and crushing loneliness that gay men experience as they come of age,\u201d Tang said. \"He\u2019s a towering figure. There\u2019d be no gay literature in America without Edmund White.\u201d",

      "Pablo Cruz, who plays Chespirito in the series, told The Associated Press in an interview translated from Spanish that the show is a tribute that tells \u201ca story that we know will connect with a very broad audience and give them an opportunity to further appreciate what they already admire and love.\u201d",
      "Chespirito's two most famous characters were \u201cEl Chavo del Ocho\u201d (\"The Boy from Number Eight\u201d) and \u201cEl Chapulin Colorado\u201d (\u201cThe Crimson Grasshopper\u201d). \u201cEl Chavo del Ocho\" was an 8-year-old boy orphan living alone in a Mexican neighborhood with his barrel, freckles, striped shirt and grayed cap. \u201cEl Chapulin Colorado\u201d was a naive superhero dressed in a red bodysuit and hood with antennae that helped him detect danger miles away (despite the name, his yellow shorts and boots gave him more the look of a red bumblebee).",
      "Through his characters, Chespirito favored a clean comedy style far removed from the sexual innuendo and obscenity-laced jokes popular today. His morning shows were a staple for preschoolers, much like \u201cCaptain Kangaroo\u201d was in the United States.",
      "The HBO series \u201cis a tribute to Chespirito\u2019s importance as one of the key figures in Mexican television and highlights the enormous impact his television programs had throughout Latin America,\u201d Fernando C\u00e1rdenas, digital manager for the Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors, said in a statement to the AP.",
      "The miniseries is a powerful act of cultural preservation, one that documents the impact Latinos have had on the global entertainment industry, said Sehila Mota Casper, director of Latinos in Heritage Conservation.",
      "\u201cFor so many of us, his characters weren\u2019t just entertainment,\u201d Mota Casper said. \u201cThey shaped how we understand humor, how we face challenges and how we see ourselves as Latinxs. This series honors that impact. By telling his story in this way, we help make sure the cultural histories that shaped us are seen, respected and carried forwards to future generations.\u201d",
      "\u201cEl Chavo\u201d proved so popular that reruns are still shown in multiple countries in Latin America and on Spanish-language television in the United States. Many Latin Americans, living under dictatorships during the height of the show, found his underdog triumphs heroic in the face of authority. In a 2005 interview with the Mexican newspaper La Jornada, G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os said he always wrote with working-class people in mind.",
      "\u201cDuring the 1970s, the program was produced to reflect the reality of working-class families in Mexico and enjoyed enormous impact in other Spanish-speaking countries because the situations portrayed in the stories were similar to those of all audiences, regardless of geographical boundaries,\u201d C\u00e1rdenas said.",
      "Alberto Lammers, who grew up watching \u201cEl Chavo\u201d in Peru during the 1970s and \u201880s, was excited for the series and the childhood nostalgia it evokes. He was also excited to learn more about what was happening behind the scenes in G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os\u2019 life.",
      "\u201cIt really struck a chord with my childhood,\u201d Lammers, who now lives in California, said after finishing the first episode. \u201cIt gives heart and context to his complexity and the characters he built. It\u2019s also a very interesting look at how he became a TV personality. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing where it goes! It\u2019s a real-life telenovela!\u201d",
      "Fans also took to social media to praise the episode and their awe at the uncanny similarities between the actors and the people they are playing.",
      "For Lammers, after migrating to the U.S., \u201cEl Chavo del Ocho\u201d served as a connection to his roots even if the show wasn't based in Peru.",
      "\u201cGoing to that show to me was actually very comforting,\u201d Lammers said. \u201cIt built a sense of community across most of Latin America.\u201d",

      "A judge has denied Harvey Weinstein\u2019s request for a mistrial after a juror complained of issues in the deliberations",
      "NEW YORK -- A juror in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sex crimes trial asked to be removed from the case Friday because he felt his fellow jurors were treating a member of their panel in an \u201cunfair and unjust\u201d way, but the judge told him he had to keep deliberating.",
      "Judge Curtis Farber later denied a defense request for a mistrial, saying he believed the juror was simply expressing discomfort in the deliberation process, noting that he\u2019s the youngest on the 12-person panel.",

      "The second day of deliberations ended Friday without a verdict. Jurors are expected back in court Monday.",
      "Jurors reheard testimony from Weinstein\u2019s three accusers. They also reviewed other evidence, including medical records and emails.",
      "Twice on Friday, though, a juror requested to address the court without the other jurors present.",
      "The juror said he wanted to be excused from the trial because he was uncomfortable with how some jurors were acting toward another juror.",
      "But Farber denied the request, saying there were no more alternate jurors to replace him and, in any case, his concerns did not warrant being dismissed.",
      "The juror insisted, calling the treatment \u201cunfair and unjust\u201d even as he described the tension as \u201cplayground stuff\u201d with jurors shunning another juror and talking behind their back.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyer Arthur Aidala argued that the jury should be told to stop deliberating while the court found out more about the concerns.",
      "He criticized the judge\u2019s questions to the concerned juror as \u201canemic at best.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask him one follow-up question,\u201d Aidala said.",

      "The blockbuster horror film \u201cSinners\u201d features the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians in a short, but impactful scene",
      "CHOCTAW, Miss. -- It\u2019s a small part in a big movie, but for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, their scene in \"Sinners\" is a huge deal.",
      "The horror movie blockbuster, starring Michael B. Jordan as a gangster turned vampire slayer, paints a brief but impactful portrait of the tribe using Choctaw actors and cultural experts. For some, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve seen the Choctaw way of life accurately portrayed on the big screen.",
      "In the scene, a posse of Choctaw, riding on horseback and in an old truck, arrives at a small farmhouse to warn the couple that lives there of coming danger. When the couple refuses their help, a Choctaw man wishes them luck in his native language before riding off.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve not seen another movie that has our language, like, spoken correctly,\u201d said Cynthia Massey, a cultural consultant for \u201cSinners.\u201d",
      "Massey runs the tribe\u2019s Chahta Immi Cultural Center alongside Sherrill Nickey and department director Jay Wesley. All three were hired as cultural consultants to ensure a genuine depiction of the tribe in the film. Together, they sifted through archives, researching how their ancestors would have dressed, spoken and acted in the 1930s, when \u201cSinners\u201d takes place.",
      "\u201cI was honored and humbled by the fact that they wanted a true representation,\u201d said Wesley, who also acted in the movie.",
      "Wesley connected the filmmakers to Choctaw actors and artifacts like the beaded sashes the Choctaw characters wear in the movie. Those sashes are now part of a \u201cSinners\u201d display at the cultural center.",
      "The movie's introduction also features a short snippet of a Choctaw war chant, performed by Wesley\u2019s daughter, Jaeden Wesley, who is a student at the University of California, Los Angeles. While recording, Jaeden Wesley said the filmmakers told her they wanted the Choctaw people to hear their music in the movie.",
      "\u201cWe were catering to our own people, even in that short little second,\u201d Jaeden Wesley said.",
      "Shining a spotlight on often overlooked cultures and topics, like the Choctaw people, is part of the mission at Proximity Media, which produced \u201cSinners.\u201d The company was founded by \u201cSinners\u201d director Ryan Coogler, his wife and film producer, Zinzi Coogler, and producer Sev Ohanian.",
      "\u201cIt was never a question for us that if we were going to portray the Mississippi Choctaw, we got to have the right people who can tell us, who can tell Ryan, what we\u2019re not knowing, what we\u2019re not thinking,\u201d Ohanian said. \u201cIt was all because we\u2019re trying to serve Ryan\u2019s story of like putting truth on screen.\"",
      "Ohanian and his co-founders didn\u2019t stop with Choctaw consultants; they enlisted a small army of experts who advised on the confluence of cultures mingling in the Mississippi Delta, where the film is set. The resulting cinematic world was so well received, community organizers penned an open letter, inviting Coogler and his fellow filmmakers to visit the Delta. Last week, the Cooglers, Ohanian and others took up the offer, attending a \u201cSinners\u201d screening in Clarksdale, Mississippi. Clarksdale is where the film's events unfold.",
      "\u201cI hope this encourages other filmmakers to find opportunities to be authentic in their storytelling and to look at this rich tapestry of culture that\u2019s right here in America,\u201d Ohanian said, noting the film industry has historically misrepresented nonwhite groups.",
      "For Wesley and his fellow consultants, the hope is the film will cultivate curiosity in audiences, encourage them to learn more about Choctaw culture and visit the Chahta Immi Cultural Center.",
      "\u201cIt's important to be connected to this culture because this was here before the public was here,\u201d Massey said. \u201cProbably three-quarters of Mississippi was Choctaw land, and now we only have 350,000 acres.\u201d",
      "They say Choctaw participation in the film has cultivated a sense of pride among tribe members. Nickey hopes it will encourage a sort of cultural renaissance at a time when she says fewer and fewer Choctaw speak their native language.",
      "\u201cI know for a fact that there are a lot of kids out there that don't even know how to speak our language. They only speak English,\u201d Nickey said. \u201cI hope they know it's okay to speak our language.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Years before Ana de Armas was using an ice skate to slice a neck in \u201cFrom the World of John Wick: Ballerina,\u201d she co-starred with Keanu Reeves in a much different film.",
      "The erotic thriller \u201cKnock Knock,\u201d released in 2015, was de Armas\u2019 first Hollywood film. De Armas, born and raised in Cuba, had just come to Los Angeles after acting in Spain. English was new to her, so she had to learn her lines phonetically.",
      "\u201cIt was tough and I felt miserable at times and very lonely,\u201d she says in an interview. \u201cBut I wanted to prove myself. I remember being in meetings with producers and they would be like, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll see you in a year when you learn English.\u2019 Before I left the office, I would say, \u2018I\u2019ll see you in two months.\u2019\u201d",
      "Since \u201cKnock Knock,\u201d her rise to stardom has been one of the last decade's most meteoric. She was radiant even as a hologram in \u201cBlade Runner 2049.\u201d She stole the show in Rian Johnson\u2019s star-studded \u201cKnives Out.\u201d She breezed through the Bond movie \u201cNo Time to Die.\u201d She was Oscar nominated for her Marilyn Monroe in \u201cBlonde. \u201d",
      "And now, 10 years after those scenes with Reeves, de Armas is for the first time headlining a big summer action movie. In \u201cBallerina,\u201d in theaters Friday, de Armas\u2019 progressive development as an unlikely action star reaches a butt-kicking crescendo, inheriting the mantle of one of the most esteemed, high-body-count franchises.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big moment in my career, and I know that. I can see that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes me look back in many ways, just being with Keanu in another film in such a different place in my career. It definitely gives me perspective of the journey and everything since we met. Things have come far since then.\u201d",
      "While de Armas, 37, isn\u2019t new to movie stardom, or the tabloid coverage that comes with it, many of her career highlights have been streaming releases. \u201cThe Gray Man\u201d and \u201cBlonde\u201d were Netflix. \u201cGhosted\u201d was Apple TV+. But \u201cBallerina\u201d will rely on de Armas (and abiding \u201cJohn Wick\u201d fandom) to put moviegoers in seats.",
      "Heading in, analysts expected an opening weekend of around $35-40 million, which would be a solid result for a spinoff that required extensive reshoots. Reviews, particularly for de Armas playing a ballerina-assassin, have been good.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure,\u201d says director Len Wiseman. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to carry all on her shoulders. But she\u2019ll be the first person to tell you: \u2018Put it on. Let me carry the weight. I\u2019m totally game.\u2019\u201d",
      "De Armas, whose talents include the ability to be present and personable on even the most frenzied red carpets, has done the globe-trotting work to make \u201cBallerina\u201d a big deal: appearing at CinemaCon, gamely eating hot wings and cheerfully deflecting questions about her next film, \u201cDeeper,\u201d with Tom Cruise.",
      "Yet for someone so comfortable in the spotlight, one of the more interesting facts about de Armas is that she lives part time in that bastion of young A-listers: Vermont.",
      "\u201cYeah, it surprised many people,\u201d she says, chuckling. \u201cAs soon as I went up there, I knew that was going to be a place that would bring me happiness and sanity and peace. But I know for a Cuban who doesn\u2019t like cold very much, it\u2019s very strange.\u201d",
      "Winding up in northern New England is just as unexpected as landing an action movie like \u201cBallerina.\u201d She grew up with the conviction, from age 12, that she would be an actor. But she studied theater.",
      "\u201cI never thought I was going to do action,\u201d de Armas says. \u201cWhat was relatable for me was watching Cuban actors on TV and in movies. That was my reality. That\u2019s all I knew, so the actors I looked up to were those.\u201d",
      "De Armas also had bad asthma, which makes some of the things she does in \u201cBallerina\u201d \u2014 a movie with a flamethrower duel \u2014 all the more remarkable to her.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t run. I sometimes couldn\u2019t play with my friends. I had to just be home and be still so I wouldn\u2019t get an asthma attack. So I never thought of myself as someone athletic or able to run just a block. So this has been a surprise.\u201d",
      "At 14, she auditioned and got into Havana\u2019s National Theatre of Cuba. Four years later, with Spanish citizenship through her grandparents, she moved to Madrid to pursue acting. When she arrive in LA in 2014, she had to start all over again.",
      "Now as one of the top Latina stars in Hollywood, she's watched as immigrant paths like hers have grow increasingly arduous if not impossible. The day after she spoke to The Associated Press, the Trump administration announced a travel ban on 12 countries and heavy restrictions on citizens of other countries, including Cuba.",
      "\u201cI got here at a time when things were definitely easier in that sense,\u201d says de Armas, who announced her then-imminent U.S. citizenship while hosting \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in 2023. \u201cSo I just feel very lucky for that. But it\u2019s difficult. Everything that\u2019s going on is very difficult and very sad and really challenging for many people. I definitely wish things were different.\u201d",
      "Chad Stahelski, director of the four \u201cJohn Wick\u201d films and producer of \u201cBallerina,\u201d was about to start production on \u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 4\u201d when producer Basil Iwanyk and Nathan Kahane, president of Lionsgate, called to set up a Zoom about casting de Armas. He quickly watched every scene she had been in.",
      "\u201cHow many people would have played the Bond girl kind of goofy like that?\u201d he says. \u201cI know that I can harden people up. I know I can make them the assassin, but getting the charm and the love and the humor out of someone is trickier. But she had it.\u201d",
      "In \u201cKnives Out,\u201d Stahelski saw someone who could go from scared and uncertain to a look of \u201cI'm going to stab you in the eye.\u201d",
      "\u201cI like that in my action heroes,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the stoic, superhero vibe where everything\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d",
      "But it wasn\u2019t just her acting or her charisma that convinced Stahelski. It was her life story.",
      "\u201c'John Wick' is all hard work \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean just in the training. You\u2019ve got to love it and put yourself out there,\u201d says Stahelski. \u201cWhen you get her story about how she came from the age of 12, got into acting, what she sacrificed, what she did, that\u2019s what got my attention. \u2018Oh, she\u2019s a perseverer. She doesn\u2019t just enjoy the view, she enjoys the climb.\u2019\u201d",
      "When that quote is read back to her, de Armas laughs, and agrees.",
      "\u201cBeing Cuban, and my upbringing and my family and everything I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ve never had a plan B,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never had that thing of, \u2018Well, if it doesn\u2019t work, my family can help.\u2019 Or, \u2018I can do this other career.\u2019 This was it. And I also knew, besides being the thing I loved the most, this was my survival. This is how I live. This is how I feed myself and my family. So it\u2019s also a sense of, I don\u2019t know, responsibility.\u201d",
      "That makes her reflect back to when she was just trying to make it in Hollywood, sounding out words, trying not to disappoint directors whose instructions she could barely understand, trying not to be intimidated by the action star across from her who had just finished shooting the first \u201cJohn Wick.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was so committed to do it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was so invested in the trying of it, just giving it a shot. When I give something a shot, I try my best, whatever that is. Then I can actually say: I gave it a shot.\u201d",

      "Atlantic City police say surveillance video initially led them to a 57-year-old Pleasantville man. He was later seen on video walking through various parts of the city, trying to sell the instruments, and he eventually sold one while the other remains unaccounted for, police said, declining further comment. The man has been charged with burglary and theft.",
      "The band was set to kick off the An Evening With Heart tour at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City on Saturday, and its gear had been set up there the day prior to the show. Among the items stolen were a custom-built, purple sparkle baritone Telecaster guitar with a hand-painted headstock made for band member Nancy Wilson, and a vintage 1966 Gibson EM-50 mandolin that band member Paul Moak has played for over 25 years.",

      "The seven-woman, five-man jury is considering two counts of criminal sex act and one count of rape, each relating to a different accuser and a different date. In this case, the criminal sex act charge is the higher-degree felony. The jury got the case after a juror was replaced by an alternate after she couldn\u2019t come to court due to illness.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Nearly eight years ago, a series of sexual misconduct allegations against the Oscar-winning movie producer propelled the #MeToo movement. Some of those accusations later generated criminal charges and convictions in New York and California.",
      "The New York conviction from 2020 was subsequently overturned, leading to the retrial before a new jury and a different judge.",
      "Jurors heard more than five weeks of testimony, including lengthy and sometimes fiery questioning of Weinstein's three accusers in the case.",
      "Jessica Mann said he raped her in 2013, when she was trying to build an acting career. Miriam Haley accused him of forcibly performing oral sex on her in 2006, when she was looking for work in entertainment production.",

      "\u201cThey all had dreams of pursuing careers in the defendant's world, the entertainment industry,\u201d prosecutor Nicole Blumberg told jurors in her closing argument Tuesday. She contended that Weinstein let the women think he was interested in their careers when what actually interested him were their bodies, and \"he was going to have their bodies and touch their bodies whether they wanted him to or not.\u201d",

      "The long-running gang case involving Atlanta rapper Young Thug will end without a single murder conviction",
      "ATLANTA -- Three years after Atlanta rapper Young Thug and 27 others were indicted on gang and racketeering charges, followed by a long, problem-plagued trial, nobody will be convicted of murder.",
      "When Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis announced the indictment in May 2022, she said her office was cracking down on a violent street gang responsible for multiple killings run by Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffery Williams.",
      "But Willis dropped the only remaining murder charge Monday after defendant Demise McMullen pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of aggravated assault. Young Thug went home Oct. 31 after pleading guilty to gang, drug and gun charges and remains on probation.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Young Thug and two others founded the street gang Young Slime Life, which was associated with the Bloods street gang, in 2012. The 33-year-old artist has a record label called Young Stoner Life, which prosecutors alleged was tied to Young Slime Life.",
      "Prosecutors drew ire for using song lyrics and social media posts in their case. Attorney Doug Weinstein, who represented defendant Deamonte Kendrick, who raps under the name Yak Gotti, said prosecutors targeted men who pursued music as a way out of hardship in economically \u201cdeprived\u201d Atlanta areas and tried to \u201cclaw them back in, hold them back down.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhatever they may have done in their youth, and I would argue most of them didn't do anything, to be targeted in this way by the prosecutors is just wrong,\u201d said Weinstein. \u201cWhatever you think of their music \u2014 the violence, the misogynistic lyrics \u2014 that is not a reason to go after these guys.\u201d",
      "Weinstein continued, adding, \u201cPeople like my client, Mr. Kendrick, had to be incarcerated for 2 1/2 years or more, in the case of some of these defendants, for a crime that they didn\u2019t do.\"",
      "Kendrick was stabbed in jail. He was one of two defendants who didn\u2019t take plea deals, and the only one cleared of all charges, including a murder charge in the 2015 drive-by shooting death of rival gang member Donovan Thomas Jr., known as \u201cBig Nut.\u201d",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, Willis spokesperson Jeff DiSantis said \u201canti-gang efforts\u201d have yielded \u201cover 400 convictions of gang members\" since Willis became district attorney, including 19 people in this case. Those efforts were \u201ckey\u201d in making Fulton County \"safer, taking dangerous offenders off the streets and sending a message that gang activity will not be tolerated in our community,\u201d he said.",
      "Willis prosecuted the case using Georgia's broad anti-racketeering law. Critics say using that law caused a messy trial by roping in dozens of people with varying levels of alleged culpability. The anti-racketeering law allows prosecutors to present evidence that might otherwise not be allowed, which some defense attorneys say lets prosecutors present irrelevant material to the jury. It also often leads to people being held in jail longer for multiple reasons.",
      "\u201cIt made everything so much more complicated and cumbersome,\u201d said Max Schardt, defense attorney for defendant Shannon Stillwell.",
      "Stillwell was among five codefendants who stood trial alongside Young Thug beginning in November 2023.",
      "After Young Thug and the others entered guilty pleas, Stillwell and Kendrick were the only ones who took their chances with a jury. They were found not guilty of racketeering, murder and gang-related charges in December. Stillwell was found guilty only of gun possession. The verdict came nearly two years after jury selection began.",
      "Nine other defendants, including the rapper Gunna, accepted plea deals before the trial began. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case. Twelve defendants were split from the original trial, and charges against six of them were dismissed in early December. Another recently got a murder charge dismissed after entering an Alford plea, which allows him to maintain his innocence while acknowledging that it is in his best interest to plead guilty.",
      "McMullen, who was also charged with murder in Thomas' killing, entered an Alford plea to a lesser aggravated assault charge and another count of violating the anti-racketeering law. A judge in this case sentenced him to 40 years, with 20 to be served in confinement at the same time as the sentence he's already serving, and 20 suspended for time served. That leaves one remaining defendant who is accused of shooting and wounding an Atlanta police officer in February 2022 while on probation. His fate is expected to be determined soon.",
      "Atlanta defense attorney Andrew Fleischman, who was not involved in the case, said Willis could have secured guilty pleas years ago without a long, expensive trial if she hadn't used the anti-racketeering law.",
      "\u201cShe went for a home run, and she didn\u2019t get it,\u201d said Fleischman.",

      "As if a movie about sharks wasn't scary enough, the filmmakers behind \u201cDangerous Animals\u201d have upped the screams by adding what every thriller needs \u2014 a serial killer.",
      "While that may sound like very dangerous moviemaking, the result is actually taut and well crafted, a worthy birthday present to \u201cJaws,\u201d celebrating its 50th anniversary this summer.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals\u201d stars Jai Courtney as an Australian boat captain who likes feeding his female customers to sharks and videotaping it, while also offering little brainy speeches about the nature of makos, mosquitos or sailfish while toying with his prey.",
      "He meets what seems like his match in Hassie Harrison's Zephyr, an American antisocial surf queen who lives in a van and refuses to be tied down. \u201cThere was nothing for me on land,\u201d she says. She's kind of a handful for any serial killer, For instance, she can pick locks with the underwire from a bikini top.",
      "Nick Lepard's screenplay is muscular and satisfying, with nods to \u201cJaws,\u201d of course, but also to \u201cPoint Break,\u201d \u201cHannibal\u201d and even the song \u201cBaby Shark.\u201d He says he was inspired to write \u201cDangerous Animals\u201d by seeing a surfboard bag and imagining it carrying a body, which says something about how Lepard's mind works, though we're not judging.",
      "Director Sean Byrnes has a super ability to build dread and his scenes are crisp without being exploitative. The movie was shot on Queensland\u2019s Gold Coast, but may take a bite out of the region's shark cage diving fleets. I'm looking twice even before taking showers now.",
      "Zephyr and the serial killer play an engaging game of chess for most of the movie, if by chess is meant she's fighting to stay alive by wriggling out of handcuffs and running or swimming away and he's determined for her to be shark food.",
      "\u201cOh, you're a fighter. I love fighters. It makes for a better show,\u201d he says, biting into the scenery almost as viciously as the sharks chomp on chum.",
      "He also does that thing that all serial killers do \u2014 saying he and his victim are similar. \u201cYou're hard as nails. Like me. You and me, we're sharks,\u201d he tells her. She tells him to stop talking so much and calls him ocean scum.",
      "The music department has a fun wink with the soundtrack. One scene uses Steve Wright's \u201cEvie (Part One)\u201d \u2014 in which the singer begs his love to let her hair hang down \u2014 as the serial killer makes mementos out of his victims' hair. Another moment, astonishingly, plays Etta James' \u201cAt Last,\u201d the ultimate wedding song, just as the bad guy finally captures his quarry inches from rescue.",
      "The setting of a boat in the middle of the Coral Sea unlocks a delicious new home for terror. Sealable hatches and no one for miles means screaming is no good. And the serial killer has weaponized Vegemite.",
      "One thing Zephyr has up her sleeve is a boy, smitten after a meet-cute in which she tries to shoplift ice cream. He's played by the hunky Josh Heuston and they're perfect for each other but she resists until she's snatched by our nasty boat captain. But even though she blew him off, her boy is suspicious about her disappearance and is on the hunt.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals,\u201d thankfully, doesn't try to be more than it is, although the quite beautiful images of sharks sliding through the ocean show, naturally, that we are the species that inspired the title. After all, sharks don't see a surfboard bag and wonder if they can put a body in it.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals,\u201d an IFC Films release in theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cstrong, bloody violent content, grisly images, sexuality, language and brief drug use.\u201d Running time: 98 minutes. Three stars out of four.",

      "NEW YORK -- Kimberly Belflower knew \u201cJohn Proctor is the Villain\u201d needed its final cathartic scene to work \u2014 and, for that, it needed Lorde's \u201cGreen Light.\u201d",
      "\u201cI literally told my agent, \u2018I would rather the play just not get done if it can\u2019t use that song,\u2019\u201d the playwright laughed. She wrote Lorde a letter, explaining what the song meant, and got her green light.",
      "Starring Sadie Sink, the staggering play about high schoolers studying \u201cThe Crucible\u201d as the #MeToo movement arrives in their small Georgia town, earned seven Tony nominations, including best new play \u2014 the most of any this season. It\u2019s among a group of Broadway shows that have centered the stories of young people and attracted audiences to match.",
      "Sam Gold\u2019s Brooklyn-rave take on \u201cRomeo + Juliet,\u201d nominated for best revival of a play and led by Kit Connor and Rachel Zegler with music from Jack Antonoff, drew the youngest ticket-buying audience recorded on Broadway, producers reported, with 14% of ticket purchasers aged 18-24, compared to the industry average of 3%.",
      "The shows share some DNA: pop music (specifically the stylings of Antonoff, who also produced \u201cGreen Light\u201d), Hollywood stars with established fanbases and stories that reflect the complexity of young adulthood.",
      "\u201cIt was very clear that young people found our show because it was doing what theater\u2019s supposed to do,\u201d Gold said. \u201cBe a mirror.\u201d",
      "The themes \u201cJohn Proctor\u201d investigates aren't danced around (until they literally are). The girls are quick to discuss #MeToo's impact, intersectional feminism and sexual autonomy. Their conversations, true to teenage girlhood, are laced with comedy and pop culture references \u2014 Taylor Swift, Beyonc\u00e9, \u201cTwilight,\u201d and, of course, Lorde.",
      "Fina Strazza, 19, portrays Beth, a leader who is whip-smart and well-intentioned \u2014 but whose friendships and belief system are shaken by the play's revelations.",
      "\u201cYou have so much empathy and are so invested in her, but she still has these mishaps and slip-ups that young people often have,\u201d said Strazza, nominated for best featured actor in a play. Some audience members have given her letters detailing how Beth helped them forgive themselves for how they handled similar experiences.",
      "The script is written in prose, with frequent line breaks and infrequent capital letters. Director Danya Taymor, nominated for best direction of a play a year after winning a Tony for another teenage canon classic, \u201cThe Outsiders, \u201d was drawn to that rhythm \u2014 and how Belflower's depiction of adolescence captured its intensity, just as S.E. Hinton had.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something about the teenage years that is so raw,\u201d Taymor said. \u201cNone of us can escape it.\u201d",
      "During his Tony-winning production of \u201cAn Enemy of the People,\u201d Gold found himself having conversations with young actors and theatergoers about climate change, politics and how \u201ctheater was something that people their age and younger really need in a different way, as the world is becoming so addicted to technology,\u201d he said.",
      "That conjured \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d The original text \u201chas it all in terms of what it means to inherit the future that people older than you have created,\u201d Gold said.",
      "Building the world of this show, with an ensemble under 30, was not unlike building \u201cAn Enemy of the People,\u201d set in 19th century Norway, Gold said: \u201cI think the difference is that the world that I made for this show is something that a very hungry audience had not gotten to see.\u201d",
      "Fans, Gold correctly predicted, were ravenous. Demand ahead of the first preview prompted a preemptive extension. Word (and bootleg video) of Connor doing a pullup to kiss Zegler made the rounds. \u201cMan of the House,\u201d an Antonoff-produced ballad sung by Zegler mid-show, was released as a single. With the show premiering just before the U.S. presidential election, Voters of Tomorrow even registered new voters in the lobby.",
      "Audiences proved willing to pay: Average ticket prices hovered around $150. Cheaper rush and lottery tickets drew lines hours before the box office opened. Every week but one sold out.",
      "\u201cThe show was initially really well sold because we had a cast that appealed to a really specific audience,\u201d said producer Greg Nobile of Seaview Productions. \u201cWe continued to see the houses sell out because these audiences came, and they were all over online talking about the ways in which they actually felt seen.\u201d",
      "Thomas Laub, 28, and Alyah Chanelle Scott, 27, started Runyonland Productions for that very reason.",
      "\u201cWe both felt a lot of frustration with the industry, and the ways that we were boxed out of it as students in Michigan who were able to come to New York sparingly,\u201d Laub said. Runyonland was launched in 2018 with the premise that highlighting new, bold voices would bring change.",
      "This spring, Scott, known for playing Whitney in HBO\u2019s \u201cSex Lives of College Girls,\u201d acted off-Broadway in Natalie Margolin's \u201cAll Nighter.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was standing onstage and looking out and seeing the college kids that I was playing,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI was like, \u2018I respect you so much. I want to do you proud. I want to show you a story that represents you in a way that doesn\u2019t belittle or demean you, but uplifts you.\u2019\u201d",
      "Co-producing \u201cJohn Proctor,\u201d Scott said, gave Runyonland the opportunity to target that audience on a Broadway scale. Belflower developed the show with students as part of a The Farm College Collaboration Project. It's been licensed over 100 times for high school and college productions. The Broadway production's social and influencer marketing is run by 20-somethings, too.",
      "Previews attracted fans with a $29 ticket lottery. While average prices jumped to over $100 last week (still below the Broadway-wide average), $40 rush, lottery and standing room tickets have sold out most nights, pushing capacity over 100%. The success is validating Runyonland's mission, Laub said.",
      "\u201cAlyah doesn\u2019t believe me that I cry every time at the end,\u201d Laub said. Scott laughs. \u201cI just want to assure you, on the record, that I do indeed cry every time.\u201d",
      "The final scene of \u201cJohn Proctor\u201d is a reclamation fueled by rage and \u201cGreen Light.\u201d Capturing that electricity has been key to the show's marketing.",
      "\u201cThe pullup (in \u2018Romeo + Juliet\u2019) is so impactful because it's so real. It's like so exactly what a teenage boy would do,\u201d Taymor said. \u201cI think when you see the girls in \u2018John Proctor\u2019 screaming ... it hits you in a visceral way.\u201d That screaming made the Playbill cover.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, the look and feel of that campaign feels different from a traditional theatrical campaign, and it feels a lot closer to a film campaign,\u201d Laub said. The show's team indeed considered the zeitgeist-infiltrating work of their sister industries, specifically studios like Neon and A24.",
      "In May, \u201cJohn Proctor is the Villain\u201d finished its second \u201cspirit week\u201d with a school spirit day. Earlier events included an ice cream social \u2014 actors served Van Leeuwen \u2014 a silent disco and a banned book giveaway. For those not in their own school's colors, the merch stand offered T-shirts, including one printed with the Walt Whitman-channeling line said by Sink's Shelby: \u201cI contain frickin' multitudes.\u201d",
      "Julia Lawrence, 26, designed the shirt after the show's team saw her TikTok video reimagining their traditional merch into something more like a concert tee.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so incredible to bring Gen Z into the theater that way, especially at a time when theater has never been more important,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cIn a world that\u2019s overpowered by screens, live art can be such a powerful way to find understanding.\u201d",

      "Jessie J, 37, shared the news in an Instagram video on Wednesday. \u201cI was diagnosed with early breast cancer,\u201d she said in the clip. \u201cCancer sucks in any form, but I\u2019m holding onto the word \u2018early\u2019.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very dramatic way to get a boob job. I am going to disappear for a bit after Summertime Ball to have my surgery, and I will come back with massive (expletive) and more music.\u201d",
      "The annual Summertime Ball will be held at Wembley Stadium on Sunday, June 15.",
      "She told her social media audience that she felt compelled to share her diagnosis.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to be open and share it,\u201d she said. \u201cOne, because, selfishly, I do not talk about it enough. I\u2019m not processing it because I\u2019m working so hard. I also know how much sharing in the past has helped me with other people giving me their love and support and also their own stories. I\u2019m an open book. It breaks my heart that so many people are going through so much similar and worse \u2013 that\u2019s the bit that kills me.\u201d",
      "The Grammy-nominated Jessie J has long been celebrated for her robust soprano and R&B-informed pop hits, like the 2014 collaboration with Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande, \u201cBang Bang,\u201d and 2011's \u201cDomino.\u201d",
      "She has released five albums across her career, most recently, 2018's Christmas album, \u201cThis Christmas Day.\u201d She has been releasing new music in 2025, including the singles \u201cLiving My Best Life\u201d and \u201cNo Secrets.\u201d A new album is expected later this year.",
      "She has a son, Sky Safir Cornish Colman, born in 2023.",

      "So vividly drawn is Stephen King\u2019s fiction that it\u2019s offered the basis for some 50 feature films",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Stephen King \u2019s first editor, Bill Thompson, once said, \u201cSteve has a movie camera in his head.\u201d",
      "So vividly drawn is King\u2019s fiction that it\u2019s offered the basis for some 50 feature films. For half a century, since Brian De Palma\u2019s 1976 film \u201cCarrie,\u201d Hollywood has turned, and turned again, to King\u2019s books for their richness of character, nightmare and sheer entertainment.",
      "Open any of those books up at random, and there\u2019s a decent chance you\u2019ll encounter a movie reference, too. Rita Hayworth. \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain.\u201d Sometimes even movies based on King\u2019s books turn up in his novels. That King\u2019s books have been such fodder for the movies is owed, in part, to how much of a moviegoer their author is.",
      "\u201cI love anything from \u2018The 400 Blows\u2019 to something with that guy Jason Statham,\u201d King says, speaking by phone from his home in Maine. \u201cThe worst movie I ever saw was still a great way to spend an afternoon. The only movie I ever walked out on was \u2018Transformers.\u2019 At a certain point I said, \u2018This is just ridiculous.\u2019\u201d",
      "Over time, King has developed a personal policy in how he talks about the adaptations of his books. \u201cMy idea is: If you can\u2019t say something nice, keep your mouth shut,\u201d he says.",
      "The most notable exception was Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201cThe Shining,\u201d which King famously called \u201ca big beautiful Cadillac with no engine inside.\u201d But every now and then, King is such a fan of an adaptation that he\u2019s excited to talk about it. That\u2019s very much the case with \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d Mike Flanagan\u2019s new adaptation of King\u2019s novella of the same name published in the 2020 collection \u201cIf It Bleeds.\u201d",
      "In \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d which Neon releases in theaters Friday (nationwide June 13), there are separate storylines but the tone-setting opening is apocalyptic. The internet, like a dazed prize fighter, wobbles on its last legs before going down. California is said to be peeling away from the mainland like \u201clike old wallpaper.\u201d",
      "And yet in this doomsday tale, King is at his most sincere. \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d the book and the movie, is about what matters in life when everything else is lost. There is dancing, Walt Whitman and joy.",
      "\u201cIn \u2018The Life of Chuck,\u2019 we understand that this guy\u2019s life is cut short, but that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t experience joy,\u201d says King. \u201cExistential dread and grief and things are part of the human experience, but so is joy.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s telling that when King, our preeminent purveyor of horror, writes about doom times, he ends up scaling it down to a single life. While darkness and doom have, and probably always will, mark his work, King \u2014 a more playful, instinctual, genre-skipping writer than he\u2019s often credited as \u2014 \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d is a prime example of King, the humanist.",
      "\u201cAn awful lot of people assume, because he writes so much stuff that\u2019s so scary, they kind of forget the reason his horror works so well is he\u2019s always juxtaposing it with light and with love and with empathy,\u201d says Flanagan, who has twice before adapted King (\u201cDoctor Sleep,\u201d \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d) and is in the midst of making a \u201cCarrie\u201d series for Amazon.",
      "\u201cYou forget that \u2018It\u2019 isn\u2019t about the clown, it\u2019s about the kids and their friendship,\" adds Flanagan. \u201c\u2018The Stand\u2019 isn\u2019t about the virus or the demon taking over the world, it\u2019s ordinary people who have to come together and stand against a force they cannot defeat.\u201d",
      "King, 77, has now written somewhere around 80 books, including the just released \u201cNever Flinch.\u201d The mystery thriller brings back King\u2019s recent favorite protagonist, the private investigator Holly Gibney, who made her stand-alone debut in \u201cIf It Bleeds.\u201d It\u2019s Gibney\u2019s insecurities, and her willingness to push against them, that has kept King returning to her.",
      "\u201cIt gave me great pleasure to see Holly grow into a more confident person,\u201d King says. \u201cShe never outgrows all of her insecurities, though. None of us do.\u201d",
      "\u201cNever Flinch\u201d is a reminder that King has always been less of a genre-first writer than a character-first one. He tends to fall in love with a character and follow them through thick and thin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always happy writing. That\u2019s why I do it so much,\u201d King says, chuckling. \u201cI\u2019m a very chipper guy because I get rid of all that dark stuff in the books.\u201d",
      "Dark stuff, as King says, hasn\u2019t been hard to come by lately, he grants. The kind of climate change disaster found in \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d King says, often dominates his anxieties.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re creeping up little by little on being the one country who does not acknowledge it\u2019s a real problem with carbon in the atmosphere,\u201d King says. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. Certain right wing politicians can talk all they want about how we\u2019re saving the world for our grandchildren. They don\u2019t care about that. They care about money.\u201d",
      "On social media, King has been a sometimes critic of President Donald Trump, whose second term has included battles with the arts, academia and public financing for PBS and NPR. Over the next four years, King predicts, \u201cCulture is going to go underground.\u201d",
      "In \u201cNever Finch,\u201d Holly Gibney is hired as a bodyguard by a women\u2019s rights activist whose lecture tour is being plagued by mysterious acts of violence. In the afterward of the book, King includes a tribute to \u201csupporters of women\u2019s right to choose who have been murdered for doing their duty.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re not going to like that,\u201d King says of right-wing critics.",
      "The original germ for \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d had nothing to do with current events. One day in Boston, King noticed a drummer busking on Boylston Street. He had the vision of a businessman in a suit who, walking by, can\u2019t resist dancing with abandon to the drummer\u2019s beat.",
      "King, a self-acknowledged dancer (though only in private, he notes), latched onto a story that would turn on the unpredictable nature of people, tracing the inner life of that imagined passerby. In the film, he\u2019s played by Tom Hiddleston. Chuck first appears, oddly, on a billboard that haunts and confuses a local teacher (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who's struggling to get his students to care about literature or education with the possible end of the world encroaching.",
      "It\u2019s a funny but maybe not coincidental irony that many of the best King adaptations, like \u201cStand By Me\u201d and \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption,\" have come from the author\u2019s more warm-hearted tales. \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d which won the People\u2019s Choice Award last fall at the Toronto International Film Festival, is after a similar spirit.",
      "When King reached out about attending the TIFF world premiere, Flanagan was shocked. The last time King had done that for one of his own adaptations was 26 years ago, for \u201cThe Green Mile.\u201d That movie, like \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d were box-office disappointments, King recalls, a fate he's hoping \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d can avoid.",
      "\u201cHe views this movie as something that\u2019s a bit precious,\u201d says Flanagan. \u201cHe\u2019s said a few things to me in the past about how earnest it is, how this is a story without an ounce of cynicism. As it was being released into a cynical world, I think he felt protective of it. I think this one really means something to him.\u201d",
      "The Stephen King industrial complex, meanwhile, keeps rolling along. Coming just this year are series of \u201cWelcome to Derry\u201d and \u201cThe Institute\u201d and a film of \u201cThe Long Walk.\u201d King, himself, just finished a draft of \u201cTalisman 3.\u201d",
      "If \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d has particular meaning to King, it could be because it represents something intrinsic about his own life. Chuck's small, seemingly unremarkable existence has grace and meaning because, as Whitman is quoted, he \"contains multitudes\u201d that surprise and delight him. King's fiction is evidence \u2014 heaps of it \u2014 that he does, too.",
      "\u201cThere are some days where I sit down and I think, \u2018This is going to be a really good day,\u2019 and it\u2019s not, at all,\u201d says King. \u201cThen other days I sit down and think to myself, \u2018I\u2019m really tired and don\u2019t feel like doing this,\u2019 and then it catches fire. You never know what you\u2019re going to get.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s National Institutes of Health director says some employees\u2019 critical letter to him has \u201cfundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- In his confirmation hearings to lead the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya pledged his openness to views that might conflict with his own. \u201cDissent,\" he said, \u201dis the very essence of science.\u201d",
      "That commitment is being put to the test.",
      "On Monday, scores of scientists at the agency sent their Trump-appointed leader a letter titled the Bethesda Declaration, challenging \u201cpolicies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.\u201d",
      "It says: \"We dissent.\"",
      "In a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, 92 NIH researchers, program directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter \u2014 and their careers on the line. An additional 250 of their colleagues across the agency endorsed the declaration without using their names.",
      "The four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya, also was sent to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and members of Congress who oversee the NIH. White House spokesman Kush Desai defended the administration's approach to federal research and said President Donald Trump is focused on restoring a \u201cGold Standard\u201d of science, not \u201cideological activism.\u201d",
      "The signers went public in the face of a \u201cculture of fear and suppression\u201d they say Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. \u201cWe are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Bhattacharya responded to the declaration by saying it \u201chas some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months.\"",
      "\u201cNevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive,\u201d he said in a statement. \"We all want the NIH to succeed.\u201d",
      "Named for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world\u2019s premier public health research institution over the course of mere months.",
      "It addresses the termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.",
      "In one case, an NIH-supported study of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.",
      "In a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyze the work, the letter says. \u201cEnding a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million,\u201d it says, \u201cit wastes $4 million.\u201d",
      "Jenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., to talk about what's happening at the NIH.",
      "At the event, she masked to conceal her identity. Now the mask is off. She was a lead organizer of the declaration.",
      "\u201cI want people to know how bad things are at NIH,\" Norton told The Associated Press.",
      "The signers said they modeled their indictment after Bhattacharya\u2019s Great Barrington Declaration in 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.",
      "His declaration drew together likeminded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive COVID-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.",
      "\u201cHe is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,\" said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.",
      "As chief of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who've been funded by the cancer institute or want to be. Cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. \"So much of it is gone \u2014 my work,\u201d she said.",
      "The 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because she didn't want to be \"a collaborator\u201d in the political manipulation of biomedical science.",
      "Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. \u201cWe have a saying in basic science,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.",
      "\u201cWe are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,\u201d he added. But that won\u2019t happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing grant cuts.",
      "The NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasized they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes nor the NIH.",
      "Employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.",
      "The letter asserts \u201cNIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety\u201d and the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who \u201cbraved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has gone at public health research on several fronts, both directly, as part of its broad effort to root out diversity, equity and inclusion values throughout the bureaucracy, and as part of its drive to starve some universities of federal money.",
      "At the White House, Desai said Americans \u201chave lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",
      "This has forced \u201cindiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Some NIH employees have previously come forward in televised protests to air grievances, and many walked out of Bhattacharya's town hall with staff. The declaration is the first cohesive effort to register agency-wide dismay with the NIH's direction.",
      "The dissenters remind Bhattacharya in their letter of his oft-stated ethic that academic freedom must be a lynchpin in science.",
      "With that in place, he said in a statement in April, \u201cNIH scientists can be certain they are afforded the ability to engage in open, academic discourse as part of their official duties and in their personal capacities without risk of official interference, professional disadvantage or workplace retaliation.\"",
      "Now it will be seen whether that's enough to protect those NIH employees challenging the Trump administration and him.",
      "\u201cThere's a book I read to my kids, and it talks about how you can't be brave if you're not scared,\u201d said Norton, who has three young children. \"I am so scared about doing this, but I am trying to be brave for my kids because it's only going to get harder to speak up.",
      "\u201cMaybe I'm putting my kids at risk by doing this,\" she added. \"And I'm doing it anyway because I couldn't live with myself otherwise.\u201d",
      "e and noy on",
      "\u201cIn recent years, Americans have lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago,\u201d spokesman Kush Desai said. \u201cThe Trump administration is focused on restoring the Gold Standard of Science \u2014 not ideological activism \u2014 as the guiding principle of HHS, the NIH, and the CDC to finally address our chronic disease epidemic.\u201d",

Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that\u2019s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.",
      "\u201cIndustry and government is very, very, very powerful. It\u2019s more powerful than me. I\u2019m just an English teacher,\u201d Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.",
      "In a way, Brockman\u2019s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.",
      "That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump\u2019s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.",
      "But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data \u2014 at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere \u2014 would make it tougher to fight climate change.",
      "At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.",
      "And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.",
      "The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.",
      "\"We can\u2019t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that\u2019s changing over time,\" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.",
      "Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.",
      "But the registry \u201cdoes put pressure on companies to ... document what they\u2019ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.",
      "Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.",
      "\"It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.\u201d",
      "The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these \u201cmonitoring deserts,\u201d said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.",
      "\"The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can\u2019t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.",
      "The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.",
      "CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It\u2019s human rights,\u201d said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. \u201cWe all deserve a right to clean air.\u201d",
      "Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what\u2019s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.",
      "Indiana says it \u201cmaintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,\u201d but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren't satisfied. She and other members of local advocacy groups Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life and Valley Watch install and maintain their own air and water quality monitors. It\u2019s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.",
      "Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven\u2019t eaten breakfast.",
      "\u201cBut you also don\u2019t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,\u201d she said.",

      "Canada\u2019s wildfire season is off to an intense start",
      "While images of wildfires capture their ferocity, data can provide insight into how bad a fire season is.",
      "Such is the case with two graphics, powered by satellite data, that showcase a Canadian wildfire season off to a wild \u2014 and scary \u2014 start.",
      "Twice a day a NASA satellite sends images to the ground, giving a real-time view of where fires are burning. This is especially useful for remote areas where no sensors are stationed.",
      "As of Tuesday that satellite had picked up four times as many fire hot spots across Canada than is typical for early June. That\u2019s more than any year since the satellite began transmitting in 2012, except 2023, according to data from Global Forest Watch.",
      "Though the satellite has recorded thousands of hot spots so far this year, that does not mean there are actually that many active fires. Each hot spot could be detected repeatedly over the course of days. And because each detection is about the size of 26 football fields, it can represent part of a much larger blaze, said James MacCarthy, wildfire research manager at Global Forest Watch.",
      "Based on data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, about 200 fires are actively burning in Canada and have consumed about 7,700 square miles (19,900 square kilometers) of terrain, most of it in the last week.",
      "Only 2023 saw such high numbers so early in Canada's fire season, which runs from April through October. That year wildfires burned a record 67,000 square miles \u2014 more than twice the surface area of Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes.",
      "Taken together, the hot spots and acres burned mean 2025 is the second-worst start to the season in years.",
      "\u201cA warm and dry finish to May and early June has created a significant fire season,\u201d said Liam Buchart, a fire weather specialist with the Canadian Forest Service.",
      "The weather conditions are made more likely by climate change and encourage wildfires to start. That means even though 90% of wildfires in Manitoba this year have been human-caused, according to the provincial government, climate change helps enable their spread.",
      "\u201cClimate change is creating the conditions that make it more likely that human-caused fires are going to spread, or even start,\u201d MacCarthy said. \u201cIt might be a human starting it, but it\u2019s going to spread quickly because now there\u2019s hot and dry conditions that are occurring more frequently and more intensely than they have in the past.\u201d",
      "The hot and dry weather is likely to to continue for at least the next week across Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, according to Natural Resources Canada. The agency\u2019s forecasts also call for \u201ca warmer and drier than normal July and August for large portions of Canada,\u201d Buchart said.",
      "\u201cThe remainder of the fire season looks to remain above normal, especially over the northern prairie provinces and southern British Columbia,\u201d he said.",

      "Childhood vaccination rates against measles fell in the years after the COVID-19 pandemic in nearly 80% of the more than 2,000 U.S. counties with available data \u2014 including in states that are battling outbreaks this year.",
      "A Johns Hopkins University study, published in JAMA this week, illustrates where more vulnerable communities are located. The results mirror trends established at state and national levels: Routine childhood vaccination rates are dropping.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at the state level or national level ... you really don\u2019t see those drastic drops. Those are there. They\u2019re real and they\u2019re really problematic,\u201d said Lauren Gardner, an expert in infectious disease modeling at Johns Hopkins University who is the paper\u2019s senior author. Gardner also built the university\u2019s COVID-19 database.",
      "Most of the measles cases in the U.S. this year \u2014 1,088 nationally as of Friday \u2014 are in unvaccinated people. It has been spreading among communities due to international and domestic travel. Three people have died from measles during this year's outbreaks, and 2025 is inching closer to becoming the worst for measles in more than three decades.",
      "Measles was eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, and the vaccine is safe and highly effective. Public schools nationwide require two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine before kindergarten, but the number of children with non-medical exemptions from those requirements hit an all-time high in the 2023-2024 school year. Health experts say community-level vaccination needs to be at 95% or higher to prevent outbreaks.",
      "The Johns Hopkins study looked at 2,066 counties across 33 states, comparing kindergarten vaccination rates averaged over school years from 2017-2020 to averages from 2022-2024. Where kindergarten data wasn\u2019t available, the researchers used a comparable rate.",
      "Here's what it looks like in counties where there have been outbreaks this year, including in Texas counties that are the epicenter of measles.",
      "Texas has logged 742 measles cases since late January, most in West Texas.",
      "Gaines County has 411 cases, the most in the state. Almost 2% of its population got measles. While the county saw a two percentage-point increase in vaccination rates after the pandemic, its 82.4% rate remains below herd immunity.",
      "Terry County (60 cases) and Yoakum County (20 cases) dropped below the 95% threshold for herd immunity after the pandemic, to 93.7% and 91.8% respectively.",
      "Lubbock County \u2014 which has seen 53 cases and is the closest metro area to Gaines County \u2014 was just below 95% before the pandemic, but dropped three percentage points after to 91.8%.",
      "El Paso County on the border of Mexico has had the third-most measles cases in Texas this year with 57. Its vaccination rate is higher than 95% but saw a 2.1 percentage-point decline to 96.5%.",
      "Counties with outbreaks in Kansas include Gray with 25 cases, Haskell with 11 and and Stevens with seven.",
      "Vaccination rates in Gray County dropped 23 percentage points after the pandemic, from 94% to 71%.",
      "Haskell County dropped 18 percentage points to 65%. And Stevens County dropped 0.5 percentage points to 90.5%.",
      "Colorado's outbreak, which is linked to an international flight that landed at the Denver airport in mid-May, involves six cases: five in state residents and one out-of-state traveler.",
      "Two people who got measles live in Arapahoe County in the Denver metro, where the vaccination rate dropped 3.5 percentage points to 88.4%. Three others live in El Paso County, home to Colorado Springs, where the vaccination rate dropped 3.8 percentage points to 80% post-pandemic.",
      "Pre-pandemic data in North Dakota wasn't available to Johns Hopkins researchers, but they looked at rates from school years ending in 2022, 2023 and 2024.",
      "North Dakota's first outbreak started in Williams County, which now has 16 measles cases. In the timeframe researchers looked at, vaccination rates in Williams rose from 84.6% in 2022 to 87.7% in 2023, only to drop back to 83.5% in 2024.",

    "story": [
      "It might start when you realize you can\u2019t hear the doorbell, or certain ringtones",
      "NEW YORK -- My first tip-off were the little things, the high-pitched little things: the doorbell and ringtones my kids could hear but I could not.",
      "Then it was the garbled-sounding conversations, and the accompanying annoyance of having to ask people to repeat themselves. Or worse, giving up and just playing along without being able to follow everything that was being said.",
      "Even then, I stalled for years before finally going through the process of getting a hearing aid. How do you even begin? Will it look clunky and make me feel like a dinosaur? And the cost!",
      "Getting a hearing test, and confirmation that I needed a hearing aid, was just the beginning.",
      "The doctor handed me a list of places I could go to get fitted. I made some calls and narrowed it down to the places that took my insurance and my zero-interest health care credit card.",
      "The first couple places were demoralizing: I walked in, was told it\u2019d be $7,000 for the \u201cbest\u201d option (they mysteriously didn\u2019t happen to have any other options handy), then marched right back out the door, utterly discouraged.",
      "I started asking friends and neighbors whether they wore a hearing aid, or knew anyone at all with a hearing aid, and could point me to a good audiologist.",
      "It took a lot of poking around, but I found one \u2014 and it made all the difference.",
      "I\u2019ve been wearing my hearing aids for several months now, and they are as easy as slipping on a pair of glasses, are almost invisible, have reconnected me with the world, and, as crazy as this may sound, they bring me joy.",
      "After talking with a few audiologists around the country, it turns out that my experience is pretty typical.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of people who stall before getting one,\u201d says Meagan P. Bachmann, director of audiology at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist, in North Carolina.",
      "\u201cHearing is important because it connects us with people,\u201d she says. \u201cMultiple studies show that not hearing can affect your ability to connect with others and participate in life, so you have to think of it in terms of overall health. Maybe you no longer go to family events, or you don\u2019t understand your doctor. People start to withdraw. A lot of people come in because it\u2019s gotten so bad that it is impacting their relationships.\u201d",
      "To speed up the process and make it less frustrating, here\u2019s what the pros recommend:",
      "1. Get tested, take the results seriously, and know that many if not most hearing aids these days are small, nearly invisible, rechargeable, and pretty easy to wear and maintain. And believe it or not, hearing aids can be fun \u2014 these days, there are colors to choose from and ways to bejewel them. One company, Deafmetal, makes jazzy-looking \u201csafety rings\u201d to help keep hearing aids in place.",
      "2. Shop for an expert audiologist. Look for someone who takes your insurance or any sort of medical credit card you might have, or has a payment plan of some kind, if needed. This is a world at the awkward juncture of consumerism and medical care, but a good audiologist should come across as a medical provider, not a salesperson. And a good audiologist should take the time to work with you to find a hearing aid that meets your individual needs, and also fits your budget.",
      "A good place to start is often with your doctor; with the American Academy of Audiologists, which lists providers on its website; or by word of mouth.",
      "\u201cAlthough all hearing aids are amplifiers, not everybody needs the same thing,\u201d says Bachmann. \u201cFitting a hearing aid is an art. It changes the acoustics, and everyone is different. You want someone who listens to your lifestyle needs. Do you have a lot of difficulty with noise? Are you mostly in quiet situations? How much technology do you need, and what kind?\u201d",
      "Greta Stamper, an audiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, agrees. \u201cHearing loss is not a one-time thing. It\u2019s a chronic health condition. It should be a partnership between you and your audiologist,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s someone asking you what you\u2019re looking for and how it\u2019s going. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressured or pushed.\u201d",
      "3. A note on cost. Although hearing aids can be pricey, there are affordable options, and a good audiologist should be able to let you try out options at several price points. Insurance often covers much of the cost, and there are ways to pay for the remaining cost in installments. Also, avoidance has pretty high costs as well, audiologists say, and the longer the wait, the harder it may be to solve the problem with a hearing aid. Although there are cheaper hearing aids at big box stores, Bachmann warns that it\u2019s good to check with your audiologist before taking that route. \u201cSome of those hearing aids are locked, so that you\u2019re not allowed to have them programmed by an outside audiologist,\u201d she says.",
      "Remember, says Stamper, that hearing aids are an investment, and usually last between five and six years.",
      "4. Know your rights. \u201cWe select what is the most likely to be successful, and if it doesn\u2019t work out you come back and do something else,\u201d says Stamper. She said most states mandate a trial period. In some cases, hearing-aid companies also cover the cost of multiple visits to your audiologist while you are getting used to your new hearing aid and get training in how to use and maintain it.",
      "5. Embrace the process, and expect it to take a little time and a few expert tweaks. Audiologists say your brain needs time to adjust to a hearing aid, and that hearing-aid settings should be adjusted little by little as your brain adapts to them.",
      "\u201cA big misconception is that you can just wear them a couple hours a day. Your brain does better with it if you use them most of the day. Your brain needs to adapt to hearing sounds it hasn't heard for a while, and it takes the brain awhile to relearn how to process all those sounds,\u201d says Stamper.",
      "6. Be realistic. \u201cAlthough hearing aids can be enormously beneficial, they may not give you back your normal hearing,\u201d says Stamper. Depending on the situation, there might be limitations to what a hearing aid can do.",
      "\u201cIt might just be lots of improvement in the key areas in which you\u2019re struggling,\u201d said Stamper.",
      "Using hearing aids is a process, the audiologists say, and although it requires some patience, it can be well worth the journey.",

    "story": [
      "A federal investigation has found that a Texas hospital that repeatedly sent a woman who was bleeding and in pain home without ending her nonviable, life-threatening pregnancy violated the law",
      "WASHINGTON -- A Texas hospital that repeatedly sent a woman who was bleeding and in pain home without ending her nonviable, life-threatening pregnancy violated the law, according to a newly released federal investigation.",
      "The government's findings, which have not been previously reported, were a small victory for 36-year-old Kyleigh Thurman, who ultimately lost part of her reproductive system after being discharged without any help from her hometown emergency room for her dangerous ectopic pregnancy.",
      "But a new policy the Trump administration announced on Tuesday has thrown into doubt the federal government's oversight of hospitals that deny women emergency abortions, even when they are at risk for serious infection, organ loss or severe hemorrhaging.",
      "Thurman had hoped the federal government's investigation, which issued a report in April after concluding its inquiry last year, would send a clear message that ectopic pregnancies must be treated by hospitals in Texas, which has one of the nation's strictest abortion bans.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone else to have to go through this,\u201d Thurman said in an interview with the Associated Press from her Texas home this week. \u201cI put a lot of the responsibility on the state of Texas and policy makers and the legislators that set this chain of events off.\u201d",
      "Women around the country have been denied emergency abortions for their life-threatening pregnancies after states swiftly enacted abortion restrictions in response to a 2022 ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, which includes three appointees of President Donald Trump.",
      "The guidance issued by the Biden administration in 2022 was an effort to preserve access to emergency abortions for extreme cases in which women were experiencing medical emergencies. It directed hospitals \u2014 even ones in states with severe restrictions \u2014 to provide abortions in those emergency cases. If hospitals did not comply, they would be in violation of a federal law and risk losing some federal funds.",
      "On Tuesday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for enforcing the law and inspecting hospitals, announced it would revoke the Biden-era guidance around emergency abortions.",
      "The law, which requires doctors to provide stabilizing treatment, was one of the few ways that Thurman was able to hold the emergency room accountable after she didn't receive any help from staff at Ascension Seton Williamson in Round Rock, Texas in February of 2023, a few months after Texas enacted its strict abortion ban.",
      "Emergency room staff observed that Thurman's hormone levels had dropped, a pregnancy was not visible in her uterus and a structure was blocking her fallopian tube \u2014 all telltale signs of an ectopic pregnancy, when a fetus implants outside of the uterus and has no room to grow. If left untreated, ectopic pregnancies can rupture, causing organ damage, hemorrhage or even death.",
      "Thurman, however, was sent home and given a pamphlet on miscarriage for her first pregnancy. She returned three days later, still bleeding, and was given an injected drug intended to end the pregnancy, but it was too late. Days later, she showed up again at the emergency room, bleeding out because the fertilized egg growing on Thurman\u2019s fallopian tube ruptured it. She underwent an emergency surgery that removed part of her reproductive system.",
      "CMS launched its investigation of how Ascension Seton Williamson handled Thurman\u2019s case late last year, shortly after she filed a complaint. Investigators concluded the hospital failed to give her a proper medical screening exam, including an evaluation with an OB-GYN. The hospital violated the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing treatment to all patients. Thurman was \u201cat risk for deterioration of her health and wellbeing as a result of an untreated medical condition,\u201d the investigation said in its report, which was publicly released last month.",
      "Ascension, a vast hospital system that has facilities across multiple states, did not respond to questions about Thurman\u2019s case, saying only that it is \u201cis committed to providing high-quality care to all who seek our services.\u201d",
      "Doctors and legal experts have warned abortion restrictions like the one Texas enacted have discouraged emergency room staff from aborting dangerous and nonviable pregnancies, even when a woman's life is imperiled. The stakes are especially high in Texas, where doctors face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an illegal abortion. Lawmakers in the state are weighing a law that would remove criminal penalties for doctors who provide abortions in certain medical emergencies.",
      "\u201cWe see patients with miscarriages being denied care, bleeding out in parking lots. We see patients with nonviable pregnancies being told to continue those to term,\u201d said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights that represented Thurman. \u201cThis is not, maybe, what some people thought abortion bans would look like, but this is the reality.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration routinely warned hospitals that they need to provide abortions when a woman\u2019s health was in jeopardy, even suing Idaho over its state law that initially prohibited nearly all abortions, unless a woman\u2019s life was on the line.",
      "But CMS\u2019 announcement on Tuesday raises questions about whether such investigations will continue if hospitals do not provide abortions for women in medical emergencies.",
      "The agency said it will still enforce the law, \u201cincluding for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy.\u201d",
      "While states like Texas have clarified that ectopic pregnancies can legally be treated with abortions, the laws do not provide for every complication that might arise during a pregnancy. Several women in Texas have sued the state for its law, which has prevented women from terminating pregnancies in cases where their fetuses had deadly fetal anomalies or they went into labor too early for the fetus to survive.",
      "Thurman worries pregnant patients with serious complications still won't be able to get the help they may need in Texas emergency rooms.",
      "\u201cYou cannot predict the ways a pregnancy can go,\u201d Thurman said. \u201cIt can happen to anyone, still. There\u2019s still so many ways in which pregnancies that aren\u2019t ectopic can be deadly.\u201d",

The switch followed severe backlash after the government approved a 42% reduction in the zone \u2014 about 2,400\u202f square kilometers (926 square miles) \u2014 and to allow miners to seek formal permits in previously restricted areas.",

Reeves said the move was necessary last year because the previous Conservative government had left public finances in a dire state.",

      "The payments are worth between 200 and 300 pounds ($271 and $406) a year. The reversal will cost the government 1.25 billion, Reeve said.",
      "Canceling the payments for most people last winter was blamed for contributing to Starmer's swift decline in popularity after his party came to power in a landslide. He was blamed for punishing elderly people on limited incomes who struggled to make ends meet during a cost-of-living crisis.",

      "Italians are heading to the polls Monday on the second day of referendums that would make it easier for children born in Italy to foreigners to obtain citizenship, and on providing more job protections",
      "ROME -- Italians headed to the polls Monday on the second and final day of referendums that would make it easier for children born in Italy to foreigners to obtain citizenship, and on providing more job protections. But partial data showed a low turnout, well below the required 50% plus one threshold, risking to invalidate the vote.",
      "Campaigners for the change in the citizenship law say it will help second-generation Italians born in the country to non- European Union parents better integrate into a culture they already see as theirs.",
      "Partial data from Italy\u2019s Interior Ministry published at 2100 GMT on Sunday showed that national turnout stood at 22.7%, just over half of the 41% registered at the same time of the day in the latest comparable referendum held in 2011. The polling stations close later Monday at 1300 GMT.",
      "The new rules, if passed, could affect about 2.5 million foreign nationals who still struggle to be recognized as citizens.",
      "The measures were proposed by Italy\u2019s main union and left-wing opposition parties. Premier Giorgia Meloni showed up at the polls on Sunday evening but didn't cast a ballot \u2014 an action widely criticized by the left as antidemocratic, since it won't contribute to reaching the necessary threshold to make the vote valid.",
      "\u201cWhile some members of her ruling coalition have openly called for abstention, Meloni has opted for a more subtle approach,\u201c said analyst Wolfango Piccoli of the Teneo consultancy based in London. \u201dIt\u2019s yet another example of her trademark fence-sitting.\u2019\u2019",
      "Supporters say this reform would bring Italy\u2019s citizenship law in line with many other European countries, promoting greater social integration for long-term residents. It would also allow faster access to civil and political rights, such as the right to vote, eligibility for public employment and freedom of movement within the EU.",
      "\u201cThe real drama is that neither people who will vote \u2018yes\u2019 nor those who intend to vote \u2018no\u2019 or abstain have an idea of what (an) ordeal children born from foreigners have to face in this country to obtain a residence permit,\u201d said Selam Tesfaye, an activist and campaigner with the Milan-based human rights group Il Cantiere.",
      "Activists and opposition parties also denounced the lack of public debate on the measures, accusing the governing center-right coalition of trying to dampen interest in sensitive issues that directly impact immigrants and workers.",
      "In May, Italy\u2019s AGCOM communications authority lodged a complaint against RAI state television and other broadcasters over a lack of adequate and balanced coverage.",
      "Opinion polls published in mid-May showed that only 46% of Italians were aware of the issues driving the referendums. Turnout projections were even weaker for a vote scheduled for the first weekend of Italy\u2019s school holidays, at around 35% of around 50 million electors, well below the required quorum.",
      "\u201cMany believe that the referendum institution should be reviewed in light of the high levels of abstention (that) emerged in recent elections and the turnout threshold should be lowered,\u201d said Lorenzo Pregliasco, political analyst and pollster at YouTrend.",
      "Some analysts note, however, that the center-left opposition could claim a victory even if the referendum fails on condition that the turnout surpasses the 12.3 million voters who backed the winning center-right coalition in the 2022 general election.",

      "KIBERA, Kenya -- Dotting the roadside in what is widely considered Africa\u2019s largest urban slum are typical stands selling vegetables. What isn't typical is their acceptance of bitcoin as a form of payment.",
      "Around 200 people use bitcoin in Soweto West, a neighborhood of the Kibera slum in Kenya 's capital. It's part of an initiative to extend financial services to one of the country's poorest and most under-banked areas.",
      "Its promoters say the adoption of crypto fits with the ideals of bitcoin as an accessible, democratic technology \u2014 but experts say it also has major risks.",
      "Bitcoin came to Soweto West via AfriBit Africa, a Kenyan fintech company, through its nonprofit initiative to improve financial inclusion.",
      "\u201cIn many cases, people in Kibera do not have an opportunity to secure their lives with normal savings,\u201d said AfriBit Africa co-founder Ronnie Mdawida, a former community worker. With bitcoin, \"they do not need documentation to have a bank account \u2026 that gives them the foundation for financial freedom.\u201d",
      "Bitcoin, the first and largest crypto, was created in 2009 in the wake of the global financial crisis as a decentralized digital asset that could act as an alternative method of payment.",
      "The asset has found more popular use as a store of value, like a digital form of gold. Bitcoin has attracted enthusiastic supporters as prices have climbed almost 1,000% in the last five years. But its volatility and lack of regulation are concerns.",
      "AfriBit Africa introduced bitcoin into Soweto West in early 2022 through crypto-denominated grants to local garbage collectors, who are often funded by nonprofits. The groups are made up of dozens of young people, who Mdawida says are more likely to be open to new tech.",
      "After gathering on a Sunday to collect trash, garbage collectors are paid a few dollars' worth of bitcoin. AfriBit Africa estimates that it has put some $10,000 into the community, with garbage collectors acting as the main agents of spreading bitcoin in Soweto West. In Kibera, many people earn about a dollar a day.",
      "Now a small number of other residents hold bitcoin, and some merchants and motorcycle taxis accept payments in crypto.",
      "Damiano Magak, 23, a garbage collector and food seller, said he prefers bitcoin to M-PESA, the ubiquitous mobile money platform in Kenya, because M-PESA transaction costs are higher and the network can be slower.",
      "There are no fees for M-PESA transactions between individuals or businesses up to 100 Kenyan shillings (78 cents), but after that the fees increase with transaction size. Fees for the Lightning bitcoin network where transactions take place are free if people use a platform that AfriBit Africa introduced into the community.",
      "Onesmus Many, 30, another garbage collector, said he feels safer with his money in a bitcoin wallet instead of in cash because of crime.",
      "Some merchants have found benefits to accepting crypto, including Dotea Anyim. She said around 10% of customers at her vegetable stand pay in bitcoin.",
      "\u201cI like it because it is cheap and fast and doesn\u2019t have any transaction costs,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen people pay using bitcoin, I save that money and use cash to restock vegetables.\u201d",
      "The possibility that crypto prices could keep rising also appeals to residents of Soweto West. Magak and Many said they now have around 70% to 80% of their net worth in bitcoin, a far higher level of exposure than most people.",
      "\u201cIt is my worth and I\u2019m risking it in bitcoin,\u201d Magak said.",
      "That concerns Ali Hussein Kassim, a fintech entrepreneur and chair of the FinTech Alliance in Kenya.",
      "\u201cIn an extremely volatile asset like bitcoin, it\u2019s overexposure. I can\u2019t afford to lose 80% of my wealth. How about a guy in Kibera?\u201d Kassim said. \u201cYou are exposing a vulnerable community to an ecosystem and to financial services that they can\u2019t necessarily afford to play in.\u201d",
      "Kassim acknowledged the potential benefits that digital assets could bring, particularly in facilitating cheaper cross-border payments like remittances, but failed to see the benefit in Kibera.",
      "Bitcoin\u2019s volatility could negate the benefits of cheaper transaction fees, Kassim said, and bitcoin does not have the same protections as other financial services due to a lack of regulation.",
      "Mdawida disagreed, calling bitcoin\u2019s unregulated nature a benefit.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t shy away from the risks involved,\u201d the AfriBit Africa co-founder said, noting the group\u2019s investments in bitcoin education in Kibera, including financial literacy training and crypto courses in the community.",
      "Efforts to introduce bitcoin into developing countries have faced challenges. Bitcoin was adopted as legal tender in El Salvador and Central African Republic but both countries have reversed their decision.",
      "In Kenya, the digital asset sector has faced legal and regulatory challenges, including crackdowns on cryptocurrency giveaways. This small project, focusing only on Soweto West, has been allowed.",
      "\u201cOn my phone I put notifications on when bitcoin rises \u2026 and it\u2019s all smiles,\" Magak said. \"Whenever it fluctuates up and down, I know at the end of the day it will just rise.\u201d",

      "The discovery emerged last month in the town of Maarat al-Numan in Idlib province, which is strategically located on the route between the cities of Aleppo and Damascus. The community became a touchpoint in the nearly 14-year Syrian civil war that ended with the fall of former President Bashar Assad in a lightning rebel offensive in December.",

      "Aboveground, it\u2019s a residential neighborhood with rows of cinder-block buildings, many of them damaged in the war. Next to one of those buildings, a pit leads down to the openings of two burial chambers, each containing six stone tombs. The sign of the cross is etched into the top of one stone column.",
      "\u201cBased on the presence of the cross and the pottery and glass pieces that were found, this tomb dates back to the Byzantine era,\u201d said Hassan al-Ismail, director of antiquities in Idlib. He noted that the discovery adds to an already rich collection of archeological sites in the area.",
      "Idlib \"has a third of the monuments of Syria, containing 800 archaeological sites in addition to an ancient city,\u201d al-Ismail said.",
      "The Byzantine Empire, which began in the 4th century AD, was a continuation of the Roman empire with its capital in Constantinople \u2014 today's Istanbul \u2014 and Christianity as its official religion.",
      "Abandoned Byzantine-era settlements called Dead Cities stretch across rocky hills and plains in northwest Syria, their weathered limestone ruins featuring remnants of stone houses, basilicas, tombs and colonnaded streets.",
      "In the past, the owners of sites where archeological ruins were found sometimes covered them up, fearful that their property would be seized to preserve the ruins, said Ghiath Sheikh Diab, a resident of Maarat al-Numan who witnessed the moment when the tomb complex was uncovered.",

      "The U.N. Ocean Conference is opening in France as pressure mounts to turn promises into action on protecting the ocean",
      "NICE, France -- The third U.N. Ocean Conference opens Monday as pressure mounts for nations to turn decades of promises into real protection for the sea.",
      "The summit comes as just 2.7% of the ocean is effectively protected from destructive extractive activities, according to the nonprofit Marine Conservation Institute. That's far below the target agreed under the \u201c30x30\u201d pledge to conserve 30% of land and sea by 2030.",
      "Atop this year\u2019s agenda is ratification of the High Seas Treaty. Adopted in 2023, the treaty would for the first time allow nations to establish marine protected areas in international waters, which cover nearly two-thirds of the ocean and are largely ungoverned.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Wild West out there with countries just fishing anywhere without any sort of regulation, and that needs to change,\u201d said Mauro Randone, regional projects manager at the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s Mediterranean Marine Initiative. \u201cThe high seas belong to everyone and no one practically at the same time, and countries are finally committing to establish some rules.\u201d",
      "The ocean is critical in stabilizing Earth\u2019s climate and sustaining life. It generates 50% of the oxygen we breathe, absorbs around 30% of carbon dioxide emissions and captures more than 90% of the excess heat caused by those emissions. Without a healthy ocean, experts warn, climate goals will remain out of reach.",
      "The treaty will only come into force once 60 countries ratify it. As of Monday, just 32 countries had. Advocates hope UNOC can build enough momentum to cross the threshold, which would allow for the first official Oceans Conference of Parties.",
      "\u201cTwo-thirds of the ocean is areas beyond national jurisdiction \u2014 that\u2019s half our planet,\u201d said Minna Epps, director of global ocean policy the International Union for Conservation of Nature. \u201cWe cannot possibly protect 30% of the ocean if it doesn\u2019t include the high seas.\u201d",
      "South Korea, France and the European Union have championed the treaty, but most large ocean nations have yet to ratify it, including the rest of the G20. Thousands of attendees are expected in Nice \u2014 from delegates and heads of state to scientists and industry leaders. The United States has yet to confirm a formal delegation.",
      "Beyond new commitments, the conference highlights the growing gap between marine protection declarations and real-world conservation.",
      "France, the conference co-host, claims to have surpassed the 30% target for marine protection. But environmental groups say only 3% of French waters are fully protected from harmful activities like bottom trawling and industrial fishing.",
      "In 2024 alone, more than 100 bottom-trawling vessels were recorded spending over 17,000 hours fishing within France\u2019s six marine nature parks, according to ocean advocacy group Oceana.",
      "\u201cThe government declares these as protected areas, but this is a lie,\u201d said Enric Sala, founder of National Geographic Pristine Seas marine reserve project. \u201cMost of it is political box-ticking. It\u2019s all paper parks.\u201d",
      "That criticism is echoed across the continent. A new World Wildlife Fund report found that although more than 11% of Europe\u2019s marine area is designated for protection, just 2% of EU waters have management plans in place.",
      "Fabien Boileau, director of marine protected areas at France\u2019s Office for Biodiversity, acknowledged the presence of bottom trawling in French protected areas, but said it was part of a phased strategy.",
      "\u201cIn France, we made the choice to designate large marine protected areas with relatively low levels of regulation at first, betting that stronger protections would be developed over time through local governance,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, we\u2019re gradually increasing the number of zones with stricter protections within those areas.\u201d",
      "While many marine protected areas struggle with enforcement, others show what real protection can achieve. Off the southern coast of France, Port-Cros National Park is one of the oldest marine reserves in the Mediterranean. There, strict anchoring bans have allowed vast seagrass meadows to grow undisturbed. Massive groupers patrol rocky outcrops, brightly colored nudibranchs munch on algae, and schools of large corbs glide through the shallows, undisturbed by fishing lines.",
      "\u201cThanks to the protections that have been in place since 1963, we can observe species that are much larger than elsewhere in the Mediterranean and at a much higher density than in other areas,\" said Hubert Flavigny, manager of Mio Palmo dive center in Hyeres, France.",
      "Still, such examples remain exceptions.",
      "Advocates say industrial fishing lobbies continue to resist stricter protections, despite evidence that well-managed reserves boost long-term fisheries through the \u201cspillover effect,\u201d whereby marine life flourishes in nearby waters.",
      "\u201cProtection is not the problem \u2014 overfishing is the problem,\u201d said Sala. \u201cThe worst enemy of the fishing industry is themselves.\u201d",
      "Frustrated by government inaction, environmental groups have taken enforcement into their own hands. In May, Greenpeace dropped 15 limestone boulders into France\u2019s Golfe du Lion, aiming to physically block bottom trawling in a marine area that has long been designated for protection. The protected zone was established in 2008 to preserve deep-sea ecosystems, yet 12 trawlers continue to operate there, despite scientific warnings of ecological collapse, according to activist group MedReAct. The Golfe is now one of the most overfished areas in the Mediterranean.",
      "The conference will feature 10 panels on topics such as blue finance, sustainable fisheries and plastic pollution. Deep sea mining is expected to feature in broader discussions, while small island states are likely to use the platform to advocate for increased climate adaptation funding. The outcome of these discussions will form the basis of the Nice Ocean Action Plan \u2014 a declaration of voluntary commitments to be adopted by consensus and presented at the United Nations in New York this July.",

      "\u201cThe ship was unlawfully boarded, its unarmed civilian crew abducted, and its life-saving cargo \u2014 including baby formula, food and medical supplies \u2014 confiscated,\u201d it said in a statement. It said the ship was seized in international waters some 200 kilometers (120 miles) from Gaza.",
      "Israel's Foreign Ministry portrayed the voyage as a public relations stunt, saying in a post on X that \"the \u2018selfie yacht\u2019 of the \u2018celebrities\u2019 is safely making its way to the shores of Israel.\u201d",
      "It said the activists would return to their home countries and the aid would be sent to Gaza through established channels. It circulated footage of what appeared to be Israeli military personnel handing out sandwiches and water to the activists, who were wearing orange life vests.",
      "Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesperson, said the ship was still en route to Israel around midday Monday. It was expected to dock at the port of Ashdod.",
      "Thunberg, a climate campaigner, was among 12 activists aboard the Madleen, which set sail from Sicily a week ago. Along the way, it had stopped on Thursday to rescue four migrants who had jumped overboard to avoid being detained by the Libyan coast guard.",
      "\u201cI urge all my friends, family and comrades to put pressure on the Swedish government to release me and the others as soon as possible,\" Thunberg said in a pre-recorded message released after the ship was halted.",
      "Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament who is of Palestinian descent, was also among the volunteers on board. She has been barred from entering Israel because of her opposition to Israeli policies toward the Palestinians.",
      "She was among six French citizens aboard the boat. French President Emmanuel Macron asked Israel to allow them to return to France as soon as possible, his office said in a statement.",
      "Adalah, a rights group in Israel that said it was representing the activists, said Israel had \u201cno legal authority\u201d to take over the ship because it was in international waters and because it was headed not to Israel but to the \u201cterritorial waters of the state of Palestine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe arrest of the unarmed activists, who operated in a civilian manner to provide humanitarian aid, amounts to a serious breach of international law,\u201d Adalah said in a statement.",
      "After a 2\u00bd-month total blockade aimed at pressuring Hamas, Israel started allowing some basic aid into Gaza last month, but humanitarian workers and experts have warned of famine unless the blockade is lifted and Israel ends its military offensive.",
      "An attempt last month by Freedom Flotilla to reach Gaza by sea failed after another of the group\u2019s vessels was attacked by two drones while sailing in international waters off Malta, organizers said. The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the front section of the ship.",
      "Israel and Egypt have imposed varying degrees of blockade on Gaza since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. Israel says the blockade is needed to prevent Hamas from importing arms, while critics say it amounts to collective punishment of Gaza's Palestinian population.",
      "Israel sealed Gaza off from all aid in the early days of the war ignited by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, but later relented under U.S. pressure. In early March, shortly before Israel ended a ceasefire with Hamas, the country again blocked all imports, including food, fuel and medicine.",
      "Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted 251 hostages, most of whom have since been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Hamas is still holding 55 hostages, more than half of them believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants but has said women and children make up most of the dead.",
      "The war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of the territory\u2019s population, leaving people there almost completely dependent on international aid.",
      "Efforts to broker another truce have been deadlocked for months. Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal, while Israel has vowed to continue the war until all the captives are returned and Hamas is defeated or disarmed and exiled.",

      "The monument, they said, will be replaced by a flagpole, as was the case when a different Lenin statue was relocated in the capital, Bishkek.",
      "The move came a week after Kyrgyzstan\u2019s ally Russia unveiled a monument to brutal Soviet dictator Josef Stalin at one of Moscow\u2019s busiest subway stations.",

      "Iranian rapper Tataloo, a face-tattooed star who once supported a hard-line Iranian presidential candidate, now awaits execution",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The tattoos covering Iranian rapper Tataloo's face stand out against the gray prison uniform the 37-year-old now wears as he awaits execution, his own rise and fall tracing the chaos of the last decade of Iranian politics.",
      "Tataloo, whose full name is Amir Hossein Maghsoudloo, faces a death sentence after being convicted on charges of \u201cinsulting Islamic sanctities.\u201d It's a far cry from when he once supported a hard-line Iranian presidential candidate.",
      "Tataloo's music became popular among the Islamic Republic's youth, as it challenged Iran's theocracy at a time when opposition to the country's government was splintered and largely leaderless.",
      "The rapper's lyrics became increasingly political after the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini and the subsequent wave of nationwide protests. He also appeared in music videos which criticized the authorities.",
      "\u201cWhen you show your face in a music video, you are saying, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m here, and I don\u2019t care about your restrictions,\u2019\u201d said Ali Hamedani, a former BBC journalist who interviewed the rapper in 2005. \u201cThat was brave.\u201d",
      "The Iranian Supreme Court last month upheld his death sentence.",
      "\u201cThis ruling has now been confirmed and is ready for execution,\u201d judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir told reporters at a press conference last month.",
      "Activists have decried his looming execution and expressed concern for his safety after he reportedly tried to kill himself in prison.",
      "Tataloo began his music career in 2003 as part of an underground genre of Iranian music that combines Western styles of rap, rhythm-and-blues and rock with Farsi lyrics. His first album, released in 2011, polarized audiences, though he never played publicly in Iran, where its Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance controls all concerts.",
      "Tataloo appeared in a 2015 music video backing Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and Tehran's nuclear program, which long has been targeted by the West over fears it could allow the Islamic Republic to develop an atomic bomb. While he never discussed the motivation behind this, it appeared that the rapper had hoped to win favor with the theocracy or perhaps have a travel ban against him lifted.",
      "In the video for \u201cEnergy Hasteei,\" or \u201cNuclear Energy,\u201d Tataloo sings a power ballad in front of rifle-wielding guardsmen and later aboard the Iranian frigate Damavand in the Caspian Sea. The ship later sank during a storm in 2018.",
      "\u201cThis is our absolute right: To have an armed Persian Gulf,\u201d Tataloo sang.",
      "Tataloo even issued an endorsement for hard-liner Ebrahim Raisi in 2017. That year, the two sat for a televised appearance as part of Raisi's failed presidential campaign against the relative moderate Hassan Rouhani. Raisi later won the presidency in 2021, but was killed in a helicopter crash in 2024.",
      "In 2018, Tataloo \u2014 who faced legal problems in Iran \u2014 was allowed to leave the country for Turkey, where many Persian singers and performers stage lucrative concerts.",
      "Tataloo hosted live video sessions as he rose to fame on social media, where he became well-known for his tattoos covering his face and body. Among them are an Iranian flag and an image of his mother next to a key and heart.",
      "Instagram deactivated his account in 2020 after he called for underage girls to join his \u201cteam\u201d for sex. He also acknowledged taking drugs.",
      "\u201cDespite being a controversial rapper, Tataloo has quite the fanbase in Iran, known as \u2018Tatalities,\u2019\u201d said Holly Dagres, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near-East Policy. \u201cOver the years, they\u2019ve flooded social media with messages of solidarity for him and even campaigned for the rapper\u2019s release in the past when he was detained on separate charges.\u201d",
      "Tataloo\u2019s rebellious music struck a chord with disenfranchised young people in Iran as they struggled to find work, get married and start their adult lives. He also increasingly challenged Iran's theocracy in his lyrics, particularly after the death of Amini following her arrest over allegedly not wearing the hijab to the liking of authorities.",
      "His collaboration \u201cEnghelab Solh\" \u2014 \u201cPeace Revolution\u201d in Farsi \u2014 called out Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei by name.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want tear gas, because there are tears in everyone\u2019s eyes,\u201d he rapped.",
      "But the music stopped for Tataloo in late 2023. He was deported from Turkey after his passport had expired, and was immediately taken into custody upon arrival to Iran.",
      "Tehran\u2019s Criminal Court initially handed Tataloo a five-year sentence for blasphemy. Iran\u2019s Supreme Court threw out the decision and sent his case to another court, which sentenced him to death in January. The rapper already faced ten years in prison for a string of separate convictions, including promoting prostitution and moral corruption.",
      "\u201cTataloo is at serious risk of execution,\u201d Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, the director of advocacy group Iran Human Rights, said in a statement. \u201cThe international community, artists and the public must act to stop his execution.\u201d",
      "Tataloo earlier expressed remorse at a trial.",
      "\u201cI have certainly made mistakes, and many of my actions were wrong,\u201d he said, according to the state-owned Jam-e Jam daily newspaper. \u201cI apologize for the mistakes I made.\u201d",
      "Tataloo married while on death row, his uncle said. Last month, Tataloo reportedly attempted to kill himself, but survived.",
      "His death sentence comes at a politically fraught moment for Iran as the country is at it's \u201cmost isolated,\u201d said Abbas Milani, an Iran expert at Stanford University.",
      "The Islamic Republic is \u201cdesperately trying to see whether it can arrive at a deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program and have the sanctions lifted,\u201d he said. Drawing the ire of Tataloo\u2019s fans is \u201cone headache they don\u2019t need,\u201d he added.",

    "story": [
      "Sub-Saharan Africa has the world's highest school dropout rates and a driving factor is that parents are being crushed by unpredictable school fees",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- A crying parent with an unpaid tuition balance walked into the staff room of a Catholic private school and begged the teachers to help enroll her son.",
      "The school\u2019s policy required the woman pay at least 60% of her son\u2019s full tuition bill before he could join the student body. She didn\u2019t have the money and was led away.",
      "\u201cShe was pleading, \u2018Please help me,\u2019\u201d said Beatrice Akite, a teacher at St. Kizito Secondary School in Uganda\u2019s capital city, who witnessed the outburst. \u201cIt was very embarrassing. We had never seen something like that.\u201d",
      "Two weeks into second term, Akite recounted the woman\u2019s desperate moment to highlight how distressed parents are being crushed by unpredictable fees they can\u2019t pay, forcing their children to drop out of school. It\u2019s leaving many in sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 which has the world\u2019s highest dropout rates \u2014 to criticize the mission-driven Catholic Church for not doing enough to ease the financial pressure families face.",
      "The Catholic Church is the region\u2019s largest nongovernmental investor in education. Catholic schools have long been a pillar of affordable but high-quality education, especially for poor families.",
      "Their appeal remains strong even with competition from other nongovernmental investors now eying schools as enterprises for profit. The growing trend toward privatization is sparking concern that the Catholic Church may price out the people who need uplifting.",
      "Akite hopes Catholic leaders support measures that would streamline fees across schools of comparable quality. Firm fee ceilings need to be set, she said.",
      "Kampala's St. Kizito Secondary School, where Akite teaches literature, was founded by priests of the Comboni missionary order, known for its dedication to serving poor communities. Its students come mostly from working-class families and tuition per term is roughly $300, a substantial sum in a country where GDP per capita was about $1,000 in 2023.",
      "Yet that tuition is lower than at many other Catholic-run schools in Kampala, where many students report later in the term because they can\u2019t raise school fees in time, Akite said.",
      "One of the most expensive private schools in Kampala, the Catholic-run Uganda Martyrs\u2019 Secondary School Namugongo, maintains a policy of \u201czero balance\u201d when a child reports to school at the beginning of a three-month term. This means students must be fully paid by the time they report to school.",
      "Tuition at the school was once as high as $800 but has since dropped to about $600 as enrollment swelled to nearly 5,000, said deputy headmaster James Batte. On a recent morning, there was a queue of parents waiting outside Batte\u2019s office to request more time to clear tuition balances.",
      "Daniel Birungi, an electrical engineer in Kampala whose son enrolled this year at St. Mary\u2019s College Kisubi, a leading school for boys in Uganda, said the emerging risk for traditional Catholic schools is to cater only to the rich.",
      "There is hot water in the bathrooms, he said, describing what he felt was a trend toward levels of luxury he never imagined as a student there in the 1990s. Now, students are prohibited from packing snacks and instead encouraged to buy what they need from school-owned canteens, he said.",
      "That has \u201cput us under a lot of pressure,\u201d he said.",
      "Tuition at St. Mary\u2019s College Kisubi is roughly $800 per term, and Birungi doubts he will be able to regularly pay school fees on time. \u201cYou can go there and see the brother and negotiate,\u201d he said, referring to the headmaster. \u201cI am planning to go there and see him and ask for that consideration.\u201d",
      "The World Bank reported in 2023 that 54% of adults in sub-Saharan Africa rank the issue of paying school fees higher than medical bills and other expenses. That\u2019s partly because education is largely in private hands, with the most desirable schools controlled by profit-seeking owners.",
      "Schools run by the Catholic Church are not usually registered as profit-making entities, but those who run those schools say they wouldn\u2019t be competitive if they were run merely as charities. They say they face the same maintenance costs as others in the field and offer scholarships to exceptional students.",
      "Regulating tuition is not easy, said Ronald Reagan Okello, a priest who oversees education at the Catholic Secretariat in Kampala. He urges parents to send their children to schools they can afford.",
      "\u201cAs the Catholic Church, also we are competing with those who are in the private sector,\u201d said Okello, the national executive secretary for education with the Ugandan bishops conference. \u201cNow, as you are competing, the other ones are setting the bar high. They are giving you good services. But now putting the standard to that level, we are forced to raise the school fees to match the demands of the people who can afford.\u201d",
      "Across the region, the Catholic Church has built a reputation as a key provider of formal education in areas often underserved by the state. Its schools are cherished by families of all means for their values, discipline and academic success.",
      "In Zimbabwe, the Catholic Church operates about 100 schools, ranging from dozens in impoverished areas where annual tuition is as low as $150 to elite boarding schools that can charge thousands of dollars.",
      "But a legacy of inclusion is under pressure in the southern African nation due to fee increases at boarding schools and efforts by Catholic leaders to fully privatize some schools. Many boarding schools already charge tuition fees between $600 and $800, prohibitive for the working class in a country where most civil servants make less than a $300 per month.",
      "Privatization will raise tuition fees even higher, warned Peter Muzawazi, a prominent educator in Zimbabwe.",
      "Muzawazi, who attended Catholic schools, once was the headmaster of Marist Brothers, a top Catholic school for boys in Zimbabwe. That school in Nyanga is among those earmarked for privatization.",
      "\u201cI know in the Catholic Church there is a lot of space for reasonable fees for day scholars, but for boarders there is need to be watching because the possibility that they would be out of reach for the vulnerable is there,\u201d he said.",
      "The church needs to be actively engaged, he said. \u201cHow do we continue to guarantee education for the poor?\u201d",
      "Efforts to privatize church-founded schools have sparked debate in Zimbabwe, which for years has been in economic decline stemming in part from sanctions imposed by the U.S. and others. Authorities say privatizing these schools is necessary to maintain standards, even as critics warn Catholic leaders not to turn their backs on poor people.",
      "\u201cSchools have now turned into businesses,\u201d Martin Chaburumunda, president of the Zimbabwe Rural Teachers\u2019 Union, told The Manica Post, a state-run weekly. \u201cChurches now appear only hungry for money as opposed to educating the communities they operate in.\"",
      "Rather than privatizing old mission schools, the church should invest in building new ones if it\u2019s useful to experiment with different funding models, said Muzawazi, a lay Catholic who serves on the governing council of the Catholic University of Zimbabwe.",
      "\u201cThe bright people who advance the cause of countries are not the rich ones,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want every church and every nation to tap the potential of every person, regardless of economic status.\u201d",

      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says that Canada will meet NATO\u2019s military spending guideline by early next year",
      "TORONTO -- Canada will meet NATO's military spending guideline by early next year and diversify defense spending away from the United States, which he says no longer plays a predominant role on the world stage, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Monday.",
      "Carney said Canada will achieve NATO\u2019s spending target of 2% of gross domestic product five years earlier than it had previously planned.",
      "\u201cOur military infrastructure and equipment have aged, hindering our military preparedness,\" Carney said. \u201cOnly one of our four submarines is seaworthy. Less than half of our maritime fleet and land vehicles are operational. More broadly we are too reliant on the United States.\u201d",
      "According to NATO figures, Canada was estimated to be spending 1.33% of GDP on its military budget in 2023, below the 2% target that NATO countries have set for themselves. Canada previously said it was on track to meet NATO\u2019s spending target by the end of the decade.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to protect Canadians, not to satisfy NATO accountants,\u201d Carney said.",
      "The announcement of increased spending came as Canada is about to host U.S. President Donald Trump and other leaders at a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations in Alberta on June 15-17, and before the NATO summit in Europe. It also comes as NATO allies are poised to increase the commitment well beyond the 2% target.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said last week that most U.S. allies at NATO endorse Trump\u2019s demand that they invest 5% of gross domestic product on their defense needs and are ready to ramp up security spending even more.",
      "Carney has said that he intends to diversify Canada\u2019s procurement and enhance the country\u2019s relationship with the EU.",
      "\u201cWe should no longer send three quarters of our defense capital spending to America,\u201d Carney said in a speech at the University of Toronto. \u201cWe will invest in new submarines, aircraft, ships, armed vehicles and artillery, as well as new radar, drones and sensors to monitor the seafloor and the Arctic.\u201d",
      "Canada has been in discussions with the European Union to join an EU drive to break its security dependency on the United States, with a focus on buying more defense equipment, including fighter jets, in Europe. Carney\u2019s government is reviewing the purchase of U.S. F-35 fighter jets to see if there are other options.",
      "\u201cWe stood shoulder to shoulder with the Americans throughout the Cold War and in the decades that followed, as the United States played a predominant role on the world stage. Today, that predominance is a thing of the past,\u201d Carney said in French.",
      "He added that with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the United States became the global hegemon, noting its gravitational pull, always strong, became virtually irresistible and made the U.S. \u201cour closest ally and dominant trading partner.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow the United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony: charging for access to its markets and reducing its relative contributions to our collective security,\u201d Carney said.",
      "The prime minister said that \"a new imperialism threatens.\u201d",
      "\u201cMiddle powers compete for interests and attention, knowing that if they are not at the table, they will be on the menu,\" Carney said.",
      "Trump\u2019s calls to make Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, and Carney won the job of prime minister after promising to confront the increased aggression shown by Trump.",
      "Carney said that the long-held view that Canada\u2019s geographic location will protect Canadians is becoming increasingly archaic.",
      "European allies and Canada have already been investing heavily in their armed forces, as well as on weapons and ammunition, since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",

      "The British government say it is reversing its unpopular plan to end winter home heating subsidies for millions of retirees",
      "LONDON -- The British government on Monday reversed its unpopular plan to end winter home heating subsidies for millions of retirees.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had signaled the u-turn last month after a loud outcry from the public and some members of his Labour Party who thought the relatively modest 1.5 billion-pound ($2 billion) savings were too politically costly.",
      "Treasury chief Rachel Reeves, who canceled the payment for home heating on all but the poorest retirees after Labour came to power last summer, said the benefit would be restored to 9 million people, or three-quarters of pensioners, in England and Wales whose incomes are below 35,000 pounds ($47,500). Reeves said the move was necessary last year because the previous Conservative government had left public finances in a dire state.",
      "\u201cTargeting winter fuel payments was a tough decision, but the right decision because of the inheritance we had been left by the previous government,\" Reeves said. \u201cIt is also right that we continue to means-test this payment so that it is targeted and fair, rather than restoring eligibility to everyone including the wealthiest.\u201d",
      "The payments are worth between 200 and 300 pounds ($271 and $406) a year. The reversal will cost the government 1.25 billion, Reeve said.",
      "Canceling the payments for most people last winter was blamed for contributing to Starmer's swift decline in popularity after his party came to power in a landslide. He was blamed for punishing elderly people on limited incomes who struggled to make ends meet during a cost-of-living crisis.",
      "Labour fared poorly in local elections in England last month, with many party representatives blaming the removal of the winter fuel payment.",
      "Kemi Badenoch, leader of the main opposition Conservative Party, quickly pounced on Starmer's about-face.",
      "\u201cKeir Starmer has scrambled to clear up a mess of his own making,\" she said. \u201cThis humiliating u-turn will come as scant comfort to the pensioners forced to choose between heating and eating last winter. The prime minister should now apologize for his terrible judgment.\u201d",

      "The crypto industry is seeing growing support from the Democratic Party, though it's far from unanimous",
      "WASHINGTON -- As President Donald Trump builds a crypto empire \u2014 including hosting a private dinner with top investors at his golf club \u2014 Democrats have united in condemning what they call blatant corruption from the White House.",
      "But the Democratic Party\u2019s own relationship with the emerging crypto industry is far less cut and dried.",
      "Work in the Republican-led Senate to legitimize cryptocurrency by adding guardrails has drawn backing from some Democrats, underscoring growing support for the industry in the party. But divisions have opened over the bill, with many demanding it prevent the Republican president and his family from directly profiting from cryptocurrency.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m all on board with the idea of regulating crypto,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. \u201cBut at this moment, when cryptocurrency is being so clearly used by Donald Trump to facilitate his corruption, I don\u2019t think you can close your eyes to that when you\u2019re legislating.\u201d",
      "The legislation is moving ahead more rapidly than Congress usually acts when an industry is new. But the big money and campaign donations flowing from cryptocurrency firms have made them a new powerhouse on the political scene, one that's increasingly gaining allies and capturing the attention of lawmakers.",
      "A look at what to know about the industry's clout and the political fight over what's known as the GENIUS Act:",
      "To understand the growing clout of the crypto industry, look no further than the 2024 election. Fairshake, a crypto super political action committee, and its affiliated PACs spent more than $130 million in congressional races.",
      "Fairshake spent roughly $40 million supporting Republican Bernie Moreno in Ohio in an effort to defeat Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. Brown, who lost to Moreno by more than 3 percentage points, was seen as a chief critic of the industry as the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.",
      "\u201cDC received a clear message that being anti-crypto is a good way to end your career, as it doesn\u2019t represent the will of the voters,\u201d Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, wrote in a social media post the day after the 2024 election.",
      "Coinbase \u2014 the largest crypto exchange in the U.S. and biggest contributor to Fairshake \u2014 does not view support for its industry as partisan, according to Kara Calvert, the company's vice president of U.S. policy. The industry also spent heavily to support Democrats Ruben Gallego and Elissa Slotkin in their races for open Senate seats in battleground states.",
      "Fairshake spent $10 million in support of Slotkin during her successful Senate run against Republican Mike Rodgers, and Slotkin, who won the Michigan race by fewer than 20,000 votes, spoke in favor of crypto on the campaign trail. Slotkin declined to be interviewed.",
      "Similar dynamics are setting up ahead of 2026 in contested House and Senate races. Fairshake said in January that it already had $116 million in cash on hand aimed at the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not slowing down, and everything remains on the table,\u201d Josh Vlasto, a spokesperson for Fairshake, told The Associated Press.",
      "Hours before a May 19 vote to move forward on cryptocurrency legislation in the Senate, an advocacy group tied to Coinbase sent an email to the offices of U.S. senators warning that the vote would count toward their crypto-friendliness scores.",
      "\u201cWhat the spending does is put crypto on the map. It lets members know that this is not a phase, this is real industry, with real dollars, that is developing its hold in Washington,\u201d said Calvert.",
      "A significant number of Democrats, 16, joined Republicans in advancing the crypto legislation. The GENIUS Act would create a new regulatory structure for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. It is viewed as a step toward consumer protections and greater legitimacy for the industry.",
      "The sticking point for many Democrats is that while the bill prohibits members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins, it excludes the president from those restrictions.",
      "Trump, once a skeptic of the industry, has vowed in his second term to make the U.S. the global capital of crypto. Meanwhile, he and his family have moved aggressively into nearly every corner of the industry: mining operations, billion-dollar bitcoin purchases, a newly minted stablecoin and a Trump-branded meme coin.",
      "Days after Trump\u2019s interests in the industry became public in early May, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York urged the Democratic caucus to unite and vote against the package to have a stronger hand in negotiations, according to a person familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss private discussions.",
      "On May 8, a bloc of Senate Democrats who had previously backed the GENIUS Act reversed course \u2014 ultimately voting to block the bill from advancing. Negotiations between Senate Democrats and Republicans followed. The White House was also involved, and in contact with senators' offices on both sides of the aisle, according to a senior official granted anonymity to discuss private conversations.",
      "The new version of the bill is now expected to pass the 100-member Senate this month. Amendments are still possible. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. has filed an amendment \u2014 cosponsored by Schumer \u2014 that would bar the president and his family from profiting off stablecoins, though it\u2019s unlikely to pass.",
      "\u201cThere is room for improvements as there often is with a lot of legislation. But with this in particular, we\u2019ve got issues with the president,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona \u201cHaving said that, this was negotiated with Democrats and Republicans. We got to a place. We voted on it. I expect this is the version we\u2019re going to pass.\u201d",
      "Still, the legislation is stirring unease. Schumer, asked if he\u2019s urging members to vote against the bill, noted that he has opposed the legislation and said \u201cthere\u2019s division in our caucus on that issue.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a gaping hole in this bill that everybody sees,\" Murphy said. \"After it\u2019s passed, it will be illegal for me to issue a cryptocurrency, but it\u2019s legal for the president of the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf this bill passes, we kind of go from a dirt road to a paved road,\u201d he said.",
      "If the Senate approves the stablecoin legislation, the bill will still need to clear the House before reaching the president\u2019s desk.",
      "Crypto advocates say the next priority is pushing Congress for market structure legislation, a far more sweeping effort than simply regulating stablecoins.",
      "\u201cStablecoin is one step of the path. Then you need market structure. We're hopeful that the Senate works together to pass something quickly,\u201d Calvert said.",
      "Some Democrats view the legislation as a chance to impose basic guardrails on a rapidly growing industry that's particularly popular among men and younger voters, two groups that drifted from the party in 2024.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate has set an ambitious timeline to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping legislation to cut taxes and spending",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate has set an ambitious timeline for passing President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping legislation to cut taxes and spending. But getting it on the Republican president's desk by July 4 will require some big decisions, and soon.",
      "Republican senators are airing concerns about different parts of the legislation, including cuts to Medicaid, changes to food aid and the impact on the deficit. To push the bill to passage, Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota and other negotiators will need to find a compromise that satisfies both ends of their conference \u2014 and that can still satisfy the House, which passed the bill last month by only one vote.",
      "A look at some of the groups and senators who leaders will have to convince as they work to push Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d bill toward a Senate vote:",
      "Every Republican senator represents a state with a rural constituency \u2014 and some of their states are among the most rural in the country. Many in those less-populated areas rely heavily on Medicaid for health care, leading several of them to warn that the changes to the program in the bill could be devastating to communities that are already struggling.",
      "Of particular concern is a freeze on a so-called provider tax that some states use to help pay for large portions of their Medicaid programs. The extra tax often leads to higher payments from the federal government, which critics say is a loophole that allows states to inflate their budgets. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and several others have argued that freezing that tax revenue would hurt rural hospitals, in particular.",
      "\u201cHospitals will close,\u201d Hawley said last month. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple. And that pattern will replicate in states across the country.\u201d",
      "Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville said Thursday that provider taxes in his state are \u201cthe money we use for Medicaid.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou start cutting that out, we\u2019ve got big problems,\u201d Tuberville said. Eliminating those taxes \u201cmight lose some folks.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Republican senators have little interest in a House-passed provision that spends more money by raising a cap on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT. The higher cap traditionally benefits more urban areas in states with high taxes, such as New York and California.",
      "The House included the new cap after New York Republicans threatened to oppose the bill, but Senate Republicans uniformly dislike it. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to have to be some adjustment\u201d on the SALT provision, Thune said Wednesday, noting that \u201csenators are just in a very different place\u201d from the House.",
      "The House-passed bill would also shift some Medicaid and food stamp costs to states, a change that has the former governors in the Senate, in particular, worried.",
      "West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice, who was governor of his state for eight years before his election to the Senate last year, said he favors many aspects of the bill. He supports the new work requirements for Medicaid and food stamp recipients, the restrictions on benefits for immigrants who are in the country illegally and the efforts to cut down on fraud. \u201cThere\u2019s real savings there,\u201d Justice said. \u201cBut then we ought to stop.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re on our way to cannibalizing ourselves,\u201d Justice said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to hurt kids and hurt our families.\u201d",
      "The provision stirring the most unease would shift 5% of administrative costs to the state for administering food stamps \u2014 known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. States that have high error rates in the program would have to take on an even higher percentage of federal costs.",
      "North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, also a former governor, said senators are working to get feedback from current governors and may propose some \u201cincentive-oriented ideas\u201d instead of a penalty for the high error rates.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the states have really looked at the impacts of some of this yet,\u201d Hoeven said.",
      "Tuberville, who is running for governor of Alabama next year, said the program should be reformed instead of shifting costs.",
      "\u201cI know what our budget is and what we can afford, and we can\u2019t start a federal program and then say, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s, let\u2019s send it back to the states and let them take a big hunk of it,\u2019\u201d Tuberville said. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s not the way we do it.\u201d",
      "Thune needs to bring Republican moderates on board with the bill, including Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Both have reservations with the Medicaid cuts, among other things.",
      "Collins said she wants to review how the SNAP changes will affect her state. Murkowski has questioned expiring subsidies for the Affordable Care Act and whether they might be needed if people are kicked off Medicaid.",
      "Last month, Murkowski said she wants to make sure that people are not negatively impacted by the bill, \u201cso we\u2019re looking at it through that lens for both Medicaid and on energy.\u201d",
      "Murkowski and Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas have also supported energy tax credits that would be phased out quickly under the House bill. The four senators argued that the quick repeal creates uncertainty for businesses and could raise prices for consumers.",
      "Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Lee of Utah and Rick Scott of Florida have argued the legislation does not save enough money and threatened to vote against it.",
      "Paul is considered the least likely to support the measure. He says he won\u2019t vote for it if it raises the debt ceiling \u2014 a key priority for GOP leaders in both the House and the Senate. The package would raise the nation\u2019s debt limit by $4 trillion to allow more borrowing to pay the nation's bills, as the Treasury Department says the limit needs to be raised by the middle of July.",
      "Johnson has been railing against the legislation since it was unveiled in the House, arguing that it does little to reduce government spending over time. He took those arguments to Trump last week at a meeting between the president and members of the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "After the meeting, Johnson said he would continue to argue that the bill needs to do more to cut costs. But he said he came away with the recognition that he needed to be \u201cmore positive\u201d as Trump exerts political pressure on Republicans to pass it.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a long ways from making the deficit curve bend down, but I recognize that\u2019s going to take time,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe truth is, there are a lot of good things in this bill that I absolutely support. I want it to succeed.\u201d",

      "The changes at Majid Al Futtaim come as Dubai tries to guide the family-run businesses that powered the city-state's growth in the United Arab Emirates through generational change. Authorities also likely want to avoid any further infighting that could slow down the growth of a firm that long has made hiring Emiratis a key goal.",
      "The Financial Times first reported on the changes to Majid Al Futtaim's board, saying it came at the orders of a government-established special judicial committee.",
      "In 2022, Dubai\u2019s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, established a special judicial committee to look after the estate of Majid Al Futtaim's founder \u2014 also named Majid Al Futtaim \u2014 following his death in 2021.",
      "Responding to questions Monday from The Associated Press, the company appeared to acknowledge the changes at Majid Al Futtaim Capital, which oversees its group of companies.",
      "The changes \u201creflect a shareholder-led effort to evolve governance in line with the long-term interests of the Group,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThese changes do not affect the operations or governance of Majid Al Futtaim Holding. Majid Al Futtaim continues to operate under an independent board and strong oversight.\u201d",
      "Dubai's government did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Financial Times described Majid Al Futtaim's parent company as now being overseen by five government and four family representatives.",
      "Succession battles aren\u2019t unusual in the United Arab Emirates, where family-run businesses dominate private enterprise. Rulers have given merchant families broad control over different sectors in exchange for the promise of big investments and fast-paced development.",
      "But over the years, that economic strategy has caused headaches for authorities, who have intervened when patriarchs die and tensions between disgruntled relatives boil over.",
      "Majid Al Futtaim is a mainstay of the local consumer economy. It\u2019s also a giant in the broader Gulf Arab region, owning and operating prominent hotels, entertainment venues and shopping malls. Its portfolio includes the Mall of the Emirates, a major tourist draw in Dubai that houses the Middle East\u2019s first-ever indoor ski slope. It also runs regional franchises for global brands, including Lego.",

      "BAGHDAD -- Tensions have escalated between Iraq\u2019s central government in Baghdad and the semiautonomous Kurdish region in the country\u2019s north in a long-running dispute over the sharing of oil revenues.",
      "The central government has accused the Kurdish regional authorities of making illegal deals and facilitating oil smuggling. Baghdad cut off funding for public sector salaries in the Kurdish region ahead of the Eid al-Adha holiday. Kurdish authorities called the move \u201ccollective punishment\u201d and threatened to retaliate.",
      "It\u2019s the latest flare-up in a long-running dispute between officials in Baghdad and Irbil, the seat of the Kurdish regional government, over sharing of oil revenues. In 2014, the Kurdish region decided to unilaterally export oil through an independent pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan.",
      "The central government considers it illegal for Irbil to export oil without going through the Iraqi national oil company and filed a case against Turkey in the International Court of Arbitration, arguing that Turkey was violating the provisions of the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline agreement signed in 1973.",
      "Iraq stopped sending oil through the pipeline in March 2023 after the arbitration court ruled in Baghdad\u2019s favor. Attempts to reach a deal to restart exports have repeatedly stalled.",
      "Last month, Prime Minister Masrour Barzani of the Iraqi Kurdish regional government traveled to Washington, where he inked two major energy deals with U.S. companies. The federal government in Baghdad then sued in an Iraqi court, asserting that it was illegal for the regional government to make the deals without going through Baghdad.",
      "The Iraqi Ministry of Finance announced a decision last month to halt funding for salaries of public sector employees in the Kurdish region. The move sparked widespread outrage in Irbil, triggering strong political and public reactions.",
      "The ministry said in a statement that the decision was due to the Kurdish regional authorities\u2019 \u201cfailure to hand over oil and non-oil revenues to the federal treasury, as stipulated in the federal budget laws.\u201d It added that any transfer of funds would be conditional on \u201cthe region\u2019s commitment to transparency and financial accountability.\u201d",
      "The federal Ministry of Oil accused Irbil of failing to deliver crude oil produced in the region\u2019s fields to the ministry for export through the state-run SOMO company, which it said had led to massive financial losses amounting to billions of dollars.",
      "The ministry warned that \u201ccontinued non-compliance jeopardizes Iraq\u2019s international reputation and obligations, forcing the federal government to reduce oil production in other provinces to stay within Iraq\u2019s OPEC quota \u2014 which includes Iraqi Kurdish production, regardless of its legality.\u201d",
      "Baghdad has also accused Irbil of smuggling oil out of the country. An Iraqi official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly said the government had tracked 240 cases of illegal border crossings from Iraq\u2019s Kurdish region into Iran between Dec. 25, 2024, and May 24, 2025, aimed at smuggling oil derivatives.",
      "The Kurdish region\u2019s Ministry of Natural Resources in a statement called those allegations \u201ca smokescreen to distract from widespread corruption and smuggling in other parts of Iraq. The KRG agreed to sell its oil through SOMO, opened an escrow account, and handed over revenues \u2014 yet Baghdad failed to meet its financial obligations.\u201d",
      "It accused the federal government of being responsible for the halt in oil exports via Turkey due to the lawsuit it filed in 2023 and said the Kurdish region had delivered over 11 million barrels of oil to the Ministry of Oil without receiving any financial compensation.",
      "The ministry accused Baghdad of \u201cviolating the constitution and pursuing a deliberate policy of collective punishment and starvation against the people\" of the Kurdish region through the halt in funding for salaries.",
      "Barzani in a statement on the eve of the Eid al-Adha holiday described the withholding of salaries as an \u201cunjust and oppressive decision\u201d and a \u201cpolicy of mass starvation\u201d comparable to the chemical attacks and \u201cgenocide\u201d launched by Iraq\u2019s former longtime strongman ruler, Saddam Hussein, against the Kurds.",
      "The Iraqi Kurdish people \"have resisted with steadfastness and courage in the face of all forms of pressure and tyranny\u201d and \u201cregret was the fate of the tyrants,\" he said.",

      "The crashes, which began late last year and carried into 2025, were the tipoff to a sophisticated cyberattack that may have allowed hackers to infiltrate a phone without a single click from the user.",
      "The attackers left no clues about their identities, but investigators at the cybersecurity firm iVerify noticed that the victims all had something in common: They worked in fields of interest to China's government and had been targeted by Chinese hackers in the past.",
      "Foreign hackers have increasingly identified smartphones, other mobile devices and the apps they use as a weak link in U.S. cyberdefenses. Groups linked to China's military and intelligence service have targeted the smartphones of prominent Americans and burrowed deep into telecommunication networks, according to national security and tech experts.",
      "It shows how vulnerable mobile devices and apps are and the risk that security failures could expose sensitive information or leave American interests open to cyberattack, those experts say.",
      "\u201cThe world is in a mobile security crisis right now,\u201d said Rocky Cole, a former cybersecurity expert at the National Security Agency and Google and now chief operations officer at iVerify. \u201cNo one is watching the phones.\u201d",

      "U.S. intelligence officials have said China poses a significant, persistent threat to U.S. economic and political interests, and it has harnessed the tools of digital conflict: online propaganda and disinformation, artificial intelligence and cyber surveillance and espionage designed to deliver a significant advantage in any military conflict.",
      "Mobile networks are a top concern. The U.S. and many of its closest allies have banned Chinese telecom companies from their networks. Other countries, including Germany, are phasing out Chinese involvement because of security concerns. But Chinese tech firms remain a big part of the systems in many nations, giving state-controlled companies a global footprint they could exploit for cyberattacks, experts say.",

      "Mobile devices can buy stocks, launch drones and run power plants. Their proliferation has often outpaced their security.",

      "It\u2019s unclear how the person obtained Wiles\u2019 connections, but they apparently gained access to the contacts in her personal cellphone, The Wall Street Journal reported. The messages and calls were not coming from Wiles\u2019 number, the newspaper reported.",
      "While most smartphones and tablets come with robust security, apps and connected devices often lack these protections or the regular software updates needed to stay ahead of new threats. That makes every fitness tracker, baby monitor or smart appliance another potential foothold for hackers looking to penetrate networks, retrieve information or infect systems with malware.",
      "Federal officials launched a program this year creating a \u201ccyber trust mark\u201d for connected devices that meet federal security standards. But consumers and officials shouldn\u2019t lower their guard, said Snehal Antani, former chief technology officer for the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Special Operations Command.",

      "The U.S. Commerce Department issued guidance saying the use of Ascend AI chips from Huawei, a leading Chinese tech company, could violate U.S. export controls. That's because the chips were likely developed with American technology despite restrictions on its export to China, the guidance said.",
      "The Chinese government wasn't pleased. One of its biggest beefs in recent years has been over U.S. moves to limit the access of Chinese companies to technology, and in particular to equipment and processes needed to produce the most advanced semiconductors.",
      "\"The Chinese side urges the U.S. side to immediately correct its erroneous practices,\u201d a Commerce Ministry spokesperson said.",

      "\u201cThe bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,\u201d Trump posted on May 30.",
      "The Chinese government indicated Saturday that it is addressing the concerns, which have come from European companies as well. A Commerce Ministry statement said it had granted some approvals and \u201cwill continue to strengthen the approval of applications that comply with regulations.\u201d",
      "The scramble to resolve the rare earth issue shows that China has a strong card to play if it wants to strike back against tariffs or other measures.",
      "Student visas don't normally figure in trade talks, but a U.S. announcement that it would begin revoking the visas of some Chinese students has emerged as another thorn in the relationship.",

      "A new study that examined five years\u2019 worth of prices at one U.S. grocery chain found that digital price tags haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges",
      "Digital price labels, which are rapidly replacing paper shelf tags at U.S. supermarkets, haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges, according to a new study that examined five years' worth of prices at one grocery chain.",
      "But some shoppers, consumer advocates and lawmakers remain skeptical about the tiny electronic screens, which let stores change prices instantly from a central computer instead of having workers swap out paper labels by hand.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s corporations vs. the humans, and that chasm between us goes further and further,\u201d said Dan Gallant, who works in sports media in Edmonton, Canada. Gallant's local Loblaws supermarket recently switched to digital labels.",
      "Social media is filled with warnings that grocers will use the technology to charge more for ice cream if it\u2019s hot outside, hike the price of umbrellas if it\u2019s raining or to gather information about customers.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania fired off a letter to Kroger last fall demanding to know whether it would use its electronic labels as part of a dynamic pricing strategy.",
      "Lawmakers in Rhode Island and Maine have introduced bills to limit the use of digital labels. In Arizona, Democratic state Rep. Cesar Aguilar recently introduced a bill that would ban them altogether.",
      "The bill hasn\u2019t gotten a hearing, but Aguilar said he\u2019s determined to start a conversation about digital labels and how stores could abuse them.",
      "\u201cGrocery stores study when people go shopping the most. And so you might be able to see a price go down one day and then go up another day,\u201d Aguilar told The Associated Press.",
      "Researchers say those fears are misplaced. A study published in late May found \u201cvirtually no surge pricing\u201d before or after electronic shelf labels were adopted. The study was authored by Ioannis Stamatopoulos of the University of Texas, Austin, Robert Evan Sanders of the University of California, San Diego and Robert Bray of Northwestern University",
      "The researchers looked at prices between 2019 and 2024 at an unnamed grocery chain than began using digital labels in October 2022. They found that temporary price increases affected 0.005% of products on any given day before electronic shelf labels were introduced, a share that increased by only 0.0006 percentage points after digital labels were installed.",
      "The study also determined that discounts were slightly more common after digital labels were introduced.",
      "Economists have long wondered why grocery prices don\u2019t change more often, according to Stamatopoulos. If bananas are about to expire, for example, it makes sense to lower the price on them. He said the cost of having workers change prices by hand could be one issue.",
      "But there\u2019s another reason: Shoppers watch grocery prices closely, and stores don\u2019t want to risk angering them.",
      "\u201cSelling groceries is not selling a couch. It\u2019s not a one-time transaction and you will never see them again,\u201d Stamatopoulos said. \u201cYou want them coming to the store every week.\u201d",
      "Electronic price labels aren\u2019t new. They\u2019ve been in use for more than a decade at groceries in Europe and some U.S. retailers, like Kohl's.",
      "But they\u2019ve been slow to migrate to U.S. grocery stores. Only around 5% to 10% of U.S. supermarkets now have electronic labels, compared to 80% in Europe, said Amanda Oren, vice president of industry strategy for North American grocery at Relex Solutions, a technology company that helps retailers forecast demand.",
      "Oren said cost is one issue that has slowed the U.S. rollout. The tiny screens cost between $5 and $20, Oren said, but every product a store sells needs one, and the average supermarket has 100,000 or more individual products.",
      "Still, the U.S. industry is charging ahead. Walmart, the nation's largest grocer and retailer, hopes to have digital price labels at 2,300 U.S. stores by 2026. Kroger is expanding the use of digital labels this year after testing them at 20 stores. Whole Foods is testing the labels in nearly 50 stores.",
      "Companies say electronic price labels have tremendous advantages. Walmart says it used to take employees two days to change paper price labels on the 120,000 items it has in a typical store. With digital tags, it takes a few minutes.",
      "The labels can also be useful. Some have codes shoppers can scan to see recipes or nutrition information. Instacart has a system in thousands of U.S. stores, including Aldi and Schnucks, that flashes a light on the digital tag when Instacart shoppers are nearby to help them find products.",
      "Ahold Delhaize\u2019s Albert Heijn supermarket chain in the Netherlands and Belgium has been testing an artificial intelligence-enabled tool since 2022 that marks down prices on its digital labels every 15 minutes for products nearing expiration. The system has reduced more than 250 tons of food waste annually, the company said.",
      "But Warren and Casey are skeptical. In their letter to Kroger, the U.S. senators noted a partnership with Microsoft that planned to put cameras in grocery aisles and offer personalized deals to shoppers depending on their gender and age.",
      "In its response, Kroger said the prices shown on its digital labels were not connected to any sort of facial recognition technology. It also denied surging prices during periods of peak demand.",
      "\u201cKroger\u2019s business model is built on a foundation of lowering prices to attract more customers,\u201d the company said.",
      "Aguilar, the Arizona lawmaker, said he also opposes the transition to digital labels because he thinks they will cost jobs. His constituents have pointed out that grocery prices keep rising even though there are fewer workers in checkout lanes, he said.",
      "\u201cThey are supposed to be part of our community, and that means hiring people from our community that fill those jobs,\" Aguilar said.",
      "But Relex Solutions' Oren said she doesn't think cutting labor costs is the main reason stores deploy digital price tags.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about working smarter, not harder, and being able to use that labor in better ways across the store rather than these very mundane, repetitive tasks,\u201d she said.",

      "The president has a patch handy, though: his sweeping import taxes \u2014 tariffs.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office, the government\u2019s nonpartisan arbiter of tax and spending matters, says the One Big Beautiful Bill, passed by the House last month and now under consideration in the Senate, would increase federal budget deficits by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. That is because its tax cuts would drain the government\u2019s coffers faster than its spending cuts would save money.",
      "By bringing in revenue for the Treasury, on the other hand, the tariffs that Trump announced through May 13 \u2014 including his so-called reciprocal levies of up to 50% on countries with which the United States has a trade deficit \u2014 would offset the budget impact of the tax-cut bill and reduce deficits over the next decade by $2.5 trillion.",
      "So it\u2019s basically a wash.",
      "That\u2019s the budget math anyway. The real answer is more complicated.",

Bush\u2019s Treasury Department.",
      "Trump has long advocated tariffs as an economic elixir. He says they can protect American industries, bring factories back to the United States, give him leverage to win concessions over foreign governments \u2014 and raise a lot of money. He\u2019s even suggested that they could replace the federal income tax, which now brings in about half of federal revenue.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s possible we\u2019ll do a complete tax cut,\u2019\u2019 he told reporters in April. \u201cI think the tariffs will be enough to cut all of the income tax.\u2019\u2019",
      "Economists and budget analysts do not share the president\u2019s enthusiasm for using tariffs to finance the government or to replace other taxes. \u201cIt\u2019s a really bad trade,\u2019\u2019 said Erica York, the Tax Foundation\u2019s vice president of federal tax policy. \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps the dumbest tax reform you could design.\u2019\u2019",
      "For one thing, Trump\u2019s tariffs are an unstable source of revenue. He bypassed Congress and imposed his biggest import tax hikes through executive orders. That means a future president could simply reverse them.",
      "\u201cOr political whims in Congress could change, and they could decide, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going revoke this authority because we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good thing that the president can just unilaterally impose a $2 trillion tax hike,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 York said.",
      "Or the courts could kill his tariffs before Congress or future presidents do. A federal court in New York has already struck down the centerpiece of his tariff program \u2014 the reciprocal and other levies he announced on what he called \u201cLiberation Day\u2019\u2019 April 2 \u2014 saying he\u2019d overstepped his authority. An appeals court has allowed the government to keep collecting the levies while the legal challenge winds its way through the court system.",
      "Economists also say that tariffs damage the economy. They are a tax on foreign products, paid by importers in the United States and usually passed along to their customers via higher prices. They raise costs for U.S. manufacturers that rely on imported raw materials, components and equipment, making them less competitive than foreign rivals that don\u2019t have to pay Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Tariffs also invite retaliatory taxes on U.S. exports by foreign countries. Indeed, the European Union this week threatened \u201ccountermeasures\u2019\u2019 against Trump\u2019s unexpected move to raise his tariff on foreign steel and aluminum to 50%.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not just getting the effect of a tax on the U.S. economy,\u201d York said. \u201cYou\u2019re also getting the effect of foreign taxes on U.S. exports.\u2019\u2019",
      "She said the tariffs will basically wipe out all economic benefits from the One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts.",
      "Smetters at the Penn Wharton Budget Model said that tariffs also isolate the United States and discourage foreigners from investing in its economy.",
      "Foreigners see U.S. Treasurys as a super-safe investment and now own about 30% of the federal government\u2019s debt. If they cut back, the federal government would have to pay higher interest rates on Treasury debt to attract a smaller number of potential investors domestically.",
      "Higher borrowing costs and reduced investment would wallop the economy, making tariffs the most economically destructive tax available, Smetters said \u2014 more than twice as costly in reduced economic growth and wages as what he sees as the next-most damaging: the tax on corporate earnings.",
      "Tariffs also hit the poor hardest. They end up being a tax on consumers, and the poor spend more of their income than wealthier people do.",
      "Even without the tariffs, the One Big Beautiful Bill slams the poorest because it makes deep cuts to federal food programs and to Medicaid, which provides health care to low-income Americans. After the bill\u2019s tax and spending cuts, an analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model found, the poorest fifth of American households earning less than $17,000 a year would see their incomes drop by $820 next year. The richest 0.1% earning more than $4.3 million a year would come out ahead by $390,070 in 2026.",
      "\u201cIf you layer a regressive tax increase like tariffs on top of that, you make a lot of low- and middle-income households substantially worse off,\u2019\u2019 said the Tax Foundation\u2019s York.",
      "Overall, she said, tariffs are \u201ca very unreliable source of revenue for the legal reasons, the political reasons as well as the economic reasons. They\u2019re a very, very inefficient way to raise revenue. If you raise a dollar of a revenue with tariffs, that\u2019s going to cause a lot more economic harm than raising revenue any other way.\u2019\u2019",

      "Air quality regulators in Southern California are debating proposed rules that would curb harmful emissions from gas-powered furnaces and water heaters",
      "DIAMOND BAR, Calif. -- Air quality regulators in Southern California heard impassioned public comments Friday before an anticipated vote on proposed rules that would curb harmful emissions from gas-powered furnaces and water heaters.",
      "The rules aim to reduce emissions of smog-contributing nitrogen oxides, also called NOx, a group of pollutants linked to respiratory issues, asthma attacks, worse allergies, decreased lung function in children, premature death and more. Burning natural gas is also one of the primary drivers of climate change.",
      "The South Coast Air Quality Management District estimates that the rules, if passed, will lower NOx emissions from gas-fired furnaces, preventing about 2,490 premature deaths and 10,200 new asthma cases over a 26-year period in the region. The district regulates air quality for 16.8 million people in Southern California, including all of Orange County and large areas of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties \u2014 one of the smoggiest areas in the U.S.",
      "The proposals come as California moves aggressively to reduce the state\u2019s reliance on planet-warming fossil fuels and ahead of a 2045 mandate for the state to have net-zero carbon emissions.",
      "The rules would set targets that aim to phase out the sale of gas-powered furnaces and water heaters starting in 2027. It does not apply to gas stoves. The sales target would start at 30%, then grow to 50% in 2029 and end at 90% in 2039. The rules would not be mandated, but manufacturers would have to pay fees ranging from $50 to $500 if they sell gas-powered appliances.",
      "That's a significant rollback from the original proposal, which would have required residential buildings to meet zero-emissions standards beginning in 2029 when appliances need to be replaced. The agency amended the rules after strong opposition from Southern California Gas and other businesses.",
      "The regulations would impact more than 10 million appliances in an estimated 5 million buildings, most of them residential.",
      "Officials and supporters say the rules would reduce air pollution and substantially improve public health. But opponents \u2014 including property owners, industry professionals and natural gas companies \u2014 fear they could raise costs for consumers and businesses, and strain the power grid by adding more electric appliances.",
      "During a packed board meeting Friday, clean air advocates held signs reading \u201cClean Air Now,\" \u201cVote 4 Clean Air, Vote 4 Justice\" and \u201cLet SoCal Breath!\u201d",
      "Before public comments, board chair Vanessa Delgado thanked the more than 200 people who signed up to speak about the rules, which took more than two years to craft.",
      "\u201cI don't believe that there's necessarily a good or right answer about these rules. I believe that it is very complicated and I know that every single one of these board members are doing what is right to move forward air quality goals in our region,\" she said.",
      "Lynwood City Councilmember Juan Mu\u00f1oz-Guevara said the rules would be a long-overdue step toward environmental justice for communities like his.",
      "\u201cI've seen firsthand how families in my community are forced to live with the health consequences of dirty air. Our children grow up with asthma, our elders struggle with respiratory illness, and too many lives are cut short,\" he said. \"Gas appliances in our home are one of the largest sources of smog-forming pollution in the region. We cannot meet clean air goals without tackling this.\u201d",
      "Peggy Huang, a member of Yorba Linda's City Council, urged the board to reject the rules.",
      "\u201cAs someone who's been advocating for affordable housing, this will increase costs for us to meet those goals,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Chino's mayor pro tem, Curtis Burton, echoed some of Huang's concerns. He said the rules would \u201ccreate an additional financial burden on residents and businesses.\u201d",
      "But air quality regulators say the rules would save consumers money by reducing energy bills.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- The Bush family's nonprofit Points of Light will lead an effort to double the number of people who volunteer with U.S. charitable organizations from 75 million annually to 150 million in 10 years.",
      "The ambitious goal, announced in New Orleans at the foundation's annual conference, which concluded Friday, would represent a major change in the way Americans spend their time and interact with nonprofits.",
      "It aspires to mobilize people to volunteer with nonprofits in the U.S. at a scale that only federal programs like AmeriCorps have in the past.",
      "It also coincides with deep federal funding cuts that threaten the financial stability of many nonprofits and with an effort to gut AmeriCorps programs, which sent 200,000 volunteers all over the country. A judge on Wednesday paused those cuts in some states, which had sued the Trump administration.",
      "Jennifer Sirangelo, president and CEO of Points of Light, said that while the campaign has been in development well before the federal cuts, the nonprofit\u2019s board members recently met and decided to move forward.",
      "\u201cWhat our board said was, \u2018We have to do it now. We have to put the stake in the ground now. It\u2019s more important than it was before the disruption of AmeriCorps,\u2019\u201d she said in an interview with The Associated Press. She said the nonprofit aims to raise and spend $100 million over the next three years to support the goal.",
      "Points of Light, which is based in Atlanta, was founded by President George H.W. Bush to champion his vision of volunteerism. It has carried on his tradition of giving out a daily award to a volunteer around the country, built a global network of volunteer organizations and cultivated corporate volunteer programs.",
      "Speaking Wednesday in New Orleans, Points of Light's board chair Neil Bush told the organization's annual conference that the capacity volunteers add to nonprofits will have a huge impact on communities.",

      "Susan M. Chambr\u00e9, professor emerita at Baruch College who studied volunteering for decades, said Points of Light's goal of doubling the number of volunteers was admirable but unrealistic, given that volunteer rates have not varied significantly over time.",
      "But she said more research is needed into what motivates volunteers, which would give insight into how to recruit people. She also said volunteering has become more transactional over time, directed by staff as opposed to organized by volunteers themselves.",
      "In making its case for increasing volunteer participation in a recent report, Points of Light drew on research from nonprofits like Independent Sector, the National Alliance for Volunteer Engagement and the Do Good Institute at the University of Maryland.",

They also see a major role for technology to better connect potential volunteers to opportunities, though they acknowledge that many have tried to do that through apps and online platforms.",
      "Reaching young people will also be a major part of accomplishing this increase in volunteer participation. Sirangelo said she's observed that many young people who do want to participate are founding their own nonprofits rather than joining an existing one.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not welcoming them to our institutions, so they have to go found something,\u201d she said. \u201cThat dynamic has to change.\u201d",

      "In a series of conversations with television anchors Friday morning, Trump showed no interest in burying the hatchet. Asked on ABC News about reports of a potential call between him and Musk, the president responded: \u201cYou mean the man who has lost his mind?\u201d",

      "Home decor\u2019s got a split personality this year",
      "Home decor's got a split personality this year: Call it \u201ccity glow\u201d and \u201ccottage flow.\u201d",
      "At the two international design fairs that I attended \u2014 Maison et Objet in France, Ambiente in Germany \u2014 acres of exhibition booths were full of Art Deco furnishings, island-vibe rattan seating and lighting, and lots of emphasis on sustainably produced materials.",
      "But a couple of aesthetics drawing crowds were especially interesting.",
      "One was an exuberant urban vibe I\u2019m nicknaming \u201ccity glow.\u201d It\u2019s full of highlighter-hued throw pillows, edgy surrealism, street art and hefty, Brutalist-style furniture \u2014 lots of sharp-cornered steel or concrete consoles and lamps that loomed over rooms \u2014 as well as rugs and wallcoverings covered in graffiti-style motifs or swaths of vibrant color.",
      "Gretchen Rivera, an interior designer in Washington, D.C., sees it as a look that resonates especially with \u201cyounger generations who grew up with digital influences. There\u2019s surrealist art, energetic colors and playful, almost toy-like design.\u201d",
      "Interior designer Anton Liakhov in Nice, France, agrees: \u201cFor a generation clamoring for creativity and self-expression, it\u2019s loud and in-your-face.\u201d",
      "For surface colors, look at Benjamin Moore\u2019s spicy orange Bryce Canyon or the bubblegum-pink Springtime Bloom. Daydream Apothecary has a whole collection of neon wall paints for intrepid decorators.",
      "Sisters Ana and Lola S\u00e1nchez use art as a bold form of self-expression at their luxe brand Oliver Gal, in South Florida. It's known for its handcrafted, statement-making pieces \u2014 including large acrylic gummy bears, graphic surfboards and wall art inspired by fashion, pop culture and modern surrealism. The result is a vibrant, edgy aesthetic.",
      "A new collection, Rococo Pop, introduces rococo-inspired frames in high-gloss acrylics paired with playful graphic imagery. \u201cWe wanted to take the opulence of 18th century rococo,\u201d notes Ana S\u00e1nchez, \u201cand give it a cheeky, pop-art punch.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese frames are like little rebels in ballgowns \u2014 elegant, over-the-top and totally unexpected,\u201d adds Lola S\u00e1nchez.",
      "The style, her sister says, \u201ccelebrates contrast. Old World charm meets modern mischief.\u201d",
      "The other impressive decor style at the design fairs was very different from the urban look. I\u2019m calling this one \u201ccottage flow,\u201d and Liakhov describes it as evoking a \u201cpeaceful sanctuary, where you can play around with textures that are anchored in, and in tune with, nature.\u201d",
      "Think nubby woolen throws in mossy hues. Softly burnished wooden tables. Vintage quilts, and dishware. Gingham and garden florals. Landscape prints. Imagery of birds and woodland animals on textiles and wallcoverings.",
      "Etsy\u2019s 2025 spring/summer trend report showed that searches for \u201cFrench cottage decor\u201d were up over 26,000% compared to 2024.",
      "\u201cI see people embracing a slower pace to life where they can,\u201d says New York-based interior and decor designer Kathy Kuo about the country cottage style.",
      "\u201cThe past two decades or so were dominated by a glorification of fast-paced \u2018hustle culture\u2019 \u2014 trends like cottagecore and coastal grandmother are evidence that the pendulum\u2019s swinging toward taking pleasure in simpler, more nature-adjacent things in life, whether or not you actually live in a country cottage,\u201d she says.",
      "Paint colors are also reflecting the trend. A calming sage green called Quietude is HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams\u2019 color of the year. Little-Greene\u2019s collection has names like Rolling Fog, Tea with Florence and Hammock.",
      "Watching design show visitors excitedly discovering new finds among the aisles, I thought THIS is what\u2019s fun about home decorating: You can think as creatively as you like when it comes to your own home.",
      "You\u2019re all about high-octane city nightlife? Come this way.",
      "Scottish crofts, Scandi cabins and cozy porches more your thing? Right over here.",
      "And if you want to mix these two aesthetics? Go for it. There\u2019s space to blend elements of both, says Kuo.",
      "\u201cDesign trends are so fluid. I absolutely see the potential to merge these into each other,\u201d she says. \u201cMany city dwellers love time in nature and have an affinity for a more rustic look, while still feeling called to honor their urban environment in their home. I see plenty of modern interior design motifs that are sleek and urban on the surface, but in the details, they\u2019re infused with organic textures and biophilic elements.\u201d",
      "\u201cReally, the best designs are the ones that are personal, rather than perfect,\u201d she adds.",
      "You could display an array of contemporary glass bowls on a curvy walnut credenza. Mix botanical patterns in vibrant, unexpected colors. Soften room elements like a sleek table and industrial-style lamp with boucle or velvet cushions and a fluffy rug. Pair polished concrete floors with vintage-inspired wallcovering.",
      "If you don\u2019t want to mix elements in one space, consider using sliding partitions from one room to another. You\u2019ll create a little style \u201cjourney.\u201d",
      "If the recent international design fairs are any indication, you\u2019re going to find loads of fun home decor in stores over the coming months. Get ready to flow.",

      "The Pentagon watchdog is looking into whether any of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s staffers was asked to delete Signal messages that may have shared sensitive military information with a reporter",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon watchdog is looking into whether any of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's aides was asked to delete Signal messages that may have shared sensitive military information with a reporter, according to two people familiar with the investigation and documents reviewed by The Associated Press.",
      "The inspector general's request focuses on how information about the March 15 airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen was shared on the messaging app.",
      "This comes as Hegseth is scheduled to testify before Congress next week for the first time since his confirmation hearing. He is likely to face questions under oath not only about his handling of sensitive information but also the wider turmoil at the Pentagon following the departures of several senior aides and an internal investigation over information leaks.",
      "Hegseth already has faced questions over the installation of an unsecured internet line in his office that bypassed the Pentagon\u2019s security protocols and revelations that he shared details about the military strikes in multiple Signal chats.",
      "One of the chats included his wife and brother, while the other included President Donald Trump\u2019s top national security officials and inadvertently included The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg.",
      "Neither the Pentagon nor the inspector general\u2019s office immediately responded to Friday requests for comment on the investigation.",
      "Besides finding out whether anyone was asked to delete Signal messages, the inspector general also is asking some past and current staffers who were with Hegseth on the day of the strikes who posted the information and who had access to his phone, according to the two people familiar with the investigation and the documents reviewed by the AP. The people were not authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Democratic lawmakers and a small number of Republicans have said that the information Hegseth posted to the Signal chats before the military jets had reached their targets could have put those pilots' lives at risk and that for any lower-ranking members of the military it would have led to their firing.",
      "Hegseth has said none of the information was classified. Multiple current and former military officials have said there is no way details with that specificity, especially before a strike took place, would have been OK to share on an unsecured device.",
      "\u201cI said repeatedly, nobody is texting war plans,\u201d Hegseth told Fox News Channel in April after reporting emerged about the chat that included his family members. \u201cI look at war plans every day. What was shared over Signal then and now, however you characterize it, was informal, unclassified coordinations, for media coordinations and other things. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve said from the beginning.\u201d",
      "Trump has made clear that Hegseth continues to have his support, saying during a Memorial Day speech at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia that the defense secretary \u201cwent through a lot\u201d but \u201che's doing really well.\u201d",
      "Hegseth has limited his public engagements with the press since the Signal controversy. He has yet to hold a Pentagon press briefing, and his spokesman has briefed reporters there only once.",
      "The inspector general is investigating Hegseth at the request of the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, and the committee's top Democrat, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island.",
      "Signal is a publicly available app that provides encrypted communications, but it can be hacked and is not approved for carrying classified information. On March 14, one day before the strikes against the Houthis, the Defense Department cautioned personnel about the vulnerability of the app.",
      "Trump has said his administration targeted the Houthis over their \u201cunrelenting campaign of piracy, violence and terrorism.\u201d He has noted the disruption Houthi attacks caused through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, key waterways for energy and cargo shipments between Asia and Europe through Egypt\u2019s Suez Canal.",
      "The Houthi rebels attacked more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, between November 2023 until January this year. Their leadership described the attacks as aimed at ending the Israeli war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",

      "At least 40% of India\u2019s more than 1.4 billion people have no access to the internet. Cheap satellite broadband is needed to bridge this gap, particularly in India\u2019s vast remote and mountainous rural areas.",

      "The company would also need to showcase through testing and trials that it meets local security rules which it has agreed to while securing the license.",
      "But the biggest challenge Musk\u2019s company faces is pricing as mobile data in India is among the world\u2019s cheapest. Ambani\u2019s Jio once even provided it for free with mobile plans.",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re playing their part, because their job is to accuse. However, what they have to do is prove it,\u201d J\u00e1quez said of the witnesses presented by prosecutors.",

      "\u201cToday, each of these expert witnesses\u2019 statements was vital. They established not only the fact of child sexual abuse, but also that they reinforced commercial sexual exploitation and money laundering,\u201d prosecutor Claudio Cordero said.",
      "Documents that prosecutors presented to the judge last year and were viewed by The Associated Press alleged that Franco, through his mother Yudelka Aybar, transferred 1 million pesos ($17,000) to the mother of the minor on Jan. 5, 2023, to consent to the purported abuse.",
      "The mother of the minor has been charged with money laundering and is under house arrest.",

      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- A.J. Greer is back in for the Florida Panthers in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final on Monday night after missing the first two in the series against the Edmonton Oilers because of injury.",
      "Coach Paul Maurice confirmed Greer would return on Florida\u2019s fourth line. Jesper Boqvist comes out of the lineup to make room for Greer, who will be making his first career appearance in the final.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a dream come true, but I\u2019m not really trying to focus on that,\u201d Greer said after the team's morning skate. \u201cIt\u2019s another game for me and I\u2019m just trying to enjoy it, but I\u2019m not trying to associate anything bigger than just my next shift, really.\u201d",
      "Greer, 28, gutted through injury for part of this playoff run before exiting in the Eastern Conference final against Carolina when it was clear he wasn't healthy enough to stay in. Maurice lauded Greer for his lack of selfishness and an abundance of self-awareness to understand when the pain threshold was reached and do what's best for the team.",
      "\u201cGood on him for recognizing that,\u201d Maurice said. \u201cWe were fortunate that we were able to heal A.J. to a place that he\u2019s really confident in what he\u2019s doing. ... He\u2019s been such a positive part of what we do.\u201d",
      "Greer almost wasn't here at all. A little over four years ago, he was languishing in the minors and almost giving up on his NHL dream.",
      "\u201cI was pretty much 24 hours away from just calling it, going to Europe and trying to just get a paycheck, trying to squeeze out every dollar that I can out of this sport and then live my life,\u201d Greer said. \u201cFortunately, things kind of bounced my way.\u201d",
      "Greer was essentially a throw-in as part of a trade to the New Jersey Devils that got the New York Islanders Kyle Palmieri and Travis Zajac, who helped them reach the East final. Greer \u2014 who was a second-round pick of Colorado in 2015 and played 37 games for the Avalanche from 2016-18 \u2014 developed some confidence with the American Hockey League's Utica Comets and cracked the Devils' roster a few times.",
      "Agent Philippe Lecavalier challenged Greer over whether he wanted to be an AHL player or adapt his style to be a role player in the NHL.",
      "\u201cYou could say I wanted to try to prove him wrong,\u201d Greer said. \u201cI kind of just went day by day, got better mentally, physically and matured with my game. I understood if I wanted to ever play in the NHL again, the way I have to play and the things I have to do \u2014 and I got a chance, so I\u2019m very grateful for that. It all led up to here.\u201d",
      "At 6-foot-3 and 209 pounds, Greer has been a physical force for Florida as the Panthers try to repeat as champions. He is one of the newcomers, along with their leading scorer in the final, Nate Schmidt, and teammates are happy to have Greer back.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a pain to play against,\u201d Evan Rodrigues said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that can change the momentum of a game. He\u2019s heavy on the forecheck. For the most part, I don\u2019t think you want to get hit by him. He\u2019s a really good presence for us. And he chips in offensively. He lays the body. Just overall a pain the neck to play against.\u201d",
      "That came with time and trial and error as Greer learned how to have an impact with limited ice time. This spring brought his first taste of the Stanley Cup playoffs, and he has made the most of his nearly eight minutes a game.",
      "\u201cMy game\u2019s grown, especially this year,\u201d Greer said. \u201cMy confidence has grown, and I\u2019m ready to take on the biggest challenge that I\u2019ve really faced in my career.\u201d",

      "The takeaways from Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s fifth-set tiebreaker victory over Jannik Sinner in the French Open men\u2019s final are multiple and significant",
      "The takeaways from Carlos Alcaraz's fifth-set tiebreaker victory over Jannik Sinner in the riveting and record-breaking French Open men's final were multiple and significant.",
      "Let's start with this: Anyone worried about how men's tennis would survive in the post-Big Three era can rest easy. Alcaraz and Sinner produced 5 1/2 hours of evidence Sunday that the game is in good hands \u2014 and that their rivalry will be, and perhaps already is, a transcendent one.",
      "Take it from no less an authority than Roger Federer. The retired owner of 20 Grand Slam titles, and rival of Rafael Nadal (22 majors) and Novak Djokovic (24), began a post on social media by declaring, \u201c3 winners in Paris today,\u201d then listed Alcaraz, Sinner and \u201cthe beautiful game of tennis. What a match!\u201d",
      "This was the 12th Alcaraz-Sinner meeting, the first in a major final.",
      "\u201cHopefully not the last time,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cEvery time that we face ... each other, we raise our level to the top.\u201d",
      "It would be shocking if there weren\u2019t many more of these to come \u2014 perhaps as soon as at Wimbledon, where play begins on June 30 and No. 2-ranked Alcaraz is the two-time defending champion.",
      "His comeback against No. 1 Sinner from two sets down, then three championship points down, to win 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (10-2) was unprecedented at Roland-Garros. It was unforgettable. Alcaraz's coach, Juan Carlos Ferrero, described his guy's best trait this way: \u201cHis strength is (to) keep believing all the time, until the last ball is gone.\u201d",
      "Alcaraz's five Grand Slam titles at 22 \u2014 that's the age at which Nadal, Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras also got to five; no one's done it younger \u2014 show how special he is. So does the Spaniard's 5-0 record in major finals, a career start surpassed among men only by Federer's 7-0.",
      "Sinner is pretty good, too. Tuesday marks a full year that he has been ranked No. 1. He has reached the finals of his last eight tournaments, a run last accomplished by Djokovic a decade ago. He has won three majors. He has won 47 of his last 50 matches.",
      "Notably, all three of those losses came against \u2014 yes, you guessed it \u2014 Alcaraz. That hearkens back to the days when Federer would beat everyone other than Nadal.",
      "Sinner had claimed 31 Slam sets in a row right up until the moment he was up 2-0 against Alcaraz.",
      "What was unmistakable to anyone watching in-person at Court Philippe-Chatrier or following along from afar on TV is that Alcaraz vs. Sinner is a must-see.",
      "\u201cThe level,\u201d Alcaraz said, \u201cwas insane.\u201d",
      "Sinner's take?",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy to be part of this,\u201d the 23-year-old Italian said. \u201cWould be even more happy if I would have ... the big trophy.\u201d",
      "As with any great rivalry \u2014 think Evert vs. Navratilova or Borg vs. McEnroe or Federer vs. Nadal, no first names needed \u2014 Alcaraz vs. Sinner provides a clash of excellence and a study in contrasts.",
      "Alcaraz displays emotion, pumping his fists, pointing to an ear to ask for more noise, yelling \u201cVamos!\u201d Sinner is rather contained. Sinner's long limbs get him to nearly every ball. Alcaraz's motor reaches speeds no one can equal. Sinner's ball-striking is pure. Alcaraz's drop shots are legendary. Both hammer groundstrokes that leave opponents exasperated and spectators gasping.",
      "Both can improve. Sinner has never won a match that lasted four hours. Alcaraz loses focus on occasion.",
      "Both are eager to improve. When Sinner returned from a three-month doping ban last month, he introduced a new, angled return stance. Alcaraz tweaked his serve and backhand technique.",
      "Who knows what heights each can reach? They split the past six Slam trophies, and eight of the past 11.",
      "Federer saw this coming.",
      "During an interview with The Associated Press in December 2019, Federer predicted someone would win major after major the way he, Nadal and Djokovic did. Just didn't know there would be a Big Two doing it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to happen, inevitably,\u201d Federer said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s almost not going to be that hard, maybe ... because the players will have seen what we did. And they didn\u2019t see just one guy doing it, once every 30 years. They saw like three guys doing it, in the shortest period of time. ... Players are going to believe more.\"",

      "The Stanley Cup Final shifts to Sunrise for Game 3 on Monday night between the Florida Panthers and Edmonton Oilers",
      "SUNRISE, Fla. -- Back in the same locker room that was the scene of Connor McDavid's profanity-laced outburst and the tearful ending to his first Stanley Cup Final, the Edmonton Oilers hope they can avoid the same result this time around.",
      "Their next chance to take that step comes Monday night in Game 3 of their final rematch against the Florida Panthers, with play shifting to Sunrise after the teams split in Edmonton. The Oilers practiced in the shadow of the Panthers' championship banner and, afterwards, players stood in the same room McDavid did his post-Game 7 interview at the most disappointing moment of his NHL career.",
      "\u201cI think no matter how much time passes, it\u2019ll always be on your mind (when) you get that close,\u201d coach Kris Knoblauch said. \u201cWe\u2019re at a new stage of our season or our path, and we\u2019re just focused on what we need to do right now.\u201d",
      "The Panthers won three of their four home games in the final last year, including the first two on the way to going up 3-0 in the series. The Oilers took Games 4 and 6 in Edmonton and Game 5 at Florida before their gut-wrenching loss in Game 7.",
      "This is also not their first trip back. They got that out of the way Feb. 27 and are very familiar with the arena thanks to last June.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely, there\u2019s a comfort level in that, and there\u2019s a benefit in that,\u201d forward Connor Brown said. \u201cYou kind of know what to expect, you\u2019ve been here and so you learn from experience, too. To be able to kind of have had to earn that experience last year, I think we\u2019ll benefit from it this year.\u201d",
      "The Panthers went 27-12-2 at home during the regular season and 4-3 during the playoffs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never bad being in your own bed, have a nice home-cooked meal,\" Florida's Sam Reinhart said. \u201cI mean, once the puck drops, you might use the crowd a little bit. You might have that little extra energy. But at this time, it\u2019s the two best teams that are left standing. Once that puck drops, it\u2019s going to be a real battle regardless.\u201d",

      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- For the Indiana Pacers, a chance at being perfect in Games 1 and 2 of these playoffs went awry.",
      "They\u2019ll have to settle for a mere split of the opening two games in the NBA Finals instead.",
      "The Pacers\u2019 bid to become the fifth team in NBA history to go 8-0 to open the four playoff rounds \u2014 sweeping Games 1 and 2 in all four series \u2014 was stopped on Sunday night by the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder took control early and won Game 2 123-107, tying the championship matchup at a game apiece.",
      "\u201cAny time you\u2019re the lower seed in a playoff series, you know your job is to go split or go try to get one on the road,\" Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton said. \"We got Game 1, you know, but it felt like we really let the rope slip there in the second quarter.\u201d",
      "That they did: A 19-2 run in that second quarter put the Thunder in control \u2014 and the final margin was 16.",
      "The Pacers were trying to join the 1986 Boston Celtics, 1987 Los Angeles Lakers, 1996 Chicago Bulls and 2017 Golden State Warriors as teams that won Games 1 and 2 in all four rounds of a single postseason. All four went on to win the NBA title.",
      "Those teams all did it with home-court advantage in every one of those series. The Pacers haven\u2019t had home court since Round 1 \u2014 taking the first two of that series against Milwaukee, then winning the first two of Round 2 at Cleveland, the first two of the Eastern Conference final at New York, and Game 1 of the finals in Oklahoma City.",
      "So, in the end, the Pacers have to settle for going 7-1, tying for the fifth-best record in Games 1 and 2 in a single postseason. They also became the third team to win five of those games on the road in a playoff run.",
      "\u201cI think you want to win every game you play,\u201d Pacers forward Pascal Siakam said. \u201cSo, we are not happy with how the game went today, and that\u2019s it.\u201d",
      "Houston went 5-3 in Games 1 and 2 on the road on its way to the title in 1995 and Miami went 5-3 in road games over the first two games of series in 2023 on its way to the NBA Finals. (The Heat were 6-2 in \u201croad\u201d games in Games 1 and 2 of their series in the 2020 bubble playoffs as well, but those games were all in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.)",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not interested in talking about the past,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cEach day, as you are on a playoff run, is like a new day. I find that looking back is a dangerous thing. We\u2019ve got to keep our eye firmly where it needs to be.\u201d",
      "If the Pacers had won Sunday, they likely would have been overwhelming favorites heading home with a 2-0 lead. Only two teams \u2014 the 1993 Chicago Bulls and 1995 Houston Rockets \u2014 won the first two games of a finals on the road, and both went on to win the NBA title in those seasons. And teams that open the finals with a 2-0 lead go on to win the series 86.5% of the time (32 times in 37 chances).",
      "\u201cKeep our heads. We know where we\u2019re at,\u201d Pacers forward Aaron Nesmith said. \u201cWe know what we\u2019ve got to do better and just execute our game plan better.\u201d",

Tremendous mistake by the Dallas franchise to trade him and I want everybody to know that.\u201d",
      "Doncic was traded by Dallas to the Los Angeles Lakers this season for Anthony Davis, a blockbuster that the entire league found stunning. Fans in Dallas were furious for months, though some of that seems to have subsided in recent weeks with the Mavericks winning draft lottery and the chance to draft Cooper Flagg No. 1 overall later this month.",
      "Nelson said his philosophy on generational players is the one that Red Auerbach taught him: Don't trade those talents.",
      "\u201cHis philosophy was when you have a great player \u2014 Bill Russell, (John) Havlicek, Sam Jones, you name \u2018em \u2014 you don\u2019t lose that player,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cYou keep him for a lifetime. You put his number up and you honor that player. That\u2019s been my philosophy.\u201d",
      "Nelson has deep ties to Dallas, so his reaction to the Doncic trade is understandable. He coached the Mavericks for eight seasons and his son, Donnie Nelson, was an executive with Dallas from 2005 through 2021.",

      "That made him far richer than he could have imagined when he was raised in poverty in the Philippines. He went on to serve his country as a senator from 2016-22 and ran unsuccessfully for president, and his voice broke a bit as he thanked his fans from home along with his family.",
      "\u201cThis is our victory,\u201d Pacquiao said. \u201cThis is our story and the best is yet to come.\u201d",

      "BRISTOL, England -- England cricket captain Harry Brook praised the unity of his \u201cgroup of mates\u201d Sunday after sealing his second series win in just 11 days.",
      "England won the second Twenty20 cricket international against West Indies by four wickets with nine balls remaining to take an insurmountable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. England scored 199-6 in 18.3 overs after West Indies lost the toss and posted 196.",
      "Brook has won five in a row against the West Indies since taking over from Jos Buttler, including a 3-0 sweep in the ODI matches.",
      "England didn't have it easy at Bristol, with the asking rate climbing past 11 per over at one stage as it chased down West Indies' target.",
      "But the team stuck together to get over the line, with five of the top six batters making handy contributions before Jacob Bethell (26) and Tom Banton (30 not out) hammered 56 off just 21 deliveries between them to puncture the West Indian resistance. Buttler again top scored for England with 47 off 36 deliveries. He hit 96 when England beat West Indies by 21 runs in the series opener on Friday.",
      "It was the kind of game England was tending to lose in the difficult final days under Buttler, whose captaincy ended with eight straight defeats across both white ball formats.",
      "After dominating the West Indies in three one-day internationals, England was expected to receive a tougher contest from the visitors, who are higher-rated in T20s than ODIs.",
      "West Indies smashed 47 runs off the last two overs of its innings, including 31 runs in the 19th over against spinner Adil Rashid, with his six deliveries going for 6-6-6-1-6-6. Jason Holder (29 not out) hit the first three sixes and Romario Shepherd added the last two.",
      "Skipper Shai Hope was top scorer for West Indies with a 38-ball 49, including four sixes. He shared an 89-run partnership for the second wicket with Johnson Charles after opener Evin Lewis was trapped lbw to Luke Wood (2-25 in four overs) on the first ball of the match. Charles hit three sixes and three fours in his 39-ball 47 before he was bowled by Wood.",
      "West Indies had No. 2-ranked T20 bowler Akeal Hosein (1-33) back with them on Sunday. Hosein missed the first T20 as he was unable to travel to England in time because of recent changes to Britain's visa entry requirements for Trinidad and Tobago citizens.",
      "England also made one change, with Wood coming in for Matthew Potts.",
      "The third T20 is at Southampton on Tuesday.",

    "story": [
      "The second consecutive Stanley Cup Final between the Florida Panthers and Edmonton Oilers has been about as even as a series can get through two games, with each winning one in overtime",
      "SUNRISE, Fla. -- After going the distance in the Stanley Cup Final last year with the Florida Panthers beating the Edmonton Oilers by a goal in Game 7 and being one win apart during the regular season, not much is separating these two NHL powerhouses so far in their championship series rematch.",
      "This final is just about as close as can be through two games, with each team winning once in overtime and knowing full well one puck off the post or into the net could have dramatically changed the situation. That remains the case going into Game 3 on Monday night at Florida, with the very real chance that a couple of bounces and small adjustments could tilt the series one way or the other.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just the back-and-forth punches of a heavyweight tilt,\" veteran Oilers forward Adam Henrique said after practice Sunday. \u201cEvery shift matters so much because it might be a 1-0 game and a 2-1 game, and those mistakes that could either cost you or pay dividends for you and keeping that pressure high \u2014 that can be the difference.\u201d",
      "This has been a different final than many in the recent past, in part because there's no underdog in it who no one expected to get this far, the opponents know each other well and the teams are nearly at full strength. That has made for some quality hockey where the goals have piled up and yet the defense and goaltending have at the same time been stellar.",
      "\u201cEverything is contested all over the ice, so you\u2019re having more events and it\u2019s more intense, but what a wonderful thing to be able to say that in the final,\u201d Panthers coach Paul Maurice said after his team's optional skate in Fort Lauderdale. \u201cBoth teams are competing defensively. They\u2019re blocking shots, they\u2019re battling, they\u2019re backchecking and it\u2019s still a high-event game. That\u2019s some high-end skill.\u201d",
      "That high-end skill has been on display. Three-time league and reigning playoff MVP Connor McDavid fittingly leads all scorers with five points, and longtime Edmonton running mate Leon Draisaitl has matched Florida's Sam Bennett and Brad Marchand at three goals apiece.",
      "Game 1 finished 4-3 in overtime and Game 2 was 5-4 in double OT. The Oilers have more shots, 92 to 74, while the Panthers have led for over 67 minutes compared to trailing for nearly 28 minutes.",
      "It has been tied for large swaths of regulation, and for all the offense, players acknowledge there has not been a whole lot of ice with which to operate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very tight,\" said Marchand, who scored the Game 2 winner 8:04 into the second overtime. \"You can\u2019t make any mistakes. Just every time you do, they seem to get something off of it. And we\u2019re obviously balanced throughout the lineup, so it\u2019s very tight out there. The games speak for themselves. It\u2019s been a battle. Very intense and a lot of fun to be a part of.\u201d",
      "Like Maurice did after his team lost the opener, Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch is making some changes going on the road where he does not control the matchups. He jumbled his defense pairs, putting Evan Bouchard with Darnell Nurse, Mattias Ekholm with John Klingberg, and Brett Kulak with Jake Walman.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re always making adjustments to counter whatever teams are doing, who\u2019s playing well,\u201d Knoblauch said. \u201cFortunately, our players are comfortable with any changes that we do make just because of how much we\u2019ve fluctuated our pairs and lines throughout the season. In Games 1 and 2 we had some changes, and games throughout the rest of the series there\u2019ll be some more.\u201d",
      "The push and pull has been quite something to behold. Tune in to just one period or a handful of shifts and it's easy to get the idea that one team or the other is dominating, and then not long after it alternates.",
      "\u201cBoth teams will have times where they look like they\u2019ve got possession of the game, but it\u2019s just not going to last. It doesn't last,\u201d Maurice said. \u201cThis is so close out there, so you can take a look at that video and I can find you 15 goals for the Edmonton Oilers that just didn\u2019t go in, and I can find you the exact same for the Florida Panthers.\u201d",
      "The emotional ebbs and flows, Maurice insists, are also not as big of swings as it looks from the outside. He didn't feel as devastated after the Game 1 defeat or as euphoric after the Game 2 triumph as it may have appeared.",
      "His players are accustomed to these waves from losing in the final to Vegas in 2023 and winning in seven games a year ago after surrendering a 3-0 series lead.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all about staying in the moment,\u201d Panthers winger Sam Reinhart said. \u201cYou can\u2019t think too far ahead, and you can\u2019t think too far in the past.\u201d",
      "Draisaitl, who scored the Game 1 OT goal, acknowledged the what-ifs creep into players' heads in the immediate aftermath of a difficult result. But he and his teammates and their counterparts on the other side understand they can't dwell too much given the razor thin margin of error.",
      "\u201cTwo really good teams going at it,\u201d Draisaitl said. \"You have to stay detailed and know that all those little bounces matter.\u201d",

      "U.S. Open week is off to a soggy start at Oakmont",
      "OAKMONT, Pa. -- Players began arriving at Oakmont on Sunday with umbrellas and expectations for a U.S. Open to live up to its reputation as golf's toughest test.",
      "Jordan Spieth was among the early arrivals, playing the front nine Saturday and 11 holes Sunday in a light, but steady rain. Turns out the USGA had a policy that no one could start on No. 10. Spieth went down the first, back up the ninth and headed to No. 10.",
      "It was long. And it was wet. The area got pounded with rain on Friday, and heavy rain was expected again Sunday afternoon. As if Oakmont wasn't already tough enough.",
      "\u201cThis course is built to be like this,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cSo they're not doing a whole lot different to the golf course. You hit a good shot, you get rewarded for it here. And if you don't, you're in big trouble. It's pure golf, no funny business about it.\u201d",
      "Sunday also was when the final field was set, barring any withdrawals. Ryan Fox won the Canadian Open and was among three players \u2014 Cameron Young and Bud Cauley were the others \u2014 who moved into the top 60 in the latest world ranking to earn a spot.",
      "Cauley and Young had made it through 36-hole qualifying last Monday, so their spots went to Chase Johnson and Eric Cole, who also had played in the Columbus, Ohio, qualifier. Cole was the second alternate in Columbus but got the spot because that's where Cauley and Young were.",
      "The USGA held back six spots for anyone else who might have moved into the top 60. The other three went to alternate Doug Ghim from the Dallas qualifier, Takumi Kanaya from the Toronto site and Riki Kawamoto in Japan.",
      "Earlier, Sahith Theegala withdrew with an injury. He was replaced on the general alternate list by Matthew Jordan from the England site.",
      "Spieth was keeping score on this day \u2014 he gave himself an 18-inch birdie putt after a 50-yard chip on the short par-4 17th and was 2 under for the day. He also did plenty of chipping and putting. On one hole, he had his caddie throw him golf balls down into the bunker. The grass was so thick it gobbled up the balls before they reached to the sand.",
      "The rough was as advertised, mainly the sheer density of it, and it was made even more difficult considering how wet it was.",
      "Spieth wasn't worried so much about the grass off the fairway \u2014 everyone has to deal with that at some point during the U.S. Open. It was what followed.",
      "\u201cIt magnifies once you make a mistake if you don't play the right shot,\" he said. \u201cIt's not like making a mistake is the end of the world. It might cost you half a shot. You just have to take what it gives you.\u201d",
      "More than 60 players in the U.S. Open field were at the Memorial two weeks ago, which also featured rough that was longer and thicker than normal. Growing grass has not been an issue in the Ohio Valley this year. The difference is the speed of Oakmont's greens \u2014 reputed to be the fastest in the land \u2014 and not many forced carries.",
      "\u201cThis test here, because they give you more runways to try to run it up to the green, it entices you to think you can do more than you should,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cThat will be the biggest challenge this week \u2014 swallowing pride. Bogeys don't hurt you. Anything more will.\u201d",
      "The forecast was for more scattered showers on Monday, and then a break from the rain until the weekend.",
      "Oakmont is hosting the U.S. Open for a record 10th time, and its reputation is strong enough that even the best can expect a strong test. First impressions, of course, can be misleading.",
      "Shane Lowry recalls seeing it for the first time on the Sunday before the 2016 U.S. Open. He started on No. 10, played five holes and walked in, wondering how he could ever manage a decent score around Oakmont. A week later, he went into the final round with a four-shot lead.",
      "\u201cIt was firm and fast when I played it that Sunday, and it was windy. We got a bit of rain that week, which helped us,\u201d Lowry recalled.",
      "The flip side was Adam Scott. He first played Oakmont the week before 2007 U.S. Open with Geoff Ogilvy, who was the defending U.S. Open champion that year.",
      "\u201cI played really great that day and Geoff didn't, so I was feeling really chipper about myself,\u201d Scott said. He returned a week later feeling confident as ever.",
      "\u201cI hit six greens in two days and flew back to Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really hit me hard.\u201d",

      "Nintendo's Switch 2 video-game console is out, and it makes some substantial improvements over its predecessor",
      "WASHINGTON -- I'm cruising around Bowser's Castle with my old pal Toad. It's not exactly relaxing, what with all the lava pits and banana peels and turtle shells littering the road. Add 23 other characters \u2014 is that a cow driving? \u2014 who are trying to get to the finish line first, and it's chaos.",
      "The hectic, high-speed insanity of any race in the new Mario Kart World would have caused the eight-year-old Switch console to wheeze a bit. And that's why we've got the Switch 2 ($449.99), the souped-up sequel to Nintendo's popular home-and-portable hybrid.",
      "It looks prettier, too. The 7.9-inch portable display (up from 6.2 inches) boosts the resolution to 1020p (from 720p), and while the LCD screen isn't quite as sharp as an OLED screen might have been, it's much cleaner than the original recipe Switch. It looks even better when connected to an HDTV since it now supports 4K and HDR.",
      "Nintendo has always stood apart from the technological arms race that fans of Sony\u2019s PlayStation and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox obsess over, insisting that first-rate games don\u2019t necessarily depend on high-powered computer chips. But you could feel the strain in 2023\u2019s The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, with its at-times blurry graphics and sluggish framerate. The Switch 2, with a faster framerate of 120 fps, corrects much of the fuzziness.",
      "That's not to say it comes close to matching the high-definition performance of the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox X/S. If you're expecting the jaw-dropping graphics of, say, Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows ... well, no.",
      "There is good news for those of us who have gotten weary of the old Switch's dinky 32 gigabytes of internal storage. The Switch 2 multiplies that by eight, for 256 GB. Of course, flashier games take up more space, so if you want more room you'll have to invest in a microSD Express card \u2014 which is a bit pricier than the standard memory card used in most portable devices.",
      "The Switch 2's Joy-Con controllers have undergone some tinkering. As before, you can attach them to the sides of the screen if you're playing on the go. If you're at home, you can attach them to a doohickey that feels more like a traditional joystick. Either way, they're now more firmly connected with magnets, which provide a satisfying snap.",
      "Both the left and right Joy-Cons now include an optical mouse, which you can use by placing the controller on its edge and rolling it around on a table. (Nintendo says you can also use it on your pants, but I prefer using a clipboard on my lap.) It remains to be seen how many Switch 2 games will call for a mouse, but 2K's port of Sid Meier's Civilization VII seems like a good candidate.",
      "And then there's a new button labeled \u201cC\u201d on the right-hand Joy-Con. That calls up GameChat, which lets you start up a conversation with other players \u2014 provided you've all taken the time to register yourselves as friends. (Eventually, you'll also need to subscribe to the Nintendo Switch Online service, but that requirement doesn't kick in until March 31, 2026.) The microphone is built into the Switch 2, though if you want to upgrade to video chat, you'll need to buy a separate Nintendo camera.",
      "Finally, there\u2019s GameShare, which lets you play selected titles with other Switch users even if they don\u2019t own the software.",
      "Nintendo has been emphasizing the new social features in its marketing, though it feels like it's catching up to the competition. The kids I know who play Fortnite or Minecraft on competing consoles seem to have figured out long ago how to chat with their pals. Welcome to the 2010s?",
      "As with any console launch, the driving question is: Does it have the games?",
      "There are just a couple of Switch 2 exclusives out now: Mario Kart World and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a $10 demo package that really should have been free. There are some new-to-Nintendo ports of excellent titles like Split Fiction and Cyberpunk 2077. You can get upgrades of classics like the last two Legend of Zelda adventures. And the Switch 2 is fully backward-compatible, so you can play everything that came out for the Switch as well as a substantial library of older titles.",
      "There\u2019s no other machine that will let you play future installments of beloved franchises like Zelda, Super Mario Bros., Super Smash Bros. and Animal Crossing. None of those have been announced yet, but some marquee names \u2014 Donkey Kong and Kirby \u2014 will star in Switch 2 exclusives later this year.",
      "There\u2019s plenty of competition out there, though, and not just in the TV-connected console market Switch shares with the PlayStation and the Xbox. Nintendo no longer has the portable market to itself, thanks to Valve\u2019s SteamDeck. Some models of that device cost less than the Switch 2, and it already has a huge library of PC games. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced over the weekend that it's teaming up with Asus on the ROG Xbox Ally, a handheld that will be out before Christmas.",
      "Honestly, we\u2019ll probably have a better idea of the Switch\u2019s quality a few years down the line, after developers get a handle on what the new hardware can do. If you\u2019re dying to get back behind the wheel with Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach right now, though, you know what you need to do.",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "A previous version of this story was corrected to say that the Switch 2 social options can be used without a subscription until March 31, 2026.",

      "Amazon says it will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, including one it is building alongside a nuclear power plant that has drawn federal scrutiny over its arrangement to essentially plug right into the power plant",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Amazon said Monday that it will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, including one it is building alongside a nuclear power plant that has drawn federal scrutiny over an arrangement to essentially plug right into the power plant.",
      "Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers at Amazon\u2019s cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, told The Associated Press that the company will build another data center complex just north of Philadelphia.",
      "One data center is being built next to northeastern Pennsylvania's Susquehanna nuclear power plant. The other will be in Fairless Hills at a logistics campus, the Keystone Trade Center, on what was once a U.S. Steel mill.",
      "In a statement, Gov. Josh Shapiro called it the largest capital investment in Pennsylvania's history.",
      "The announcements add to the billions of dollars in Big Tech's data center cash already flowing into the state.",
      "Since 2024 started, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina as it ramps up its investment in infrastructure to compete with other tech giants to meet growing demand for artificial intelligence products.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "The majority owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant, Talen Energy, announced last year that it had sold its data center to Amazon for $650 million in a deal to eventually provide 960 megawatts. That's 40% of the output of one of the nation's largest nuclear power plants, or enough to power more than a half-million homes.",
      "However, the arrangement between Talen and Amazon \u2014 called a \u201cbehind the meter\u201d connection \u2014 has been held up by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the first such case to come before the agency.",
      "It has raised questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it\u2019s fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid.",
      "For Big Tech, plugging energy-hungry data centers directly into a power plant can take years off their development timelines and is a much faster route to procuring power than having to connect to the congested electricity grid.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on a procedural grounds, will decide the matter, leaving in limbo regulatory treatment of the deal and others that likely would follow.",
      "Already in Pennsylvania, Microsoft announced a deal with the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to restart the reactor under a 20-year agreement to supply its data centers in four states with energy.",
      "Meanwhile, the owners of what was once Pennsylvania\u2019s biggest coal-fired power plant say they will turn it into a $10 billion natural gas-powered data center campus.",

      "Getty Images is facing off against artificial intelligence company Stability AI in a London courtroom for the first major copyright trial of the generative AI industry",
      "LONDON -- Getty Images is facing off against artificial intelligence company Stability AI in a London courtroom for the first major copyright trial of the generative AI industry.",
      "Opening arguments before a judge at the British High Court are scheduled for Monday. The trial could last for three weeks.",
      "Stability, based in London, owns a widely used AI image-making tool that sparked enthusiasm for the instant creation of AI artwork and photorealistic images upon its release in August 2022. OpenAI introduced its surprise hit chatbot ChatGPT three months later.",
      "Seattle-based Getty has argued that the development of the AI image maker, called Stable Diffusion, involved \u201cbrazen infringement\u201d of Getty\u2019s photography collection \u201con a staggering scale.\"",
      "Tech companies have long argued that \u201cfair use\u201d or \u201cfair dealing\u201d legal doctrines in the United States and United Kingdom allow them to train their AI systems on large troves of writings or images. Getty was among the first to challenge those practices when it filed copyright infringement lawsuits in the United States and the United Kingdom in early 2023.",
      "\u201cWhat Stability did was inappropriate,\u201d Getty CEO Craig Peters told The Associated Press in 2023. He said creators of intellectual property should be asked for permission before their works are fed into AI systems rather than having to participate in an \u201copt-out regime.\"",
      "Stability has argued that the case doesn't belong in the United Kingdom because the training of the AI model technically happened elsewhere, on computers run by U.S. tech giant Amazon.",
      "Similar cases in the U.S. have not yet gone to trial.",
      "Stable Diffusion\u2019s roots trace to Germany, where computer scientists at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich worked with the New York-based tech company Runway to develop the original algorithms. The university researchers credited Stability AI for providing the servers that trained the models, which require large amounts of computing power.",

      "After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech\u2019s pivotal race to create artificial intelligence, Apple will try to regain its footing Monday with its annual showcase for the next generation of software powering the iPhone and other popular products",
      "After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech's pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple will try to regain its footing Monday at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.",
      "The presummer rite, which attracts thousands of developers to Apple's Silicon Valley headquarters, is expected to be more subdued than the feverish anticipation that surrounded the event during the previous two years.",
      "In 2023, Apple unveiled a mixed-reality headset that has been little more than a niche product, and last year WWDC trumpeted its first major foray into the AI craze with an array of new features highlighted by the promise of a smarter and more versatile version of its virtual assistant, Siri.",
      "But heading into this year's showcase, Apple faces nagging questions about whether the nearly 50-year-old company has lost some of the mystique and innovative drive that turned it into a tech trendsetter. Instead of making a big splash as it did with the Vision Pro headset, Apple this year is expected to focus on an overhaul of its software that may include a new, more tactile look for the iPhone's native apps and a new nomenclature for identifying its operating system updates.",
      "Even though it might look like Apple is becoming a technological laggard, Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson contends the company still has ample time to catch up in an AI race that's \u201cmore of a marathon, than a sprint. It will force Apple to evolve its operating systems.\u201d",
      "If reports about its iOS naming scheme pan out, Apple will switch to a method that automakers have used to telegraph their latest car models by linking them to the year after they first arrive at dealerships. That would mean the next version of the iPhone operating system due out this autumn will be known as iOS 26 instead of iOS 19 \u2014 as it would be under the current sequential naming approach.",
      "Whatever it's named, the next iOS will likely be released as a free update in September, around the same time as the next iPhone models if Apple follows its usual road map.",
      "Meanwhile, Apple's references to AI may be less frequent than last year when the technology was the main attraction.",
      "While some of the new AI tricks compatible with the latest iPhones began rolling out late last year as part of free software updates, Apple still hasn't been able to soup up Siri in the ways that it touted at last year's conference. The delays became so glaring that a chastened Apple retreated from promoting Siri in its AI marketing campaigns earlier this year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just taking a bit longer than we thought,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts last month when asked about the company's headaches with Siri. \u201cBut we are making progress, and we\u2019re extremely excited to get the more personal Siri features out there.\u201d",
      "While Apple has been struggling to make AI that meets its standards, the gap separating it from other tech powerhouses is widening. Google keeps packing more AI into its Pixel smartphone lineup while introducing more of the technology into its search engine to dramatically change the way it works. Samsung, Apple's biggest smartphone rival, is also leaning heavily into AI. Meanwhile, ChatGPT recently struck a deal that will bring former Apple design guru Jony Ive into the fold to work on a new device expected to compete against the iPhone.",
      "\u201cWhile much of WWDC will be about what the next great thing is for the iPhone, the unspoken question is: What's the next great thing after the iPhone?\u201d said Dipanjan Chatterjee, another analyst for Forrester Research.",
      "Besides facing innovation challenges, Apple also faces regulatory threats that could siphon away billions of dollars in revenue that help finance its research and development. A federal judge is currently weighing whether proposed countermeasures to Google's illegal monopoly in search should include a ban on long-running deals worth $20 billion annually to Apple while another federal judge recently banned the company from collecting commission on in-app transactions processed outside its once-exclusive payment system.",
      "On top of all that, Apple has been caught in the cross-hairs of President Donald Trump's trade war with China, a key manufacturing hub for the Cupertino, California, company. Cook successfully persuaded Trump to exempt the iPhone from tariffs during the president's first administration, but he has had less success during Trump's second term, which seems more determined to prod Apple to make its products in the U.S..",
      "\u201cThe trade war and uncertainty linked to the tariff policy is of much more concern today for Apple\u2019s business than the perception that Apple is lagging behind on AI innovation,\u201d Husson said.",
      "The multi-dimensional gauntlet facing Apple is spooking investors, causing the company's stock price to plunge by nearly 20% so far this year \u2014 a decline that has erased $750 billion in shareholder wealth. After beginning the year as the most valuable company in the world, Apple now ranks third behind longtime rival Microsoft, another AI leader, and AI chipmaker Nvidia.",

      "The crashes, which began late last year and carried into 2025, were the tipoff to a sophisticated cyberattack that may have allowed hackers to infiltrate a phone without a single click from the user.",
      "The attackers left no clues about their identities, but investigators at the cybersecurity firm iVerify noticed that the victims all had something in common: They worked in fields of interest to China's government and had been targeted by Chinese hackers in the past.",
      "Foreign hackers have increasingly identified smartphones, other mobile devices and the apps they use as a weak link in U.S. cyberdefenses. Groups linked to China's military and intelligence service have targeted the smartphones of prominent Americans and burrowed deep into telecommunication networks, according to national security and tech experts.",
      "It shows how vulnerable mobile devices and apps are and the risk that security failures could expose sensitive information or leave American interests open to cyberattack, those experts say.",
      "\u201cThe world is in a mobile security crisis right now,\u201d said Rocky Cole, a former cybersecurity expert at the National Security Agency and Google and now chief operations officer at iVerify. \u201cNo one is watching the phones.\u201d",

      "Chinese hackers also sought access to phones used by Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance during the 2024 campaign.",
      "The Chinese government has denied allegations of cyberespionage, and accused the U.S. of mounting its own cyberoperations. It says America cites national security as an excuse to issue sanctions against Chinese organizations and keep Chinese technology companies from the global market.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. has long been using all kinds of despicable methods to steal other countries\u2019 secrets,\u201d Lin Jian, a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, said at a recent press conference in response to questions about a CIA push to recruit Chinese informants.",
      "U.S. intelligence officials have said China poses a significant, persistent threat to U.S. economic and political interests, and it has harnessed the tools of digital conflict: online propaganda and disinformation, artificial intelligence and cyber surveillance and espionage designed to deliver a significant advantage in any military conflict.",
      "Mobile networks are a top concern. The U.S. and many of its closest allies have banned Chinese telecom companies from their networks. Other countries, including Germany, are phasing out Chinese involvement because of security concerns. But Chinese tech firms remain a big part of the systems in many nations, giving state-controlled companies a global footprint they could exploit for cyberattacks, experts say.",
      "Chinese telecom firms still maintain some routing and cloud storage systems in the U.S. \u2014 a growing concern to lawmakers.",
      "\u201cThe American people deserve to know if Beijing is quietly using state-owned firms to infiltrate our critical infrastructure,\u201d U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich. and chairman of the China committee, which in April issued subpoenas to Chinese telecom companies seeking information about their U.S. operations.",
      "Mobile devices can buy stocks, launch drones and run power plants. Their proliferation has often outpaced their security.",
      "The phones of top government officials are especially valuable, containing sensitive government information, passwords and an insider's glimpse into policy discussions and decision-making.",
      "The White House said last week that someone impersonating Susie Wiles, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, reached out to governors, senators and business leaders with texts and phone calls.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how the person obtained Wiles\u2019 connections, but they apparently gained access to the contacts in her personal cellphone, The Wall Street Journal reported. The messages and calls were not coming from Wiles\u2019 number, the newspaper reported.",
      "While most smartphones and tablets come with robust security, apps and connected devices often lack these protections or the regular software updates needed to stay ahead of new threats. That makes every fitness tracker, baby monitor or smart appliance another potential foothold for hackers looking to penetrate networks, retrieve information or infect systems with malware.",
      "Federal officials launched a program this year creating a \u201ccyber trust mark\u201d for connected devices that meet federal security standards. But consumers and officials shouldn\u2019t lower their guard, said Snehal Antani, former chief technology officer for the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Special Operations Command.",

      "A new study that examined five years\u2019 worth of prices at one U.S. grocery chain found that digital price tags haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges",
      "Digital price labels, which are rapidly replacing paper shelf tags at U.S. supermarkets, haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges, according to a new study that examined five years' worth of prices at one grocery chain.",
      "But some shoppers, consumer advocates and lawmakers remain skeptical about the tiny electronic screens, which let stores change prices instantly from a central computer instead of having workers swap out paper labels by hand.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s corporations vs. the humans, and that chasm between us goes further and further,\u201d said Dan Gallant, who works in sports media in Edmonton, Canada. Gallant's local Loblaws supermarket recently switched to digital labels.",
      "Social media is filled with warnings that grocers will use the technology to charge more for ice cream if it\u2019s hot outside, hike the price of umbrellas if it\u2019s raining or to gather information about customers.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania fired off a letter to Kroger last fall demanding to know whether it would use its electronic labels as part of a dynamic pricing strategy.",
      "Lawmakers in Rhode Island and Maine have introduced bills to limit the use of digital labels. In Arizona, Democratic state Rep. Cesar Aguilar recently introduced a bill that would ban them altogether.",
      "The bill hasn\u2019t gotten a hearing, but Aguilar said he\u2019s determined to start a conversation about digital labels and how stores could abuse them.",
      "\u201cGrocery stores study when people go shopping the most. And so you might be able to see a price go down one day and then go up another day,\u201d Aguilar told The Associated Press.",
      "Researchers say those fears are misplaced. A study published in late May found \u201cvirtually no surge pricing\u201d before or after electronic shelf labels were adopted. The study was authored by Ioannis Stamatopoulos of the University of Texas, Austin, Robert Evan Sanders of the University of California, San Diego and Robert Bray of Northwestern University",
      "The researchers looked at prices between 2019 and 2024 at an unnamed grocery chain than began using digital labels in October 2022. They found that temporary price increases affected 0.005% of products on any given day before electronic shelf labels were introduced, a share that increased by only 0.0006 percentage points after digital labels were installed.",
      "The study also determined that discounts were slightly more common after digital labels were introduced.",
      "Economists have long wondered why grocery prices don\u2019t change more often, according to Stamatopoulos. If bananas are about to expire, for example, it makes sense to lower the price on them. He said the cost of having workers change prices by hand could be one issue.",
      "But there\u2019s another reason: Shoppers watch grocery prices closely, and stores don\u2019t want to risk angering them.",
      "\u201cSelling groceries is not selling a couch. It\u2019s not a one-time transaction and you will never see them again,\u201d Stamatopoulos said. \u201cYou want them coming to the store every week.\u201d",
      "Electronic price labels aren\u2019t new. They\u2019ve been in use for more than a decade at groceries in Europe and some U.S. retailers, like Kohl's.",
      "But they\u2019ve been slow to migrate to U.S. grocery stores. Only around 5% to 10% of U.S. supermarkets now have electronic labels, compared to 80% in Europe, said Amanda Oren, vice president of industry strategy for North American grocery at Relex Solutions, a technology company that helps retailers forecast demand.",
      "Oren said cost is one issue that has slowed the U.S. rollout. The tiny screens cost between $5 and $20, Oren said, but every product a store sells needs one, and the average supermarket has 100,000 or more individual products.",
      "Still, the U.S. industry is charging ahead. Walmart, the nation's largest grocer and retailer, hopes to have digital price labels at 2,300 U.S. stores by 2026. Kroger is expanding the use of digital labels this year after testing them at 20 stores. Whole Foods is testing the labels in nearly 50 stores.",
      "Companies say electronic price labels have tremendous advantages. Walmart says it used to take employees two days to change paper price labels on the 120,000 items it has in a typical store. With digital tags, it takes a few minutes.",
      "The labels can also be useful. Some have codes shoppers can scan to see recipes or nutrition information. Instacart has a system in thousands of U.S. stores, including Aldi and Schnucks, that flashes a light on the digital tag when Instacart shoppers are nearby to help them find products.",
      "Ahold Delhaize\u2019s Albert Heijn supermarket chain in the Netherlands and Belgium has been testing an artificial intelligence-enabled tool since 2022 that marks down prices on its digital labels every 15 minutes for products nearing expiration. The system has reduced more than 250 tons of food waste annually, the company said.",
      "But Warren and Casey are skeptical. In their letter to Kroger, the U.S. senators noted a partnership with Microsoft that planned to put cameras in grocery aisles and offer personalized deals to shoppers depending on their gender and age.",
      "In its response, Kroger said the prices shown on its digital labels were not connected to any sort of facial recognition technology. It also denied surging prices during periods of peak demand.",
      "\u201cKroger\u2019s business model is built on a foundation of lowering prices to attract more customers,\u201d the company said.",
      "Aguilar, the Arizona lawmaker, said he also opposes the transition to digital labels because he thinks they will cost jobs. His constituents have pointed out that grocery prices keep rising even though there are fewer workers in checkout lanes, he said.",
      "\u201cThey are supposed to be part of our community, and that means hiring people from our community that fill those jobs,\" Aguilar said.",
      "But Relex Solutions' Oren said she doesn't think cutting labor costs is the main reason stores deploy digital price tags.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about working smarter, not harder, and being able to use that labor in better ways across the store rather than these very mundane, repetitive tasks,\u201d she said.",

      "Joked Telemetry Insight auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid, \u201cSince Trump has no history of retaliating against perceived adversaries, he\u2019ll probably just let this pass.\u201d",
      "Turning serious, he sees trouble ahead for Musk.",
      "\u201cFor someone that rants so much about government pork, all of Elon\u2019s businesses are extremely dependent on government largesse, which makes him vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Trump and the federal government also stand to lose from a long-running dispute, but not as much as Musk.",
      "The dispute comes just a week before a planned test of Tesla\u2019s driverless taxis in Austin, Texas, a major event for the company because sales of its EVs are lagging in many markets, and Musk needs a win.",
      "Trump can mess things up for Tesla by encouraging federal safety regulators to step in at any sign of trouble for the robotaxis.",
      "Even before the war of words broke out on Thursday, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration requested data on how Musk\u2019s driverless, autonomous taxis will perform in low-visibility conditions. That request follows an investigation last year into 2.4 million Teslas equipped with full self-driving software after several accidents, including one that killed a pedestrian.",
      "A spokesman for NHTSA said the probe was ongoing and that the agency \"will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice has also probed the safety of Tesla cars, but the status of that investigation is unclear. The DOJ did not respond immediately to requests for comment.",
      "The promise of a self-driving future led by Tesla inspired shareholders to boost the stock by 50% in the weeks after Musk confirmed the Austin rollout. But on Thursday, the stock plunged more than 14% amid the Trump-Musk standoff. On Friday, it recovered a bit, bouncing back nearly 4%.",
      "\u201cTesla\u2019s recent rise was almost entirely driven by robotaxi enthusiasm,\" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \u201cElon\u2019s feud with Trump could be a negative.\u201d",
      "One often-overlooked but important part of Tesla\u2019s business that could take a hit is its sales of carbon credits.",
      "As Musk and Trump were slugging it out Thursday, Republican senators inserted new language into Trump\u2019s budget bill that would eliminate fines for gas-powered cars that fall short of fuel economy standards. Tesla has a thriving side business selling \u201cregulatory credits\u201d to other automakers to make up for their shortfalls.",
      "Musk has downplayed the importance of the credits business, but the changes would hurt Tesla as it reels from boycotts of its cars tied to Musk\u2019s time working for Trump.",
      "Credit sales jumped by a third to $595 million in the first three months of the year even as total revenue slumped.",
      "Musk\u2019s foray into right-wing politics cost Tesla sales among the environmentally minded consumers who embraced electric cars and led to boycotts of Tesla showrooms.",
      "If Musk has indeed ended his close association with Trump, those buyers could come back, but that\u2019s far from certain.",
      "Meanwhile, one analyst speculated earlier this year that Trump voters in so-called red counties could buy Teslas \u201cin a meaningful way.\u201d But he\u2019s now less hopeful.",
      "\u201cThere are more questions than answers following Thursday developments,\u201d TD Cowen\u2019s Itay Michaeli wrote in his latest report, \u201cand it\u2019s still too early to determine any lasting impacts.\u201d",
      "Michaeli\u2019s stock target for Tesla earlier this year was $388. He has since lowered it to $330. Tesla was trading Friday at $300.",
      "Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he could cut government contracts to Musk\u2019s rocket company, SpaceX, a massive threat to a company that has received billions of federal dollars.",
      "The privately held company that is reportedly worth $350 billion provides launches, sends astronauts into space for NASA and has a contract to send a team from the space agency to the moon next year.",
      "But if Musk has a lot to lose, so does the U.S.",
      "SpaceX is the only U.S. company capable of transporting crews to and from the space station, using its four-person Dragon capsules. The other alternative is politically dicey: depending wholly on Russia's Soyuz capsules.",
      "Musk knew all this when he shot back at Trump that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft. But it is unclear how serious his threat was. Several hours later \u2014 in a reply to another X user \u2014 he said he wouldn\u2019t do it.",
      "A subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk\u2019s once-close relationship with the president.",
      "Musk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for some services during a trip with Trump in the Middle East last month. The company has also won a string of other recent deals in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere as Trump has threatened tariffs.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much politics played a role, and how much is pure business.",
      "On Friday, The Associated Press confirmed that India had approved a key license to Starlink. At least 40% of India\u2019s more than 1.4 billion people have no access to the internet.",
      "Big advertisers that fled X after Musk welcomed all manner of conspiracy theories to the social media platform have started to trickle back in recent months, possibly out of fear of a conservative backlash.",
      "Musk has called their decision to leave an \u201cillegal boycott\u201d and sued them, and the Trump administration recently weighed in with a Federal Trade Commission probe into possible coordination among them.",
      "Now advertisers may have to worry about a different danger.",
      "If Trump sours on X, \"there\u2019s a risk that it could again become politically radioactive for major brands,\u201d said Sarah Kreps, a political scientist at Cornell University. She added, though, that an \u201cexodus isn\u2019t obvious, and it would depend heavily on how the conflict escalates, how long it lasts and how it ends.\u201d",

      "Artificial Intelligence\u2019s use in filmmaking is growing",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Artificial intelligence 's use in movie making is exploding. And a young film festival, now in its junior year, is showcasing what this technology can do on screen today.",
      "The annual AI Film Festival organized by Runway, a company that specializes in AI-generated video, kicked off in New York Thursday night with ten short films from around the world making their debut on the big screen.",
      "\u201cThree years ago, this was such a crazy idea,\u201d Runway CEO Crist\u00f3bal Valenzuela told the crowd. \u201cToday, millions of people are making billions of videos using tools we only dreamed of.\u201d",
      "The film festival itself has grown significantly since its 2023 debut. About 300 people submitted films when it first began, Valenzuela said, compared to about 6,000 submissions received this year.",
      "The one and half-hour lineup stretched across a range of creative styles and ambitious themes \u2014 with Jacob Alder's \u201c Total Pixel Space \" taking home the festival's top prize. The 9-minute and 28-second film questions how many possible images \u2014 real or not \u2014 exist in the digital space, and uses math to calculate a colossal number. A stunning series of images, ranging from the familiar life moments to those that completely bend reality, gives viewers a glimpse of what's out there.",
      "Meanwhile, Andrew Salter's \u201cJailbird,\" which snagged second place, chronicles a chicken's journey \u2014 from the bird's perspective \u2014 to a human prison in the United Kingdom to take part in a joint-rehabilitation program. And \u201cOne,\u201d a futuristic story by Ricardo Villavicencio and Edward Saatchi about interplanetary travel followed in third place.",
      "The 10 films shown were finalists selected from thousands submitted to Runway's AI Film Festival this year. The shorts will also be shown at screenings held in Los Angeles and Paris next week.",
      "How AI is used and executed is a factor judges evaluate when determining festival winners. But not every film entered was made entirely using AI. While submission criteria requires each movie include the use of AI-generated video, there's no set threshold, meaning some films can take a more \u201cmixed media\u201d approach \u2014 such as combining live shots of actors or real-life images and sounds with AI-generated elements.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to encourage people to explore and experiment with it,\u201d Valenzuela said in an interview prior to Thursday's screening.",
      "Creating a coherent film using generative AI is no easy feat. It can take a long list of directions and numerous, detailed prompts to get even a short scene to make sense and look consistent. Still, the scope of what this kind of technology can do has grown significantly since Runway's first AI Film Festival in 2023 \u2014 and Valenzuela says that's reflected in today's submissions. While there are still limits, AI-generated video is becoming more and more life-like and realistic.",
      "Runway encourages the use of its own AI tools for films entered into its festival, but creators are also allowed to turn to other resources and tools as they put together the films \u2014 and across the industry, tools that use AI to create videos spanning from text, image and/or audio prompts have rapidly improved over recent years, while becoming increasingly available.",
      "\u201cThe way (this technology) has lived within film and media culture, and pop culture, has really accelerated,\u201d said Joshua Glick, an associate professor of film and electronic arts at Bard College.",
      "He adds that Runway's film fest, which is among a handful of showcases aimed at spotlighting AI's creative capabilities, arrives as companies in this space are searching for heightened \u201clegitimacy and recognition\u201d for the tools they are creating \u2014 with aims to cement partnerships in Hollywood as a result.",
      "AI's presence in Hollywood is already far-reaching, and perhaps more expansive than many moviegoers realize. Beyond \u201cheadline-grabbing\u201d (and at times controversial) applications that big-budget films have done to \u201cde-age\u201d actors or create eye-catching stunts, Glick notes, this technology is often incorporated in an array of post-production editing, digital touch-ups and additional behind-the-scenes work like sorting footage.",
      "Industry executives repeatedly point to how AI can improve efficiency in the movie making process \u2014 allowing creatives to perform a task that once took hours, for example, in a matter of minutes \u2014 and foster further innovation.",
      "Still, AI's rapid growth and adoption has also heightened anxieties around the burgeoning technology \u2014 notably its implications for workers.",
      "The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees \u2014 which represents behind-the-scenes entertainment workers in the U.S. and Canada \u2014 has \u201clong embraced new technologies that enhance storytelling,\u201d Vanessa Holtgrewe, IATSE's international vice president, said in an emailed statement. \u201cBut we\u2019ve also been clear: AI must not be used to undermine workers\u2019 rights or livelihoods.\u201d",
      "IATSE and other unions have continued to meet with major studios and establish provisions in efforts to provide guardrails around the use of AI. The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists has also been vocal about AI protections for its members, a key sticking point in recent labor actions.",
      "For Runway's AI Film Festival, Valenzuela hopes screening films that incorporate AI-generated video can showcase what's possible \u2014 and how he says this technology can help, not hurt, creatives in the work they do today.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s natural to fear change ... (But) it's important to understand what you can do with it,\" Valenzuela said. Even filmmaking, he adds, was born \u201cbecause of scientific breakthroughs that at the time were very uncomfortable for many people.\"",

      "Britain\u2019s competition regulator says Amazon has pledged to beef up its systems to combat fake online reviews",
      "LONDON -- Amazon has pledged to beef up fight against fake reviews, Britain's competition regulator said Friday after an investigation into whether big online platforms are doing enough to crack down on phony online ratings for products and services.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority said it secured the \u201cundertakings\u201d from Amazon, after getting a similar agreement earlier this year from Google to clamp down on rogue reviews plaguing the internet.",
      "The company promised to strengthen its existing systems for fighting fake reviews. It will also tackle catalog abuse, which involves sellers boosting star ratings for a product by hijacking good reviews from a completely different one.",
      "As an example, a shopper might come across a pair of headphones with a five-star rating. But, after looking closer, most of the reviews are for a mobile phone charger, the watchdog said.",
      "As part of its commitments, Amazon has agreed to sanction anyone caught using these tactics. Businesses could be banned from selling on the Amazon website and users posting fake reviews could be banned from posting them, the CMA said.",
      "The watchdog's chief executive, Sarah Cardell, said that so many people shop on Amazon and \u201cstar ratings and reviews have a huge impact on their choices.\u201d",
      "Amazon's pledges \u201cmean people can make decisions with greater confidence \u2013 knowing that those who seek to pull the wool over their eyes will be swiftly dealt with.\u201d",
      "The pledges apply to Amazon's U.K. website. The company said in a statement that it has zero tolerance for fake reviews and that the measures build on Amazon's existing efforts to tackle them.",
      "\u201cWe invest significant resources to proactively stop fake reviews ever appearing on our store, including on expert human investigators and machine learning models that analyse thousands of data points to detect risk,\" the company said.",
      "The CMA opened its investigations into Amazon and Google in 2021 to examine whether the two companies broke U.K. consumer law by failing to protect shoppers. It began looking into phony reviews on some big websites amid the boom in online shopping fueled by the coronavirus pandemic.",

      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation\u2019s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health.",
      "Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products \u2014 including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service \u2014 in ways that put money in her own pocket.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses.",
      "In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.",
      "Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn\u2019t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a \u201cmaterial connection\u201d to a product they promote.",
      "Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.",
      "\u201cI fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.",
      "The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users\u2019 glucose levels, could benefit from this administration\u2019s health guidance and policy.",
      "Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.",
      "The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being \u201cbought off\u201d or \u201ccorrupt\u201d because of ties to industry.",
      "Means' use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.",
      "Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.",
      "\u201cDuring my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,\u201d she wrote on her website.",
      "Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.",
      "Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.",
      "\u201cAt the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we\u2019re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we\u2019d want it,\u201d she said on Megyn Kelly's podcast last year.",
      "But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.",
      "During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn\u2019t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.",
      "Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to \u201cencompass more and more of our lives,\u201d said Emily Hund, author of \u201cThe Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.\u201d",
      "With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.",
      "Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don\u2019t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.",
      "\u201cA lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,\u201d said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don\u2019t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.",
      "Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.",
      "Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, \u201cGood Energy\"; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.",
      "She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included \u201caffiliate\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a \u201cmetabolic health collection.\u201d",
      "On a \u201cMy Faves\u201d page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links \u201care affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.\u201d",
      "It's not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.",
      "Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast \u201cLet\u2019s Be Honest\u201d that \u201crelationships are influential.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,\" Means said. \"We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.\u201d",
      "In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was \u201cinsanity\u201d to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, \u201cWe need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren\u2019t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.\u201d",
      "On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, \u201cI do understand how it\u2019s messy.\u201d",
      "Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a \u201cClean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations\u201d guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.",
      "Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.",
      "Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an \u201cInvestor and/or Advisor.\u201d The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.",
      "Though the \u201cAbout\u201d page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that\u2019s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.",
      "Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives' LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil's founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means' business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means' advice \u201ctransformational,\u201d saying her teachings reversed Niazi's prediabetes and other ailments.",
      "\u201cI am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,\u201d Niazi said in an email.",
      "While the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair.",
      "\u201cWhat you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,\u201d Sylvain said, adding, \u201cShould there be any doubt about claims you make about products?\u201d",
      "Means isn\u2019t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.",
      "Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job \u2014 among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle.",
      "He divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time.",
      "Means has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role.",
      "Hund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict.",
      "Other administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties.",
      "\u201cThis is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,\u201d Hund said. \u201cIs this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?\u201d",

      "As President Donald Trump and Elon Musk argued on social media on Thursday, the world's richest man threatened to decommission a space capsule used to take astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station.",
      "After Trump threatened to cut government contracts given to Musk's SpaceX rocket company and his Starlink internet satellite services, Musk responded via X that SpaceX \"will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.\u201d",
      "It's unclear how serious Musk's threat was. But the capsule, developed with the help of government contracts, is an important part of keeping the space station running. NASA also relies heavily on SpaceX for other programs including launching science missions and, later this decade, returning astronauts to the surface of the moon.",
      "SpaceX is the only U.S. company capable right now of transporting crews to and from the space station, using its four-person Dragon capsules.",
      "Boeing\u2019s Starliner capsule has flown astronauts only once; last year\u2019s test flight went so badly that the two NASA astronauts had to hitch a ride back to Earth via SpaceX in March, more than nine months after launching last June.",
      "Starliner remains grounded as NASA decides whether to go with another test flight with cargo, rather than a crew.",
      "SpaceX also uses a Dragon capsule for its own privately run missions. The next one of those is due to fly next week on a trip chartered by Axiom Space, a Houston company.",
      "Cargo versions of the Dragon capsule are also used to ferry food and other supplies to the orbiting lab.",
      "Russia\u2019s Soyuz capsules are the only other means of getting crews to the space station right now.",
      "The Soyuz capsules hold three people at a time. For now, each Soyuz launch carries two Russians and one NASA astronaut, and each SpaceX launch has one Russian on board under a barter system. That way, in an emergency requiring a capsule to return, there is always someone from the U.S. and Russian on board.",
      "With its first crew launch for NASA in 2020 \u2014 the first orbital flight of a crew by a private company \u2014 SpaceX enabled NASA to reduce its reliance on Russia for crew transport. The Russian flights had been costing the U.S. tens of millions of dollars per seat, for years.",
      "NASA has also used Russian spacecraft for cargo, along with U.S. contractor Northrup Grumman.",
      "The company has used its rockets to launch several science missions for NASA as well as military equipment.",
      "Last year, SpaceX also won a NASA contract to help bring the space station out of orbit when it is no longer usable.",
      "SpaceX\u2019s Starship mega rocket is what NASA has picked to get astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface of the moon, at least for the first two landing missions. Starship made its ninth test flight last week from Texas, but tumbled out of control and broke apart.",

      "Shares of Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle maker fell sharply Thursday as investors fear his dispute with President Donald Trump could end up hurting the company",
      "Investors bought hundreds of billions of dollars of Tesla stock after Donald Trump was elected on a bet that politics were more important than profits.",
      "In three hours Thursday, they learned yet again how dangerous that gamble could be.",
      "Shares of Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle maker plunged more than 14% in a stunning wipeout as investors dumped holdings amid a bitter war of words between the president and the world's richest man. By the end of the trading day, $150 billion of Tesla's value had been erased, more than what it would take to buy all the shares of Starbucks and hundreds of other big publicly traded U.S. companies.",
      "In after-hours trading, Tesla shares rose 0.8%.",
      "The disagreement started over the president's budget bill, then quickly turned nasty. After Musk said that Trump wouldn't haven't gotten elected without his help, Trump implied that he may turn the federal government against his companies, including Tesla and SpaceX.",
      "\u201cThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,\u201d Trump wrote on his social messaging service Truth Social. \u201cI was always surprised that Biden didn\u2019t do it!\u201d",
      "The drop on Thursday partially reversed a big runup in the eight weeks since Musk confirmed that Tesla would be testing an autonomous, driverless \u201crobotaxi\u201d service in Austin, Texas, this month.",
      "Investors fear Trump might not be in such a rush to usher in a future of self-driving cars in the U.S., and that could slam Tesla. So much of its real business selling electric cars is struggling now and so it needs the promise of a new age of driverless cars to be realized\u2014 and fast.",
      "\u201cThe whole goal of robotaxis is to have them in 20 or 25 cities next year,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, one of Tesla's biggest fans, but now worried. \"If you start to heighten the regulatory environment, that could delay that path.\u201d",
      "He added, \"There is a fear that Trump is not going to play Mr. Nice Guy.\u201d",
      "Trump's threat to cut government contracts seems targeted more to another of Musk's businesses, SpaceX, than his car company. The privately held rocket company has received billions of dollars for sending astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, providing launches and doing other work for NASA. The company is currently racing to develop a mega rocket for the space agency to send astronauts to moon next year.",
      "A subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk's once-close relationship with the president.",
      "On a trip with Trump to the Middle East last month, Musk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for aviation and maritime use. Though its not clear how much politics has played a role, a string of other recent deals in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere has come as Trump has threatened tariffs and sent diplomats scrambling to please the president.",
      "One measure of SpaceX's success: A private financing round followed by a private sale of shares in recent months reportedly valued it at an $350 billion, up from an estimated $210 billion a year ago.",
      "Now all that is possibly in danger. Tesla shares got even a bigger lift from Musk's close relationship with Trump, initially at least.",
      "After the presidential election in November, investors rushed into the stock, adding more than $450 billion to its value in a few weeks. The belief was that the company would see big riches as Trump eased regulatory oversight of Tesla. They also were betting that the new administration would embrace Musk's plans for millions of cars on U.S. roads without drivers behind the wheel.",
      "After hitting an all-time high on Dec. 17, the shares retreated as Musk\u2019s time as head of a government cost-cutting group led to boycotts and a hit to Tesla's reputation. They've recently popped higher again after Musk vowed to focus more on Tesla and its upcoming driverless taxi launch.",
      "Now investors aren't so sure, a worry that has translated into big paper losses in Tesla stock held by Musk personally \u2014 down $20 billion for the day.",

    "story": [
      "A study published in the academic journal Science has found that cutting off the horns of rhinos in Africa leads to a reduction in poaching of the endangered species",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- Cutting off the horns of sedated rhinos with a chainsaw has been viewed by wildlife conservationists in Africa for more than 30 years as a necessary evil to save the iconic endangered species from poaching.",
      "They hoped the drastic action was working, but evidence was scarce.",
      "Now, a study published Thursday in the academic journal Science has found that dehorning rhinos has led to a large reduction in poaching in game reserves in and around the Kruger National Park in northern South Africa \u2014 an area that's home to 25% of the world's rhinos and is especially vulnerable to poaching.",
      "The results of the seven-year study that ended in 2023 are seen as long-awaited evidence that removing rhinos' horns \u2014 which needs to be done every one to two years because they grow back \u2014 helps them survive, even if the animals lose part of their makeup.",
      "The conclusions seem obvious. Lucrative illegal markets in parts of southeast Asia and China crave rhino horns for use in traditional medicines, and removing the rhinos' horns take away what poachers are after.",
      "But Tim Kuiper, a biodiversity scientist at South Africa's Nelson Mandela University and the lead author of the study, said it was new to have long-term data from multiple sites on dehorning rhinos. He said the study, conducted between January 2017 and December 2023, focused on 11 reserves in the Kruger area and compared data from eight that dehorned their rhinos against the three that didn't.",
      "It also analyzed data from the reserves before and after they dehorned their rhinos.",
      "The study showed that dehorning consistently reduced poaching, Kuiper said. It found that the dehorning of more than 2,000 rhinos resulted in a 78% reduction in poaching in those eight reserves, providing some confirmation that such an invasive intervention was worth it.",
      "\u201cIt is a big part of what a rhino is, having a horn,\u201d Kuiper said. \u201cSo having to remove it is kind of a necessary evil, if I can put it that way. But it\u2019s very effective. There\u2019s no doubt it saved hundreds of rhinos' lives.\u201d",
      "South Africa has the largest numbers of black and white rhinos. Namibia, Zimbabwe and Kenya also have significant populations. There are around 17,500 white rhinos and 6,500 black rhinos left in the world, with black rhino numbers reduced from 70,000 in 1970 to less than 2,500 by the time poaching reached a crisis point in the mid-1990s, according to the Save the Rhino organization.",
      "Dehorning rhinos started in southern Africa as early as 1989. It has not been accepted without question.",
      "There has been opposition from animal rights activists but also questions from conservationists over what impact it has on a rhino's wellbeing, and what a future might look like with more hornless rhinos.",
      "Vanessa Duthe, a rhino researcher in South Africa not involved in the study, said rhinos use their horns to defend themselves against predators, to compete for territory and, in the case of black rhinos, to look for food. There is also evidence that dehorned rhinos adjust their movements to live in smaller ranges, she said.",
      "She said conservationists don't know the full impacts of dehorning, but research had found it had no adverse effect on rhinos' breeding rates or mortality rates.",
      "\u201cWhat we do know is that the benefits of dehorning by far outweigh any ecological cost that we\u2019re aware of today,\u201d Duthe said. She said dehorning a rhino now takes around 10 minutes and the process causes minimum distress. Blindfolds and earmuffs are put on sedated rhinos during dehorning, which also provides an opportunity to microchip rhinos and collect samples that aid research.",
      "Conservationists agree that dehorning alone will not end rhino poaching and Kuiper said he saw it as a short-to-mid-term solution. Other efforts like more effective law enforcement and better support for game rangers on the frontline are key.",
      "While South Africa has helped pull rhinos back from the threat of extinction, more than 400 rhinos a year are still killed by poachers in the country.",
      "The dehorning study was a collaboration between scientists from three South African universities, Oxford University in England and game reserve managers and rangers. It also involved the South African National Parks department, the World Wildlife Fund and the Rhino Recovery Fund.",

      "Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body",
      "WASHINGTON -- Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body. Today, they account for 26%.",
      "Like other prestigious U.S. universities, Harvard for years has been cashing in on its global cache to recruit the world\u2019s best students. Now, the booming international enrollment has left colleges vulnerable to a new line of attack from President Donald Trump. The president has begun to use his control over the nation\u2019s borders as leverage in his fight to reshape American higher education.",
      "Trump\u2019s latest salvo against Harvard uses a broad federal law to bar foreign students from entering the country to attend the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His proclamation applies only to Harvard, and a federal judge late Thursday temporarily blocked it. But Trump's order poses a threat to other universities his administration has targeted as hotbeds of liberalism in need of reform.",
      "It\u2019s rattling campuses under federal scrutiny, including Columbia University, where foreign students make up 40% of the campus. As the Trump administration stepped up reviews of new student visas last week, a group of Columbia faculty and alumni raised concerns over Trump\u2019s gatekeeping powers.",
      "\u201cColumbia\u2019s exposure to this \u2018stroke of pen\u2019 risk is uniquely high,\u201d the Stand Columbia Society wrote in a newsletter.",
      "People from other countries made up about 6% of all college students in the U.S. in 2023, but they accounted for 27% of the eight schools in the Ivy League, according to an Associated Press analysis of Education Department data. Columbia\u2019s 40% was the largest concentration, followed by Harvard and Cornell at about 25%. Brown University had the smallest share at 20%.",
      "Other highly selective private universities have seen similar trends, including at Northeastern University and New York University, which each saw foreign enrollment double between 2013 and 2023. Growth at public universities has been more muted. Even at the 50 most selective public schools, foreign students account for about 11% of the student body.",
      "As the middle class has grown in other countries, more families have been able to afford test prep and admissions guidance to compete for spots in the Ivy League, said Rajika Bhandari, who leads a firm of higher education consultants.",
      "\u201cThe Ivy League brand is very strong overseas, especially in countries like India and China, where families are extremely brand-aware of top institutions in the U.S. and other competing countries,\u201d Bhandari said in an email.",
      "Over the last two decades, she said, U.S. universities have increasingly recognized the benefits of international exchange, seeing it as a crucial revenue source that subsidizes U.S. students and keeps enrollments up in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math.",
      "America\u2019s universities have been widening their doors to foreign students for decades, but the numbers shot upward starting around 2008, as Chinese students came to U.S. universities in rising numbers.",
      "It was part of a \u201cgold rush\u201d in higher education, said William Brustein, who orchestrated the international expansion of several universities.",
      "\u201cWhether you were private or you were public, you had to be out in front in terms of being able to claim you were the most global university,\" said Brustein, who led efforts at Ohio State University and West Virginia University.",
      "The race was driven in part by economics, he said. Foreign students typically aren\u2019t eligible for financial aid and, at some schools, they pay much higher tuition than their American counterparts. Colleges also were eyeing global rankings that gave schools a boost if they recruited larger numbers of foreign students and scholars, he said.",
      "Some wealthier universities \u2014 including Harvard \u2014 offer financial aid to foreign students. But students who get into those top-tier U.S. universities often have the means to pay higher tuition rates, Brustein said. That provides further incentive to enroll more foreign students, he said, saving more scholarship money for American students.",
      "Still, international enrollment didn't expand equally across all types of colleges. Public universities often face pressure from state lawmakers to limit foreign enrollment and keep more seats open for state residents. Private universities don\u2019t face that pressure, and many aggressively recruited foreign students as their enrollment of U.S. students stayed flat. The college-going rate among American students has changed little for decades, and some have been turned off on college by rising costs and student debt loads.",
      "Proponents of international exchange say foreign students pour billions of dollars into the U.S. economy, and many go on to support the nation\u2019s tech industry and other fields in need of skilled workers. Most international students study STEM fields.",
      "In the Ivy League, most international growth has been at the graduate level, while undergraduate numbers have seen more modest increases. Foreign graduate students make up more than half the students at Harvard\u2019s government and design schools, along with five of Columbia\u2019s schools.",
      "Harvard's undergraduate foreign population increased by about 100 students from 2013 to 2023, while graduate numbers increased by nearly 2,000. Part of that growth can be explained by increasing global competition at the graduate level, said William Kirby, a historian at Harvard who has written about the evolution of higher education.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t recruit the very best students internationally in your most important graduate programs, particularly in science and engineering, then you will not be competitive,\" Kirby said.",
      "The Ivy League has been able to outpace other schools in large part because of its reputation, Brustein said. He recalls trips to China and India, where he spoke with families that could recite where each Ivy League school sat in world rankings.",
      "\u201cThat was the golden calf for these families. They really thought, \u2018If we could just get into these schools, the rest of our lives would be on easy street,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Last week, Trump said he thought Harvard should cap its foreign students to about 15%.",
      "\u201cWe have people who want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can\u2019t get in because we have foreign students there,\u201d Trump said at a news conference.",
      "The university called Trump's latest action banning entry into the country to attend Harvard \u201cyet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard\u2019s First Amendment rights.\u201d",
      "In a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration\u2019s previous attempt to block international students at Harvard, the university said its foreign student population was the result of \u201ca painstaking, decades-long project\u201d to attract the most qualified international students. Losing access to student visas would immediately harm the school\u2019s mission and reputation, it said.",
      "\u201cIn our interconnected global economy,\" the school said, \u201ca university that cannot welcome students from all corners of the world is at a competitive disadvantage.\u201d",

      "It's kitten season in warm-weather areas and animal shelters need all the help they can get",
      "NEW YORK -- Strawberry, Blueberry, JoJo and Mazzy were about 6 weeks old when animal rescuers coaxed them out of long metal pipes in the parking lot of a storage unit company. Meatball was a single kitten living in a cold garage with a group of semi-feral adult cats.",
      "Spaghetti, Macaroni and Rigatoni, meanwhile, were just 2 weeks old when the good folks of LIC Feral Feeders, a cat rescue in Queens, took them in and bottle-fed them until they were strong enough to survive.",
      "Consider these cuties the face of kitten season 2025.",
      "Kitten season, typically landing during warmer months, is the time of year when most cats give birth. That produces a surge of kittens, often fragile neonates. Shelters get overwhelmed, especially when it comes to the 24-hour care and feeding of extremely young kittens.",
      "That, as a result, triggers a need for more foster homes because many of the 4,000 or so shelters in the U.S. don't have the time or resources for around-the-clock care, said Hannah Shaw, an animal welfare advocate known as the Kitten Lady with more than a million followers on Instagram.",
      "\u201cWe see about 1.5 million kittens entering shelters every year. And most of them will come into shelters during May and June,\u201d she said. \u201cShelters need all hands on deck to help out through fostering.\u201d",
      "Familiarity with fostering animals is high, Shaw said. The act of doing it is a different story. There's a false perception, she said, that the expense of fostering animals falls on the people who step up to do it. These days, many shelters and rescues cover the food, supplies and medical costs of fostering.",
      "\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t foster because they think it\u2019s going to be this huge cost, but fostering actually only costs you time and love,\u201d she said.",
      "Lisa Restine, a Hill\u2019s Pet Nutrition veterinarian, said people looking to adopt kittens should take pairs since cats often bond early in life. And how many cats is too many cats per household?",
      "\u201cThis is nothing serious or medical but my general rule of thumb is the number of adults in the house, like a 2-to-1 ratio, because you can carry one cat in each hand, so if there are two adults you can have four cats and still be sane,\u201d she said.",
      "Square footage to avoid territory disputes is a good rule of thumb when planning for cats, Restine said. Two cats per 800 square feet then 200 square feet more for each addition should help, she said.",
      "Littermates, like Macaroni and Rigatoni, are much more likely to bond, Restine said. Kittens not biologically related but raised together often bond as well \u2014 like Meatball and Spaghetti. But adopters hoping to bond an adult cat with a new kitten arrival may be disappointed.",
      "\u201cOnce they're over that 3- or 4-month mark, it's hard to get that true bonding,\u201d Restine said.",
      "Typically, kittens stay in their foster homes from a few weeks to a few months. While statistics are not kept on the number of kitten fosters that \u201cfail\u201d \u2014 when foster families decided to keep their charges \u2014 some shelters report rates as high as 90%. That's a win, despite use of the word \u201cfail,\u201d advocates note.",
      "Shaw sees another barrier holding people back from fostering: the notion that it requires special training or skills. That's why she has dedicated her life to educating the public, offering videos, books and research on how it works at her site kittenlady.org.",
      "Companies are coming on board, too. Hill's, a pet food company, runs the Hill\u2019s Food, Shelter & Love program. It has provided more than $300 million in food support to over 1,000 animal shelters that support fostering in North America.",
      "\u201cAbout a quarter of a million kittens, unfortunately, don\u2019t survive in our shelters every year,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cThe shelter\u2019s going to be there to mentor and support you. So I think a lot of the fear that people have about fostering, they might find that actually it is something you totally can do. It\u2019s just scary because you haven\u2019t done it yet.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The Nintendo Switch 2 finally hit store shelves on Thursday, eight years after the initial release of Japanese video-game maker Nintendo's popular video game console.",
      "Even with a hefty $450 price tag, fans around the world, from Japan to the U.S., lined up outside stores to pick up pre-orders or have a chance to buy the device. The release ends months of anticipation that included pre-order hiccups and fears that tariffs would delay the release of the Switch 2.",
      "Here's what to know about the release and where you can buy it.",
      "The Nintendo Switch's unique ability to switch from a handheld console to a traditional one helped make it a hit when it launched in 2017. The Nintendo Switch Lite, which was a handheld-only device released two years later, also became popular, especially during the pandemic. It helped usher in bestselling Nintendo games including \u201cThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,\u201d \u201cMario Kart 8 Deluxe\u201d and \u201cAnimal Crossing: New Horizons.\u201d",

But demand has dwindled for the Switch, now in its eighth year after its debut. Nintendo hopes the new console will boost its declining sales.",
      "The base Switch 2 costs $450 and a bundle with the new \u201cMario Kart World\u201d included costs $500.

Nintendo acknowledged the \u201cvery high demand\u201d at the time and said it was working hard to fulfill orders, but also urged people to try to buy the device without a pre-order on June 5.",
      "Nintendo said it expects to sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles for the fiscal year through March 2026.",
      "The company is hoping the device jump-starts its sagging sales. In May Nintendo reported a 43% decline in profit for the fiscal year through March but promised a turnaround.",

      "A private lunar lander from Japan has crashed into the moon",
      "A private lunar lander from Japan crashed while attempting a touchdown Friday, the latest casualty in the commercial rush to the moon.",
      "The Tokyo-based company ispace declared the mission a failure several hours after communication was lost with the lander. Flight controllers scrambled to gain contact, but were met with only silence and said they were concluding the mission.",
      "Communications ceased less than two minutes before the spacecraft\u2019s scheduled landing on the moon with a mini rover. Until then, the descent from lunar orbit seemed to be going well.",
      "CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada apologized to everyone who contributed to the mission, the second lunar strikeout for ispace.",
      "Two years ago, the company\u2019s first moonshot ended in a crash landing, giving rise to the name \u201cResilience\u201d for its successor lander. Resilience carried a rover with a shovel to gather lunar dirt as well as a Swedish artist\u2019s toy-size red house for placement on the moon\u2019s dusty surface.",
      "Company officials said it was too soon to know whether the same problem doomed both missions.",
      "\u201cThis is the second time that we were not able to land. So we really have to take it very seriously,\" Hakamada told reporters. He stressed that the company would press ahead with more lunar missions.",
      "A preliminary analysis indicates the laser system for measuring the altitude did not work as planned, and the lander descended too fast, officials said. \"Based on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface,\u201d the company said in a written statement.",
      "Long the province of governments, the moon became a target of private outfits in 2019, with more flops than wins along the way.",
      "Launched in January from Florida on a long, roundabout journey, Resilience entered lunar orbit last month. It shared a SpaceX ride with Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost, which reached the moon faster and became the first private entity to successfully land there in March.",
      "Another U.S. company, Intuitive Machines, arrived at the moon a few days after Firefly. But the tall, spindly lander face-planted in a crater near the moon\u2019s south pole and was declared dead within hours.",
      "Resilience was targeting the top of the moon, a less treacherous place than the shadowy bottom. The ispace team chose a flat area with few boulders in Mare Frigoris or Sea of Cold, a long and narrow region full of craters and ancient lava flows that stretches across the near side\u2019s northern tier.",
      "Plans had called for the 7.5-foot (2.3-meter) Resilience to beam back pictures within hours and for the lander to lower the piggybacking rover onto the lunar surface this weekend.",
      "Made of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic with four wheels, ispace\u2019s European-built rover \u2014 named Tenacious \u2014 sported a high-definition camera to scout out the area and a shovel to scoop up some lunar dirt for NASA.",
      "The rover, weighing just 11 pounds (5 kilograms), was going to stick close to the lander, going in circles at a speed of less than one inch (a couple centimeters) per second. It was capable of venturing up to two-thirds of a mile (1 kilometer) from the lander and should be operational throughout the two-week mission, the period of daylight.",
      "Besides science and tech experiments, there was an artistic touch.",
      "The rover held a tiny, Swedish-style red cottage with white trim and a green door, dubbed the Moonhouse by creator Mikael Genberg, for placement on the lunar surface.",
      "Minutes before the attempted landing, Hakamada assured everyone that ispace had learned from its first failed mission. \u201cEngineers did everything they possibly could\u201d to ensure success this time, he said.",
      "He considered the latest moonshot \u201cmerely a steppingstone\u201d to its bigger lander launching by 2027 with NASA involvement.",
      "Ispace, like other businesses, does not have \u201cinfinite funds\u201d and cannot afford repeated failures, Jeremy Fix, chief engineer for ispace\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, said at a conference last month.",
      "While not divulging the cost of the current mission, company officials said it\u2019s less than the first one which exceeded $100 million.",
      "Two other U.S. companies are aiming for moon landings by year\u2019s end: Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin and Astrobotic Technology. Astrobotic\u2019s first lunar lander missed the moon altogether in 2024 and came crashing back through Earth\u2019s atmosphere.",
      "For decades, governments competed to get to the moon. Only five countries have pulled off successful robotic lunar landings: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan. Of those, only the U.S. has landed people on the moon: 12 NASA astronauts from 1969 through 1972.",
      "NASA expects to send four astronauts around the moon next year. That would be followed a year or more later by the first lunar landing by a crew in more than a half-century, with SpaceX's Starship providing the lift from lunar orbit all the way down to the surface. China also has moon landing plans for its own astronauts by 2030.",

      "NEW YORK -- Federal prosecutors charged two Chinese researchers on Tuesday with smuggling a crop-killing fungus into the U.S. last summer \u2014 charges that come amid heightened political tensions between the two countries and as the Trump administration moves to revoke visas from visiting Chinese students.",
      "Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu are charged with conspiracy, smuggling, making false statements and visa fraud for allegedly bringing the fungus Fusarium graminearum into the U.S. Jian, 33, was booked in a Detroit federal court. Liu, 34, is thought to be in China.",
      "According to the FBI, Liu had small baggies of the fungus stashed in his backpack when he flew to the U.S. last year and, after claiming ignorance about the plant material inside them, said he was planning to use it for research at a University of Michigan lab where Jian worked and where Liu previously worked.",
      "Fusarium graminearum causes a disease called Fusarium head blight that can wipe out cereal crops such as wheat, barley and maize and rice \u2014 it inflicts $1 billion in losses annually on U.S. wheat and barley crops, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "It isn\u2019t the only fungus to cause Fusarium head blight, but it\u2019s the most common culprit in the U.S. The fungus infects plants early in the growing season, shriveling wheat grains and blanching crop heads a whitish-tan color. It also causes a toxin to accumulate in wheat kernels that can make them unsafe for people and livestock to eat.",
      "Nicknamed \u201cvomitoxin\u201d because it\u2019s most known for causing livestock to throw up, it can also cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache and fever in animals and people.",

      "Researchers often bring foreign plants, animals and even strains of fungi to the U.S. to study them, but they must file certain permits before moving anything across state or national borders.

      "Homan himself earlier Monday pushed back on the idea he was going to arrest Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, both Democrats.",
      "In an interview with NBC News over the weekend, Homan had not ruled out the possibility -- prompting Newsom to respond: \"He knows where to find me.\"",
      "Homan on Monday morning, during an interview on Fox, commented further on his remarks to NBC.",
      "\"The reporter asked about, 'Could Governor, Governor Newsom, or Mayor Bass, be arrested? I said, 'Well, no one's above the law, if they cross the line and commit a crime. Absolutely they can.' So, there was no discussion about arresting Newsom,\" he said.",
      "\"I've said it many times, You can protest, you got your First Amendment rights, but when you cross that line, you put hands on an ICE officer, or you destroy property, or ICE says that you're impeding law enforcement ... That's a crime, and that the Trump administration is not going to tolerate. You cross that line we're gonna see prosecution in the Department of Justice,\" Homan said.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed solidarity with the president after the president suggested Newsom should be arrested.",
      "\u201cI heard that for the first time sitting next to the president when they asked him that question at the White House. I don't know what all that involves, but he gave comment there, and I'll stick by what he said,\u201d Johnson said, adding that he also agrees with the Trump's decision to send in the National Guard, predicting it will have a \u201cdeterrent effect.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have to maintain the rule of law, and if the state and local leaders are unable or unwilling to do so, it is the job of the federal government to step in,\u201d Johnson told reporters outside the White House.",
      "Trump on Monday also doubled down on his decision over the weekend to deploy the National Guard to California, over objections from Newsom.",
      "Trump said in 2020 that a request from a governor was needed to send in the National Guard. ABC News asked Trump what changed between his statement then and now.",
      "\"Well, the biggest change from that statement is we have an incompetent governor,\" Trump said. Trump contended his administration was \"straightening out his problems.\"",
      "\"I mean, I think we have it very well under control. I think it would have been a very bad situation. It was heading in the wrong direction. It's now heading in the right direction,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump has long expressed a desire to quash protests he considered dangerous by using the military, though the use of federal troops on U.S. soil is mostly prohibited by the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act. Trump deployed the National Guard in this situation under Title 10 of the U.S. Code.",
      "Asked if he would deploy Marines to Los Angeles on Monday, Trump had said \"we'll see what happens.\"",
      "Shortly after the president's comments, a U.S. official confirmed to ABC News 700 Marines from Twentynine Palms, California, had been ordered to assist on the streets of Los Angeles although it was unclear exactly what role they would play.",
      "Newsom said the state is suing the administration over Trump deploying the National Guard.",
      "\"He flamed the fires and illegally acted to federalize the National Guard,\" Newsom wrote on social media. \"The order he signed doesn\u2019t just apply to CA. It will allow him to go into ANY STATE and do the same thing. We\u2019re suing him.\"",

      "Derrick Groves is among 10 inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center on May 16, according to Louisiana State Police. Eight of the inmates have since been captured, but Groves and another inmate -- Antoine Massey -- remain on the run, police said.",
      "Over a dozen people have been arrested on suspicion of helping the escapees, including another inmate in the jail and a jail maintenance worker who is accused of shutting off water to the toilet, allowing escapees to remove it.",
      "Most recently, Darriana Burton, 28, of New Orleans, was arrested on Monday for allegedly helping Groves escape, the Louisiana Attorney General's Office announced.",
      "Burton is a former Orleans Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office correctional employee, according to the office, which described her and Groves as having an on-again, off-again relationship for three years.",
      "She allegedly had an \"active involvement in the planning phase of the escape,\" according to the affidavit for her arrest warrant, including relaying \"escape-related information\" and coordinating communications between Groves and people outside the jail.",
      "Two days before the escape, Groves and Burton had a FaceTime video call via the facility's iPads during which Burton \"was observed holding a secondary device in front of the camera\" that displayed an unknown man in a separate FaceTime call, according to the affidavit.",
      "\"This conversation remained intentionally vague, as Groves, Burton and the unknown male appeared to recognize the call was being recorded,\" the affidavit stated, noting that it was implied that Burton and the unknown man would have a separate, unmonitored call to allegedly discuss details of the escape.\"",
      "Shortly after the initial video call, the three were present on another call during which the unknown man \"advised against the escape, calling it a 'bad move' and warning that it would trigger a 'manhunt,'\" the affidavit stated.",
      "\"This exchange confirmed that Burton had already disclosed the escape plan to the outside contact, actively soliciting his involvement,\" the affidavit stated. \"It further demonstrates her direct role in facilitating communication and supporting the coordination of Groves' escape.",
      "Burton has been transported to the Plaquemines Parish Jail and faces a felony charge of conspiracy to commit simple escape, officials said.",
      "\"We will continue to pursue anyone and everyone who has aided and abetted these criminals. We will find you, arrest you, and prosecute you to the full extent of the law,\" Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement. \"We will arrest all aiders and abettors, and we will eventually get Antoine Massey and Derrick Groves back to prison where they belong.\"",
      "Burton was employed at the Orleans Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office from August 2022 until her termination in March 2023, the Louisiana Attorney General's Office said. She was arrested and charged for allegedly bringing contraband into the jail and \"malfeasance in office,\" though the Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office refused the charges, according to the state attorney general's office.",
      "The reward for the arrest of Groves and Massey increased to $50,000, authorities announced late last month, as police said they believe they are closing in on the \"dangerous\" fugitives.",
      "Groves was convicted last year of two counts of second-degree murder in a 2018 Mardi Gras Day shooting and faces a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, prosecutors said. Unrelated to that case, he also subsequently pleaded guilty to two counts of manslaughter, online court records show.",

      "WASHINGTON -- As the nation's capital cleans up from the culmination of World Pride this past weekend, focus now shifts to a very different massive event \u2014 Saturday's military parade to honor the 250th birthday of the Army and the 79th birthday of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re preparing for an enormous turnout,\u201d said Matt McCool of the Secret Service's Washington Field office, who said more than 18 miles of \u201canti-scale fencing\u201d would be erected and \u201cmultiple drones\u201d would be in the air. The entire District of Columbia is normally a no-fly zone for drones.",
      "Army officials have estimated around 200,000 attendees for the evening military parade, and McCool said he was prepared for \"hundreds of thousands\" of people.",
      "\u201cWe have a ton of magnetometers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a million people show up, then we're going to have some lines.\u201d",
      "A total of 175 magnetometers would be used at security checkpoints controlling access to the daytime birthday festival and the nighttime parade. Metropolitan Police Department chief Pamela Smith predicted \u201cmajor impacts to traffic\u201d and advised attendees to arrive early and consider forgoing cars for the Metro.",
      "\u201cThis is a significant event with a large footprint,\u201d she said. \u201cWe're relying on the public to be an extra set of ears and eyes for us.\u201d",
      "The military parade has been designated a National Special Security Event \u2014 similar to a presidential inauguration or state funeral. That status is reserved for events that draw large crowds and potential mass protests. It calls for an enhanced degree of high-level coordination among D.C. officials, the FBI, Capitol Police and Washington\u2019s National Guard contingent \u2014 with the Secret Service taking the lead.",
      "The Army birthday celebration had already been planned for months. But earlier this spring, Trump announced his intention to transform the event \u2014 which coincides with his 79th birthday \u2014 into a massive military parade complete with 60-ton M1 Abrams battle tanks and Paladin self-propelled howitzers rolling through the city streets.",
      "Multiple counter-protests of varying sizes are planned for Saturday, with the largest being a mass march to the White House dubbed the No Kings rally. Officials say they are also on alert for signs that the immigration-related clashes between law enforcement and protesters currently roiling Los Angeles would spread.",
      "\u201cWe're paying attention, obviously, to what is happening there. We'll be ready,\u201d McCool said. \u201cWe have a robust plan for civil disobedience.\u201d",
      "Agent Phillip Bates of the FBI's Washington Field office, which is tasked with counterterrorism and crisis management, said there were \u201cno credible threats\u201d to the event at the moment.",
      "Lindsey Appiah, the deputy mayor for public safety, told The Associated Press last week that the city had longstanding plans for the Army birthday celebration. But those plans \u201cgot a lot bigger on short notice\u201d when Trump got involved.",
      "Still, Appiah said the city has grown \u201cvery flexible, very nimble\u201d at rolling with these sort of changes.",

      "The escalatory step is prompting a host of legal questions, including how far Trump is willing to go to use his authority to curb protests over his administration's immigration raids.",
      "On Sunday, Trump was asked by ABC News Senior Political Correspondent Rachel Scott if he is prepared to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act. The last time the act was used was in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots.",
      "\"Depends on whether or not there is an insurrection,\" Trump replied.",
      "When asked by Scott if he thought an insurrection was taking place in Los Angeles, Trump replied, \u201cNo, no. But you have violent people, and we are not going to let them get away with it,\" Trump said at the time. But by Sunday night, he was referring to the protesters on his Truth Social platform as \u201cviolent, insurrectionist mobs\u201d and \u201cpaid insurrectionists.\u201d",
      "Asked to define insurrection, Trump said, \"You actually really just have to look at the site to see what's happening.\"",

      "The bar for sending active-duty Marines? \"The bar is what I think is,\" Trump had said on Sunday.",
      "What to know about the Insurrection Act",
      "Generally, the use of federal troops on U.S. soil is mostly prohibited. The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act limits the military from being involved in civilian law enforcement unless Congress approves it or under circumstances \"expressly authorized by the Constitution.\"",
      "One exception is the Insurrection Act, a 218-year-old law signed by President Thomas Jefferson.",
      "The Insurrection Act states, in part: \"Whenever there is an insurrection in any State against its government, the President may, upon the request of its legislature or of its governor if the legislature cannot be convened, call into Federal service such of the militia of the other States, in the number requested by that State, and use such of the armed forces, as he considers necessary to suppress the insurrection.\"",
      "Another provision states it can be used \"whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States in any State by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings.\"",
      "Some legal experts have warned the law is overly broad and vague, and there have been various calls for it to be reformed to provide greater checks on presidential power.",
      "The Insurrection Act has been invoked in response to 30 crises over its history, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, including presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy to desegregate schools after the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education",
      "Most of its uses involved federal troops being deployed, though a few situations were resolved after troops were ordered to respond but before they arrived on the scene, the Brennan Center noted.",
      "When it was last used in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush to send the National Guard to Los Angeles, it was at the request of then-Gov. Pete Wilson as riots exploded in the city after the acquittal of four white police officers charged in the beating of Rodney King.",
      "If Trump were to invoke the act, he would likely be doing so against Newsom's wishes -- something that hasn't been done since President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960s to deal with civil unrest.",
      "How Trump mobilized the National Guard",
      "Trump did not invoke the Insurrection Act when he activated and deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles.",
      "Instead, he cited Title 10 of the U.S. Code -- which contains a provision that allows the president to call on federal service members when there \"is a rebellion or danger of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States\" or when \"the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "According to a presidential memorandum, Trump said he was sending National Guard to \"temporarily protect ICE and other United States Government personnel who are performing Federal functions, including the enforcement of Federal law, and to protect Federal property, at locations where protests against these functions are occurring or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments and planned operations.\"",
      "The memo stated that 2,000 National Guard troops could be deployed for 60 days or \"at the discretion\" of Hegseth.",
      "Troops called up under Title 10 fall generally are prevented from direct involvement in law enforcement duties under the Posse Comitatus Act, unless Trump invokes the Insurrection Act or other limited exceptions apply.",

    "summary": "More than 300 scientists from the NIH signed an open letter on Monday to director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, criticizing the Trump administration over recent moves.",
    "story": [
      "The letter called for staff to be reinstated and funding to be restored.",
      "More than 300 scientists from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) signed an open letter on Monday morning to director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, criticizing the Trump administration over recent moves.",
      "The letter, including 92 signed names and 250 anonymous but verified signatories, shares concerns that research is being politicized, global collaboration is being interrupted and that budget and staff cuts have hindered the ability of NIH to do important research.",
      "\"[W]e dissent to Administration policies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe,\" the letter reads. \"We are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources.\"",
      "Some of the NIH scientists who signed the letter, speaking in their personal capacity and not on behalf of the agency, told ABC News they and their colleagues have tried to raise concerns internally -- and repeatedly -- but to no avail.",
      "They said there is now an urgency to speak up, especially as Bhattacharya is set to testify on Tuesday at a hearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee on the proposed NIH budget for the upcoming fiscal year.",
      "\"There is a lot of risk to speaking up, and I am very scared still, even after it's already done, even after it's already said,\" Jenna Norton, a program officer at the NIH's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and one of the lead organizers of the letter, told ABC News. \"I think a lot of people are focused on the risk of speaking up, but we also need to think about the risk of not speaking up.\"",
      "The letter, called the Bethesda Declaration -- NIH is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland -- is modeled after the Great Barrington Declaration, of which Bhattacharya was a co-author.",
      "Published in October 2020 and named after the Massachusetts town in which it was drafted, the Great Barrington Declaration called for COVID-19 lockdowns to be avoided and a new plan for handling the pandemic by protecting the most vulnerable individuals but allowing most to resume normal activities, achieving herd immunity naturally.",
      "At the time, it was widely criticized by public health professionals, including Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, who said allowing a virus \"we don't fully understand to run free is simply unethical.\" During testimony before Congress in March 2023, Bhattacharya said the declaration was targeted for \"suppression\" by federal health officials.",
      "\"We modeled the Bethesda Declaration after the Great Barrington Declaration \u2026 because we wanted him to see himself in our action,\" Norton said. \"He's spoken a lot about his commitment to academic freedom and to dissent. If Jay Bhattacharya is the person he very publicly claims to be, and if he is actually in charge at NIH, our hope is that this will move him to action. And if he's not the person he says to be or he's not in charge at NIH, I think the public and Congress should be aware of that.\"",
      "The letter called on Bhattacharya to reverse grants that have been delayed or terminated for \"political reasons\" and to allow work with foreign collaborators.",
      "The signatories also asked Bhattacharya to reverse a policy capping indirect costs for research at 15% and to reinstate essential staff who were fired at NIH.",
      "\"The Bethesda Declaration has some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months, including the continuing support of the NIH for international collaboration,\" Bhattacharya said in a statement to ABC News. \"Nevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive. We all want the NIH to succeed.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health & Human Services told ABC News that the agency has not halted \"legitimate\" collaborations with international partners. Additionally, the spokesperson said other funders, like the Gates Foundation, cap indirect costs at 15% and that each case of termination is being reviewed.",
      "Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral researcher at the NIH's National Institute of General Medical Sciences whose work focused on antimicrobial resistance, told ABC News seeing the changes at the agency has been a \"traumatic experience.\"",
      "He said when the Trump administration came into office, he was prevented from doing research in his lab because he couldn't purchase essential items and he was not allowed to attend a conference in February to speak with potential collaborators. He also saw many of his coworkers get accidentally terminated and then reinstated.",
      "\"It's just really traumatic and really disruptive for researchers at the NIH,\" Morgan, who signed the letter, said. \"We get into this not because we're trying to make money, not because of our own benefit. We're getting into this because we want to serve the public. We want to do life-saving research.\"",
      "Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute (NCI) who also signed the letter, said prior to the new administration, she worked with researchers interested either in receiving funds from NCI or who had funds already and were requesting assistance from NCI.",
      "However, with more than 2,100 research grants totaling around $9.5 billion terminated at NIH -- according to the letter -- she said some of her daily tasks have changed.",
      "\"I spend my time on the phone now talking with people who've just learned that their projects have been cut and have been given false, pseudo-scientific reasons to say their work is not valuable, not important for public health for America, and it's just not true,\" Kobrin told ABC News.",
      "The NIH researchers told ABC News there is a public letter that people can sign to express their support or they can contact their congressional representatives to express their concerns.",
      "Morgan, the antimicrobial researcher, said he doesn't want the letter to just be about detailing all the changes that occurred at NIH since Trump took office.",
      "\"It is us standing up and showing that that not everything is lost, and certainly there's been irreparable damage, but we still have time to right the ship and take it in the right direction,\" he said. \"I need to leave people with that message of hope because, otherwise, they can feel there's nothing that they can do, and that we're powerless, but we are all powerful.\"",

    "story": [
      "After a bruising war between Israel and Hezbollah, Lebanon\u2019s new leaders sense an opportunity to revitalize the country\u2019s devastated economy with help from its wealthy Gulf neighbors",
      "BEIRUT -- Fireworks lit up the night sky over Beirut\u2019s famous St. Georges Hotel as hit songs from the 1960s and 70s filled the air in a courtyard overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "The retro-themed event was hosted last month by Lebanon\u2019s Tourism Ministry to promote the upcoming summer season and perhaps recapture some of the good vibes from an era viewed as a golden one for the country. In the years before a civil war began in 1975, Lebanon was the go-to destination for wealthy tourists from neighboring Gulf countries seeking beaches in summer, snow-capped mountains in winter and urban nightlife year-round.",
      "In the decade after the war, tourists from Gulf countries \u2013 and crucially, Saudi Arabia \u2013 came back, and so did Lebanon\u2019s economy. But by the early 2000s, as the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah gained power, Lebanon's relations with Gulf countries began to sour. Tourism gradually dried up, starving its economy of billions of dollars in annual spending.",
      "Now, after last year's bruising war with Israel, Hezbollah is much weaker and Lebanon's new political leaders sense an opportunity to revitalize the economy once again with help from wealthy neighbors. They aim to disarm Hezbollah and rekindle ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, which in recent years have prohibited their citizens from visiting Lebanon or importing its products.",
      "\u201cTourism is a big catalyst, and so it\u2019s very important that the bans get lifted,\u201d said Laura Khazen Lahoud, the country's tourism minister.",
      "On the highway leading to the Beirut airport, once-ubiquitous banners touting Hezbollah\u2019s leadership have been replaced with commercial billboards and posters that read \u201ca new era for Lebanon.\u201d In the center of Beirut, and especially in neighborhoods that hope to attract tourists, political posters are coming down, and police and army patrols are on the rise.",
      "There are signs of thawing relations with some Gulf neighbors. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have lifted yearslong travel bans.",
      "All eyes are now on Saudi Arabia, a regional political and economic powerhouse, to see if it will follow suit, according to Lahoud and other Lebanese officials. A key sticking point is security, these officials say. Although a ceasefire with Israel has been in place since November, near-daily airstrikes have continued in southern and eastern Lebanon, where Hezbollah over the years had built its political base and powerful military arsenal.",
      "As vital as tourism is \u2014 it accounted for almost 20% of Lebanon's economy before it tanked in 2019 \u2014 the country's leaders say it is just one piece of a larger puzzle they are trying to put back together.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s agricultural and industrial sectors are in shambles, suffering a major blow in 2021, when Saudi Arabia banned their exports after accusing Hezbollah of smuggling drugs into Riyadh. Years of economic dysfunction have left the country's once-thriving middle class in a state of desperation.",
      "The World Bank says poverty nearly tripled in Lebanon over the past decade, affecting close to half its population of nearly 6 million. To make matters worse, inflation is soaring, with the Lebanese pound losing 90% of its value, and many families lost their savings when banks collapsed.",
      "Tourism is seen by Lebanon's leaders as the best way to kickstart the reconciliation needed with Gulf countries -- and only then can they move on to exports and other economic growth opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the thing that makes most sense, because that\u2019s all Lebanon can sell now,\u201d said Sami Zoughaib, research manager at The Policy Initiative, a Beirut-based think tank.",
      "With summer still weeks away, flights to Lebanon are already packed with expats and locals from countries that overturned their travel bans, and hotels say bookings have been brisk.",
      "At the event hosted last month by the tourism ministry, the owner of the St. Georges Hotel, Fady El-Khoury, beamed. The hotel, owned by his father in its heyday, has acutely felt Lebanon's ups and downs over the decades, closing and reopening multiple times because of wars. \u201cI have a feeling that the country is coming back after 50 years,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent weekend, as people crammed the beaches of the northern city of Batroun, and jet skis whizzed along the Mediterranean, local business people sounded optimistic that the country was on the right path.",
      "\u201cWe are happy, and everyone here is happy,\u201d said Jad Nasr, co-owner of a private beach club. \u201cAfter years of being boycotted by the Arabs and our brothers in the Gulf, we expect this year for us to always be full.\u201d",
      "Still, tourism is not a panacea for Lebanon's economy, which for decades has suffered from rampant corruption and waste.",
      "Lebanon has been in talks with the International Monetary Fund for years over a recovery plan that would include billions in loans and require the country to combat corruption, restructure its banks, and bring improvements to a range of public services, including electricity and water.",
      "Without those and other reforms, Lebanon's wealthy neighbors will lack confidence to invest there, experts said. A tourism boom alone would serve as a \u201cmorphine shot that would only temporarily ease the pain\" rather than stop the deepening poverty in Lebanon, Zoughaib said.",
      "The tourism minister, Lahoud, agreed, saying a long-term process has only just begun.",
      "\"But we\u2019re talking about subjects we never talked about before,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think the whole country has realized that war doesn\u2019t serve anyone, and that we really need our economy to be back and flourish again.\u201d",

      "LAHAINA, Hawaii -- Fifty trucks will spend five months hauling Lahaina wildfire debris to a landfill in the center of Maui starting next Monday, Maui County said.",
      "There's enough debris to fill five football fields five stories high. About two years ago the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century killed 102 people and turned vast stretches of Lahaina into burned rubble.",
      "The trucks are expected to make multiple trips each day moving the debris from Olowalu, a town south of Lahaina, to the Central Maui Landfill about 19 miles (30 kilometers) away, the county said in a statement.",
      "Part of the route follows a winding, two-land coastal highway. The trucks will travel on former sugar cane plantation roads for portions to limit traffic disruption. For safety reasons, crews will only work during the day.",
      "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers finished clearing Lahaina properties earlier this year but it's had to temporarily store the debris at a former quarry on state-owned land in Olowalu while authorities searched for longer-term solution. In December, the Maui County Council approved acquiring privately owned land next to Maui\u2019s existing landfill for a permanent disposal site.",
      "Handling debris after large wildfires is always a logistical challenge. It took Paradise, California, officials about a year to transport more than 300,000 truck loads of debris to three different landfills after the 2018 Camp Fire killed 85 people and burned most of the town.",
      "Maui County said it evaluated the debris with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Hawaii Department of Health and determined transporting and storing it at the landfill didn't post a public health risk. Workers will lightly wet it before loading it onto trucks to control dust. The debris will be wrapped in thick plastic sheets. In total, it weighs about 400,000 tons (363,00 metric tons).",
      "Some Olowalu residents were worried the debris would stay in their community permanently, potentially desecrating Native Hawaiian shrines, ancient burial sites and offshore coral reefs and marine life.",
      "Most of the steel and concrete left behind by the fire was to be recycled. Much of the debris heading for the landfill is ash and small particles, which state Department of Health tests found had arsenic, lead and other toxins.",

      "A private correctional company says inmates at a Tennessee prison sought to destroy property, compromised security cameras and set a few fires during a riot that took hours to contain and caused minor injuries to three inmates and one guard",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Inmates at a Tennessee prison sought to destroy property, compromised security cameras and set a few fires during a riot that took several hours to contain and caused minor injuries to three inmates and one guard, the facility's private operator said.",
      "On Sunday evening, a large group of inmates at Trousdale Turner Correctional Center from several housing units left their cells and accessed an inner yard, becoming \u201cdisruptive and confrontational\u201d and refusing to follow the staff's directions, according to CoreCivic spokesperson Ryan Gustin. The prison in Hartsville, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Nashville, is the subject of an ongoing U.S. Department of Justice investigation.",
      "One correctional officer was assaulted and released from the hospital. Three inmates were being treated for minor injuries, Gustin said.",
      "The prison's staff used chemical agents on the inmates, who were secured by early Monday morning. They did not reach the perimeter and state troopers and local law enforcement officers were positioned outside the facility. The Tennessee Highway Patrol deployed about 75 troopers and the agency remained on site overnight until \u201cevery prisoner had been accounted for,\u201d Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security spokesperson Jason Pack said.",
      "The prison remained on lockdown while CoreCivic and the Tennessee Department of Correction investigate the riot, Gustin said.",
      "The incident followed an assault by two Trousdale inmates Saturday that injured a correctional officer who remains at the hospital, Gustin said.",
      "Last August, the U.S. Department of Justice announced an investigation into the Trousdale prison after years of \u201creports of physical assaults, sexual assaults, murders and unchecked flow of contraband and severe staffing shortages,\u201d according to then-U.S. Attorney Henry Leventis. The department confirmed Monday the investigation remains ongoing.",
      "Tennessee\u2019s corrections agency has fined CoreCivic $37.7 million across four prisons since 2016, including for understaffing violations. Records obtained by The Associated Press also show the company has spent more than $4.4 million to settle about 80 lawsuits and out-of-court complaints alleging mistreatment \u2014 including at least 22 inmate deaths \u2014 at four Tennessee prisons and two jails since 2016.",
      "The state comptroller released scathing audits in 2017, 2020 and 2023.",
      "The Brentwood, Tennessee-based company has defended itself by pointing to industry-wide problems with hiring and keeping workers. CoreCivic has said it offers hiring incentives and strategically backfills with workers from other facilities nationally.",
      "Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee's administration has stood by CoreCivic.",
      "However, the Republican-led Legislature this year showed its concern by unanimously passing a bill that would move 10% of inmates out of a private prison each time the annual death rate is twice as high as a comparable state-run facility. Lee signed the legislation. Department of Correction spokesperson Sarah Gallagher said the agency is developing a procedure to calculate and report the death rate for 2025 under the new law.",
      "The legislation was spurred by the advocacy of Tim Leeper, a roofing businessman who has attended the same local Rotary Club as the two Republicans who ultimately sponsored the bill, Rep. Clark Boyd and Sen. Mark Pody. Leeper's son Kylan was an inmate at Trousdale when he died of a fentanyl overdose. His family has sued CoreCivic over his death.",

      "The projects are part of a series of personal touches that Trump, a real estate developer turned politician, has added or is adding to the Executive Mansion and its grounds since he opened his second term in January. The projects also include new artwork of himself on walls and gold-toned flourishes in the Oval Office. He also wants to add a ballroom.",

The project is set to be completed in about two months, or the first half of August, said the official, who was not authorized to comment publicly on intended changes to the Executive Mansion and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "After stepping off the helicopter, Trump walked over to a bulldozer that was on the South Lawn to start digging a foundation for one of two flagpoles he promised in April. One flagpole will be added to the South Lawn, and the second will be installed on the North Lawn, he said.",
      "Trump said he was installing two \u201cbeautiful\u201d flagpoles \u201cpaid for by Trump\u201d on the grounds because \u201cthey\u2019ve needed flagpoles for 200 years.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on the two fugitive sons of incarcerated Mexican Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman and announced a reward offer of up to $10 million each for information leading to the arrest or conviction of the men.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions on Archivaldo Ivan Guzman Salazar and Jesus Alfredo Guzman Salazar who are believed to be currently located in Mexico.",
      "Guzman's other sons \u2014 Joaquin Guzman Lopez and Ovidio Guzman Lopez \u2014 are currently incarcerated in the United States. In May, federal prosecutors announced they would not seek the death penalty for Joaquin Guzman Lopez if he\u2019s convicted of multiple charges in Chicago.",
      "Sanctions were also imposed on a faction of the Sinaloa cartel known as the \u201cChapitos,\u201d or little Chapos, which has been identified as a main exporter of fentanyl to the U.S. as well as a regional network of Chapitos associates and businesses based in Mazatlan, Mexico, that allegedly engage in drug trafficking, extortion and money laundering.",
      "According to federal prosecutors, El Chapo smuggled mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the United States over 25 years. He was convicted in 2019 on multiple conspiracy counts and sentenced to life in a U.S. prison.",
      "\u201cAt the Department of the Treasury, we are executing on President Trump\u2019s mandate to completely eliminate drug cartels and take on violent leaders like \u2018El Chapo\u2019s\u2019 children,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.",
      "The Sinaloa Cartel, through various incarnations, is Mexico\u2019s oldest criminal group, dating to the 1970s. One of their most lucrative businesses in recent years has been the production of the synthetic opioid fentanyl, blamed for tens of thousands of overdose deaths each year in the U.S. The Trump administration in February labeled the Sinaloa cartel a foreign terrorist organizations.",

      "Oklahoma prosecutors say they will retry longtime death row inmate Richard Glossip a third time for his role in the 1997 killing of his former boss",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- Oklahoma prosecutors will retry longtime death row inmate Richard Glossip a third time for his role in the 1997 killing of his former boss, Attorney General Gentner Drummond said Monday.",
      "The decision comes after the U.S. Supreme Court in February tossed Glossip\u2019s conviction and death sentence. The court determined the original prosecutors in the case allowed a key witness to give testimony they knew to be false, violating Glossip\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial.",
      "Glossip, who had long maintained his innocence, was twice convicted and sentenced to death for the killing of Oklahoma City motel owner Barry Van Treese in what prosecutors alleged was a murder-for-hire killing. Another man, Justin Sneed, admitted robbing Van Treese and beating him to death with a baseball bat, but testified that he did so after Glossip promised to pay him $10,000. Sneed was the state\u2019s key witness against Glossip and was sentenced to life in prison.",
      "After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Drummond, acknowledged retrying the case more than 25 years later would be difficult. Drummond had taken the unusual step of asking the court to overturn Glossip\u2019s conviction, arguing that while he believed Glossip had a role in the killing, he did not believe he had received a fair trial.",
      "\u201cI do not believe Richard Glossip is innocent,\u201d Drummond said after the high court\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe mission of this office is to seek justice, not to defend the prosecution.\u201d",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote for five of the high court's justices, said additional prosecutorial misconduct, including interfering with Sneed\u2019s testimony, destroying evidence and withholding witness statements, further undermined confidence in the verdict.",
      "During his time on death row, courts in Oklahoma set nine different execution dates for Glossip, and he came so close to being put to death that he had three separate last meals. In 2015, he was being held in a cell next to Oklahoma\u2019s execution chamber, waiting to be strapped to a gurney and injected with drugs that would kill him.",
      "But the scheduled time for his execution came and went. And behind the walls of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, prison officials were scrambling after learning one of the lethal drugs they received to carry out the procedure didn\u2019t match the execution protocols. The drug mix-up ultimately led to a nearly seven-year moratorium on executions in Oklahoma.",

      "Sixteen states have sued the Trump administration over its plan to allow the sale of forced-reset triggers and return seized devices",
      "Sixteen states have sued the Trump administration over its plan to allow the sale of forced-reset triggers that make semiautomatic rifles fire more rapidly and return devices already seized to their owners.",
      "The suit announced Monday argues that returning the triggers would violate federal law, pose a threat to residents and law enforcement and worsen gun violence. It was filed in federal court in Maryland.",
      "There had been several legal battles over the devices, which replace the typical trigger on an AR-15-style rifle. The Biden administration had previously argued the triggers qualify as machine guns under federal law because constant finger pressure on the triggers will keep a rifle firing, essentially creating an illegal machine gun.",
      "Rare Breed Triggers, the maker of the devices, had argued that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was wrong in its classification and ignored demands to stop selling the triggers before being sued by the Biden administration.",
      "The Justice Department reached a deal announced last month to allow the sale of forced-reset triggers with Rare Breed Triggers, which was previously represented by David Warrington, Trump\u2019s current White House counsel.",
      "Under the settlement, Rare Breed Triggers agreed not to develop such devices to be used on handguns, according to the Justice Department. The settlement requires the ATF to return triggers that it had seized or that owners had voluntarily surrendered to the government.",
      "The states' lawsuit is being led by the attorneys general of Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey. Other states involved are Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, along with the District of Columbia.",

      "If President Donald Trump's budget proposal wins final congressional approval, funding will be slashed for tribal colleges and universities",
      "In President Donald Trump's budget request, he's proposing slashing funding for tribal colleges and universities, including eliminating support for the country's only federally funded college for contemporary Native American arts.",
      "If the budget is approved by Congress, beginning in October, the more than $13 million in annual appropriations for the Institute for American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico, would be reduced to zero. It would be the first time in nearly 40 years that the congressionally chartered school would not receive federal support, said Robert Martin, the school's president.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t wipe out 63 years of our history and what we\u2019ve accomplished with one budget,\u201d Martin said on Friday. \u201cI just can\u2019t understand or comprehend why they would do something like this.\u201d",
      "The college, founded in 1962, has provided affordable education to thousands of Native artists and culture bearers, including U.S. poet laureate Joy Harjo, painter T.C. Cannon and bestselling novelist Tommy Orange. It's the only four-year degree fine arts institution in the world devoted to contemporary Native American and Alaskan Native arts, according to its website.",
      "Martin said he has spoken with members of Congress from both major political parties who have assured him they'll work to keep the institute's budget level for the next fiscal year, but he worries the morale of students and staff will be affected. Martin said he also spoke with staff in the office of U.S. Rep. Tom Cole, a member of the Chickasaw Nation and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. Cole, a Republican and former member of IAIA's board of trustees and a longtime advocate in Congress for funding that supports tribal citizens, was unavailable for comment.",
      "Breana Brave Heart, a junior studying arts and business, said the proposal shocked her and made her wonder: \u201cWill I be able to continue my education at IAIA with these budget cuts?\u201d Brave Heart said she started organizing with other students to contact members of Congress. \u201cIAIA is under attack,\" she said, \"and I need other students to know this.\u201d",
      "Martin said that amid the Republican Trump administration's crackdown on federal policies and funding that support diversity, equity and inclusion, trust responsibilities and treaty rights owed to tribal nations have also come under attack.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a problem for us and many other organizations when you\u2019ve got that DEI initiative which really is not applicable to us, because we\u2019re not a racial category, we\u2019re a political status as a result of the treaties,\" he said. \u201cWe\u2019re easily identified as what this administration might refer to as a \u2018woke\u2019.\u201d",
      "Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico said the cuts are another example of the Trump administration \u201cturning its back on Native communities and breaking our trust responsibilities.\u201d",
      "\"As a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, I remain committed to keeping IAIA fully funded and will continue working with appropriators and the New Mexico Congressional Delegation to ensure its future,\u201d Luj\u00e1n said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The congressional budget bill includes roughly $3.75 trillion in tax cuts, extending the expiring 2017 individual income tax breaks and temporarily adding new ones that Trump campaigned on. The revenue loss would be partially offset by nearly $1.3 trillion in reduced federal spending elsewhere, namely through Medicaid and food assistance.",
      "A Jan. 30 order from the Interior Department titled \u201cEnding DEI Programs and Gender Ideology Extremism\u201d stated that any efforts to eradicate diversity, equity and inclusion in the department\u2019s policy should exclude trust obligations to tribal nations.",
      "However, earlier this year, several staff members at the other two congressionally chartered schools in the country \u2014 the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Haskell Indian Nations University in Kansas \u2014 were laid off as part of Trump's push to downsize the federal workforce. In a lawsuit filed in March, both institutions reported that some staff and faculty were rehired, but the Bureau of Indian Education notified those people that might be temporary and they may be laid off again.",
      "\u201cIt shows what a president\u2019s values and priorities are, and that\u2019s been hard,\u201d said Ahniwake Rose, president of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, an organization that represents more than 30 Tribal Colleges and Universities. \"That\u2019s been hard for our staff, our students, our faculty to see that the priority of the administration through the Department of Interior might not be on tribal colleges.\"",
      "In its budget request this year, the Interior Department is proposing reducing funding to the BIE's post secondary programs by more than 80%, and that would have a devastating affect on tribal colleges and universities, or TCUs, which rely on the federal government for most of their funding, said Rose. Most TCUs offer tribal citizens a tuition-free higher education, she said, and funding them is a moral and fiduciary responsibility the federal government owes tribal nations.",
      "In the many treaties the U.S. signed with tribal nations, it outlined several rights owed to them \u2014 like land rights, health care and education through departments established later, like the BIE. Trust responsibilities are the legal and moral obligations the U.S. has to protect and uphold those rights.",
      "The Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "The proposed resolutions call for laws on gender, marriage and family based on what they say is the biblically stated order of divine creation. They also call for legislators to curtail sports betting and to support policies that promote childbearing.",
      "The Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's largest Protestant denomination, is also expected to debate controversies within its own house during its annual meeting Tuesday and Wednesday \u2014 such as a proposed ban on churches with women pastors. There are also calls to defund the organization\u2019s public policy arm, whose anti-abortion stance hasn\u2019t extended to supporting criminal charges for women having abortions.",

      "Southern Baptists will be meeting on the 40th anniversary of another Dallas annual meeting. An epic showdown took place when a record-shattering 45,000 church representatives clashed in what became a decisive blow in the takeover of the convention \u2014 and its seminaries and other agencies \u2014 by a more conservative faction that was also aligned with the growing Christian conservative movement in presidential politics.",
      "The 1985 showdown was \u201cthe hinge convention in terms of the old and the new in the SBC,\u201d said Albert Mohler, who became a key agent in the denomination's rightward shift as longtime president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky.",
      "Attendance this week will likely be a fraction of 1985's, but that meeting's influence will be evident. Any debates will be among solidly conservative members.",
      "Many of the proposed resolutions \u2014 on gambling, pornography, sex, gender and marriage \u2014 reflect long-standing positions of the convention, though they are especially pointed in their demands on the wider political world. They are proposed by the official Committee on Resolutions, whose recommendations typically get strong support.",

      "Separate resolutions decry pornography and sports betting as destructive, calling for the former to be banned and the latter curtailed.",
      "At least some of these political stances are in the realm of plausibility at a time when their conservative allies control all levers of power in Washington and many have embraced aspects of a Christian nationalist agenda.",
      "A Southern Baptist, Mike Johnson, is speaker of the House of Representatives and third in line to the presidency.",
      "At least one Supreme Court justice, Clarence Thomas, has called for revisiting the 2015 Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide.

Ten former Southern Baptist presidents endorsed its continued funding, though one other called for the opposite.",

      "A group of Southern Baptist ethnic groups and leaders signed a statement in April citing concern over Trump's immigration crackdown, saying it has hurt church attendance and raised fears. \u201cLaw and order are necessary, but enforcement must be accompanied with compassion that doesn\u2019t demonize those fleeing oppression, violence, and persecution,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The Center for Baptist Leadership, however, denounced the denominational Baptist Press for working to \u201cweaponize empathy\u201d in its reporting on the statement and Leatherwood for supporting it.",
      "Texas pastor Dwight McKissic, a Black pastor who shares many of the Southern Baptist Convention's conservative stances, criticized what he sees as a backlash against the commission, \u201cthe most racially progressive entity in the SBC.\u201d",

      "The denomination\u2019s belief statement says the office of pastor is limited to men, but there remain disagreements over whether this applies only to the lead pastor or to assistants as well. In recent years, the convention began purging churches that either had women as lead pastors or asserted that they could serve that role. But when an SBC committee this year retained a South Carolina megachurch with a woman on its pastoral staff, some argued this proved the need for a constitutional amendment. (The church later quit the denomination of its own accord.)",
      "The meeting comes as the Southern Baptist Convention continues its long membership slide, down 2% in 2024 from the previous year in its 18th consecutive annual decline. The organization now reports a membership of 12.7 million members, still the largest among Protestant denominations, many of whom are shrinking faster.",

      "Republican senators are airing concerns about different parts of the legislation, including cuts to Medicaid, changes to food aid and the impact on the deficit. To push the bill to passage, Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota and other negotiators will need to find a compromise that satisfies both ends of their conference \u2014 and that can still satisfy the House, which passed the bill last month by only one vote.",
      "A look at some of the groups and senators who leaders will have to convince as they work to push Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d bill toward a Senate vote:",
      "Every Republican senator represents a state with a rural constituency \u2014 and some of their states are among the most rural in the country. Many in those less-populated areas rely heavily on Medicaid for health care, leading several of them to warn that the changes to the program in the bill could be devastating to communities that are already struggling.",
      "Of particular concern is a freeze on a so-called provider tax that some states use to help pay for large portions of their Medicaid programs. The extra tax often leads to higher payments from the federal government, which critics say is a loophole that allows states to inflate their budgets. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and several others have argued that freezing that tax revenue would hurt rural hospitals, in particular.",
      "\u201cHospitals will close,\u201d Hawley said last month. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple. And that pattern will replicate in states across the country.\u201d",
      "Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville said Thursday that provider taxes in his state are \u201cthe money we use for Medicaid.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou start cutting that out, we\u2019ve got big problems,\u201d Tuberville said. Eliminating those taxes \u201cmight lose some folks.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Republican senators have little interest in a House-passed provision that spends more money by raising a cap on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT. The higher cap traditionally benefits more urban areas in states with high taxes, such as New York and California.",
      "The House included the new cap after New York Republicans threatened to oppose the bill, but Senate Republicans uniformly dislike it. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to have to be some adjustment\u201d on the SALT provision, Thune said Wednesday, noting that \u201csenators are just in a very different place\u201d from the House.",
      "The House-passed bill would also shift some Medicaid and food stamp costs to states, a change that has the former governors in the Senate, in particular, worried.",
      "West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice, who was governor of his state for eight years before his election to the Senate last year, said he favors many aspects of the bill. He supports the new work requirements for Medicaid and food stamp recipients, the restrictions on benefits for immigrants who are in the country illegally and the efforts to cut down on fraud. \u201cThere\u2019s real savings there,\u201d Justice said. \u201cBut then we ought to stop.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re on our way to cannibalizing ourselves,\u201d Justice said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to hurt kids and hurt our families.\u201d",
      "The provisions stirring the most unease would require states to pay a higher share of the cost for food stamps \u2014 known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. States would pay at least 5% of the cost of the benefits, with states that have high error rates in the program paying even more. The House bill would also shift additional administrative costs for the program to states.",
      "North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, also a former governor, said senators are working to get feedback from current governors and may propose some \u201cincentive-oriented ideas\u201d instead of a penalty for the high error rates.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the states have really looked at the impacts of some of this yet,\u201d Hoeven said.",
      "Tuberville, who is running for governor of Alabama next year, said the program should be reformed instead of shifting costs.",
      "\u201cI know what our budget is and what we can afford, and we can\u2019t start a federal program and then say, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s, let\u2019s send it back to the states and let them take a big hunk of it,\u2019\u201d Tuberville said. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s not the way we do it.\u201d",
      "Thune needs to bring Republican moderates on board with the bill, including Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Both have reservations with the Medicaid cuts, among other things.",
      "Collins said she wants to review how the SNAP changes will affect her state. Murkowski has questioned expiring subsidies for the Affordable Care Act and whether they might be needed if people are kicked off Medicaid.",
      "Last month, Murkowski said she wants to make sure that people are not negatively impacted by the bill, \u201cso we\u2019re looking at it through that lens for both Medicaid and on energy.\u201d",
      "Murkowski and Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas have also supported energy tax credits that would be phased out quickly under the House bill. The four senators argued that the quick repeal creates uncertainty for businesses and could raise prices for consumers.",
      "Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Lee of Utah and Rick Scott of Florida have argued the legislation does not save enough money and threatened to vote against it.",
      "Paul is considered the least likely to support the measure. He says he won\u2019t vote for it if it raises the debt ceiling \u2014 a key priority for GOP leaders in both the House and the Senate. The package would raise the nation\u2019s debt limit by $4 trillion to allow more borrowing to pay the nation's bills, as the Treasury Department says the limit needs to be raised by the middle of July.",
      "Johnson has been railing against the legislation since it was unveiled in the House, arguing that it does little to reduce government spending over time. He took those arguments to Trump last week at a meeting between the president and members of the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "After the meeting, Johnson said he would continue to argue that the bill needs to do more to cut costs. But he said he came away with the recognition that he needed to be \u201cmore positive\u201d as Trump exerts political pressure on Republicans to pass it.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a long ways from making the deficit curve bend down, but I recognize that\u2019s going to take time,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe truth is, there are a lot of good things in this bill that I absolutely support. I want it to succeed.\u201d",

      "Who\u2019s there? It\u2019s Anthony Weiner. And he wants your vote.",
      "Yes, that Weiner: The guy whose once-promising political career was derailed by sexting scandals and then seemingly ended forever when he was imprisoned for sending sexually explicit messages to a 15-year-old girl.",
      "But now Weiner's hoping to convince enough voters in lower Manhattan that he deserves yet another chance in a comeback bid for a seat on the New York City Council.",
      "On a recent weekday at an apartment complex in the Lower East Side, the former congressman, 60, was knocking on doors, reintroducing himself to voters and reminding them about the election. And, on this Thursday at least, the would-be constituents aren\u2019t slamming their doors in the registered sex offender\u2019s face.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Anthony Weiner!\u201d the candidate said after knocking on a door.",
      "A man opens the door, his face lighting up with surprise.",
      "\u201cIt is Anthony Weiner!\u201d the man said, a big smile spreading across his face.",
      "After some pleasantries and a reminder about the race, the man had an important question for the candidate: \u201cMind if I get a picture with you?\u201d",
      "And so it went as Weiner walked down floor after floor, knocking on doors. A quick hello here, a fast thank you there. Campaign literature flowed into hands. People seemed happy to see him.",
      "It isn\u2019t always this friendly. Weiner said he still struggles with how to speak about his scandal, calling it the \u201cfundamental, unsolvable problem of the campaign.\u201d",
      "\u201cSometimes it\u2019s with like real painful, kind of, honesty about what happened and sometimes it\u2019s a little bit defensive, and sometimes, like, a woman at this street fair last week, she\u2019s like, \u2018I love you and I\u2019m going to vote for you, but I voted for you before and how can I ever trust you?\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "But, he notes, some people would rather talk about anything else.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to hear about that. I want to hear about me and I want to hear about how come there aren\u2019t cops on the street and I want to hear about why my taxes are so high,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Weiner, a brash and ambitious politician whose New York accent and wily, kinetic style made for solid theater on the House floor, was once someone worth watching in the Democratic Party. Back then, he represented a district in parts of Brooklyn and Queens.",
      "His latest return to the political stage \u2014 this time for a City Council seat that covers Union Square and the East Village \u2014 pits him against state lawmaker Harvey Epstein, whose name's unfortunate proximity to convicted sex offenders Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein inspired a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d bit, along with a handful of other low-key candidates.",
      "The primary, on June 24, is considered the defining contest of the election, given the district's heavy Democratic bent. It's hard to know how it'll turn out in a low-turnout, early-summer primary where there's no deep political polling.",
      "The comeback attempt comes more than a decade after his career imploded for sending a lewd picture of himself to a college student over Twitter in 2011.",
      "He first tried to claim his account was hacked but eventually admitted to having inappropriate online interactions with at least six other women and resigned from Congress after serving there for more than a decade.",
      "After leaving Washington, Weiner mounted a campaign for New York City mayor but was again undone after it was disclosed that he sent explicit photos under the alias \u201cCarlos Danger\u201d to at least one woman after leaving the House. The revelation tanked his mayoral bid.",
      "Along the way, his marriage collapsed.",
      "In 2017, his scandal entered the criminal realm after prosecutors said he had illicit online contact with a high school student. During the proceedings, Weiner\u2019s lawyer said he probably exchanged thousands of messages with hundreds of women over the years and had been communicating with up to 19 women when he encountered the student.",
      "He eventually pleaded guilty to transferring obscene material to a minor and was sentenced to 21 months in prison. He was required to register as a sex offender after his release in 2019.",
      "Since then, he's worked as the CEO of a countertop company in Brooklyn and hosted a radio show where he would muse about politics, eventually finding himself ginning up his own ideas and wondering: Why not get back in the game? He opened a campaign account and donations started flowing in. He'd go out on the street and people wanted to sign his petitions.",
      "\u201cI knew I had things I wanted to say and I knew that I thought it was important that everyone try to do something at this point,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, his scandals are so much an elephant in the room that his campaign recently started circulating a mailer that, on one side, features a massive elephant alongside the text \u201cAnthony Weiner knows you may have questions.\u201d On the other side, a note from Weiner reads: \u201cSince I am asking you for your vote again, I want to address the elephant in the room.\u201d",
      "It goes on: \u201cI accepted responsibility, I did my time (literally) and paid my debt to society in full.\"",
      "A man who answered one of Weiner\u2019s door knocks told the candidate that he saw the mailer and said it was a smart move to address the scandals head-on.",
      "The two then dove into political issues, chatting about crime, the subway and homeless people. As the conversation was coming in for a landing, the man told Weiner that showing up at his door to speak with him showed that he cared. He declined to give his name to an Associated Press reporter who approached him after Weiner had said goodbye and taken off down a flight of stairs.",
      "After a few more meet-and-greets, Weiner wrapped up for the day. He left he complex, hopped on a bicycle and zipped off down the street.",

    "story": [
      "The FBI under the leadership of Director Kash Patel has made fighting violent crime and illegal immigration top priorities",
      "WASHINGTON -- FOR MOVEMENT AT 12:01 A.M. ON MONDAY JUNE 9TH",
      "When the FBI arrested an accused leader of the MS-13 gang, Kash Patel was there to announce the case, trumpeting it as a step toward returning \"our communities to safety.\u201d",
      "Weeks later, when the Justice Department announced the seizure of $510 million in illegal narcotics bound for the U.S, the FBI director joined other law enforcement leaders in front of a Coast Guard ship in Florida and stacks of intercepted drugs to highlight the haul.",
      "His presence was meant to signal the premium the FBI is placing on combating violent crime, drug trafficking and illegal immigration, concerns that have leapfrogged up the agenda in what current and former law enforcement officials say amounts to a rethinking of priorities and mission at a time when the country is also confronting increasingly sophisticated national security threats from abroad.",
      "A revised FBI priority list on its website places \u201cCrush Violent Crime\u201d at the top, bringing the bureau into alignment with the vision of President Donald Trump, who has made a crackdown on illegal immigration, cartels and transnational gangs a cornerstone of his administration. Patel has said he wants to \u201cget back to the basics.\u201d His deputy, Dan Bongino, says the FBI is returning to \u201cits roots.\u201d",
      "Patel says the FBI remains focused on some of the same concerns, including China, that have dominated headlines in recent years, and the bureau said in a statement that its commitment to investigating international and domestic terrorism has not changed. That intensifying threat was laid bare over the past month by a spate of violent acts, most recently a Molotov cocktail attack on a Colorado crowd by an Egyptian man who authorities say overstayed his visa and yelled \u201cFree Palestine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe FBI continuously analyzes the threat landscape and allocates resources and personnel in alignment with that analysis and the investigative needs of the Bureau,\u201d the FBI said in a statement. \u201cWe make adjustments and changes based on many factors and remain flexible as various needs arise.\u201d",
      "Signs of restructuring abound. The Justice Department has disbanded an FBI-led task force on foreign influence and the bureau has moved to dissolve a key public corruption squad in its Washington field office, people familiar with the matter have told The Associated Press. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has proposed steep budget cuts for the FBI, and there\u2019s been significant turnover in leadership ranks as some veteran agents with years of experience have been pushed from their positions.",
      "Some former officials are concerned the stepped-up focus on violent crime and immigration \u2014 areas already core to the mission of agencies including the Drug Enforcement Administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 risks deflecting attention from some of the complicated criminal and national security threats for which the bureau has long borne primary if not exclusive responsibility for investigating.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re looking down five feet in front of you, looking for gang members and I would say lower-level criminals, you\u2019re going to miss some of the more sophisticated strategic issues that may be already present or emerging,\u201d said Chris Piehota, who retired from the FBI in 2020 as an executive assistant director.",
      "Enforcement of immigration laws has long been the principal jurisdiction of immigration agents tasked with arresting people in the U.S. illegally along with border agents who police points of entry.",
      "Since Trump's inauguration, the FBI has assumed greater responsibility for that work, saying it's made over 10,000 immigration-related arrests. Patel has highlighted the arrests on social media, doubling down on the administration's promise to prioritize immigration enforcement.",
      "Agents have been dispatched to visit migrant children who crossed the U.S-Mexico border without parents in what officials say is an effort to ensure their safety. Field offices have been directed to commit manpower to immigration enforcement.",
      "The Justice Department has instructed the FBI to review files for information about those illegally in the U.S. and provide it to the Department of Homeland Security unless doing so would compromise an investigation. And photos on the FBI\u2019s Instagram account depict agents with covered faces and tactical gear alongside detained subjects, with a caption saying the FBI is \u201cramping up\u201d efforts with immigration agents to locate \u201cdangerous criminals.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re giving you about five minutes to cooperate,\u201d Bongino said on Fox News about illegal immigrants. \u201cIf you\u2019re here illegally, five minutes, you\u2019re out.\u201d",
      "That's a rhetorical shift from prior leadership. Though Patel\u2019s direct predecessor, Christopher Wray, warned about the flow of fentanyl through the southern border and the possibility migrants determined to commit terrorism could illegally cross through, he did not characterize immigration enforcement as core to the FBI's mission.",
      "There's precedent for the FBI to rearrange priorities to meet evolving threats, though for the past two decades countering terrorism has remained a constant atop the agenda.",
      "Then-Director Robert Mueller transformed the FBI after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks into a national security, intelligence-gathering agency. Agents were reassigned from investigations into drugs, violent crime and white-collar fraud to fight terrorism. In a top 10 priority list from 2002, protecting the U.S. from terrorism was first. Fighting violent crime was near the bottom, above only supporting law enforcement partners and technology upgrades.",
      "The FBI\u2019s new list of priorities places \u201cCrush Violent Crime\u201d as a top pillar alongside \u201cDefend the Homeland,\" though FBI leaders have also sought to stress that counterterrorism remains the bureau's principal mandate.",
      "Wray often said he was hard-pressed to think of a time when the FBI was facing so many elevated threats at once. At the time of his departure last January, the FBI was grappling with elevated terrorism concerns; Iranian assassination plots on U.S. soil; Chinese spying and hacking of Americans' cell phones; ransomware attacks against hospitals; and Russian influence operations aimed at sowing disinformation.",
      "Testifying before lawmakers last month, Patel took care to note the surge in terrorism threats following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas and a Chinese espionage threat he said had yielded investigations in each of the bureau\u2019s offices. But the accomplishments he dwelled on first concerned efforts to \u201ctake dangerous criminals off our streets,\u201d including the arrests of three suspects on the \u201cTen Most Wanted\u201d list, and large drug seizures.",
      "Rounding out the priority list are two newcomers: \u201cRebuild Public Trust\u201d and \u201cFierce Organizational Accountability.\u201d",
      "Those reflect claims amplified by Patel and Bongino that the bureau had become politicized through its years of investigations of Trump, whose Mar-a-Lago home was searched by agents for classified documents in 2022. Close allies of Trump, both men have committed to disclose files from past investigations, including into Russian election interference and the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, that have fueled grievances against the bureau.",
      "They've also pledged to examine matters that have captivated attention in conservative circles, like the leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion that overturned Roe v. Wade. Employees have spent hours poring over documents from the sex trafficking case against financier Jeffrey Epstein, a favorite subject of conspiracy theorists, to prepare them for release.",
      "Patel had forecast his interest in rejiggering priorities long before becoming director, including by saying that if he ran the bureau, he would \u201clet good cops be good cops\u201d and push agents into the field. A critic as a House Republican staffer of the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation, which he calls an example of politicized law enforcement, he had said that he would support breaking off the FBI's \u201cintel shops\u201d to focus on crime-fighting.",
      "James Gagliano, a retired FBI supervisor, said he would like to see more specific information about the new priorities but was heartened by an enhanced violent crime focus so long as other initiatives weren\u2019t abandoned.",
      "\u201cMission priorities change,\u201d Gagliano said. \u201cThe threat matrix changes. You\u2019ve got to constantly get out in front of that.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has touted several terrorism successes, including the arrests of a suspected participant in a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport that killed 13 American servicemembers and of an ex-Michigan National Guard member on charges of plotting a military base attack on behalf of the Islamic State.",
      "But the administration is also employing a broad definition of what it believes constitutes terrorism.",
      "FBI and Justice Department officials see the fight against transnational gangs as part of their counterterrorism mandate, taking advantage of the Trump administration\u2019s designation of the violent street gangs MS-13 and Tren de Aragua as foreign terrorist organizations to bring terrorism-related charges against defendants, including a Venezuelan man suspected of being a high-ranking TdA member and a Utah father-son suspected of providing material support to a Mexican cartel \u2014 a charge typically used for cases involving groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaida.",
      "A former Justice Department terrorism prosecutor, Patel has called the FBI\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Forces \u2014 interagency units in the bureau\u2019s 55 field offices \u2014 as \u201cshining examples\u201d of its mission. Those task forces spent years pursuing suspects in the Capitol riot but have now been enlisted to track down cartel members, he has said.",
      "After an Egyptian man whose work authorization in the U.S. had expired was arrested on charges of using a homemade flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to attack a group drawing attention to Israeli hostages in Gaza, administration officials held up the case as proof of their philosophy that immigration enforcement is tantamount to protecting national security.",
      "The FBI says its domestic terrorism investigations continue uninterrupted, though Patel at times has discussed the threat in different terms than Wray, who led the bureau as it investigated the Capitol riot and who cited it as evidence of the dangers of homegrown extremists. At hearings last month, Patel pointed to a string of arsons and vandalism acts at Tesla dealerships as domestic terrorism acts that commanded the FBI's resources and attention.",
      "As it reconfigures its resources, the FBI has moved to reassign some agents focused on domestic terrorism to a new task force set up to investigate the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and its aftermath, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel moves.",
      "One national security concern Patel has preached continuity on in public is the threat from China, which he said in a recent Fox News interview keeps him up at night. Wray often called China the gravest long-term threat to national security, and when he stepped aside in January the FBI was contending with an espionage operation that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.",
      "There are signs of a broader national security realignment.",
      "A task force tracking foreign influence, like Russia\u2019s attempts to interfere in American democracy, was disbanded and the Justice Department has scaled back criminal enforcement of a statute requiring registration of U.S. lobbying on behalf of foreign entities.",
      "All of that concerns retired FBI supervisor Frank Montoya, a longtime counterintelligence official who says fentanyl and drug cartels are not \u201cexistential\u201d threats in the same way Russia and China are. When it comes to complicated, interagency espionage work, the FBI, he said, has always \u201cbeen the glue that made it all work.\u201d",
      "Patel makes no apologies for priorities he says come from the White House.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has set some priorities out in a new focus for federal law enforcement,\u201d he has said. \u201cThe FBI has heard those directions, and we are determined to deliver on our crime-fighting and national security mission with renewed vigor.\u201d",

      "Multiple internal investigations by the New Orleans Police Department found that the lethal shooting of the 18-week-old, 22-pound (10-kilogram) rescue dog Apollo violated department policies and was \u201cunjustified.\u201d But after Apollo\u2019s owners sued Burmaster and the city of New Orleans in 2022, department leadership in July 2023 cleared him of wrongdoing for his use of force during the final step in the review.",
      "New Orleans Independent Police Monitor Stella Cziment, whose office has closely followed the case, said that she saw no reason \u2014 save the civil lawsuit \u2014 for the department\u2019s reversal.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see how it aligns with policy; I don\u2019t understand how he was exonerated and I disagree with that finding,\u201d Cziment said.",
      "Longstanding federal oversight of the city's police department put in place after a decades-long history of misconduct and culture of impunity is in the process of winding down. Department leaders have sought to reassure the public that they have built a system of transparency and accountability.",
      "The dog's owners, Derek Brown and Julia Barecki-Brown, say Burmaster violated their constitutional rights by shooting Apollo on their property \u201cin the absence of an objectively legitimate and imminent threat.\" They are seeking damages for emotional distress after they held Apollo in their arms as he died. They declined to comment via their attorney.",
      "Burmaster and the New Orleans Police Department declined to comment, citing pending litigation. In court filings, Burmaster\u2019s attorneys argue he was acting within the scope of his duty as a police officer when he fired the gun.",
      "On the evening of April 10, 2021, Burmaster and his partner responded to a nighttime call that a woman had been screaming inside a home in the city's Lower Garden District.",
      "Body camera footage reviewed by The Associated Press, police investigation records and court documents detail what happened next.",
      "Burmaster approached the gated yard making what he described as \u201ckissing noises\u201d to assess whether any dogs were present and said aloud there were none.",
      "Soon after the officers entered through the gate, two dogs \u2014 Apollo and another larger dog owned by the family \u2014 came running while barking. The larger dog approached Burmaster's partner, who exited back through the gate. Apollo moved toward Burmaster, who covered his crotch with one hand and fired three shots with the other.",
      "The owners of the dogs then ran out from the home, screaming at the officers.",
      "\u201cOh my god, what did you do, what did you do,\u201d Barecki-Brown shouted. \u201cNo! No! No!\u201d",
      "\u201cThat's a baby, that's a puppy,\u201d she continued, sobbing hysterically.",
      "Burmaster identified himself as a police officer, apologized repeatedly, and asked them why they let the dogs out.",
      "\u201cI made kissy noises \u2014 to get, if there was a dog behind this fence,\u201d Burmaster said.",
      "\u201cHow could you shoot a puppy?\u201d Barecki-Brown responded. \u201cThis is the love of our lives.\u201d",
      "Burmaster repeatedly told investigators he fired his gun because he was afraid Apollo would bite him in the genitals. In 2012, Burmaster also fatally shot another dog while grabbing his crotch for protection, police records show. There have been 11 fatal shootings of animals between 2012 and 2022 by New Orleans police officers, according to police records shared in court filings.",
      "During a hearing held by the department's Use of Force Review Board \u2014 which unanimously ruled Burmaster was not justified in firing his weapon \u2014 Deputy Superintendent Christopher Goodly stated \u201cthe smaller dog posed no threat.\u201d",
      "Investigators noted Burmaster did not consider non-lethal options such as kicking the dog or using his Taser. In violation of department policy, he was not carrying his baton or wearing his body armor.",
      "Sgt. David Duplantier of the department's training academy later testified that he felt Burmaster had acted properly under difficult circumstances, court records show.",
      "Burmaster\u2019s partner was sent to the hospital to treat a minor wound caused by the firing of Burmaster\u2019s gun.",
      "Burmaster trained other field officers in the department at the time. In the five years leading up to the incident, he used force 11 times and all instances were found to be justified by the department, according to court records.",
      "Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick acknowledged in a deposition that she signed off on the decision to exonerate Burmaster without reviewing the bodycam footage. The officer received an \u201coral reprimand\u201d for not being properly equipped.",
      "Apollo was a Catahoula, a medium-sized breed known for hunting and tracking prowess and is Louisiana's state dog. The United Kennel Club, a global dog registry, describes Catahoulas as \u201caffectionate, gentle and loyal family companions.\u201d",

      "The U.N. Ocean Conference is opening in France as pressure mounts to turn promises into action on protecting the ocean",
      "NICE, France -- The third United Nations Ocean Conference opens Monday as pressure mounts for nations to turn decades of promises into real protection for the sea.",
      "The summit comes as just 2.7% of the ocean is effectively protected from destructive extractive activities, according to the nonprofit Marine Conservation Institute. That's far below the target agreed under the \u201c30x30\u201d pledge to conserve 30% of land and sea by 2030.",
      "Atop this year\u2019s agenda is ratification of the High Seas Treaty. Adopted in 2023, the treaty would for the first time allow nations to establish marine protected areas in international waters, which cover nearly two-thirds of the ocean and are largely ungoverned.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Wild West out there with countries just fishing anywhere without any sort of regulation, and that needs to change,\u201d said Mauro Randone, regional projects manager at the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s Mediterranean Marine Initiative. \u201cThe high seas belong to everyone and no one practically at the same time, and countries are finally committing to establish some rules.\u201d",
      "The ocean is critical in stabilizing Earth\u2019s climate and sustaining life. It generates 50% of the oxygen we breathe, absorbs around 30% of carbon dioxide emissions and captures more than 90% of the excess heat caused by those emissions. Without a healthy ocean, experts warn, climate goals will remain out of reach.",
      "The treaty will only come into force once 60 countries ratify it. As of Monday, just 32 countries had. Advocates hope UNOC can build enough momentum to cross the threshold, which would allow for the first official Oceans Conference of Parties.",
      "\u201cTwo-thirds of the ocean is areas beyond national jurisdiction \u2014 that\u2019s half our planet,\u201d said Minna Epps, director of global ocean policy the International Union for Conservation of Nature. \u201cWe cannot possibly protect 30% of the ocean if it doesn\u2019t include the high seas.\u201d",
      "South Korea, France and the European Union have championed the treaty, but most large ocean nations have yet to ratify it, including the rest of the G20. Thousands of attendees are expected in Nice \u2014 from delegates and heads of state to scientists and industry leaders. The United States has yet to confirm a formal delegation.",
      "Beyond new commitments, the conference highlights the growing gap between marine protection declarations and real-world conservation.",
      "France, the conference co-host, claims to have surpassed the 30% target for marine protection. But environmental groups say only 3% of French waters are fully protected from harmful activities like bottom trawling and industrial fishing.",
      "In 2024 alone, more than 100 bottom-trawling vessels were recorded spending over 17,000 hours fishing within France\u2019s six marine nature parks, according to ocean advocacy group Oceana.",
      "\u201cThe government declares these as protected areas, but this is a lie,\u201d said Enric Sala, founder of National Geographic Pristine Seas marine reserve project. \u201cMost of it is political box-ticking. It\u2019s all paper parks.\u201d",
      "That criticism is echoed across the continent. A new World Wildlife Fund report found that although more than 11% of Europe\u2019s marine area is designated for protection, just 2% of EU waters have management plans in place.",
      "Fabien Boileau, director of marine protected areas at France\u2019s Office for Biodiversity, acknowledged the presence of bottom trawling in French protected areas, but said it was part of a phased strategy.",
      "\u201cIn France, we made the choice to designate large marine protected areas with relatively low levels of regulation at first, betting that stronger protections would be developed over time through local governance,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, we\u2019re gradually increasing the number of zones with stricter protections within those areas.\u201d",
      "While many marine protected areas struggle with enforcement, others show what real protection can achieve. Off the southern coast of France, Port-Cros National Park is one of the oldest marine reserves in the Mediterranean. There, strict anchoring bans have allowed vast seagrass meadows to grow undisturbed. Massive groupers patrol rocky outcrops, brightly colored nudibranchs munch on algae, and schools of large corbs glide through the shallows, undisturbed by fishing lines.",
      "\u201cThanks to the protections that have been in place since 1963, we can observe species that are much larger than elsewhere in the Mediterranean and at a much higher density than in other areas,\" said Hubert Flavigny, manager of Mio Palmo dive center in Hyeres, France.",
      "Still, such examples remain exceptions.",
      "Advocates say industrial fishing lobbies continue to resist stricter protections, despite evidence that well-managed reserves boost long-term fisheries through the \u201cspillover effect,\u201d whereby marine life flourishes in nearby waters.",
      "\u201cProtection is not the problem \u2014 overfishing is the problem,\u201d said Sala. \u201cThe worst enemy of the fishing industry is themselves.\u201d",
      "Frustrated by government inaction, environmental groups have taken enforcement into their own hands. In May, Greenpeace dropped 15 limestone boulders into France\u2019s Golfe du Lion, aiming to physically block bottom trawling in a marine area that has long been designated for protection. The protected zone was established in 2008 to preserve deep-sea ecosystems, yet 12 trawlers continue to operate there, despite scientific warnings of ecological collapse, according to activist group MedReAct. The Golfe is now one of the most overfished areas in the Mediterranean.",
      "The conference will feature 10 panels on topics such as blue finance, sustainable fisheries and plastic pollution. Deep sea mining is expected to feature in broader discussions, while small island states are likely to use the platform to advocate for increased climate adaptation funding. The outcome of these discussions will form the basis of the Nice Ocean Action Plan \u2014 a declaration of voluntary commitments to be adopted by consensus and presented at the United Nations in New York this July.",
      "\"There cannot be a healthy planet without a healthy ocean,\" said Peter Thomson, U.N. special envoy for the ocean. \u201cIt\u2019s urgent business for us all.\u201d ___",

      "BEIJING -- U.S.-China trade talks in London this week are expected to take up a series of fresh disputes that have buffeted relations, threatening a fragile truce over tariffs.",
      "Both sides agreed in Geneva last month to a 90-day suspension of most of the 100%-plus tariffs they had imposed on each other in an escalating trade war that had sparked fears of recession.",
      "Since then, the U.S. and China have exchanged angry words over advanced semiconductors that power artificial intelligence, \u201crare earths\u201d that are vital to carmakers and other industries, and visas for Chinese students at American universities.",
      "President Donald Trump spoke at length with Chinese leader Xi Jinping by phone last Thursday in an attempt to put relations back on track. Trump announced on social media the next day that trade talks would be held on Monday in London.",
      "The latest frictions began just a day after the May 12 announcement of the Geneva agreement to \u201cpause\u201d tariffs for 90 days.",
      "The U.S. Commerce Department issued guidance saying the use of Ascend AI chips from Huawei, a leading Chinese tech company, could violate U.S. export controls. That's because the chips were likely developed with American technology despite restrictions on its export to China, the guidance said.",
      "The Chinese government wasn't pleased. One of its biggest beefs in recent years has been over U.S. moves to limit the access of Chinese companies to technology, and in particular to equipment and processes needed to produce the most advanced semiconductors.",
      "\"The Chinese side urges the U.S. side to immediately correct its erroneous practices,\u201d a Commerce Ministry spokesperson said.",

      "One area where China holds the upper hand is in the mining and processing of rare earths. They are crucial for not only autos but also a range of other products from robots to military equipment.",

      "\u201cThe bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,\u201d Trump posted on May 30.",
      "The Chinese government indicated Saturday that it is addressing the concerns, which have come from European companies as well. A Commerce Ministry statement said it had granted some approvals and \u201cwill continue to strengthen the approval of applications that comply with regulations.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump says he\u2019s deploying 2,000 California National Guard troops to Los Angeles to respond to immigration protests, over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom",
      "President Donald Trump says he's deploying 2,000 California National Guard troops to Los Angeles to respond to immigration protests, over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "It's not the first time Trump has activated the National Guard to quell protests. In 2020, he asked governors of several states to send troops to Washington, D.C. to respond to demonstrations that arose after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police officers. Many of the governors he asked agreed, sending troops to the federal district. The governors that refused the request were allowed to do so, keeping their troops on home soil.",
      "This time, however, Trump is acting in opposition to Newsom, who under normal circumstances would retain control and command of California's National Guard. While Trump said that federalizing the troops was necessary to \u201caddress the lawlessness\u201d in California, the Democratic governor said the move was \u201cpurposely inflammatory and will only escalate tensions.\u201d",
      "Here are some things to know about when and how the president can deploy troops on U.S. soil.",
      "Generally, federal military forces are not allowed to carry out civilian law enforcement duties against U.S. citizens except in times of emergency.",
      "An 18th-century wartime law called the Insurrection Act is the main legal mechanism that a president can use to activate the military or National Guard during times of rebellion or unrest. But Trump didn't invoke the Insurrection Act on Saturday.",
      "Instead, he relied on a similar federal law that allows the president to federalize National Guard troops under certain circumstances.",
      "The National Guard is a hybrid entity that serves both state and federal interests. Often it operates under state command and control, using state funding. Sometimes National Guard troops will be assigned by their state to serve federal missions, remaining under state command but using federal funding.",
      "The law cited by Trump's proclamation places National Guard troops under federal command. The law says that can be done under three circumstances: When the U.S. is invaded or in danger of invasion; when there is a rebellion or danger of rebellion against the authority of the U.S. government, or when the President is unable to \u201cexecute the laws of the United States,\u201d with regular forces.",
      "But the law also says that orders for those purposes \u201cshall be issued through the governors of the States.\u201d It's not immediately clear if the president can activate National Guard troops without the order of that state's governor.",
      "Notably, Trump\u2019s proclamation says the National Guard troops will play a supporting role by protecting ICE officers as they enforce the law, rather than having the troops perform law enforcement work.",
      "Steve Vladeck, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center who specializes in military justice and national security law, says that\u2019s because the National Guard troops can\u2019t legally engage in ordinary law enforcement activities unless Trump first invokes the Insurrection Act.",
      "Vladeck said the move raises the risk that the troops could end up using force while filling that \u201cprotection\u201d role. The move could also be a precursor to other, more aggressive troop deployments down the road, he wrote on his website.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing these troops will be allowed to do that, for example, the ICE officers against whom these protests have been directed could not do themselves,\u201d Vladeck wrote.",
      "The Insurrection Act and related laws were used during the Civil Rights era to protect activists and students desegregating schools. President Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to Little Rock, Arkansas, to protect Black students integrating Central High School after that state\u2019s governor activated the National Guard to keep the students out.",
      "George H.W. Bush used the Insurrection Act to respond to riots in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of white police officers who were videotaped beating Black motorist Rodney King.",
      "National Guard troops have been deployed for a variety of emergencies, including the COVID pandemic, hurricanes and other natural disasters. But generally, those deployments are carried out with the agreements of the governors of the responding states.",
      "In 2020, Trump asked governors of several states to deploy their National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. to quell protests that arose after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police officers. Many of the governors agreed, sending troops to the federal district.",
      "At the time, Trump also threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act for protests following Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis \u2013 an intervention rarely seen in modern American history. But then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper pushed back, saying the law should be invoked \u201conly in the most urgent and dire of situations.\u201d",
      "Trump never did invoke the Insurrection Act during his first term.",
      "But while campaigning for his second term, he suggested that would change. Trump told an audience in Iowa in 2023 that he was prevented from using the military to suppress violence in cities and states during his first term, and said if the issue came up again in his next term, \u201cI\u2019m not waiting.\u201d",
      "Trump also promised to deploy the National Guard to help carry out his immigration enforcement goals, and his top adviser Stephen Miller explained how that would be carried out: Troops under sympathetic Republican governors would send troops to nearby states that refuse to participate, Miller said on \u201cThe Charlie Kirk Show,\u201d in 2023.",
      "After Trump announced he was federalizing the National Guard troops on Saturday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said other measures could follow.",
      "Hegseth wrote on the social media platform X that active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton were on high alert and would also be mobilized \u201cif violence continues.\u201d",

      "South Dakota is on a path to invest $2 billion into its corrections facilities in the next decade as a result of its stringent crime laws",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- Two years after approving a tough-on-crime sentencing law, South Dakota is scrambling to deal with the price tag for that legislation: Housing thousands of additional inmates could require up to $2 billion to build new prisons in the next decade.",
      "That\u2019s a lot of money for a state with one of the lowest populations in the U.S., but a consultant said it\u2019s needed to keep pace with an anticipated 34% surge of new inmates in the next decade as a result of South Dakota\u2019s tough criminal justice laws. And while officials are grumbling about the cost, they don't seem concerned with the laws that are driving the need even as national crime rates are dropping.",
      "\u201cCrime has been falling everywhere in the country, with historic drops in crime in the last year or two,\u201d said Bob Libal, senior campaign strategist at the criminal justice nonprofit The Sentencing Project. \u201cIt\u2019s a particularly unusual time to be investing $2 billion in prisons.\u201d",
      "Some Democratic-led states have worked to close prisons and enact changes to lower inmate populations, but that's a tough sell in Republican-majority states such as South Dakota that believe in a tough-on-crime approach, even if that leads to more inmates.",
      "For now, state lawmakers have set aside a $600 million fund to replace the overcrowded 144-year-old South Dakota State Penitentiary in Sioux Falls, making it one of the most expensive taxpayer-funded projects in South Dakota history.",
      "But South Dakota will likely need more prisons. Phoenix-based Arrington Watkins Architects, which the state hired as a consultant, has said South Dakota will need 3,300 additional beds in coming years, bringing the cost to $2 billion.",
      "Driving up costs is the need for facilities with different security levels to accommodate the inmate population.",
      "Concerns about South Dakota\u2019s prisons first arose four years ago, when the state was flush with COVID-19 relief funds. Lawmakers wanted to replace the penitentiary, but they couldn't agree on where to put the prison and how big it should be.",
      "A task force of state lawmakers assembled by Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden is expected to decide that in a plan for prison facilities this July. Many lawmakers have questioned the proposed cost, but few have called for criminal justice changes that would make such a large prison unnecessary.",
      "\u201cOne thing I\u2019m trying to do as the chairman of this task force is keep us very focused on our mission,\u201d said Lieutenant Gov. Tony Venhuizen. \u201cThere are people who want to talk about policies in the prisons or the administration or the criminal justice system more broadly, and that would be a much larger project than the fairly narrow scope that we have.\u201d",
      "South Dakota's incarceration rate of 370 per 100,000 people is an outlier in the Upper Midwest. Neighbors Minnesota and North Dakota have rates of under 250 per 100,000 people, according to the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice advocacy nonprofit.",
      "Nearly half of South Dakota's projected inmate population growth can be attributed to a law approved in 2023 that requires some violent offenders to serve the full-length of their sentences before parole, according to a report by Arrington Watkins.",
      "When South Dakota inmates are paroled, about 40% are ordered to return to prison, the majority of those due to technical violations such as failing a drug test or missing a meeting with a parole officer. Those returning inmates made up nearly half of prison admissions in 2024.",
      "Sioux Falls criminal justice attorney Ryan Kolbeck blamed the high number of parolees returning in part on the lack of services in prison for people with drug addictions.",
      "\u201cPeople are being sent to the penitentiary but there\u2019s no programs there for them. There\u2019s no way it\u2019s going to help them become better people,\u201d he said. \u201cEssentially we\u2019re going to put them out there and house them for a little bit, leave them on parole and expect them to do well.\u201d",
      "South Dakota also has the second-greatest disparity of Native Americans in its prisons. While Native Americans make up one-tenth of South Dakota\u2019s population, they make up 35% of those in state prisons, according to Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit public policy group.",
      "Though legislators in the state capital, Pierre, have been talking about prison overcrowding for years, they're reluctant to dial back on tough-on-crime laws. For example, it took repeated efforts over six years before South Dakota reduced a controlled substance ingestion law to a misdemeanor from a felony for the first offense, aligning with all other states.",
      "\u201cIt was a huge, Herculean task to get ingestion to be a misdemeanor,\u201d Kolbeck said.",
      "Former penitentiary warden Darin Young said the state needs to upgrade its prisons, but he also thinks it should spend up to $300 million on addiction and mental illness treatment.",
      "\u201cUntil we fix the reasons why people come to prison and address that issue, the numbers are not going to stop,\u201d he said.",
      "Without policy changes, the new prisons are sure to fill up, criminal justice experts agreed.",
      "\u201cWe might be good for a few years, now that we\u2019ve got more capacity, but in a couple years it\u2019ll be full again,\u201d Kolbeck said. \u201cUnder our policies, you\u2019re going to reach capacity again soon.\u201d",

      "This year's Boulder Jewish Festival is being reimagined to focus on community healing",
      "BOULDER, Colo. -- The group that was attacked last weekend in Boulder, Colorado, while calling for Hamas to release Israeli hostages will be a central focus of the Boulder Jewish Festival, which kicks off Sunday morning in the same location where the firebombing took place.",
      "Organizers of the festival, which is in its 30th year, said they have reimagined the cultural celebration to focus on community healing after a man who yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d threw Molotov cocktails at Run for Their Lives demonstrators, according to law enforcement officials.",
      "Authorities have said 15 people and a dog were victims of the attack. Not all were physically injured, and some are considered victims for the legal case because they were in the area and could potentially have been hurt.",
      "Run for Their Lives, a global grassroots initiative with 230 chapters, started in October 2023 after Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip stormed into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 others hostage.",
      "Sunday's festival at the downtown Pearl Street pedestrian mall will center the group's cause \u2014 raising awareness of the 55 people believed to still be in captivity in Gaza. The Boulder chapter walks at the mall every weekend for 18 minutes, the numerical value of the Hebrew word \u201cchai,\u201d which means \u201clife.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is going to look very different this year. Run for Their Lives is going to be featured front and center,\u201d said Miri Kornfeld, a Run for Their Lives organizer in Denver. \u201cThe community is looking for a way to come together after an act of violence. People just want to be together, and they want to celebrate who they are.\u201d",
      "A group representing families of the Israeli hostages plans to send at least one family to join the Boulder chapter Sunday as it resumes its weekly walks during the festival, Kornfeld said. Art, food and music are also planned.",
      "In response to the attack, the Boulder Police Department and the FBI are coordinating to provide increased security at the festival, local synagogues and the Boulder Jewish Community Center. Festival attendees can expect drones, SWAT elements and plainclothes officers in the crowd to increase safety and make people feel at ease, police Chief Stephen Redfearn said.",
      "\u201cAny would-be attacker, anybody that might come there to cause harm, I want them to see that we have a lot of people there, and hopefully that dissuades anyone from doing anything nefarious,\" Redfearn said Thursday.",
      "The victims of the attack include eight women and seven men, ranging in age from 25 to 88. One is a Holocaust survivor.",
      "Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was charged Thursday in state court with 118 counts, including attempted murder, assault, illegal use of explosives and animal cruelty. He has also been charged with a hate crime in federal court and is jailed on a $10 million cash bond.",
      "Soliman, an Egyptian national who federal authorities say was living in the U.S. illegally, told police he was driven by a desire \u201cto kill all Zionist people,\" a reference to the movement to establish and sustain a Jewish state in Israel. Authorities said he expressed no remorse about the attack.",
      "U.S. immigration officials took Soliman's wife and five children, who also are Egyptian, into custody Tuesday. They have not been charged in the attack.",
      "A federal judge on Wednesday granted a request to block the deportation of Soliman\u2019s wife and children.",
      "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, has deemed the attack antisemitic, meaning it targeted Jewish people because of their identity or beliefs.",
      "Organizers have not confirmed whether all the demonstrators last Sunday were Jewish. The group is open to Jewish and non-Jewish participants.",
      "The violence in downtown Boulder unfolded against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war, which continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitism in the U.S. It also came at the start of the holiday of Shavuot, which commemorates God giving the Torah to the Jewish people at Mount Sinai in Egypt.",
      "\u201cIn the wake of the most violent antisemitic terrorist attack in Colorado history, we are reminded of the profound power of standing shoulder to shoulder,\u201d Mindy Miller of Stop Antisemitism Colorado said at a community vigil Wednesday night. \u201cLet today be the beginning of a new chapter in Colorado \u2014 one where Jews no longer have to stand alone.\u201d",

      "Mohammad Sharafoddin, his wife and young son managed to make it out of Afghanistan as refugees nine years ago, at one point walking 36 hours in a row over mountain passes",
      "IRMO, S.C. -- Mohammad Sharafoddin, his wife and young son walked at times for 36 hours in a row over mountain passes as they left Afghanistan as refugees to end up less than a decade later talking about their journey on a plush love seat in the family's three-bedroom suburban American home.",
      "He and his wife dreamed of bringing her niece to the United States to share in that bounty. Maybe she could study to become a doctor and then decide her own path.",
      "But that door slams shut on Monday as America put in place a travel ban for people from Afghanistan and a dozen other countries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of shock for us when we hear about Afghanistan, especially right now for ladies who are affected more than others with the new government,\u201d Mohammad Sharafoddin said. \u201cWe didn't think about this travel ban.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump signed the ban Wednesday. It is similar to one in place during his first administration but covers more countries. Along with Afghanistan, travel to the U.S. is banned from Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.",
      "Trump said visitors who overstay visas, like the man charged in an attack that injured dozens of demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado, earlier this month, are a danger to the country. The suspect in the attack is from Egypt, which isn't included in the ban.",
      "The countries chosen for the ban have deficient screening of their citizens, often refuse to take them back and have a high percentage of people who stay in the U.S. after their visas expire, Trump said.",
      "The ban makes exceptions for people from Afghanistan on Special Immigrant Visas who generally worked most closely with the U.S. government during the two-decade war there.",
      "Afghanistan was also one of the largest sources of resettled refugees, with about 14,000 arrivals in a 12-month period through September 2024. Trump suspended refugee resettlement on his first day in office.",
      "It is a path Sharafoddin took with his wife and son out of Afghanistan walking on those mountain roads in the dark then through Pakistan, Iran and into Turkey. He worked in a factory for years in Turkey, listening to YouTube videos on headphones to learn English before he was resettled in Irmo, South Carolina, a suburb of Columbia.",
      "His son is now 11, and he and his wife had a daughter in the U.S. who is now 3. There is a job at a jewelry maker that allows him to afford a two-story, three-bedroom house. Food was laid out on two tables Saturday for a celebration of the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday.",
      "Sharafoddin's wife, Nuriya, said she is learning English and driving \u2014 two things she couldn't do in Afghanistan under Taliban rule.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very happy to be here now, because my son is very good at school and my daughter also. I think after 18 years they are going to work, and my daughter is going to be able to go to college,\u201d she said.",
      "It is a life she wanted for her niece too. The couple show videos from their cellphones of her drawing and painting. When the Taliban returned to power in 2021, their niece could no longer study. So they started to plan to get her to the U.S. at least to further her education.",
      "Nuriya Sharafoddin doesn't know if her niece has heard the news from America yet. She hasn't had the heart to call and tell her.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not ready to call her. This is not good news. This is very sad news because she is worried and wants to come,\u201d Nuriya Sharafoddin said.",
      "While the couple spoke, Jim Ray came by. He has helped a number of refugee families settle in Columbia and helped the Sharafoddins navigate questions in their second language.",
      "Ray said Afghans in Columbia know the return of the Taliban changed how the U.S. deals with their native country.",
      "But while the ban allows spouses, children or parents to travel to America, other family members aren't included. Many Afghans know their extended families are starving or suffering, and suddenly a path to help is closed, Ray said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see how the travel ban and the specifics of it actually play out,\u201d Ray said. \u201cThis kind of thing that they\u2019re experiencing where family cannot be reunited is actually where it hurts the most.\u201d",
      "The Taliban have criticized Trump for the ban, with their top leader Hibatullah Akhundzada saying the U.S. was now the oppressor of the world.",
      "\u201cCitizens from 12 countries are barred from entering their land \u2014 and Afghans are not allowed either,\u201d he said on a recording shared on social media. \u201cWhy? Because they claim the Afghan government has no control over its people and that people are leaving the country. So, oppressor! Is this what you call friendship with humanity?\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Six decades after the federal government ordered Concordia Parish to desegregate its schools, the district remains racially divided",
      "FERRIDAY, La. -- Even at a glance, the differences are obvious. The walls of Ferriday High School are old and worn, surrounded by barbed wire. Just a few miles away, Vidalia High School is clean and bright, with a new library and a crisp blue \u201cV\u201d painted on orange brick.",
      "Ferriday High is 90% Black. Vidalia High is 62% white.",
      "For Black families, the contrast between the schools suggests \u201cwe\u2019re not supposed to have the finer things,\u201d said Brian Davis, a father in Ferriday. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like our kids don\u2019t deserve it,\u201d he said.",
      "The schools are part of Concordia Parish, which was ordered to desegregate 60 years ago and remains under a court-ordered plan to this day. Yet there\u2019s growing momentum to release the district \u2014 and dozens of others \u2014 from decades-old orders that some call obsolete.",
      "In a remarkable reversal, the Justice Department said it plans to start unwinding court-ordered desegregation plans dating to the Civil Rights Movement. Officials started in April, when they lifted a 1960s order in Louisiana\u2019s Plaquemines Parish. Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the department\u2019s civil rights division, has said others will \u201cbite the dust.\u201d",
      "It comes amid pressure from Republican Gov. Jeff Landry and his attorney general, who have called for all the state\u2019s remaining orders to be lifted. They describe the orders as burdens on districts and relics of a time when Black students were still forbidden from some schools.",
      "The orders were always meant to be temporary \u2014 school systems can be released if they demonstrate they fully eradicated segregation. Decades later, that goal remains elusive, with stark racial imbalances persisting in many districts.",
      "Civil rights groups say the orders are important to keep as tools to address the legacy of forced segregation \u2014 including disparities in student discipline, academic programs and teacher hiring. They point to cases like Concordia, where the decades-old order was used to stop a charter school from favoring white students in admissions.",
      "\u201cConcordia is one where it's old, but a lot is happening there,\u201d said Deuel Ross, deputy director of litigation for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. \u201cThat\u2019s true for a lot of these cases. They\u2019re not just sitting silently.\u201d",
      "Last year, before President Donald Trump took office, Concordia Parish rejected a Justice Department plan that would have ended its case if the district combined several majority white and majority Blac k elementary and middle schools.",
      "At a town hall meeting, Vidalia residents vigorously opposed the plan, saying it would disrupt students\u2019 lives and expose their children to drugs and violence. An official from the Louisiana attorney general\u2019s office spoke against the proposal and said the Trump administration likely would change course on older orders.",
      "Accepting the plan would have been a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d for the district, said Paul Nelson, a former Concordia superintendent. White families would have fled to private schools or other districts, said Nelson, who wants the court order removed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time to move on,\u201d said Nelson, who left the district in 2016. \u201cLet\u2019s start looking to build for the future, not looking back to what our grandparents may have gone through.\u201d",
      "At Ferriday High, athletic coach Derrick Davis supported combining schools in Ferriday and Vidalia. He said the district's disparities come into focus whenever his teams visit schools with newer sports facilities.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me, if we\u2019d all combine, we can all get what we need,\u201d he said.",
      "Others oppose merging schools if it\u2019s done solely for the sake of achieving racial balance. \u201cRedistricting and going to different places they\u2019re not used to ... it would be a culture shock to some people,\" said Ferriday\u2019s school resource officer, Marcus Martin, who, like Derrick Davis, is Black.",
      "The district\u2019s current superintendent and school board did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Concordia is among more than 120 districts across the South that remain under desegregation orders from the 1960s and \u201970s, including about a dozen in Louisiana.",
      "Calling the orders historical relics is \u201cunequivocally false,\u201d said Shaheena Simons, who until April led the Justice Department section that oversees school desegregation cases.",
      "\u201cSegregation and inequality persist in our schools, and they persist in districts that are still under desegregation orders,\u201d she said.",
      "With court orders in place, families facing discrimination can reach out directly to the Justice Department or seek relief from the court. Otherwise, the only recourse is a lawsuit, which many families can\u2019t afford, Simons said.",
      "In Concordia, the order played into a battle over a charter school that opened in 2013 on the former campus of an all-white private school. To protect the area\u2019s progress on racial integration, a judge ordered Delta Charter School to build a student body that reflected the district\u2019s racial demographics. But in its first year, the school was just 15% Black.",
      "After a court challenge, Delta was ordered to give priority to Black students. Today, about 40% of its students are Black.",
      "Desegregation orders have been invoked recently in other cases around the state. One led to an order to address disproportionately high rates of discipline for Black students, and in another a predominantly Black elementary school was relocated from a site close to a chemical plant.",
      "The Trump administration was able to close the Plaquemines case with little resistance because the original plaintiffs were no longer involved \u2014 the Justice Department was litigating the case alone. Concordia and an unknown number of other districts are in the same situation, making them vulnerable to quick dismissals.",
      "Concordia\u2019s case dates to 1965, when the area was strictly segregated and home to a violent offshoot of the Ku Klux Klan. When Black families in Ferriday sued for access to all-white schools, the federal government intervened.",
      "As the district integrated its schools, white families fled Ferriday. The district's schools came to reflect the demographics of their surrounding areas. Ferriday is mostly Black and low-income, while Vidalia is mostly white and takes in tax revenue from a hydroelectric plant. A third town in the district, Monterey, has a high school that's 95% white.",
      "At the December town hall, Vidalia resident Ronnie Blackwell said the area \u201cfeels like a Mayberry, which is great,\u201d referring to the fictional Southern town from \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show.\u201d The federal government, he said, has \u201cprobably destroyed more communities and school systems than it ever helped.\u201d",
      "Under its court order, Concordia must allow students in majority Black schools to transfer to majority white schools. It also files reports on teacher demographics and student discipline.",
      "After failing to negotiate a resolution with the Justice Department, Concordia is scheduled to make its case that the judge should dismiss the order, according to court documents. Meanwhile, amid a wave of resignations in the federal government, all but two of the Justice Department lawyers assigned to the case have left.",
      "Without court supervision, Brian Davis sees little hope for improvement.",
      "\u201cA lot of parents over here in Ferriday, they\u2019re stuck here because here they don\u2019t have the resources to move their kids from A to B,\" he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find schools like Ferriday \u2014 the term is, to me, slipping into darkness.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday said he is removing every member of a government panel that makes vaccine recommendations.",
      "Kennedy said he is \"retiring\" all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, asserting that it \"has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.\"",
      "\"A clean sweep is needed to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science,\" Kennedy wrote in an opinion piece published by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Kennedy's move was quickly rebuked by a number of doctors groups. A statement released by the American Medical Association said it \"upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives.\" The American Academy of Pediatrics called it\u00a0part of an \"escalating effort by the Administration to silence independent medical expertise and stoke distrust in lifesaving vaccines.\"",
      "It comes after months of criticism over how Kennedy has wielded his authority and platform as the head of the nation's public health agencies, including\u00a0ordering changes to COVID-19 vaccine guidance, terminating bird flu vaccine\u00a0research funding, forcing out federal vaccines officials and spreading myths about\u00a0measles shots.",
      "The members of the committee are independent medical and public health experts who advise and vote on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations. The CDC sets immunization schedules for both adults and children based on recommendations from ACIP.",
      "Experts and health authorities closely watch the committee's decisions, since their recommendations are tied to a number of federal policies, including requirements for insurance coverage and liability protections.",
      "\"Per the June 9, 2025 directive from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, this email serves as formal notice of your immediate termination as a member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). We appreciate your prior service and commitment,\" read an email to one committee member from the CDC.",
      "\"This is horrifying,\" a CDC official said of Kennedy's move.",
      "The American Public Health Association\u00a0denounced\u00a0it as an undemocratic \"coup\" of the process. The Infectious Disease Society of America called it \"reckless, shortsighted and severely harmful.\" The American College of Physicians accused Kennedy of having \"circumvented the standard, transparent vaccine review processes\" at the CDC.",
      "\"Today's announcement will seriously erode public confidence in our government's ability to ensure the health of the American public and it will endanger the safety, welfare and lives of our patients,\" Dr. Jason Goldman, the group's president and a liaison to the committee, said in\u00a0a statement.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and the top Republican in the Senate's health committee, also expressed concern, saying \"now the fear is that the ACIP will be filled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion.\"",
      "\"I've just spoken with Secretary Kennedy, and I'll continue to talk with him to ensure this is not the case,\" Cassidy\u00a0posted on X.",
      "Cassidy had been a key vote in Kennedy's confirmation process, coming out in favor of Kennedy's nomination only after Kennedy offered a number of reassurances, including to \"maintain\" the committee \"without changes.\"",
      "Career CDC officials usually select experts to sit on the committee out of the applications it receives, forwarding picks to the secretary to be signed off on.",
      "Kennedy said the Trump administration would not have been able to appoint a majority of new members until 2028 because some of the current members were last-minute appointees of the Biden administration.",
      "\"The prior administration made a concerted effort to lock in public health ideology and limit the incoming administration's ability to take the proper actions to restore public trust in vaccines,\" Kennedy said.",
      "It is unclear who is being considered to replace the committee's members or how they are being selected. A spokesperson for the department did not comment when asked.",
      "The move comes a week after a committee leader, Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, resigned from her role following an order from Kennedy to change the CDC's guidance on COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.",
      "Outside groups criticized\u00a0the edits forced by Kennedy, which bypassed the longstanding advisory committee process and usurped an already-ongoing work group within the panel that had been weighing how to narrow COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.",

      "BowFlex is recalling millions of units of its adjustable dumbbells because their weight plates can dislodge and cause injury to users.",
      "The recall comes after over 100 reports of injuries including concussions, abrasions, broken toes or contusions, according to the CPSC.",
      "The dumbbells are popular because of their versatility: They allow users to lift dumbbells of different weights, without owning a full set of individually weighted dumbbells, which would take up a lot of space.",
      "A total of 3,844,200 units of the product are being recalled, according to a notice from the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) Thursday. That includes 3.7 million units that were sold by Nautilus Inc. Nautilus changed its corporate name to BowFlex in 2023.",

      "For customers who purchased the dumbbells from BowFlex, formerly Nautilus, consumers may request a refund in the form of a prorated voucher.

    "published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration wants to shutter the CDC's National Asthma Control Program, which provides millions in funding to state-administered initiatives aimed at fighting the disease.",
    "story": [
      "Esther Bejarano's son was 11 months old when asthma landed him in the hospital. She didn't know what had triggered his symptoms \u2014 neither she nor her husband had asthma \u2014 but she suspected it was the pesticides sprayed on the agricultural fields near her family's home.",
      "Pesticides are a known contributor to asthma and are commonly used where Bejarano lives in California's Imperial Valley, a landlocked region that straddles two counties on the U.S.-Mexico border and is one of the main producers of the nation's winter crops. It also has some of the worst air pollution in the nation and one of the highest rates of childhood asthma emergency room visits in the state, according to data collected by the California Department of Public Health.",
      "Bejarano has since learned to manage her now-19-year-old son's asthma and works at Comite Civico del Valle, a local rights organization focused on environmental justice in the Imperial Valley. The organization trains health care workers to educate patients on proper asthma management, enabling them to avoid hospitalization and eliminate triggers at home. The course is so popular that there's a waiting list, Bejarano said.",
      "But the group's Asthma Management Academy program and similar initiatives nationwide face extinction with the Trump administration's mass layoffs, grant cancellations, and proposed budget cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency. Asthma experts fear the cumulative impact of the reductions could result in more ER visits and deaths, particularly for children and people in low-income communities \u2014 populations disproportionately vulnerable to the disease.",
      "\"Asthma is a preventive condition,\" Bejarano said. \"No one should die of asthma.\"",
      "Asthma can block airways, making it hard to breathe, and in severe cases can cause death if not treated quickly. Nearly 28 million people in the U.S. have asthma, and about 10 people still die every day from the disease, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.",
      "In May, the White House released a budget proposal that would permanently shutter\u00a0the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Asthma Control Program, which was already gutted by federal health department layoffs in April. It's unclear whether Congress will approve the closure.",
      "Last year, the program allotted $33.5 million to state-administered initiatives in 27 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C., to help communities with asthma education. The funding is distributed in four-year grant cycles, during which the programs receive up to $725,000 each annually.",
      "Comite Civico del Valle's academy in Southern California, a clinician workshop in Houston, and asthma medical management training in Allentown, Pennsylvania \u2014 ranked the most challenging U.S. city to live in with asthma \u2014 are among the programs largely surviving on these grants. The first year of the current grant cycle ends Aug. 31, and it's unknown whether funding will continue beyond then.",
      "Data suggests that the CDC's National Asthma Control Program has had a significant impact. The agency's own research has shown that the program saves $71 in health care costs for every $1 invested. And the asthma death rate decreased 44% between the 1999 launch of the program and 2021, according to the American Lung Association.",
      "\"Losing support from the CDC will have devastating impacts on asthma programs in states and communities across the country, programs that we know are improving the lives of millions of people with asthma,\" said Anne Kelsey Lamb, director of the Public Health Institute's Regional Asthma Management and Prevention program. \"And the thing is that we know a lot about what works to help people keep their asthma well controlled, and that's why it's so devastating.\"",
      "The Trump administration cited cost savings and efficiency in its April announcement of the cuts to HHS. Requests for comment from the White House and HHS's CDC about cuts to federal asthma and related programs were not answered.",
      "The information wars",
      "Fresno, in the heart of California's Central Valley, is one of the country's top 20 \"asthma capitals,\" with high rates of asthma and related emergencies and deaths. It's home to programs that receive funding through the National Asthma Control Program. Health care professionals there also rely on another aspect of the program that is under threat if it's shuttered: countrywide data.",
      "The federal asthma program collects information on asthma rates and offers a tool to study prevalence and rates of death from the disease, see what populations are most affected, and assess state and local trends. Asthma educators and health care providers worry that the loss of these numbers could be the biggest impact of the cuts, because it would mean a dearth of information crucial to forming educated recommendations and treatment plans.",
      "\"How do we justify the services we provide if the data isn't there?\" said Graciela Anaya, director of community health at the Central California Asthma Collaborative in Fresno.",
      "Mitchell Grayson, chair of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation's Medical Scientific Council, is similarly concerned.",
      "\"My fear is we're going to live in a world that is frozen in Jan. 19, 2025, as far as data, because that was the last time you know that this information was safely collected,\" he said.",
      "Grayson, an allergist who practices in Columbus, Ohio, said he also worries government websites will delete important recommendations that asthma sufferers avoid heavy air pollution, get annual flu shots, and get COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Disproportionate risk",
      "Asthma disproportionately affects communities of color because of \"historic structural issues,\" said Lynda Mitchell, CEO of the Asthma and Allergy Network, citing a higher likelihood of living in public housing or near highways and other pollution sources.",
      "She and other experts in the field said cuts to diversity initiatives across federal agencies, combined with the rollback of environmental protections, will have an outsize impact on these at-risk populations.",
      "In December, the Biden administration awarded nearly $1.6 billion through the EPA's Community Change Grants program to help disadvantaged communities address pollution and climate threats. The Trump administration moved to cut this funding in March. The grant freezes, which have been temporarily blocked by the courts, are part of a broader effort by the Trump EPA to eliminate aid to environmental justice programs across the agency.",
      "In 2023 and 2024, the National Institutes of Health's Climate Change and Health Initiative received $40 million for research, including on the link between asthma and climate change. The Trump administration has moved to cut that money. And a March memo essentially halted all NIH grants focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI \u2014 funds many of the asthma programs serving low-income communities rely on to operate.",
      "On top of those cuts, environmental advocates like Isabel Gonz\u00e1lez Whitaker of Memphis, Tennessee, worry that the proposed reversals of environmental regulations will further harm the health of communities like hers that are already reeling from the effects of climate change. Shelby County, home to Memphis, recently received an F on the American Lung Association's annual report card for having so many high ozone days. Gonz\u00e1lez Whitaker is director of EcoMadres, a program within the national organization Moms for Clean Air that advocates for better environmental conditions for Latino communities.",
      "\"Urgent asthma needs in communities are getting defunded at a time when I just see things getting worse in terms of deregulation,\" said Gonz\u00e1lez Whitaker, who took her 12-year-old son to the hospital because of breathing issues for the first time this year. \"We're being assaulted by this data and science, which is clearly stating that we need to be doing better around preserving the regulations.\"",
      "Back in California's Imperial Valley \u2014 where the majority-Hispanic, working-class population surrounds California's largest lake, the Salton Sea \u2014 is an area called Bombay Beach. Bejarano calls it the \"forgotten community.\" Homes there lack clean running water, because of naturally occurring arsenic in the groundwater, and residents frequently experience a smell like rotten eggs blowing off the drying lakebed, exposing decades of pesticide-tinged dirt.",
      "In 2022, a 12-year-old girl died in Bombay Beach after an asthma attack. Bejarano said she later learned that the girl's school had recommended that she take part in Comite Civico del Valle's at-home asthma education program. She said the girl was on the waiting list when she died.",
      "\"It hit home. Her death showed the personal need we have here in Imperial County,\" Bejarano said. \"Deaths are preventable. Asthma is reversible. If you have asthma, you should be able to live a healthy life.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/norovirus-surge-early-cdc-tracking-new-strain/",
    "published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 11:00:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The norovirus strain GII.17 may have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks.",
    "story": [
      "After years of largely predictable norovirus waves, the emergence of a new strain might have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks from this notorious stomach bug, suggests a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In previous years, the U.S. usually saw norovirus outbreaks increase around December. That marked the start of the season for the virus. But last year's season started in October, as a new norovirus strain called GII.17 drove a record wave of outbreaks.",
      "\"Continued surveillance is needed to determine if this genotype remains the dominant genotype, as well as whether the norovirus season continues to start earlier than previous years,\" wrote two of the CDC's top norovirus researchers, in an article published this month by the agency's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.",
      "Outbreaks have since slowed to usual levels. But with GII.17 now identified in more than 3 in 4 outbreaks in the U.S., its displacement of the GII.4 strain that had previously been dominant is raising questions about whether norovirus season could arrive early again.",
      "\"GII.4 viruses are the main driver for norovirus seasonality. With the decrease of GII.4 outbreaks since 2024, whether GII.17 viruses will continue to cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season cannot yet be determined,\" the CDC researchers wrote.",
      "Several other countries also saw unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus this past year, after GII.17 surged to dominance.",
      "In England, norovirus reports reached levels more than double recent seasons. GII.17 was the most frequently reported genotype of norovirus through April, far above GII.4.",
      "In Japan, where GII.17 previously drove a wave of infections a decade ago, local health authorities in Tokyo reported a steep wave of infectious gastroenteritis \u2014 most from norovirus \u2014 that peaked weeks later than previous seasons and remains above recent years.",
      "Miranda de Graaf, a scientist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands coordinating the global NoroNet network of norovirus researchers, said the Dutch nation did not see an earlier start to its norovirus season. But the country did see higher numbers of norovirus outbreaks, including a few large outbreaks in between when the usual seasonal surges occurred.",
      "GII.4 was still being detected around the world, meaning it was possible that GII.17's dominance could be short-lived, de Graaf said. Researchers had previously wondered if GII.17 could permanently take over, only to see GII.4 cases continue to remain dominant.",
      "\"GII.17 only replaced GII.4 last year, and there has not been another seasonal peak after that. Therefore it is not clear if these shifts will last, or if GII.17 will be the predominant strain next winter season,\" de Graaf said in an email.",
      "A CDC spokesperson said the agency is monitoring norovirus outbreaks through its CaliciNet laboratory\u00a0database\u00a0and pointed to a surge of GII.17 strains in Asia and Europe in 2014 that was followed by no reports of a change to seasonality.",
      "They also cautioned that there was no clear evidence to prove that GII.17's emergence was the cause of a change to the norovirus season last year.",
      "\"There are currently insufficient historic data to predict whether norovirus GII.17 will remain the dominant genotype and lead to an earlier onset of the norovirus season later this year,\" the spokesperson said in an email.",
      "Benjamin Lopman, an epidemiology professor at Emory University who previously worked for the CDC's viral diseases division, said shifts in norovirus strains happen \"when new variants find ways around the immunity that people have built up\" to previous strains. He said that new strains usually trigger more frequent outbreaks earlier in the season.",
      "\"I expect we'll see outbreak patterns return to more typical levels and seasonal patterns in the coming years, though it's always challenging to predict how these viruses will behave,\" Lopman said in an email.",

      "\"Our phone's ringing off the hook, email's up, everything, because people are in panic mode. It reminds me very much of the pandemic, where it's a supply shock.\"",
      "Since Mr. Trump first announced tariffs, Araten has seen demand increase by nearly 50%. The surge comes as consumers strive to navigate the ever-changing tariff landscape.",
      "A U.S. agreement with China, announced in early May\u00a0by the White House, would effectively reduce the level of U.S. taxes still in place on Chinese goods to about 30% from 145%. China meanwhile, has agreed to cut its tariffs on American goods to 10% from 125%.",
      "Despite the agreement, there is still massive uncertainty surrounding Mr. Trump's tariffs. China said the Trump administration is undermining the temporary trade agreement between the two nations by issuing AI chip export control guidelines, stopping the sale of chip design software to China and planning to revoke Chinese student visas.",
      "But the uncertainty isn't just coming from China. The U.S. Court of International Trade\u00a0last month permanently blocked Mr. Trump's 10% tariff assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner, as well as the president's duties on imports from Mexico, Canada and China. However, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.,\u00a0temporarily halted the federal trade court's decision, for now reinstating the levies imposed by the president under an emergency powers law.",
      "If the tariffs do go into effect, Areton believes that a 30% levy is still too high and that the tariffs could impact supplies this holiday season. According to a statement from the United States Toy Association, 77% of toys sold in the United States are made in China.",
      "Major toymaker Basic Fun!, which manufacturers toys like Lincoln Logs, Tonka Trucks and Care Bears, told CBS News it halted the production of all its toys manufactured in China when tariffs went up to 145%, but restarted everything when the tariffs dropped back to 30%. However, the toymaker still expects prices to go up by 10% to 15% later this year.",
      "The Rodon Group has avoided the tariff chaos by using automation to keep production of K'nex toys stateside. The company invested in robots in the 1980s that \"did almost nothing, but could pick stuff up,\" Aretan said. Over the last four decades, the company has continued to invest in robotics, which allowed it to take the advantage away from offshore manufacturers, where labor costs are lower.",
      "According to Araten, an employee at the Rodon Group is able to accomplish what 150 workers overseas are able to accomplish. However, despite believing in automation, Araten says that domestic production will only work if the United States invests in its workforce.",
      "\"It's automation and STEM education. It's that combination. You're going to need talented people,\" insisted Araten from his factory floor.",
      "\"That's what we need to invest in, and that takes time. But whenever we put our mind to something as a nation, we've done it.\"",

      "\"The lack of homes, especially at affordable price points where they would be entering the market, has been plaguing first-time homebuyers for the last several years,\" Lautz said. \"It's been a continual issue, especially with interest rates. It makes the cost of homeownership quite high.\"",
      "Along with inadequate construction of affordable housing, many existing homeowners are reluctant to sell their properties given their lower mortgage rates.",
      "\"People who are homeowners have no motivational factors to move, so that's not freeing up inventory,\" Lautz said. \"It's almost created a hoarding situation for those in low-interest rate mortgages who don't want to separate from them.\"",
      "Financial squeeze",
      "Other factors are making it hard for people to buy a first home. The high cost of rent gets in the way of saving for a down payment, while credit card debt, car loans and child care costs also hold first-time homebuyers back. More recently, meanwhile, the resumption of student loan payments is putting many people under financial pressure.",
      "Some Americans are managing to save enough for a first home by temporarily moving in with family or friends to minimize the cost of rent, Lautz said. But that approach isn't viable for everyone.",
      "\"It has been a pathway to ownership for some. But for someone who is 38-years-old, moving in with mom and dad can get uncomfortable,\" she said. \"For an older homebuyer, that might be less attractive for everyone involved.\"",

      "In the lawsuit filed in federal court, attorneys for the state said President Trump \"unlawfully bypassed\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom by putting National Guard troops under federal control without the governor's permission.",
      "The troops were deployed to protect federal property and personnel under a law that lets the president call the National Guard into federal service during a \"rebellion.\" But California's lawsuit argues this law does not apply to the tense protests that Los Angeles has faced over Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations.",
      "\"At no point in the past three days has there been a rebellion or an insurrection. Nor have these protests risen to the level of protests or riots that Los Angeles and other major cities have seen at points in the past, including in recent years,\" the lawsuit reads.",
      "The lawsuit also states that the law cited by the Trump administration \u2014 Section 12406 \u2014 explicitly requires orders to call up the National Guard to go through governors, who normally control their own National Guard forces.",
      "The suit argues the use of National Guard forces has stoked \"fear and terror\" and \"heightened tensions with protesters and residents.\" It also states that local police have handled any violence at the protests effectively.",
      "\"One of the cornerstones of our Nation and our democracy is that our people are governed by civil, not military, rule,\" the suit reads. \"The Founders enshrined these principles in our Constitution \u2014 that a government should be accountable to its people, guided by the rule of law, and one of civil authority, not military rule.\"",

      "When asked about what he would say regarding the argument that the lawsuit is impacting the president's ability to protect public safety, the attorney general said on \"The Takeout\" that California has very large and well-resourced law enforcement agencies and departments that are capable of handling the situation in Los Angeles, adding that most of the protesting has been peaceful except some instances of violence.",
      "\"If the National Guard is ever needed, the governor can call them in,\" Bonta told Garrett. \"But the president calling in the Marines, the president calling in the National Guard, it only stokes the flames, increases tension, creates unneeded provocation.\"",

The LAPD said it had arrested 31 people on a range of charges, including failure to disperse, objects and fireworks thrown at officers, looting and arson. California Highway Patrol had arrested 17 people and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department made five arrests, the agencies told CBS News.",

Yes, I know that some were taken that weren't supposed to, that parents expected to get their kids back, but the reality is, what would their life have been like if their parents did get them back, you know? They wouldn't have had the opportunities that they had here in the U.S.\"",
      "Steve Ford acknowledged, \"Anytime you have a mission like this, is it gonna be 100%? Absolutely not. That's- this is war. You're trying to do the best you can very quickly.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tensions in Los Angeles escalated Sunday as thousands of protesters took to the streets in response to President Trump's deployment of the National Guard, blocking off a major freeway and setting self-driving cars on fire as law enforcement used tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bangs to control the crowd.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday that his office intends to sue the Trump administration for deploying the Guard without consulting him, a move he called \"illegal and immoral\"\u00a0in a social media post Sunday.",
      "In another post Monday morning, Newsom said Mr. Trump \"illegally acted to federalize the National Guard,\" adding, \"We're suing him.\"",
      "As of midday Monday, 53 people have been arrested, officials said. The LAPD said it had arrested 31 people on a range of charges, including failure to disperse, objects and fireworks thrown at officers, looting and arson. California Highway Patrol had arrested 17 people and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department made five arrests, the agencies told CBS News.",
      "Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell on Sunday addressed complaints accusing the police department of responding too slowly to the unrest.",
      "\"We can't participate in any way in civil immigration enforcement,\" McDonnell said.",
      "He reminded reporters that police must comply with the California Values Act, a Los Angeles \"sanctuary city\" ordinance also known as SB 54, which prevents local and state law enforcement agencies from assisting federal immigration enforcement activity.",
      "On Sunday, many protesters dispersed as evening fell and police declared an unlawful assembly, a precursor to officers moving in and arresting people who didn't leave.",
      "But some of those remaining threw objects at police from behind a makeshift barrier that spanned the width of a street and others hurled chunks of concrete, rocks, electric scooters and fireworks at California Highway Patrol officers and their vehicles parked on the closed southbound 101 Freeway. Officers ran under an overpass to take cover.",
      "CBS News Los Angeles reported that several fires were set in dumpsters and trash bins and at least one store had windows shattered by alleged looters. Dozens of buildings were tagged with graffiti, including the LAPD Headquarters, the U.S. Courthouse and the old Los Angeles Times building.",
      "Footage from the CBS News Los Angeles helicopter showed that multiple windows of the police headquarters had been shattered as well.",
      "Separately, San Francisco police reported 60 arrests Sunday night. Police said people were taking part in \"First Amendment activities\" but then began committing crimes \"ranging from assault to felony vandalism and causing property damage.\" An unlawful assembly was declared but several people kept \"engaging in illegal activity,\" police said. Two officers were hurt, though the injuries weren't life-threatening. Police said the demonstrators then vandalized buildings, a police cruiser and other property, and officers began arresting people who didn't comply with the dispersal order.",
      "L.A. demonstrations intensified",
      "Sunday's protests in Los Angeles, a sprawling city of 4 million people, were centered in several blocks of downtown. It was the third and most intense day of demonstrations against Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown in the region, as the arrival of around 300 Guard troops spurred anger and fear among many residents.",
      "The Guard was deployed specifically to protect federal buildings, including the downtown detention center where protesters concentrated.",
      "Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said officers were \"overwhelmed\" by the remaining protesters. He said they included regular agitators who show up at demonstrations to cause trouble.",
      "Dozens of people were arrested throughout the weekend of the protest.",
      "Mr. Trump responded to McDonnell on Truth Social, telling him to arrest protesters in face masks.",
      "\"Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!\" he wrote.",
      "Starting in the morning, the troops stood shoulder to shoulder, carrying long guns and riot shields as protesters shouted \"shame\" and \"go home.\" After some closely approached the guard members, another set of uniformed officers advanced on the group, shooting smoke-filled canisters into the street.",
      "Minutes later, the L.A. police fired rounds of crowd-control munitions to disperse the protesters, who they said were assembled unlawfully. Much of the group then moved to block traffic on the 101 Freeway until state patrol officers cleared them from the roadway by late afternoon.",
      "Nearby, at least four self-driving Waymo cars were set on fire, sending large plumes of black smoke into the sky and exploding intermittently as the electric vehicles burned. By evening, police had issued an unlawful assembly order shutting down several blocks of downtown Los Angeles.",
      "Flash-bangs echoed out every few seconds into the evening.",
      "How the demonstrations started",
      "The arrival of the National Guard followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighboring Compton.",
      "Federal agents arrested immigrants in LA's fashion district, in a Home Depot parking lot and at several other locations on Friday. The next day, they were staging at a Department of Homeland Security office near another Home Depot in Paramount, which drew out protesters who suspected another raid. Federal authorities later said there was no enforcement activity at that Home Depot.",
      "The weeklong tally of immigrant arrests in the LA area climbed above 100, federal authorities said. Many more were arrested while protesting, including a prominent union leader who was accused of impeding law enforcement.",
      "What are officials saying?",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom requested that Mr. Trump remove the guard members in a letter Sunday afternoon, calling their deployment a \"serious breach of state sovereignty.\" He was in Los Angeles meeting with local law enforcement and officials.",
      "The deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts.",
      "Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass blamed the increasingly aggressive protests on the president's decision to deploy the Guard, calling it a move designed to enflame tensions. They've both urged protesters to remain peaceful.",
      "\"What we're seeing in Los Angeles is chaos that is provoked by the administration,\" Bass said in an afternoon press conference. \"This is about another agenda, this isn't about public safety.\"",
      "But McDonnell, the LAPD chief, said the protests were following a similar pattern for episodes of civil unrest, with things ramping up in the second and third days.",
      "He pushed back against claims by the Trump administration that the LAPD had failed to help federal authorities when protests broke out Friday after a series of immigration raids. His department responded as quickly as it could, and had not been notified in advance of the raids and therefore was not pre-positioned for protests, he said.",
      "Newsom, meanwhile, has repeatedly said that California authorities had the situation under control. He mocked Mr. Trump for posting a congratulatory message to the Guard on social media before troops had even arrived in Los Angeles, and said on MSNBC that Mr. Trump never floated deploying the Guard during a Friday phone call. He called the president a \"stone-cold liar.\"",
      "The admonishments didn't deter the administration.",
      "\"It's a bald-faced lie for Newsom to claim there was no problem in Los Angeles before President Trump got involved,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.",
      "The military has put about 700 Marines on high alert to possibly deploy to Los Angeles, three U.S. officials told CBS News on Monday, two days after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said they could be sent to the city \"if violence continues.\" The Marines could be mobilized in the coming days to support National Guard troops already in the city, the officials said.",
      "When asked what the threshold is for sending in the Marines, Mr. Trump said Sunday: \"The bar is what I think it is.\"",
      "Democratic California Rep. Maxine Waters on Sunday strongly rebuked the president's decision to deploy the National Guard, calling the situation \"outrageous\" and \"horrible\" and adding that she believes Mr. Trump is using L.A., a sanctuary city, as an example.",
      "\"He's using deportation as a way to enhance his position with all those right-wingers out there who do not want this country to be a country of people coming from other places,\" the Democrat told a reporter outside the Metropolitan Detention Center. \"I think he's up to creating martial law.\"",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris also condemned the Trump administration's actions in L.A. on Sunday, calling the deployment of the National Guard \"a dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos.\"",
      "\"In addition to the recent ICE raids in Southern California and across our nation, it is part of the Trump Administration's cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division,\" said Harris, who also previously served as a senator and attorney general of California. \"This Administration's actions are not about public safety \u2014 they're about stoking fear. Fear of a community demanding dignity and due process.\"",
      "Some perspective on the protests",
      "The protests didn't reach the size of past demonstrations that brought the National Guard to Los Angeles, including the Watts and Rodney King riots, and the 2020 protests against police violence, in which Newsom requested the assistance of federal troops.",
      "The last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.",

      "Green has served in Congress since 2019. He had planned to retire at the end of last year instead of seeking a fourth term, but quickly reversed course after Mr. Trump urged him to reconsider.",
      "\"Though I planned to retire at the end of the previous Congress, I stayed to ensure that President Trump's border security measures and priorities make it through Congress,\" Green said. \"By overseeing the border security portion of the reconciliation package, I have done that. After that, I will retire, and there will be a special election to replace me.\"",
      "Green's departure could further eat into House Republicans' narrow majority, depending on when he leaves and when a special election is held in his solidly red district. Republicans can currently afford to lose three votes, but there are three vacancies from Democrats who died this year. Special elections to replace them are scheduled for the fall.",

      "Large-scale but concentrated protests have broken out throughout L.A. County, including in the Westlake District, downtown L.A. and Paramount, following a widespread operation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week. A federal law enforcement official told CBS News that multiple federal law enforcement officers have been injured during confrontations with protesters.",
      "\"In light of these incidents and credible threats of continued violence,\" as the memo said, the president issued instructions to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Attorney General Pam Bondi, to authorize the National Guard to post up in Los Angeles.",

      "The military has put about 700 Marines on high alert to possibly deploy to Los Angeles, three U.S. officials told CBS News.",
      "What did President Trump order regarding the National Guard?",
      "The presidential memorandum Mr. Trump issued Saturday said at least 2,000 National Guard troops would be deployed to Los Angeles, and those soldiers are now arriving in the area. The president has charged National Guard personnel with protecting ICE officials and other federal authorities and employees. They have not been granted the authority to arrest civilians.",
      "\"In light of these incidents and credible threats of continued violence, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby call into federal service members and units of the National Guard under 10 U.S.C. 12406 to temporarily protect ICE and other United States government personnel who are performing federal functions, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property, at locations where protests against these functions are occurring or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments and planned operations,\" the memorandum said.",
      "The memo says the National Guard personnel will be there for 60 days \"or at the discretion of the secretary of defense.\" The majority of National Guard troops being deployed, according to a Defense Department official, are with the California National Guard.",
      "The memo also said the defense secretary may employ \"any other members of the regular Armed Forces as necessary to augment and support the protection of federal functions and property in any number determined appropriate in his discretion.\"",
      "What is Title 10 authority?",
      "The federal code Mr. Trump cited, 10 U.S.C. 12406, says \"the president may call into federal service members and units of the National Guard of any State in such numbers as he considers necessary to repel the invasion, suppress the rebellion, or execute those laws,\" in the event that \"the United States, or any of the commonwealths or possessions, is invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation; there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States; or the president is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "Loyola University law professor and CBS News contributor Jessica Levinson told CBS Los Angeles that Title 10 allows the president to \"call up the National Guard to provide some sort of backup, some personnel assistance, to ICE and other federal law enforcement.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has insisted on social media that Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass have not been up to the job of protecting the city, despite their disagreement.",
      "\"Governor Gavin Newscum and 'Mayor' Bass should apologize to the people of Los Angeles for the absolutely horrible job that they have done, and this now includes the ongoing L.A. riots,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social Sunday morning.",

      "Bass has been critical of the immigration raids and of Mr. Trump's handling of the situation.",
      "\"Angelenos \u2014 don't engage in violence and chaos. Don't give the administration what they want,\" she wrote on X.",
      "Mr. Trump also invoked Title 10 authority to deploy U.S. troops to the U.S.-Mexico border after his inauguration in January.",
      "Does Title 10 give Trump the authority to deploy the National Guard?",
      "Newsom insists that the president \"illegally acted to federalize the National Guard.\"",
      "Loyola's Levinson assessed that the president likely has the authority to call out the National Guard in a merely supportive role as described in the memorandum. Levinson told CBS Los Angeles it's important to \"be careful as to which authority the president is using and what that allows the National Guard to do.\"",
      "\"This is very different than if he does ultimately invoke the Insurrection Act,\" Levinson told CBS Los Angeles. \"That is an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act, which says in general that the military should not act as a domestic law enforcement force or body. And so, what we're looking at here is, does the president keep this at Title 10, which essentially, again allows the National Guard to come in in a supporting role only. Or, are we looking at invoking the Insurrection Act, which is an exception to the general rule that the military really can't act like a domestic police force. That would provide the National Guard with a lot more substantive authority, and that would, I would offer, be something that I don't think historically we've ever seen where you have a president against the wishes of the governor and the mayor sending in the National Guard in to send some potentially extensive functions.\"",
      "A 1971 Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion on the president's authority to use troops, written in light of the Mayday protests, said federal law \"does not prevent the use of troops to protect the functioning of the government by assuring the availability of federal employees to carry out their assigned duties and that troops may therefore be utilized to prevent traffic obstructions designed to prevent the access of employees to their agencies.\" The opinion also says that \"if serious violence occurs beyond the control of police, the president could also, upon proper request, invoke his authority to use troops pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331\u2013334.\"",
      "Steve Vladeck, professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center and an expert on national security law, said in his Substack newsletter \"One First\" that the president's move \"is a big deal\" but also \"not as drastic an escalation (or abuse) as many had feared, at least not yet.\"",
      "Vladeck said the federal code the White House cited \"provides no additional substantive authority that the federal government did not already possess.\"",
      "\"There's nothing these troops will be allowed to do that, for example, the ICE officers against whom these protests have been directed could not do themselves,\" he wrote. \"And because of the Posse Comitatus Act, the reverse is not true; there is plenty that these troops cannot legally do that the ICE officers can.\"",
      "How is Title 10 authority different from the Insurrection Act?",
      "Mr. Trump invoked the Title 10 authority, which allows the president to call the military and National Guard of any state \"as he considers necessary to repel the invasion, suppress the rebellion, or execute those laws.\" Protecting federal law enforcement in California, Levinson suggested, may be a valid use of that authority. Under Title 10, U.S. military personnel are not supposed to act as law enforcement officers against American civilians.",
      "It's a different situation than if he had invoked the Insurrection Act, which goes much further than Title 10. In normal circumstances, the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act barring U.S. soldiers from acting like law enforcement in the U.S.",
      "But the Insurrection Act, first enacted in 1792, allows the president to deploy the military inside the U.S. to help civilian law enforcement with law enforcement duties. The Insurrection Act can be invoked if a state's legislature or sometimes governor requests federal aid to suppress an insurrection in the state. And it can be invoked over a state's objections in order to \"enforce the laws\" of the U.S. or \"suppress rebellion\" when \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion\" make it \"impracticable\" to enforce federal law in that state by the \"ordinary course of judicial proceedings,\" according to the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "The Brennan Center argues the Insurrection Act should be used only in crises, and says the law is too vague in its language, leaving room for abuse. The law doesn't define \"insurrection,\" \"rebellion\" or \"domestic violence,\" they note.",
      "In 1992, former President George H.W. Bush invoked the Insurrection Act to deploy thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quell riots after a jury acquitted police officers who beat Black motorist Rodney King. But he was acting at the request of state officials.",
      "Deploying the National Guard often falls to state governors",
      "Deploying the National Guard to respond to incidents or natural disasters often falls to state governors, as they're in charge of their state's National Guard.",
      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, for instance, deployed the National Guard in 2020 when protests broke out over the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Critics of Walz said he didn't call in the National Guard soon enough.",
      "Governors often deploy the National Guard to the sites of natural disasters like hurricanes and floods.",
      "But while it's not a frequent occurrence, presidents have federalized the National Guard before. Bush federalized the National Guard in 1992, and in 1965, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson federalized Alabama's National Guard in order to protect civil rights demonstrators in Montgomery, without the cooperation of Alabama's governor.",
      "What are the concerns with deploying the National Guard and what happens next?",
      "Vladeck warned that, even though the National Guard's authority is limited in scope for now, there are risks with deploying the soldiers.

    "summary": "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
    "story": [
      "The Joro spider, Asian long-horned beetle and spotted lanternfly have company this summer.",
      "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting continues to spread across the U.S. and can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
      "Asian needle ants were first detected in the U.S. almost a century ago, but the species has continued to expand its reach, primarily throughout the Southeast, and this pest could potentially be deadly to humans, according to Dan Suiter, a professor of urban entomology at the University of Georgia.",
      "\"It injects venom that can harm you. Its sting can be life threatening,\" Suiter recently told the university.",
      "Suiter added that people who have adverse reactions to bee and ant stings are especially vulnerable and could go into anaphylactic shock from the needle ant's sting. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds of being exposed to something you're allergic to, such as a sting, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"If you suffer from anaphylaxis, you should really know what this ant looks like,\" Suiter says. \"And it might be smart to carry an EpiPen.\"",
      "Suiter urged people to be vigilant for these invasive species, especially with ant populations peaking later this summer.",
      "What are Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are technically known as Brachyponera chinensis\u00a0\u2014 roughly translated as \"short, wicked ant from China\" \u2014 but their native range also includes Japan and the Koreas, according to the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "The insect was first discovered in the U.S. in 1932 in Georgia, but has only recently started to \"cause problems in North America after being relatively unnoticed for many years,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "The pest has now been detected all the way from Washington state to Florida, according to the site\u00a0antmaps.org as well as Mississippi State University, and the ant is recently getting more attention in Texas.",
      "Suiter says Asian needle ants are \"sneaky\" because they are less than a quarter of an inch long and are adept at hiding.",
      "\"Unlike many invasive species that tend to colonize areas in the wake of natural or human disturbance, Asian needle ants are capable of invading undisturbed forest areas where they nest under and within logs and other debris, under stones, and in leaf litter,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "Environmental impacts",
      "According to Suiter, Asian needle ants wreak havoc in native environments.",
      "\"They outcompete other ant species that are important to the ecology of that area,\" he says.",
      "Asian needle ants prey on other insects and are capable of displacing ant species that are critical for seed dispersal, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Researchers have documented large decreases in seed dispersal in forests where Asian needle ants are present.",
      "\"Thus, this invasive species could have dramatic, long-term negative effects on forest understory,\" the service says.",
      "What should people do if they see Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are about 0.2 inches in length, and dark brown or black with the end of the antennae and the legs being a lighter orange-brown, the U.S. Forest Service says. Other ant species can look similar, \"so it takes an experienced eye to positively identify them,\" the service says.",
      "Suiter says that you can send a photograph or a specimen to a local University of Georgia Extension office, which can help with identification. The public can also contact a professional to come out and bait for the ants, he says.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service advises people to avoid the pest and to be especially vigilant in areas with logs and rotting or rocks were the ants can nest.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as with many invasive species, it appears Asian needle ants are here to stay,\" the service says.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 21:16:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A private lunar lander from Tokyo-based company ispace was aiming for a touchdown in the unexplored far north with a mini rover.",
    "story": [
      "Four-and-a-half months after launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket, a privately-built Japanese lander attempted to touch down on the moon Thursday, but telemetry indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity moments before communications were lost. The data suggested a mission-ending crash landing.",
      "\"Based on the currently available data, the Mission Control Center has been able to confirm the following: The laser rangefinder used to measure the distance to the lunar surface experienced delays in obtaining valid measurement values,\" ispace, builder of the Resilience lander, said in a statement.",
      "\"As a result, the lander was unable to decelerate sufficiently to reach the required speed for the planned lunar landing. Based on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface.\"",
      "After unsuccessful attempts to re-establish communications, flight controllers in Tokyo uplinked commands to reboot the Resilience lander's flight computer. But there was no response.",
      "\"Given that there is currently no prospect of a successful lunar landing, our top priority is to swiftly analyze the telemetry data we have obtained thus far and work diligently to identify the cause,\" said ispace founder and CEO Takeshi Hakamada.",
      "\"We will strive to restore trust by providing a report of the findings to our shareholders, payload customers, (mission) partners, government officials and all supporters of ispace.\"",
      "The landing attempt came two years after ispace's first lander malfunctioned during the final stages of its descent to the moon, making a similar hard landing. But Hakamada said it was too early to establish any common cause and that engineers needed more time to analyze the telemetry that made it back to Earth.",
      "Carrying cameras, a few science payloads, a tiny rover and even an art project, Resilience   fired its thrusters just after 2:10 p.m. EDT to begin the 66-minute descent from a 62-mile-high circular orbit to touchdown near the center of Mare Frigoris \u2014 the Sea of Cold \u2014 in the moon's northern hemisphere at 60 degrees north latitude.",
      "All appeared to be going smoothly when, around 3:17 p.m. \u2014 the projected landing time \u2014 telemetry suddenly ceased. The last data received indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity and an altitude of 630 feet above the surface.",
      "\"At this moment, we have not yet been able to establish communication with Resilience, but ispace engineers in our Mission Control Center are continuing to work to contact the lander,\" the company posted on X just after 5 p.m.",
      "\"We will share an update with the latest information in a media announcement in the next few hours. Thank you for your patience -- please check back with us soon.\" Three hours later, officials announced the landing failure during a news briefing.",
      "The primary goals of the mission were to land on the moon and deploy the small micro rover Tenacious. The rover, in turn, carried the art project, a tiny model of a Swedish house, designed by artist Mikael Genberg. The traditionally styled red-and-white house measures just 4.7 inches long, 4 inches high and weighs just 3.5 ounces.",
      "Asked why he took on the project, which required years of planning, fundraising and engineering, Genberg said \"we have done as human beings things from time to time that (do not) seemingly have a purpose beyond just being creative.\"",
      "\"The Eiffel Tower, for instance, I mean it's a stupid thing to build,\" he said. \"Today, it has a purpose as maybe the most important thing to make Paris the most visited city in the world.\"",
      "While the \"moonhouse\" could survive for thousands if not millions of years in the airless environment of the moon, its custom paint was expected to fade in the sun's harsh radiation, and lunar dust will slowly coat its surface. Genberg joked that he would happily await an invitation to repaint it.",
      "Ispace is one of a handful of companies attempting to provide non-government transportation services to the moon for a variety of payloads ranging from science instruments to technology demonstrations.",
      "But as it turns out, getting low-cost spacecraft to the moon's surface is extremely difficult.",
      "Ispace tried and\u00a0failed in 2023\u00a0when its first lander ran out of propellant nearing the surface, dropping to a \"hard\" crash landing. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology launched its\u00a0Peregrine lander in January 2024, but the spacecraft suffered a propulsion system leak and never made it to the moon.",
      "Houston-based Intuitive Machines successfully put two landers down on the lunar surface\u00a0in 2024, and again\u00a0earlier this year, but both spacecraft tipped over on touchdown. While each one survived its landing, neither was able to accomplish all of its pre-flight objectives.",
      "Before Thursday, only Firefly Aerospace had successfully touched down and carried out its mission, landing the\u00a0Blue Ghost spacecraft on March 2, 53 years after the final Apollo mission.",
      "Resilience and Blue Ghost\u00a0were launched atop a single SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Jan. 15. The Blue Ghost lander took a direct route to the moon and carried out a successful touchdown, operating for a full two-week lunar \"day.\"",
      "Resilience followed a longer, low-energy trajectory that carried it well past its target, using the moon's gravity to bring it back to an initially elliptical orbit and finally, using its thrusters, to the 62-mile circular orbit that set the stage for descent.",

      "The fungus labeled a \"potential agroterrorism weapon\" in a recent arrest touted by the Trump administration likely originated in North America and is already widely prevalent around the country, a researcher who studied the fungus for the federal government says.",
      "University of Michigan researcher Yunqing Jian and her boyfriend, Zunyong Liu, were charged with trying to smuggle strains of a fungus called Fusarium graminearum into the United States. Jian worked at the University of Michigan, according to officials, and Liu works at a Chinese university. The two have co-authored research into the fungus.",
      "\"I can confirm that the FBI arrested a Chinese national within the United States who allegedly smuggled a dangerous biological pathogen into the country,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said Tuesday in a post\u00a0on X.",
      "According to charging documents in the case, Liu told customs officers he was trying to continue his research with the strains at the University of Michigan lab that Jian worked in, skirting the rules that require paperwork and safeguards to safely import fungi for studies.",
      "F. graminearum is already widely prevalent across the U.S. in native grasses around the country as well as crops, scientists say. It spreads and thrives usually during wet weather, causing a common crop disease called Fusarium head blight or head scab, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service.",
      "\"It's extremely prevalent in North America. It likely arose in North America, so it's not like a foreign agent coming in. And it's already causing a lot of problems in U.S. agriculture,\" Harold Kistler, an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota, told CBS News.",
      "Kistler said scientists believe F. graminearum likely originated in North America because all of its closest relatives have been found on the continent.",
      "\"Graminearum itself is distributed worldwide, and likely because of the distribution of grain from North America worldwide,\" he said.",
      "Kistler previously worked as a researcher for the USDA's Agricultural Research Service, studying fungi like F. graminearum and the crop disease it causes. While at the agency, he co-authored research with Liu and Jian uncovering new molecular clues to how the disease might be mitigated.",
      "\"It's a real problem. The problem is because there's no naturally occurring resistance to the disease. And people have been trying for decades to find resistance. It's just a tough nut to crack,\" Kistler said of the head blight caused by F. graminearum.",
      "Farmers in the U.S. rely on a number of methods to mitigate the risk of F. graminearum, including the use of fungicides, though scientists have worried about the possibility of mutations that could make the fungicides less effective.",
      "\"The fungicides are not cheap. So it's extra cost to farmers. But it's worth it because, without it, their crops could be completely lost. Not only due to yield reduction, but because what grain they may have would be contaminated with these toxins,\" Kistler said.",
      "Billions of dollars were lost to epidemics caused by the fungus in the 1990s, researchers and agriculture officials estimate. The Food and Drug Administration monitors for the toxins that are produced by fungi like F. graminearum, including deoxynivalenol, also called vomitoxin or DON, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea in humans who ingest too much of it.",
      "\"It is not possible to completely avoid the presence of DON in wheat. DON is sometimes found in wheat grown under normal weather conditions, however, the fungus thrives in cool, wet conditions,\" the FDA said in a 2010 advisory to states and grain groups.",
      "Kistler said U.S. distributors also test grain for the presence of the toxins to prevent there being too much of it in the food supply.",
      "\"If it's too high, they will reject it. They won't buy it. Or they will reduce the amount that they'll pay for it. If it's just marginal, they can blend it with grain that doesn't have the toxin to get below the limit of what's considered safe,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Astronomers announced Wednesday they have discovered a massive planet orbiting a tiny star, a bizarre pairing that has stumped scientists.",
      "Most of the stars across the Milky Way are small red dwarfs like TOI-6894, which has only 20% the mass of our sun.",
      "It had not been thought possible that such puny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
      "But an international team of astronomers have detected the unmistakable signature of a gas giant planet orbiting the undersized TOI-6894, according to a study in the journal Nature Astronomy. This makes the star the smallest star yet known to host a gas giant.",
      "The planet has a slightly larger radius than Saturn, but only half its mass. It orbits its star in a little over three days.",
      "The astronomers discovered the planet when searching through more than 91,000 low-mass red dwarfs observed by NASA's TESS space telescope. Its existence was then confirmed by ground-based telescopes, including Chile's Very Large Telescope.",
      "\"The fact that this star hosts a giant planet has big implications for the total number of giant planets we estimate exist in our galaxy,\" study co-author Daniel Bayliss of the UK's Warwick University said in a statement.",
      "Another co-author, Vincent Van Eylen, of University College London, said it was an \"intriguing discovery.\"",
      "\"We don't really understand how a star with so little mass can form such a massive planet!\" he said. \"This is one of the goals of the search for more exoplanets. By finding planetary systems different from our solar system, we can test our models and better understand how our own solar system formed.\"",
      "Planet is unusually cold",
      "The most prominent theory for how planets form is called core accretion.",
      "The process begins when a ring of gas and dust \u2014 called a protoplanetary disc \u2014 which surrounds a newly formed star builds up into a planetary core. This core attracts more gas that forms an atmosphere, eventually snowballing into a gas giant.",
      "Under this theory, it is difficult for low-mass stars to host giant planets because there is not enough gas and dust to begin building a core in the first place.",
      "A rival theory proposes that these planets instead form when their protoplanetary disc becomes gravitationally unstable and breaks up, with the collapsing gas and dust forming a planet.",
      "However neither theory seems to explain the existence of the newly discovered planet, TOI-6894b, the researchers said.",
      "The planet also interests scientists because it is strangely cold.",
      "Most of the gas giants discovered outside our solar system so far have been what are known as \"hot Jupiters,\" where temperatures soar well over 1,000 degrees Celsius. But the newly discovered planet appears to be under 150C, the researchers said.",
      "\"Temperatures are low enough that atmospheric observations could even show us ammonia, which would be the first time it is found in an exoplanet atmosphere,\" said study co-author Amaury Triaud of Birmingham University.",
      "The James Webb space telescope is scheduled to turn its powerful gaze toward the planet in the next year, which could help uncover some more mysteries of this strange planet.",
      "Recent cosmic discoveries",
      "The spotting of the giant planet orbiting the undersized star marks the latest in a string of recent celestial discoveries.",
      "Last month, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive \"Planet Nine\" said they instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, making it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "Also in May, an international team reported that a newly found celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it's shooting out radio waves.",
      "Meanwhile, scientists announced recently that a new planetarium show about the Milky Way helped them unlock one of the solar system's many secrets. Experts at the American Museum of Natural History in New York were fine-tuning a scene about the Oort Cloud that's far beyond Pluto. Scientists have never glimpsed this region, but when museum experts projected their scene onto the planetarium dome, created using simulation data, they saw a spiral shape.",

The show features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker, including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",
      "No matter how striking and beautiful the visuals of the show, the museum was committed to making it scientifically accurate. That's what created the perfect conditions to stumble upon something new, said the museum's Carter Emmart.",

      "Arsia Mons, which dwarfs Earth's tallest volcanoes, and its two neighboring volcanoes are often surrounded by water ice clouds, especially in the early morning. The image released Friday marks the first time one of the volcanoes has been imaged on the planet's horizon, NASA said.",
      "Odyssey has previously captured high-altitude images of the Martian horizon, and to do so, it rotates 90 degrees while in orbit so that its camera can take the picture, NASA said. The spacecraft typically focuses on the upper atmosphere but also studies surface features.",
      "The latest image, captured on May 2, focuses on Arsia Mons, which is roughly twice as tall as Earth's largest volcano, Hawaii's Mauna Loa, which rises 6 miles above the seafloor.",
      "Arsia Mons is the cloudiest of the three volcanoes in the area -- collectively called the Tharsis Mountains -- and the clouds are especially thick when the Red Planet is farthest from the sun, a period called aphelion.",
      "The new snapshot clearly shows the cloud canopy across the Red Planet's equator.",
      "\"We picked Arsia Mons hoping we would see the summit poke above the early morning clouds. And it didn't disappoint,\" said Jonathon Hill, the operations lead for Odyssey's camera, called the Thermal Emission Imaging System, or THEMIS.",
      "The angle of the camera allows scientists to see dust and water ice cloud layers, enabling them to observe changes over the course of seasons.",
      "\"We're seeing some really significant seasonal differences in these horizon images,\" said planetary scientist Michael D. Smith of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"It's giving us new clues to how Mars' atmosphere evolves over time.\"",
      "Launched in 2001, Odyssey has the distinction of being the longest-running spacecraft orbiting another planet.",
      "NASA's Perseverance rover, which\u00a0landed on Mars in 2021, is collecting\u00a0samples for an eventual return\u00a0to Earth from Jezero Crater, an ancient lakebed and river delta that could hold clues to any past microbial life. Last month, Perseverance took a selfie that captured an image of a dust devil popping up about 3 miles behind the rover.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 21:16:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A private lunar lander from Tokyo-based company ispace was aiming for a touchdown in the unexplored far north with a mini rover.",
    "story": [
      "Four-and-a-half months after launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket, a privately-built Japanese lander attempted to touch down on the moon Thursday, but telemetry indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity moments before communications were lost. The data suggested a mission-ending crash landing.",
      "\"Based on the currently available data, the Mission Control Center has been able to confirm the following: The laser rangefinder used to measure the distance to the lunar surface experienced delays in obtaining valid measurement values,\" ispace, builder of the Resilience lander, said in a statement.",
      "\"As a result, the lander was unable to decelerate sufficiently to reach the required speed for the planned lunar landing. Based on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface.\"",
      "After unsuccessful attempts to re-establish communications, flight controllers in Tokyo uplinked commands to reboot the Resilience lander's flight computer. But there was no response.",
      "\"Given that there is currently no prospect of a successful lunar landing, our top priority is to swiftly analyze the telemetry data we have obtained thus far and work diligently to identify the cause,\" said ispace founder and CEO Takeshi Hakamada.",
      "\"We will strive to restore trust by providing a report of the findings to our shareholders, payload customers, (mission) partners, government officials and all supporters of ispace.\"",
      "The landing attempt came two years after ispace's first lander malfunctioned during the final stages of its descent to the moon, making a similar hard landing. But Hakamada said it was too early to establish any common cause and that engineers needed more time to analyze the telemetry that made it back to Earth.",
      "Carrying cameras, a few science payloads, a tiny rover and even an art project, Resilience   fired its thrusters just after 2:10 p.m. EDT to begin the 66-minute descent from a 62-mile-high circular orbit to touchdown near the center of Mare Frigoris \u2014 the Sea of Cold \u2014 in the moon's northern hemisphere at 60 degrees north latitude.",
      "All appeared to be going smoothly when, around 3:17 p.m. \u2014 the projected landing time \u2014 telemetry suddenly ceased. The last data received indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity and an altitude of 630 feet above the surface.",
      "\"At this moment, we have not yet been able to establish communication with Resilience, but ispace engineers in our Mission Control Center are continuing to work to contact the lander,\" the company posted on X just after 5 p.m.",
      "\"We will share an update with the latest information in a media announcement in the next few hours. Thank you for your patience -- please check back with us soon.\" Three hours later, officials announced the landing failure during a news briefing.",
      "The primary goals of the mission were to land on the moon and deploy the small micro rover Tenacious. The rover, in turn, carried the art project, a tiny model of a Swedish house, designed by artist Mikael Genberg. The traditionally styled red-and-white house measures just 4.7 inches long, 4 inches high and weighs just 3.5 ounces.",
      "Asked why he took on the project, which required years of planning, fundraising and engineering, Genberg said \"we have done as human beings things from time to time that (do not) seemingly have a purpose beyond just being creative.\"",
      "\"The Eiffel Tower, for instance, I mean it's a stupid thing to build,\" he said. \"Today, it has a purpose as maybe the most important thing to make Paris the most visited city in the world.\"",
      "While the \"moonhouse\" could survive for thousands if not millions of years in the airless environment of the moon, its custom paint was expected to fade in the sun's harsh radiation, and lunar dust will slowly coat its surface. Genberg joked that he would happily await an invitation to repaint it.",
      "Ispace is one of a handful of companies attempting to provide non-government transportation services to the moon for a variety of payloads ranging from science instruments to technology demonstrations.",
      "But as it turns out, getting low-cost spacecraft to the moon's surface is extremely difficult.",
      "Ispace tried and\u00a0failed in 2023\u00a0when its first lander ran out of propellant nearing the surface, dropping to a \"hard\" crash landing. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology launched its\u00a0Peregrine lander in January 2024, but the spacecraft suffered a propulsion system leak and never made it to the moon.",
      "Houston-based Intuitive Machines successfully put two landers down on the lunar surface\u00a0in 2024, and again\u00a0earlier this year, but both spacecraft tipped over on touchdown. While each one survived its landing, neither was able to accomplish all of its pre-flight objectives.",
      "Before Thursday, only Firefly Aerospace had successfully touched down and carried out its mission, landing the\u00a0Blue Ghost spacecraft on March 2, 53 years after the final Apollo mission.",
      "Resilience and Blue Ghost\u00a0were launched atop a single SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Jan. 15. The Blue Ghost lander took a direct route to the moon and carried out a successful touchdown, operating for a full two-week lunar \"day.\"",
      "Resilience followed a longer, low-energy trajectory that carried it well past its target, using the moon's gravity to bring it back to an initially elliptical orbit and finally, using its thrusters, to the 62-mile circular orbit that set the stage for descent.",

    "summary": "It had not been thought possible that such tiny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
    "story": [
      "Astronomers announced Wednesday they have discovered a massive planet orbiting a tiny star, a bizarre pairing that has stumped scientists.",
      "Most of the stars across the Milky Way are small red dwarfs like TOI-6894, which has only 20% the mass of our sun.",
      "It had not been thought possible that such puny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
      "But an international team of astronomers have detected the unmistakable signature of a gas giant planet orbiting the undersized TOI-6894, according to a study in the journal Nature Astronomy. This makes the star the smallest star yet known to host a gas giant.",
      "The planet has a slightly larger radius than Saturn, but only half its mass. It orbits its star in a little over three days.",
      "The astronomers discovered the planet when searching through more than 91,000 low-mass red dwarfs observed by NASA's TESS space telescope. Its existence was then confirmed by ground-based telescopes, including Chile's Very Large Telescope.",
      "\"The fact that this star hosts a giant planet has big implications for the total number of giant planets we estimate exist in our galaxy,\" study co-author Daniel Bayliss of the UK's Warwick University said in a statement.",
      "Another co-author, Vincent Van Eylen, of University College London, said it was an \"intriguing discovery.\"",
      "\"We don't really understand how a star with so little mass can form such a massive planet!\" he said. \"This is one of the goals of the search for more exoplanets. By finding planetary systems different from our solar system, we can test our models and better understand how our own solar system formed.\"",
      "Planet is unusually cold",
      "The most prominent theory for how planets form is called core accretion.",
      "The process begins when a ring of gas and dust \u2014 called a protoplanetary disc \u2014 which surrounds a newly formed star builds up into a planetary core. This core attracts more gas that forms an atmosphere, eventually snowballing into a gas giant.",
      "Under this theory, it is difficult for low-mass stars to host giant planets because there is not enough gas and dust to begin building a core in the first place.",
      "A rival theory proposes that these planets instead form when their protoplanetary disc becomes gravitationally unstable and breaks up, with the collapsing gas and dust forming a planet.",
      "However neither theory seems to explain the existence of the newly discovered planet, TOI-6894b, the researchers said.",
      "The planet also interests scientists because it is strangely cold.",
      "Most of the gas giants discovered outside our solar system so far have been what are known as \"hot Jupiters,\" where temperatures soar well over 1,000 degrees Celsius. But the newly discovered planet appears to be under 150C, the researchers said.",
      "\"Temperatures are low enough that atmospheric observations could even show us ammonia, which would be the first time it is found in an exoplanet atmosphere,\" said study co-author Amaury Triaud of Birmingham University.",
      "The James Webb space telescope is scheduled to turn its powerful gaze toward the planet in the next year, which could help uncover some more mysteries of this strange planet.",
      "Recent cosmic discoveries",
      "The spotting of the giant planet orbiting the undersized star marks the latest in a string of recent celestial discoveries.",
      "Last month, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive \"Planet Nine\" said they instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, making it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "Also in May, an international team reported that a newly found celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it's shooting out radio waves.",
      "Meanwhile, scientists announced recently that a new planetarium show about the Milky Way helped them unlock one of the solar system's many secrets. Experts at the American Museum of Natural History in New York were fine-tuning a scene about the Oort Cloud that's far beyond Pluto. Scientists have never glimpsed this region, but when museum experts projected their scene onto the planetarium dome, created using simulation data, they saw a spiral shape.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",

      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",
      "The museum contacted the researcher who provided the Oort Cloud data for the show, who was also surprised to see the spiral.",
      "\"It's kind of a freak accident that it actually happened,\" said David Nesvorny with the Southwest Research Institute.",
      "Realizing they'd stumbled on something new, the researchers published their findings earlier this year in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The spiral is \"a striking shift in our understanding of the outer solar system,\" planetary scientist Andre Izidoro with Rice University, who was not involved with the study, said in an email.",
      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",
      "While putting together the planetarium show, the museum's experts weren't expecting a window into the universe's inner workings. The show features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker, including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",
      "No matter how striking and beautiful the visuals of the show, the museum was committed to making it scientifically accurate. That's what created the perfect conditions to stumble upon something new, said the museum's Carter Emmart.",
      "\"You just never know what you're going to find,\" Emmart said.",
      "According to the planetarium, \"Encounters in the Milky Way\" \u2014 narrated by actor Pedro Pascal \u2014 is a \"a time-traveling journey about the cosmic movements that shape our galactic neighborhood.\"",
      "The film, a collaboration of astronomers and science visualization experts, pulls from data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission. The mission is called the \"billion-star survey\" as it aims to map the precise positions and motions of nearly 2 billion stars in our galaxy.",

They can also ask ChatGPT specific questions about the image, such as, keeping with the example of the sweater, \"What material is this made of?\"",
      "Another feature builds on Apple broad selection of emojis by giving users the power to combine and personalize existing emojis to create their own unique expressions. In their presentation, Apple showed how someone could merge the lightbulb emoji with the sloth emoji to indicate they were the last one to get a joke, for example.",

    "story": [
      "New college graduates this year face an especially daunting task \u2014 putting their degrees to work just as \"generative\" artificial intelligence technology like ChatGPT is beginning to change the American workplace.",
      "\"We are entering an entirely new economy, so the knowledge economy that we have been in for the last 50 years or so is on the way out, and a new economy is on the way in,\" Aneesh Raman, Chief Economic Opportunity Officer at LinkedIn, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The impact of AI on Americans recently out of college is already visible across a range of industries and jobs, from technology and finance to media, legal fields and market research. As a result, for the first time\u00a0unemployment among fresh grads recently surpassed the nation's overall jobless rate \u2014 a shift some experts attribute in part to the creeping influence of AI.",
      "\"There are signs that entry-level positions are being displaced by artificial intelligence at higher rates than the roles above them,\" said Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.",
      "With the adoption of AI at work only expected to accelerate, we asked three experts across academia, recruitment and consulting for advice on how new college grads should navigate this new normal. Here's what they said.",
      "Become fluent in AI",
      "Perhaps most important, young job-seekers start using gen-AI tools \u2014 today.",
      "\"Almost anybody in that audience, irrespective of the job that they're pursuing, will be expected to use AI with some facility right away,\" said Joseph Fuller, a professor at Harvard Business School and founder of the Managing the Future of Work\u00a0project, comparing the task to learning how to use Microsoft Office for a previous generation of grads.",
      "To get the ball rolling, experts encourage those who are starting to hunt for work to familiarize themselves with the array of tools at their disposal, such as Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI's ChatGPT. That means learning how to engage with such tools beyond simply using them as a search engine.",
      "\"You want to get in a dialogue with it,\" Fuller said. \"You want to ask it to take different perspectives.\"",
      "Emily Rose McRae, an analyst at research and advisory firm Gartner, said learning how to use AI apps can also be a good way to develop transferable skills. For example, asking AI to summarize documents and then validating its findings to ensure accuracy.",
      "Meanwhile, although AI can be helpful when it comes time to filling out job applications, users should proceed with caution given that recruiters can often spot AI-generated language, experts note. Nearly two-thirds of job candidates today use AI at some point in the application process, according to a\u00a0report from recruitment firm Career Group Companies.",
      "\"If you're using it to write your cover letter and your resume and you did not review it, everyone can tell,\" McRae said.",
      "Another way to gain potentially valuable experience with AI, while also seeking work, is for interview practice. For example, users can ask the chatbot both to provide sample questions they might face in an interview and then rate the quality of their responses.",
      "\"If you are using it as a tool to get your own understanding of self in interviews, you're going to start being leaps ahead of everyone else,\" Raman said.",
      "Hone your soft skills",
      "Experts say that as AI surpasses humans in executing certain tasks \u2014 think actuarial math or corporate compliance, for example \u2014more attention will shift to job candidates' so-called soft skills, such as problem solving and communication.",
      "\"You cannot outsource your thinking to AI,\" LinkedIn's Raman said. \"You have to continue to hone critical thinking and complex strategy thinking.\"",
      "The focus will be less on your pedigree \u2014 where you went to school or even whether you have a college degree \u2014 he added, and more on what he calls the \"5 Cs\": curiosity, compassion, creativity, courage and communication.",
      "To improve their soft skills, Fuller encourages entry-level job candidates to work on turning what they regard as their biggest weakness into a strength. For instance, if you typically shy away from public speaking or talking in groups, push yourself to get comfortable in those situations.",
      "\"The inability to do that is going to be penalized more severely in the work of the future than it has been in the past,\" he said.",
      "The Harvard professor also suggested highlighting examples of advanced social skills directly on your resume to help paint a picture for recruiters of how you can contribute to the workplace.",
      "Choose your employer wisely",
      "Beyond skills development, experts say college grads should be thoughtful about the type of company they choose to work at, knowing that AI could drastically alter the business in the coming years.",
      "\"The most important thing, if you're a new grad, is where you work \u2014 not what you do at the place you're going to work,\" Raman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He encouraged college graduates to seek out employers that are integrating AI responsibly and with respect for their workforce \u2014 as opposed to embracing it chiefly to replace people. Companies that are adapting to what is a major technological shift in real time will typically offer the best opportunities for learning and growth, Fuller said.",
      "In evaluating a prospective employer, young job candidates should try to gain an understanding of how they fit into the company's future. For example, McRae recommends asking hiring managers up front what types of investments the organization is making in its employees and what the room for growth looks like.",
      "\"What are they telling me they care about? What do career paths look like for this role like now? How do you help people develop the skills they need to become experts?\" she said.",
      "In researching companies, McRae also encouraged recent college grads to look for places that offer apprenticeship or rotational programs, which can offer ways to quickly ramp up their knowledge base, especially if traditional entry-level roles are in short supply.",

    "summary": "Meta platforms such as Instagram have marketed AI tools that let users create sexually explicit images of real people.",
    "story": [
      "Meta has removed a number of ads promoting \"nudify\" apps \u2014 AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfakes using images of real people \u2014 after a CBS News investigation found hundreds of such advertisements on its platforms.",
      "\"We have strict rules against non-consensual intimate imagery; we removed these ads, deleted the Pages responsible for running them and permanently blocked the URLs associated with these apps,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "CBS News uncovered dozens of those ads on Meta's Instagram platform, in its \"Stories\" feature, promoting AI tools that, in many cases, advertised the ability to \"upload a photo\" and \"see anyone naked.\" Other ads in Instagram's Stories promoted the ability to upload and manipulate videos of real people. One promotional ad even read \"how is this filter even allowed?\" as text underneath an example of a nude deepfake.",
      "One ad promoted its AI product by using highly sexualized, underwear-clad deepfake images of actors Scarlett Johansson and Anne Hathaway. Some of the ads' URL links redirect to websites that promote the ability to animate real people's images and get them to perform sex acts. And some of the applications charged users between $20 and $80 to access these \"exclusive\" and \"advance\" features. In other cases, an ad's URL redirected users to Apple's app store, where \"nudify\" apps were available to download.",
      "An analysis of the advertisements in Meta's ad library found that there were, at a minimum, hundreds of these ads available across the company's social media platforms, including on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, the Facebook Messenger application and Meta Audience Network \u2014 a platform that allows Meta advertisers to reach users on mobile apps and websites that partner with the company.",
      "According to Meta's own Ad Library data, many of these ads were specifically targeted at men between the ages of 18 and 65, and were active in the United States, European Union and United Kingdom.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told CBS News the spread of this sort of AI-generated content is an ongoing problem and they are facing increasingly sophisticated challenges in trying to combat it.",
      "\"The people behind these exploitative apps constantly evolve their tactics to evade detection, so we're continuously working to strengthen our enforcement,\" a Meta spokesperson said.",
      "CBS News found that ads for \"nudify\" deepfake tools were still available on the company's Instagram platform even after Meta had removed those initially flagged.",
      "Deepfakes are manipulated images, audio recordings, or videos of real people that have been altered with artificial intelligence to misrepresent someone as saying or doing something that the person did not actually say or do.",
      "Last month, President Trump signed into law the bipartisan \"Take It Down Act,\" which, among other things, requires websites and social media companies to remove deepfake content within 48 hours of notice from a victim.",
      "Although the law makes it illegal to \"knowingly publish\" or threaten to publish intimate images without a person's consent, including AI-created deepfakes, it does not target the tools used to create such AI-generated content.",
      "Those tools do violate platform safety and moderation rules implemented by both Apple and Meta on their respective platforms.",
      "Meta's advertising standards policy says, \"ads must not contain adult nudity and sexual activity. This includes nudity, depictions of people in explicit or sexually suggestive positions, or activities that are sexually suggestive.\"",
      "Under Meta's \"bullying and harassment\" policy, the company also prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company says its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share nonconsensual intimate imagery.",
      "Apple's guidelines for its app store explicitly state that \"content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy\" is banned.",
      "Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell University's tech research center, has been studying the surge in AI deepfake networks marketing on social platforms for more than a year. He told CBS News in a phone interview on Tuesday that he'd seen thousands more of these ads across Meta platforms, as well as on platforms such as X and Telegram, during that period.",
      "Although Telegram and X have what he described as a structural \"lawlessness\" that allows for this sort of content, he believes Meta's leadership lacks the will to address the issue, despite having content moderators in place.",
      "\"I do think that trust and safety teams at these companies care. I don't think, frankly, that they care at the very top of the company in Meta's case,\" he said. \"They're clearly under-resourcing the teams that have to fight this stuff, because as sophisticated as these [deepfake] networks are \u2026 they don't have Meta money to throw at it.\"",
      "Mantzarlis also said that he found in his research that \"nudify\" deepfake generators are available to download on both Apple's app store and Google's Play store, expressing frustration with these massive platforms' inability to enforce such content.",
      "\"The problem with apps is that they have this dual-use front where they present on the app store as a fun way to face swap, but then they are marketing on Meta as their primary purpose being nudification. So when these apps come up for review on the Apple or Google store, they don't necessarily have the wherewithal to ban them,\" he said.",
      "\"There needs to be cross-industry cooperation where if the app or the website markets itself as a tool for nudification on any place on the web, then everyone else can be like, 'All right, I don't care what you present yourself as on my platform, you're gone,'\" Mantzarlis added.",
      "CBS News has reached out to both Apple and Google for comment as to how they moderate their respective platforms. Neither company had responded by the time of writing.",
      "Major tech companies' promotion of such apps raises serious questions about both user consent and about online safety for minors. A CBS News analysis of one \"nudify\" website promoted on Instagram showed that the site did not prompt any form of age verification prior to a user uploading a photo to generate a deepfake image.",
      "Such issues are widespread. In December, CBS News' 60 Minutes reported on the lack of age verification on one of the most popular sites using artificial intelligence to generate fake nude photos of real people.",
      "Despite visitors being told that they must be 18 or older to use the site, and that \"processing of minors is impossible,\" 60 Minutes was able to immediately gain access to uploading photos once the user clicked \"accept\" on the age warning prompt, with no other age verification necessary.",
      "Data also shows that a high percentage of underage teenagers have interacted with deepfake content. A March 2025 study conducted by the children's protection nonprofit Thorn showed that among teens, 41% said they had heard of the term \"deepfake nudes,\" while 10% reported personally knowing someone who had had deepfake nude imagery created of them.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Jun 2025 20:33:21 -0400",
    "summary": "Gov. Gavin Newsom posted on social media that \"Commandeering a state's National Guard without consulting the Governor of that state is illegal and immoral.\"",
    "story": [
      "California sued the Trump administration on Monday after the state's National Guard was deployed to respond to protesters in Los Angeles, calling the move an \"unprecedented power grab.\"",
      "In the lawsuit filed in federal court, attorneys for the state said President Trump \"unlawfully bypassed\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom by putting National Guard troops under federal control without the governor's permission.",
      "The troops were deployed to protect federal property and personnel under a law that lets the president call the National Guard into federal service during a \"rebellion.\" But California's lawsuit argues this law does not apply to the tense protests that Los Angeles has faced over Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations.",
      "\"At no point in the past three days has there been a rebellion or an insurrection. Nor have these protests risen to the level of protests or riots that Los Angeles and other major cities have seen at points in the past, including in recent years,\" the lawsuit reads.",
      "The lawsuit also states that the law cited by the Trump administration \u2014 Section 12406 \u2014 explicitly requires orders to call up the National Guard to go through governors, who normally control their own National Guard forces.",
      "The suit argues the use of National Guard forces has stoked \"fear and terror\" and \"heightened tensions with protesters and residents.\" It also states that local police have handled any violence at the protests effectively.",
      "\"One of the cornerstones of our Nation and our democracy is that our people are governed by civil, not military, rule,\" the suit reads. \"The Founders enshrined these principles in our Constitution \u2014 that a government should be accountable to its people, guided by the rule of law, and one of civil authority, not military rule.\"",
      "Separately, the Trump administration has activated 700 active-duty Marines to assist the National Guard.",
      "\"Donald Trump is putting fuel on this fire. Commandeering a state's National Guard without consulting the Governor of that state is illegal and immoral,\" Newsom wrote Sunday on X. \"California will be taking him to court.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Newsom have engaged in an escalating war of words that on Monday included Mr. Trump voicing support for arresting Newsom.",
      "\"I would do it if I was Tom,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to his \"border czar\" Tom Homan, the White House executive associate director of enforcement and removal operations. \"I think it's great. Gavin likes publicity. But I think it would be a great thing.\"",
      "Homan later told CBS News' John Dickerson that \"there's no intention to arrest\" Newsom.",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Monday that the federalization of the California National Guard deprives the state of resources needed to protect citizens, particularly in the event of an emergency \u2014 an argument also raised in Monday's lawsuit. In an interview Monday with CBS News' Major Garrett on \"The Takeout,\" Bonta said the basis of the state's lawsuit is that Mr. Trump essentially doesn't have the authority to send in the troops.",
      "\"The authority that the president cites to only allow for the deployment of the National Guard by the president when there's an invasion by a foreign nation, which there's not, when there's a rebellion to overturn leadership of the United States of America, which there's not, or when the regular forces of the federal government cannot execute the law, which is also not present,\" Bonta said.",
      "When asked about what he would say regarding the argument that the lawsuit is impacting the president's ability to protect public safety, the attorney general said on \"The Takeout\" that California has very large and well-resourced law enforcement agencies and departments that are capable of handling the situation in Los Angeles, adding that most of the protesting has been peaceful except some instances of violence.",
      "\"If the National Guard is ever needed, the governor can call them in,\" Bonta told Garrett. \"But the president calling in the Marines, the president calling in the National Guard, it only stokes the flames, increases tension, creates unneeded provocation.\"",
      "National Guard troops were sent to downtown Los Angeles on Sunday amid a weekend marked by protests and at times violent clashes between law enforcement and protesters. The unrest began following large-scale immigration enforcement operations in the area on Friday.",
      "Images captured by CBS Los Angeles showed members of the National Guard using what appeared to be tear gas and rounds of non-lethal ammunition after a crowd gathered near the Metropolitan Detention Center.",
      "As of midday Monday, 53 people have been arrested, officials said. The LAPD said it had arrested 31 people on a range of charges, including failure to disperse, objects and fireworks thrown at officers, looting and arson. California Highway Patrol had arrested 17 people and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department made five arrests, the agencies told CBS News.",
      "Mr. Trump announced Saturday night that he would deploy the Guard in response to the protests. In a social media post on Sunday, he criticized Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. Mr. Trump called the protesters \"troublemakers and insurrectionists.\"",
      "Newsom, in his own social media posts, accused Mr. Trump of \"escalating the situation,\" and called the National Guard deployment \"purposefully inflammatory.\"",
      "He requested that the federal government rescind the deployment of troops to L.A. in a letter addressed to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, saying there was \"no need\" for the National Guard.",
      "Newsom's office confirmed on Saturday that he spoke with Mr. Trump for about 40 minutes, although it's unclear if they spoke before or after Mr. Trump announced the deployment.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson said immigration enforcement operations have resulted in the arrest of a \"domestic abuser\" and a \"child rapist.\"",

    "summary": "More than 2,500 children of U.S. servicemen born in Vietnam were flown to the United States in the chaotic final days of the Vietnam War.",
    "story": [
      "In April 1975, during the chaotic final days of the Vietnam War, there were some 3,000 babies in the country that had been fathered by U.S. servicemen.",
      "\"Dad felt very responsibly that he wanted to get those babies out,\" Steve Ford told CBS News \u2014 \"dad\" in this case being then-President Gerald Ford.",
      "\"The word was once the North got into Saigon, that these babies would be possibly slaughtered, killed,\" Steve Ford said.",
      "President Ford moved urgently, and Operation Babylift\u00a0was born, flying more than 2,500 of those children to the United States.",
      "But the first flight in the operation crashed just minutes after takeoff, killing 78 of the nearly 250 children on board. The president was undeterred, and the flights resumed the very next day, filled with cardboard file boxes that had been repurposed into makeshift cradles.",
      "\"Dad met the first plane, and one of the best pictures for me is seeing him carrying that first baby off the plane,\" Steve Ford said.",
      "Thuy Williams, then just 5 years old, was on that flight.",
      "\"There's actually a picture of me reading a book to the little kid next to me and I just look calm,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Williams had originally been placed on the first flight \u2014 the one that crashed \u2014 but was pulled off at the last moment due to overcrowding. Her mother, who brought her to the plane, believed she had died in the wreckage. It wasn't until decades later that the two were reunited in Vietnam.",
      "Even beyond the tragedy of the crash, the mission has drawn some criticism over the years. Not all of the children airlifted were orphans. Some had been temporarily placed in orphanages by parents desperate to get them to safety, believing they might be reunited someday. In a small number of cases, children were evacuated without parental or family consent, fueling debate over the ethics of the operation.",
      "\"My mom gave me up to save my life,\" Williams said when asked about some of the problems with the operation. \"A lot of those kids, their parents gave them up to save their lives. Yes, I know that some were taken that weren't supposed to, that parents expected to get their kids back, but the reality is, what would their life have been like if their parents did get them back, you know? They wouldn't have had the opportunities that they had here in the U.S.\"",
      "Steve Ford acknowledged, \"Anytime you have a mission like this, is it gonna be 100%? Absolutely not. That's- this is war. You're trying to do the best you can very quickly.\"",
      "\"I can not imagine what that mother would have to process to make that decision,\" he said of women like Williams' mother, who gave their kids up to get them out of the country.",
      "Williams was adopted by a couple in Portland, Oregon, and said she began to consider herself an American \"pretty much probably right away.\"",
      "\"When your first memories are seeing people killed, those are things you wanna leave behind,\" she said.",
      "Ten years after her arrival in the U.S., Williams made the under-18 National Soccer Team. She then spent eight years in the Army, built a construction company and started a nonprofit that takes kids to Africa.",
      "To this day, she coaches soccer, track and lacrosse, and she's so close to her players that she's officiated weddings for two of them.",
      "\"I understand the opportunities that I had being here in the U.S. I just wanted to serve,\" she said.",
      "Steve Ford and Williams recently had a chance to meet at the Gerald Ford Museum.",
      "\"My dad would love her story. It would bring tears to his eye to see what she's done with her life,\" Steve Ford said.",
      "\"Someone said to me, I'm not sure they'd come get those babies today. I think back on dad. He had the moral clarity to go save those babies. And we had an obligation to do something, to help them,\" he added.",

      "Kyiv \u2014 Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that a new prisoner exchange with Russia was underway. He said it would take place in several rounds over the \"coming days,\" announcing that Kyiv had received the first group of captives from Russia.",
      "The news of another prisoner swap, agreed to by the warring neighbors in direct talks that have failed to yield any significant progress toward a broader easing of the war sparked by Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion in 2022, came after Moscow launched a drone attack on a Ukrainian air base in the country's far west.",
      "\"Today, an exchange began, which will continue in several stages over the coming days,\" Zelenskyy said on social media. \"Among those we are bringing back now are the wounded, the severely wounded, and those under the age of 25,\" he added.",

      "The exchange of prisoners has been a solitary positive development from those direct talks, in which the two sides remain otherwise entrenched in their respective demands over conditions to halt the fighting. On the roughly 600-mile front line in the ground war, stretching from eastern Ukraine's northern to southern borders, the fighting has only intensified in recent weeks.",
      "Moscow claimed Monday to have gained even more ground in eastern Ukraine, and it did so after launching a massive round of attack drones in retaliation for Kyiv's blistering sneak drone attack on Russian military aircraft last week.",

      "Moscow fired a record 479 drones at Ukraine, including on the western region of Rivne that has been largely spared from attacks, Kyiv said Monday, while claiming an attack on a Russian factory hundreds of miles east of Moscow.",

      "Moscow said Monday its strikes are continued retaliation for a bold Ukrainian attack on its bomber planes parked deep inside Russia, including in Siberia, that infuriated the Kremlin.",

      "\"Enemy air strikes were recorded in 10 spots,\" the Ukrainian air force said.",
      "The mayor of the western city of Rivne, Oleksandr Tretyak, called it \"the largest attack\" on the region since the start of the war.",
      "Regional governor Oleksandr Koval said 70 buildings \u2014 including private houses and a nursery \u2014 were damaged in the attack.",
      "Russia said it had targeted an airfield near the village of Dubno in the Rivne region.",
      "\"This is one of the retaliatory strikes against terrorist attacks by the Kyiv regime on Russian military airfields,\" its defense ministry said.",

There were no reports by Ukrainian media of significant damages to the facility.",

      "\"The passengers are expected to return to their home countries,\" the Israel Defense Ministry previously said on social media. The ministry said any aid on the ship would be sent to Gaza.",
      "The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organized the largely symbolic effort to deliver humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip and protest Israel's blockade and wartime conduct in the Palestinian territory, claimed the activists had been \"kidnapped by Israeli forces,\" and it released pre-recorded messages from them.",

      "\"I have instructed the IDF to act so that the 'Madeleine' flotilla does not reach Gaza,\" Katz said in a statement from his office.\"To the antisemitic Greta and her fellow Hamas propagandists \u2014 I will say this clearly: You should turn back, because you will not make it to Gaza.\"",
      "Thunberg was among about 12 activists aboard the Madleen, which was operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition. The coalition says it is a grassroots movement working to end Israel's blockade of Gaza.",
      "\"Greta Thunberg is currently on her way to Israel, safe and in good spirits,\" Israel's Foreign Ministry said in one of a series of posts on the interception Monday, accompanied by a photo of a lifejacket-clad Thunberg smiling as a member of the Israeli forces offers her some food.",
      "The ministry posted a number of photos and videos showing the flotilla boat's crew sitting on a smaller vessel as water and sandwiches are offered around. In one post, with a video of the activists, the ministry dismissively labels the group's commandeered vessel a \"selfie yacht,\" and adds: \"The show is over.\"",
      "\"Game of Thrones\" actor Liam Cunningham was initially believed to have been on the Madleen, too, but he did not take part in the voyage after helping to load the vessel before its departure from Catania, on the Italian island of Sicily.",
      "According to the Flotilla, two of those on board the ship were Turkish nationals, and the foreign ministry in Turkey on Monday blasted the Israeli intervention as \"a clear violation of international law,\" calling it a \"heinous attack\" on the aid boat.",
      "The ministry had earlier said that Israel's \"aggressive and lawless attitude will not silence the voices defending human values,\" calling the flotilla's actions part of the international community's \"justified reaction to Israel's genocidal policies, which use hunger as a weapon in Gaza and prevent the delivery of humanitarian aid.\"",
      "The vessel departed from Sicily on June 1.",
      "On Sunday, in a social media post, the coalition accused Israel of jamming its communications as they approached, about 160 nautical miles from Gaza.",
      "\"Help us to break the siege,\" the post said.",

      "An attempt last month by Freedom Flotilla to reach Gaza by sea failed after another of the group's vessels was attacked by two drones while sailing in international waters off Malta.

      "\"The majority of our decision-making is based on science,\" said Dr. Gbolahan Okubadejo, an orthopedic spine surgeon located in the New York City metro area. \"We do a lot of research \u2026 a lot about decision-making is research-based.\"",

      "They can have a variety of specialties and certifications, with a focus on manual spinal adjustments and other musculoskeletal issues.",

      "A chiropractor\u2019s methods are generally less invasive than a surgeon's.",
      "\"The ultimate goal of chiropractic is to help your body move and function the way it\u2019s meant to,\" Tori Hartline, a chiropractor at Sunlife Chiropractic in Frisco, Texas, told Fox News Digital. \"When your spine is out of alignment, it puts unnecessary pressure on muscles, causing them to tighten up.\"",
      "\"The ultimate goal of chiropractic is to help your body move and function the way it\u2019s meant to.\"",

      "These small stressors might not seem like a big deal at first, but when they continue long-term and are unaddressed, they can lead to more serious injuries and chronic pain, Hartline warned.",

      "Radiating pain may warrant a visit to an orthopedic specialist, experts say. (iStock)",
      "That's why he encourages patients not to avoid a chiropractor altogether, but to use a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to care.",
      "\"But if it's just primarily pain, then in those cases, if a patient has an interest in chiropractic, I wouldn't discourage it,\" Okubadejo said. \"If it's something mild to moderate, strictly musculoskeletal, in that case, it's safe.\"",

      "\"I think if a chiropractor isn't linked to a spine surgery practice or doesn't have a strong relationship and maybe takes too much on, on their own, that could be potentially harmful,\" Okubadejo noted.",
      "The best \"green flag,\" he said, \"is someone who's very transparent, who explains everything to you, someone who shows you the imaging, who takes on the role as an educator \u2026 and has a very clear treatment plan.\"",

    "story": [
      "Fox News correspondent Jeff Paul has the latest on the Colorado community's response to the Boulder attack\u00a0on 'America's Newsroom.'",
      "More than 100 Democrats voted against a House GOP-led resolution to condemn the accused terror attack in Boulder, Colorado.",
      "It passed 280-113, with 75 Democrats joining Republicans to vote for the bill. Six lawmakers, five Democrats and one Republican, voted \"present.\"",
      "The legislation was introduced by Rep. Gabe Evans, R-Colo., last week in response to the attack. But Democrat lawmakers made clear they were opposed to language in the resolution that they felt was politically charged.",
      "In addition to condemning the attack, Evans' resolution also appeared to rebuke blue-leaning sanctuary jurisdictions that were at odds with federal immigration authorities, and he condemned illegal immigrants who overstay their visas as well.",
      "A second bill, led by Reps. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., and Joe Neguse, D-Colo., more broadly condemned the rise in antisemitic attacks in the U.S. That legislation netted much wider bipartisan support, passing 400-0, with just two lawmakers voting \"present.\"",

      "Police work at the scene after an attack that injured multiple people in Boulder, Colo., on June 1, 2025. (Reuters | Fox News Digital)",
      "But Evans' resolution more specifically noted that the case of terror suspect Mohammed Sabry Soliman, who overstayed a tourist visa and a subsequent work authorization, \"demonstrates the dangers of not removing from the country aliens who fail to comply with the terms of their visas.\"",
      "The Egyptian national is facing federal charges after allegedly attempting to set fire to peaceful demonstrators who were protesting Hamas' continued possession of Israeli hostages in Gaza.",
      "The Trump administration has vowed that he and his family will be deported from the U.S.",
      "Evans' resolution also \"affirms that free and open communication between State and local law enforcement and their Federal counterparts remains the bedrock of public safety and is necessary in preventing terrorist attacks\" and it \"expresses gratitude to law enforcement officers, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel, for protecting the homeland.\"",
      "It comes as Democrat-controlled cities like Los Angeles and Nashville, Tennessee, have seen their leaders criticize the Trump administration's ICE crackdown.",
      "The Trump administration's handling of anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles has spurred an outpouring of scorn from Democrat officials, particularly the decision to send National Guard troops in to break up the demonstrations.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., criticized Evans' resolution in comments to reporters on Monday.",
      "Rep. Gabe Evans led the resolution. (Tierney L. Cross/Getty Images)",
      "\"Who is this guy? He's not seriously concerned with combating antisemitism in America. This is not a serious effort,\" Jeffries said. \"Antisemitism is a scourge on America. It shouldn't be weaponized politically.\"",
      "Jeffries also called Evans \"a joke.\"",
      "Evans responded on X, \"I served our nation in uniform in the Middle East, as a cop in Colorado, & now as a Congressman. This wildly offensive sentiment from Democrat\u2019s Leader is why antisemitism persists. The Left is unserious about finding real solutions.\"",
      "Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., who is Jewish, also criticized Evans' resolution.",
      "MEET THE TRUMP-PICKED LAWMAKERS GIVING SPEAKER JOHNSON A FULL HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE",
      "\"You weren't here, Mr. Evans, last term, but there were about 10 antisemitism resolutions that effectively said the same thing solely to score political points. We Jews are sick and tired of being used as pawns,\" Goldman said during debate on the bill.",

      "But Van Drew, who is leading a bipartisan resolution that similarly condemns antisemitism but does not discuss immigration, defended Evans' measure.",
      "\"Yes, it is different than mine. Mine focused purely on antisemitism here in the world. But he brings up a valid point not only for Jews, but for many innocent victims. Whether it was Laken Riley, whether it was the women that were raped, the women and men that were killed, those that were beaten, those that were hurt, who were in law enforcement. Illegal immigration is not a good thing,\" Van Drew said.",
      "The two lawmakers who voted \"present\" on Van Drew's resolution were Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.",
      "Greene wrote on X after the vote, \"Antisemitic hate crimes are wrong, but so are all hate crimes. Yet Congress never votes on hate crimes committed against white people, Christians, men, the homeless, or countless others. Tonight, the House passed two more antisemitism-related resolutions, the 20th and 21st I\u2019ve voted on since taking office. Meanwhile, Americans from every background are being murdered \u2014 even in the womb \u2014 and Congress stays silent.\"",

    "story": [
      "Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin sounded off on a Biden-appointed federal judge who could decide Wednesday morning that a plane carrying illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes to South Sudan has to return.",
      "The Trump administration on Friday announced it had returned Kilmar Abrego Garcia \u2013 a Salvadoran migrant and alleged MS-13 member \u2013 to the U.S., months after he was deported to El Salvador in what officials later acknowledged was an administrative error.",
      "It is unclear whether Abrego Garcia\u2019s return signals a shift in policy or is merely a one-off. The administration paired the announcement with news of a new federal indictment charging him with crimes related to transporting undocumented immigrants in the U.S.",
      "Still, the case has sparked fresh questions about the administration\u2019s willingness to comply with other court orders requiring the return of deported migrants \u2013 whether individuals or entire classes \u2013 or mandating that certain individuals remain in U.S. custody long enough to challenge their removals to so-called \"third countries.\"",
      "It also undercut the Trump administration's assertion earlier this year that it is powerless to order El Salvador to return a prisoner or facilitate the return of migrants sent to El Salvador \u2013 something judges have attempted somewhat unsuccessfully to square in various court proceedings this year.",
      "Here is what to know about those cases so far.",

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)",
      "Daniel Lozano-Camargo, previously referred to in court documents as \"Cristian,\" is a 20-year-old Venezuelan immigrant deported in March under the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime law invoked by Trump to quickly remove hundreds of immigrants and send them to El Salvador to be detained in the country\u2019s maximum-security CECOT prison.",
      "U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher\u00a0ruled in April that his deportation violated a settlement agreement that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stuck last year with a group of young asylum seekers, including Lozano-Camargo, who had entered the country as an unaccompanied child and later sought asylum.",
      "Under that agreement, DHS agreed not to deport the immigrants until their asylum cases were fully adjudicated in court, which she said had not happened in Lozano-Camargo\u2019s case prior to his removal.",
      "Gallagher, a Trump appointee, ruled that his deportation was a breach of contract. In ordering his return to the U.S., she stressed that her ruling had nothing to do with the strength of his asylum request in question \u2013 a nod to the two apparent low-level drug offenses he had racked up prior to his removal \u2013 but simply his ability to have his asylum request adjudicated in court under the agreement with DHS.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\u00a0upheld that decision late last month, clearing the way for Gallagher to set a formal timeline for the government to comply with facilitating the return. DHS officials told the court last week in a status update that Lozano-Camargo remains held at CECOT.",

      "Prisoners at CECOT are seen in a cell at the Salvadorian maximum-security detention facility on April 4, 2025. (Alex Pe\u00f1a/Getty Images)",
      "The Trump administration returned a mistakenly deported Guatemalan native to U.S. soil last week, marking the\u00a0first known instance of the Trump administration complying with a judge\u2019s orders to return an individual removed from the U.S. based on erroneous information.",
      "The immigrant, referred to in court documents only as \"O.C.G.,\" was deported to Mexico in March without due process and despite his stated fears of persecution in the country, according to U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy, who ordered his return.",
      "Murphy noted that O.C.G. had previously been held for ransom and\u00a0raped in Mexico but was not afforded the chance to assert those fears prior to his removal \u2013 a right afforded to him by U.S. and international law.",
      "ICE officials told the court earlier this month that they were working to secure his return. Last week, attorneys for O.C.G. told Fox News he had been returned to the U.S. on Wednesday via commercial flight.",
      "Unlike the individuals deported to CECOT, however, O.C.G. had not been detained in Mexico after he was deported, which could have eased some of the hurdles for the administration in returning him.",
      "The Trump administration relented for the first time last week and complied with a federal judge's order to return a deported migrant removed from the U.S. based on erroneous information. (Getty Images)",
      "Murphy ordered the Trump administration to keep in U.S. custody a group of six immigrants who were deported to South Sudan without due process or notice until they have the opportunity to conduct so-called \"reasonable fear interviews,\" or a chance to explain to U.S. officials any fear of persecution or torture, should they be released into South Sudanese custody.",
      "Currently, all six individuals remain detained at a U.S. military base in Djibouti \u2013 the only U.S. military base currently operational in all of Africa \u2013 and where ICE officials tasked with keeping them in custody cited recent health risks, including from malaria exposure, searing heat, nearby burn pits as well as the \"imminent danger\" of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen.",
      "In response, Murphy reiterated earlier this month that the individuals need not remain in South Sudan and that the U.S. is free to move them to another location, including back to the U.S., to more safely carry out these proceedings. It is unclear whether the government has plans to relocate the group.",

      "Judge James Boasberg, chief judge of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, attends a panel discussion at the annual ABA Spring Antitrust Meeting in Washington, D.C. (AFP/Getty Images)",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg last week ordered the Trump administration to provide all non-citizens deported from the U.S. to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador to be afforded the opportunity to seek habeas relief in court and challenge their alleged gang status \u2013 the latest in a heated fight centered on Trump's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport certain migrants.",
      "Boasberg reiterated in the 69-page ruling that due process includes providing migrants deported to CECOT prior notice of removal, as well as so-called habeas protections, or the right to challenge their removals in court. He gave the Trump administration until Wednesday to submit to the court plans for how it will go about providing the habeas relief to plaintiffs held at CECOT.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"Defendants plainly deprived these individuals of their right to seek habeas relief before their summary removal from the United States \u2014 a right that need not itself be vindicated through a habeas petition,\" Boasberg said in his order.",
      "The order is almost certain to spark fierce backlash from the Trump administration, which has previously railed against Boasberg's earlier rulings and the temporary restraining order handed down in March. Boasberg later found probable cause to hold the administration in contempt of court, citing the government's \"willful disregard\" for his March 15 emergency order, which ordered the administration to halt its deportation under the Alien Enemies Act, and immediately return all planes to the U.S., which did not happen.",

That\u2019s where identity protection services come in.

      "6) Request an IRS Identity Protection PIN: Prevent fraudulent tax filings using your SSN by setting up an\u00a0Identity Protection PIN with the IRS. This six-digit number adds another layer of protection during tax season.",
      "7) Review your Social Security earnings record: Log in to your\u00a0\"My Social Security\" account regularly to review your earnings history and benefits. This helps ensure your information hasn\u2019t been altered or compromised.",

      "Glide underwater with CudaJet and make the ocean your playground. Kurt Knutsson discusses the redesigned tech that might be your next big thrilling adventure.",
      "If you've ever dreamed of gliding underwater with the freedom of a dolphin, the CudaJet might be the gadget for you. Unlike most underwater propulsion systems that strap onto your arms or legs, the CudaJet is worn like a backpack, giving you a hands-free way to cruise beneath the surface. It's a fresh approach that feels a lot more natural and comfortable, especially for longer swims.",
      "The CudaJet's story started almost seven years ago. Back then, it was just a prototype called the Cuda, a passion project by British designer Archie O'Brien during his final year at Loughborough College of Art and Design, now known as Loughborough Design School. Archie wanted something lighter and faster than anything else out there, and in 2023 his vision became reality with the first commercial CudaJet.",
      "Now, the CudaJet has been redesigned with a longer battery life, lighter build and updated features, making it even more appealing to underwater adventure seekers.",

      "CudaJet underwater jetpack: How it works and what\u2019s new",
      "So, what's it like to use? The main unit is a dual-jet-drive pack that attaches to a padded neoprene harness, which you wear on your torso. You control everything with a hardwired, trigger-style remote that lets you adjust your speed and keep an eye on the battery level. One of the biggest improvements for 2025 is the battery. While the original model provided approximately 40 minutes of underwater fun for every 75-minute charge, the latest version extends that time to a full 90 minutes per charge. That's more than double the original runtime, so you can explore even more on a single outing.",
      "CudaJet can take you down to a maximum depth of 131 feet, and it delivers about 88 pounds of thrust. That translates to a top speed of roughly 10 feet per second, or about 6.7 mph. Now, that might not sound fast on land, but underwater it's a whole different story. The company likes to point out that at 10 feet per second, the drag force on your body is about the same as flying through air at nearly 200 mph. It's an exhilarating experience that feels powerful and smooth.",
      "The 2025 redesign also trimmed some weight from the original, reducing it from approximately 33 pounds to just over 30 pounds, including the harness. The harness itself comes in four sizes, so you can get a fit that feels just right. Safety is clearly a priority as well. Each CudaJet ships with a factory-set safety depth of about 10 feet, which you can adjust up to the full 131 feet if you're feeling adventurous. If you ever go past your set limit, the motor cuts out and floats you right back to the surface. The controller's full-color display keeps you updated on your speed, battery and depth at all times.",

For those who want something even more exclusive, there's a Founder's Edition with lifetime product access, in-water training with the founder and a lifetime warranty, but only 20 of those are being made.",

The process involves custom-fitting the harness to your size and selecting your preferred finish, all of which are handcrafted in the U.K. Due to this approach, there is typically a wait time before delivery, which varies depending on demand and the customization options.

      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Online scams thrive on the urgency and fear of their victims. If you've ever been a victim of a scam, you\u2019d know that bad actors often try to rush you into taking action by creating a sense of fear. A scammer may call you impersonating a government agency and claim your Social Security number has been linked to drug trafficking.",
      "A phishing email might ask you to update your tax details or claim you\u2019ve won a lottery or a free product, all to get you to click a malicious link.",
      "A more effective tactic scammers use is sending fake login alerts. These are warnings that someone has logged into your account, prompting you to take immediate action. This method works well because legitimate services like Google, Apple, Netflix and Facebook also send these types of notifications when someone, including you, logs in from a new device. It can be tricky to tell the difference.",

      "How login alert scams work and why they\u2019re so effective",
      "Scammers often pose as login alerts from Google, Apple, Meta or even your bank, complete with official-looking logos, because fear is effective. But not every alert is a scam. In many cases, these notifications are legitimate and can help you detect unauthorized access to your accounts. Let\u2019s focus on the scam side first.",

      "One such email used a clean layout with minimal text. It avoided the usual scare tactics and stuck to a simple message. But that is not always the case. A common red flag in phishing attempts is the tendency to overload the email with unnecessary details. These messages often include cluttered formatting, excessive explanations and an increasing number of typos or design errors. One phishing email simply gets to the point:",

      "What\u2019s concerning now is that poor grammar is no longer a reliable sign of a scam. Thanks to AI, even those with limited English skills can write emails that sound polished and professional. As a result, many phishing messages today read just like legitimate emails from trusted companies.",
      "Receiving a phishing email is not the real issue. The real problem starts when you click on it. Most of these emails contain links that lead to fake login pages, designed to look exactly like platforms such as Facebook, Google or your bank.",
      "If you enter your credentials there, they go directly to the scammer. In some cases, simply clicking the link can trigger a malware download, especially if your browser is outdated or your device lacks proper security.

      "For instance, a legit Google security alert might say, \"We detected a login from a new sign-in to your Google Account on a Pixel 6 Pro device. If this was you, you don't need to do anything. If not, we'll help you secure your account.\"\u00a0\u00a0It may include a \"Check activity\" button, but that link always redirects to a google.com address, and it won\u2019t prompt you to reenter your password via the email link.

      "2. Remove your data from the internet: Scammers are able to send you targeted messages because your data, like your email address or phone number, is already out there. This often happens due to past data breaches and shady data brokers. A data removal service can help clean up your digital trail by removing your information from public databases and people-search sites. It\u2019s not a quick fix, but over time, it reduces how easily scammers can find and target you.",

It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

    "story": [
      "May 7 is the deadline to get a REAL ID, and some DMVs are facing large crowds and major backup. FOX's Asher Reed spoke with FOX 35 Orlando from outside a DMV in Antioch, Tennessee, with more on the issue.",
      "If you've received a text message claiming to be from your state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and threatening you with fines or penalties unless you pay up, you're not alone. A new wave of scam texts is sweeping across the country, targeting drivers in states like Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, New York, California, Illinois, New Jersey, Virginia, Colorado, Vermont, Texas, North Carolina and even Washington, D.C.",
      "These messages look official and urgent, warning you about supposed unpaid tickets or tolls and demanding immediate payment. But don't be fooled, as these texts are sophisticated scams designed to steal your personal information or money.",

      "These scam messages vary slightly depending on the state you're in, but they\u2019re generally structured in the same way. The text threatens consequences, such as credit score damage, revoked driving privileges, suspended vehicle registration or increased toll fees, if you do not pay the bill you have supposedly incurred. To make the message appear legit, the scammers often include a date for penalties to begin, a fake administrative code and a link that appears to be an official DMV website.",

These are two powerful psychological motivators that can send you into a panic since your driving privileges are at risk, or you're facing financial consequences. The aim is to get you to act hastily without pausing to verify the source. The messages also mimic legitimate government communications by including familiar terms, official-sounding codes and web addresses that appear authentic. Here is an example of what the text might look like:",

      "If you receive a suspicious text message claiming to be from your state's DMV and demanding payment or personal information, follow these steps to protect yourself:",
      "1. Be skeptical of any message creating urgency or panic: Scammers rely on fear and urgency to trick you into acting without thinking. If a message pressures you to act immediately, that's a major red flag.",
      "2. Check for obvious red flags: Look for signs like strange sender addresses, awkward language, misspellings or links that don't match your state's official DMV website.",
      "3. Do not click any links or reply, and use strong antivirus software: Legitimate DMVs will not ask for payments, personal details or sensitive information via unsolicited text messages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Verify directly with your DMV: If you're concerned the message might be real, contact your state's DMV using the official website or a trusted phone number. Never use the contact information provided in the suspicious text.",
      "5. Consider a Personal Data Removal Service:\u00a0Your personal information is widely available online, which can make you a bigger target for these types of scams, therefore you might look into a personal data removal service. These services work by submitting opt-out requests to data brokers that collect and sell your information, helping to reduce your digital footprint and making it harder for scammers to find your contact details.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6. Delete the message immediately and block the sender: Removing the text helps prevent accidental clicks and reduces the risk of falling for the scam later. Also, be sure to\u00a0block phone numbers and texts that send spam or scam messages, reducing future risk.",
      "7. Register your number with the\u00a0National Do Not Call Registry: While this won't stop all scams, it can help reduce unwanted communications.",
      "8. Don't provide any personal or financial information: Never share your Social Security number, driver's license number, banking information, or passwords in response to an unsolicited text.",
      "9. If you clicked the link or gave out information, act quickly: If you accidentally entered personal or financial information, contact your bank, credit card provider or local law enforcement right away to minimize potential damage.",
      "10. Keep your phone's security features updated: Ensure your\u00a0device's operating system and security software are current to help block known scam numbers and malicious links.",
      "11. Report the scam:\u00a0Forward the message to 7726 (SPAM) to alert your mobile provider and help block similar messages in the future. Mark the message as junk or spam within your messaging app, if possible. File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at\u00a0reportfraud.ftc.gov or the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center at\u00a0ic3.gov.",
      "DON\u2019T GET CAUGHT IN THE \"APPLE ID SUSPENDED\" PHISHING SCAM",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Scam texts pretending to be from the DMV are getting more convincing, but you don't have to be their next victim. Staying skeptical of urgent messages, double-checking anything that seems off and never clicking suspicious links can go a long way in protecting your personal information. Remember, the real DMV will never pressure you for payment or sensitive details over text. By staying alert, you can help prevent these scams and keep your personal information and money secure.",

      "By 2050, the population of adults over 65 is projected to surge from 58 million to 82 million, intensifying the already urgent challenge of eldercare. With falls remaining the top cause of injury among older adults, the need for innovative, tech-driven solutions has never been clearer.",
      "MIT engineers are stepping up to this challenge with E-BAR, a mobile robot designed to physically support seniors and prevent falls as they move around their homes.",

      "How MIT\u2019s E-BAR robot helps prevent falls and support senior mobility",
      "E-BAR, short for\u00a0Elderly Bodily Assistance Robot, is not your typical assistive device. Rather than relying on harnesses or wearables, which many seniors find cumbersome or stigmatizing, E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users from behind. This allows individuals to walk freely, lean on the robot's arms for support or receive full-body assistance when transitioning between sitting and standing. The robot's articulated body, constructed from 18 interconnected bars, mimics the natural movement of the human body, delivering a seamless and intuitive experience.",
      "AI ROBOTS HELP NURSES BEAT BURNOUT AND TRANSFORM HOSPITAL CARE",
      "The engineering behind E-BAR's mobility is equally impressive. The robot's 220-pound base is meticulously designed to support the weight of an average adult without tipping or slipping, and its omnidirectional wheels enable smooth navigation through tight spaces and around household obstacles. This means E-BAR can move effortlessly alongside users, providing support in real time, whether they are reaching for a high shelf or stepping out of a bathtub.",

      "Inside MIT\u2019s E-BAR: A fall-prevention robot designed for aging in place",
      "What sets E-BAR apart from previous eldercare robots is its integrated fall-prevention system. Each arm is embedded with airbags made from soft, grippable materials that can inflate instantly if a fall is detected. This rapid response cushions the user without causing bruising, and, crucially, it does so without requiring the user to wear any special gear. In lab tests, E-BAR successfully supported elderly volunteers as they performed everyday tasks that often pose a risk for falls, such as bending down, stretching up or navigating the tricky edge of a bathtub.",
      "Currently, E-BAR is operated via remote control, but the MIT team is already working on automating its navigation and assistance features. The vision is for future versions to autonomously follow users, assess their real-time fall risk using machine learning algorithms and provide adaptive support as their mobility needs evolve.",

      "Why E-BAR prioritizes dignity, usability and independence for older adults",
      "The E-BAR project is rooted in extensive interviews with seniors and caregivers, which revealed a strong preference for unobtrusive, non-restrictive support systems. E-BAR's U-shaped handlebars leave the front of the user completely open, allowing for a natural stride and easy exit at any time. The robot is slim enough to fit through standard doorways and is designed to blend into the home environment, making it a practical addition rather than an intrusive medical device.",
      "MIT researchers see E-BAR as part of a broader ecosystem of assistive technologies, each tailored to different stages of aging and mobility. While some devices may offer predictive fall detection or harness-based support, E-BAR's unique combination of full-body assistance, fall prevention and user autonomy addresses a critical gap for those who want to maintain independence but need occasional support.",

The research team is continuing to refine the design and aims to bring it to market in the coming years, but it could take 5\u201310 years before the device receives full regulatory approval and becomes commercially accessible.",
      "Looking forward, the research team is also focused on refining E-BAR's design to make it slimmer, more maneuverable and even more intuitive to use. They are also exploring ways to integrate advanced AI for real-time fall prediction and adaptive assistance, ensuring that the robot can meet users' changing needs as they age. The ultimate goal is to provide seamless, continuous support, empowering seniors to live safely and confidently in their own homes.",

It's easy to see how something like this could make a big difference for seniors wanting to stay independent without feeling tied down by bulky or uncomfortable devices.

      "LexisNexis isn\u2019t a household name for most people, but it plays a major role in how personal data is harvested and used behind the scenes. The company pulls information from a wide range of sources, compiling detailed profiles that help other businesses assess risk and detect fraud. Its clients include banks, insurance companies and government agencies.",
      "In 2023, the New York Times reported that several car manufacturers had been sharing driving data with LexisNexis without notifying vehicle owners. That information was then sold to insurance companies, which used it to adjust premiums based on individual driving behavior. The story made one thing clear. LexisNexis has access to a staggering amount of personal detail, even from people who have never willingly engaged with the company.",
      "Law enforcement also uses LexisNexis tools to dig up information on suspects. These systems offer access to phone records, home addresses and other historical data. While such tools might assist in investigations, they also highlight a serious issue. When this much sensitive information is concentrated in one place, it becomes a single point of failure.

      "Keeping your personal data safe online can feel overwhelming, but a few practical steps can make a big difference in protecting your privacy and reducing your digital footprint. Here are 7 effective ways to take control of your information and keep it out of the wrong hands:",
      "1. Remove your data from the internet:\u00a0The most effective way to take control of your data and avoid data brokers from selling it is to opt for data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "2. Review privacy settings: Take a few minutes to explore the privacy and security settings on the services you use. For example, limit who can see your social media posts, disable unnecessary location-sharing on your phone and consider turning off ad personalization on accounts like Google and Facebook. Most browsers let you block third-party cookies or clear tracking data. The FTC suggests comparing the privacy notices of different sites and apps and choosing ones that let you opt out of sharing when possible.",
      "3. Use privacy-friendly tools: Install browser extensions or plugins that block ads and trackers (such as uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger). You might switch to a more private search engine (like DuckDuckGo or Brave) that doesn\u2019t log your queries. Consider using a browser\u2019s \"incognito\" or private mode when you don\u2019t want your history saved, and regularly clear your cookies and cache. Even small habits, like logging out of accounts when not in use or using a password manager, make you less trackable.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Beware of phishing links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Scammers may try to get access to your financial details and other important data using phishing links. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Be cautious with personal data: Think twice before sharing extra details. Don\u2019t fill out online surveys or quizzes that ask for personal or financial information unless you trust the source. Create separate email addresses for sign-ups (so marketing emails don\u2019t go to your main inbox). Only download apps from official stores and check app permissions.",
      "6. Opt out of data broker lists: Many data brokers offer ways to opt out or delete your information, though it can be a tedious process. For example, there are sites like Privacy Rights Clearinghouse or the Whitepages opt-out page that list popular brokers and their opt-out procedures. The FTC\u2019s consumer guide,\u00a0\"Your Guide to Protecting Your Privacy Online,\" includes tips on opting out of targeted ads and removing yourself from people-search databases. Keep in mind you may have to repeat this every few months.",
      "7. Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "HR FIRM CONFIRMS 4M RECORDS EXPOSED IN MAJOR HACK",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "For many, the LexisNexis breach may be the first time they realize just how much of their data is in circulation. Unlike a social media platform or a bank, there is no clear customer relationship with a data broker, and that makes it harder to demand transparency. This incident should prompt serious discussion around what kind of oversight is necessary in industries that operate in the shadows. A more informed public and stronger regulation may be the only things standing between personal data and permanent exposure.",

      "Why is windowless design such a big deal for aircraft?",
      "Most travelers don't realize that windows are structural weak points in an aircraft. They require extra reinforcement, add weight and disrupt the smooth flow of air over the fuselage (the main body of the plane). This increases drag, a resistance force that makes flight less efficient. By removing windows, the Phantom 3500's surface allows air to flow with minimal turbulence, helping the aircraft achieve what Otto Aviation describes as \"full laminar flow characteristics.\"",
      "HYPERSONIC JET PROMISES NYC TO LONDON IN UNDER AN HOUR",
      "This is a major contributor to its impressive aerodynamic performance. The windowless design is not just for aesthetics. Otto Aviation specifically engineered the fuselage to optimize laminar flow, using lightweight materials and smooth surfaces to further reduce drag and fuel consumption.",

These displays stream real-time video from cameras mounted on the aircraft's exterior, offering passengers a panoramic, immersive view of the skies. Otto Aviation refers to this system as Super Natural Vision, a proprietary technology that replaces traditional windows with state-of-the-art digital displays, seamlessly integrating real-time external views for a unique in-flight experience.",

By sustaining laminar flow, the aircraft aims to improve fuel efficiency by 35%. This allows it to maintain high-speed performance while consuming less fuel, making it one of the most aerodynamically efficient aircraft ever developed. It operates in the transonic range (Mach 0.8\u20131.2), balancing speed and efficiency. It can also reach a cruising altitude of 51,000 feet, significantly higher than most commercial airliners, which typically fly between 30,000 and 40,000 feet.",
      "Thanks to its streamlined fuselage and optimized aerodynamics, the Phantom 3500 burns 50% less fuel than conventional business jets. This reduction in fuel consumption translates to lower operating costs and a significant decrease in carbon emissions. The Phantom 3500\u2019s wings achieve complete laminar flow, allowing for smoother airflow and reduced drag, enabling the aircraft to take off from runways as short as 3,500 feet, nearly doubling the number of accessible airports in the U.S. alone compared to similar-sized jets.",

      "Adidas confirms vendor breach: Here\u2019s what we know",
      "Adidas has officially acknowledged that a third-party vendor suffered a breach, resulting in unauthorized access to consumer data. In a\u00a0public notice titled \"Data Security Information,\" the company revealed that a \"third-party customer service provider\" had been compromised.

      "1. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Adidas breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Adidas breach. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You might want to consider investing in identity theft protection, which can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Adidas breach shows that even companies with decades of brand equity and a massive global footprint are not immune to lapses in data security. It underscores the need for companies to go beyond basic compliance and actively evaluate the cybersecurity standards of every partner in their ecosystem. Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the trade-offs they make when sharing their personal information, and brands that fail to meet this moment may find their reputations eroding faster than they expect.",

In one ward, Nurabot delivers wound care kits and educational materials directly to patient bedsides, saving nurses multiple trips to supply rooms and allowing them to dedicate more time to their patients. The robot is also especially helpful during visiting hours and night shifts, when staffing levels are typically lower.",

Prosecutors accuse her of striking him with her Lexus after a night out drinking, then leaving him to die on the ground during a blizzard in Canton, Massachusetts, about 20 miles south of the city where he worked.",
      "In a hearing without jurors present, Judge Beverly Cannone ruled that Laposata's credentials did not qualify her to testify about potential dog bites as a source of injuries to O'Keefe's arm, and the judge limited what she could say about the impacts of motor vehicles on pedestrians in collisions.",

      "\"When the brain slaps forcefully against the base of the skull, the delicate bones above the eye break, and that's again the coup contra coup,\" she said. \"The brain slaps forward, and when those delicate bones are broken, there's bleeding, and that bleeding then goes right down into the upper eyelids. So it kind of looks like you have black eyes, but...there's not been any punch to the face.\"",
      "She said that the injury pattern also indicated that he fell on a ridged surface, not something flat.",
      "That also caused the \"raccoon eyes\" swelling and bruising in the front of his face. However, she testified, the cut over O'Keefe's right eye was caused by something else \u2013 an application of force involving a small object.",

      "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) strategy aims to get illegal immigration cases dropped. Federal officials plan to arrest migrants and place them in expedited removal proceedings, fast-tracking them to deportation out of the country, allowing for almost-immediate removal without a hearing before an immigration judge, according to ICE sources.",
      "If a migrant has an active, pending court case, expedited removal cannot happen, which is why DHS officials are planning to get them dropped. Immigration judges, however, have to agree to drop cases, and so far, they are cooperating with the effort, sources said.",

      "\"Because the playbook is this: the immigrant goes into their court hearing.

And in many instances, the judge will just dismiss over objection of the immigrant or [if] the immigrant doesn't know any better, and they say, \u2018Sure, that sounds great.\u2019 And then they walk out of the courtroom, and they're apprehended,\" Lincoln-Goldfinch explained.",
      "If judges refuse to dismiss cases, they can \"maintain their own jurisdiction over what happens with [an immigrant] because this person is in immigration court proceedings and the judge gets to decide what happens to them so long as they don't dismiss the case.\"",

It doesn't make sense from a resource expenditure perspective,\" she said. \"And I think that is the main objection. So do I think this will be challenged in court?

And for us to go back on that sentencing now and then the victims to be re-victimized, the families of the murdered, to have to continuously relive this is unconscionable to me,\" Jones explained.",

Gavin Newsom was \"unlawful\" and should be rescinded.",
      "Bonta said in a statement that Trump's order \u201cinfringes on Governor Newsom\u2019s role as Commander-in-Chief of the California National Guard and violates the state\u2019s sovereign right to control and have available its National Guard in the absence of a lawful invocation of federal power.\u201d",
      "Bonta argued in the lawsuit that the Defense Department did not communicate directly with the governor\u2019s office regarding any planned activation and deployment of California National Guard members, and it did not seek approval to utilize the National Guard to protect federal agents and federal property.",
      "When reached for comment Monday night, a Pentagon spokesperson said it's the Defense Department's policy to not comment on pending or ongoing litigation.",
      "The suit went on to say that the protests and unrest \u201cpale in comparison\u201d to other incidents, including the federalization of the National Guard in 1992 at the request of California Gov. Pete Wilson during the Rodney King riots.",
      "\u201cAt no point in the past three days has there been a rebellion or an insurrection,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "During a news conference Monday before filing the lawsuit, Bonta accused Trump of \"trying to manufacture chaos and crisis on the ground for his own political ends.\"",
      "He told reporters that the law Trump used to activate the guard had been used only once before, when President Richard Nixon used it in 1970 to activate the guard to deliver mail during a postal strike. He also said it\u2019s the first time the guard had been activated without a governor\u2019s consent since 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson deployed troops in Alabama to protect civil rights demonstrators.",
      "The White House had contended the move was necessary to combat \u201clawlessness that has been allowed to fester\u201d in Los Angeles, referring to clashes and confrontations between federal agents carrying out immigration raids and protesters in recent days.",
      "\"We did the right thing,\" Trump told reporters Monday, adding that the \"place would be burning down\" if they hadn't. \"I\u2019m very happy I got involved. And I think Gavin, in his own way, is probably happy I got involved.\"",
      "Newsom, a Democrat, had said that there was no need to deploy the National Guard and that Trump took the drastic step out of a desire for a \u201cspectacle.\u201d",
      "He also accused Trump of trying to \"manufacture a crisis.\"",
      "\"He\u2019s hoping for chaos so he can justify more crackdowns, more fear, more control,\u201d Newsom said Sunday on X, where he also urged protesters to \u201cstay peaceful.\u201d",
      "Tensions between protesters and law enforcement escalated Saturday, with some protesters throwing objects and law enforcement deploying pepper balls and flash-bangs. Videos also showed looting and a car on fire.",
      "The protests swelled Sunday, with demonstrators shutting down streets and highways, setting more cars on fire and increasing confrontations with law enforcement.",
      "The protests initially began in response to immigration enforcement operations, as the Trump administration has made mass deportations a centerpiece of its domestic policy. In recent days, administration officials have targeted major Democratic cities in their enforcement efforts, including Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.",
      "Trump praised the National Guard on Truth Social for a \"job well done\" in the early hours of Sunday, before they'd been deployed in the city.",
      "On Monday, he ratcheted up his rhetoric about the protesters on social media, charging that if any protester spat on a National Guard member, \"they will be hit harder than they have ever been hit before.\"",
      "\"Such disrespect will not be tolerated!\" wrote Trump. On his first day in office, Trump issued roughly 1,500 pardons to people who'd been charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol, in which 140 law enforcement officers were injured.",
      "About 300 guard members are in Los Angeles, officials said, where they've been tasked with guarding federal personnel and properties. In addition, about 700 Marines from the Marine Corps base in Twentynine Palms, California, will deploy to Los Angeles to support the National Guard members already in the city, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday."

      "A senior White House official said, \u201cIt\u2019s not being actively planned or considered, but anyone who breaks federal law puts themselves at risk of being arrested. That\u2019s just a basic fact.\u201d",
      "A second White House official said that if Newsom or Bass do \u201csomething to get themselves arrested,\u201d then they could be detained. But, the person added, the optics of arresting them wouldn\u2019t be good for Republicans right now, as it doesn't appear they've broken any laws.",
      "In an interview Monday with \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d Homan said that he never had discussions about arresting Newsom and his that comments Saturday were hypothetical. \u201cThe reporter asked me, well, could Gov. Newsom or Mayor Bass be arrested? I said, \u2018Well, no one\u2019s above the law. If they cross the line and commit a crime, absolutely they can.\u2019 So there was no discussion about arresting Newsom.\u201d",
      "Newsom said Sunday that Trump hadn't expressed any concern about his ability to manage the growing protest in Los Angeles or the prospect of federalizing National Guard troops during a phone call after protests started Friday.",
      "\"We talked for almost 20 minutes, and he barely \u2014 this issue never came up,\" Newsom said. \"We had a very decent conversation.\"",
      "Newsom and Bass have intensely criticized Trump's decision to authorize the deployment of at least 2,000 National Guard troops in response to the protests, arguing they would only inflame tensions in the city already heightened by the large-scale immigration operations.",

      "\"In dynamic and fluid situations such as the one in Los Angeles, State and local authorities are the most appropriate ones to evaluate the need for resources and safeguard life and property,\" Newsom said in the letter.",
      "Threats by the administration to arrest elected officials have been a hallmark of Trump's second term, particularly after the high-profile arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka outside an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detention facility in New Jersey. The charges were dropped, though the Justice Department charged another elected official with Baraka, Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver, with two counts of assaulting, resisting and impeding law enforcement officials in connection with the incident."

    "story": [
      "The 17 members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s independent vaccine advisory committee are being removed from their posts, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Monday afternoon.",
      "Kennedy announced the change in an editorial in The Wall Street Journal, claiming that the \u201ccommittee has been plagued with persistent conflicts of interest and has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.\u201d",
      "Such a claim is \"deeply insulting to the many scientists who contribute countless hours to the process,\" said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, an infectious disease expert with the American Academy of Pediatrics. \"We are, in fact, a model for the rest of the world.\"",
      "\"This is manufactured chaos,\" O'Leary said.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known more commonly as ACIP, consists of medical and public health experts \u2014 including pediatricians, epidemiologists and geriatricians \u2014 who make recommendations to the CDC about who should get certain vaccines, including the schedule for childhood vaccinations. Several times a year the committee holds public meetings where data is presented and reviewed.",
      "The committee reports the data to the CDC director, who then reviews the recommendations and can choose whether to adopt them. The CDC director isn't required to do so, but usually goes along with the ACIP recommendations.",
      "Members of ACIP, who undergo an extensive vetting process before being appointed, are required to disclose conflicts of interest and recuse themselves from voting on vaccines for which a conflict exists. The CDC released a database in March of some members\u2019 previous work on clinical trials or vaccine research funded by drug companies, but much of the information was already public. Many public health experts argue that past associations with the pharmaceutical industry is relevant and valuable expertise for ACIP members, as long as conflicts are disclosed.",
      "\u201cTo claim that you are doing this to restore faith in CDC is a special form of gaslighting,\u201d said a CDC employee, referring to Kennedy's comments. The employee did not want to speak on the record for fear of retribution.",
      "Dismantling the committee is among Kennedy\u2019s most aggressive actions so far to reshape U.S. vaccine policy. Kennedy rose to prominence as a high-profile figure in the anti-vaccine movement, and has made a variety of specious and debunked claims about vaccine harms. Since aligning himself with President Donald Trump and becoming head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has overseen a series of steps that have undercut vaccine access, including the pullback of funds for vaccine distribution to children of lower income families.",
      "In an interview, former CDC director Dr. Mandy Cohen said, \u201cSecretary Kennedy\u2019s unprecedented action spreads confusion and casts doubt on transparent public health processes that protect Americans. I\u2019m deeply concerned for families trying to navigate how to keep their loved ones safe.\u201d",
      "Kennedy\u2019s decision to fire ACIP members \u201cshould erase any remaining doubt that he intends to impose his personal anti-vaccine agenda on the American people,\u201d Dr. Richard Besser, the former acting director of the CDC and current president of the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said in a statement. He added that Monday\u2019s action will \u201cmake it far more difficult for pediatricians and other providers to care for their patients,\u201d since they rely on ACIP\u2019s guidance to make their own vaccine recommendations.",
      "In his editorial, Kennedy called for a \u201cclean sweep\u201d of the ACIP, but did not say who he planned to appoint to the now-vacant positions or provide a timeline for filling the roles. HHS said in a press release that ACIP will convene its next meeting from June 25 to June 27.",
      "\u201cWhat I think Kennedy is doing here is attempting to replace career civil servants with scientific expertise with those who may be more amenable to his and the Trump administration\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Matt Motta, an assistant professor of health law and policy at Boston University\u2019s School of Public Health.",
      "Motta said firing ACIP members is \u201can unequivocally clear attempt to break the promise\u201d that Kennedy made during his confirmation hearings to not limit vaccine access. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said in February that Kennedy had promised to maintain the ACIP \u201cwithout changes.\u201d Cassidy said Monday on X that he will continue to talk with Kennedy to ensure the ACIP is not \u201cfilled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion.\u201d",
      "Kennedy's shake up of the vaccine committee comes as the U.S. is experiencing a rise in vaccine-preventable outbreaks, including measles and whooping cough. Since last fall, 241 mostly unvaccinated children have died of flu-related illnesses, the highest number for a non-pandemic season since 2004.",
      "Members of the ACIP are appointed to four-year terms, and many were slated to serve on the committee for another three years. Kennedy wrote Monday that \u201cwithout removing the current members, the current Trump administration would not have been able to appoint a majority of new members until 2028.\u201d",
      "The move further degrades the federal government as a trusted source on vaccines and could force consumers, doctors and insurers to look elsewhere for expert guidance on vaccines, according to one ACIP member.",
      "\u201cThe clear implication is that CDC will no longer be credible in the space of vaccination,\u201d said the ACIP member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because their employer does not allow them to speak to the media. \u201cInsurers and other funding agencies will have to turn to the professional associations for recommendations about vaccines.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A Burmese American woman was eager to bring her siblings over to the U.S. from Myanmar amid a more than 15-year wait for visas. She\u2019d been hoping to reunite with them since the 1990s, during military rule in her home country, so her brother\u2019s family could start a life in the U.S. But a day after she bought the plane tickets, President Donald Trump ordered a travel ban that included Myanmar.",
      "The woman, 51, and her husband, who were granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation, had sponsored her brother and sister-in-law to immigrate to the U.S. The siblings were then were hoping to bring their own adult kids, too, so that they wouldn\u2019t have to fulfill mandatory military service in the country\u2019s active civil war.",
      "With the travel ban in effect Monday, they said the policy has a heightened impact on people from war-torn countries like Myanmar who had hopes of finding sanctuary in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating because we were on the cusp of securing their safety to leave that situation,\u201d said her husband, 57, adding he felt like a \u201crug got pulled out from under us in an instant.\u201d",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump\u2019s policy is in the \u201cbest interest of the American people and their safety.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis commonsense, country-specific travel restrictions include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe restrictions fulfill the President\u2019s day one promise to protect American citizens from dangerous foreign actors who may come to the United States and cause us harm.\u201d",
      "The travel restrictions, announced on Wednesday, completely bar entry to the U.S. for people from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, in addition to those from Afghanistan, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Other countries, including Cuba, Laos and Venezuela, are under partial travel restrictions.",
      "According to Trump\u2019s proclamation, several of the countries on the list had declined to accept the repatriation of their nationals while others had visa overstay rates that the administration deemed \u201cunacceptable.\u201d A few countries lacked \u201cthe competence of the central authority\u201d for issuing passports, the proclamation said.",
      "Jackson also pointed out a section in the proclamation that allows for applications for refugee status.",
      "\u201cNothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the [international Convention Against Torture], consistent with the laws of the United States,\u201d the proclamation said.",
      "However, after he took office, Trump limited refugee admissions for almost all countries including Myanmar. And in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke the temporary legal status of more than 500,000 immigrants that was granted by the Biden administration. Those immigrants came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and are now subject to deportation.",
      "Myanmar was among the nine countries in the latest proclamation that Trump also targeted during his first term. In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. issued 13,284 visas to the country, with business and tourism permits making up the most common types of visas. Myanmar recorded 1,384 overstays that fiscal year, equating to an overstay rate of almost 30%.",
      "The new travel ban comes as Myanmar\u2019s violent military regime fights to hold on to power after it seized control from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in a 2021 coup. Since then, violence has escalated across the region as the military clashes with ethnic minority rebel groups and pro-democracy militias.",
      "\u201cJunta forces have slaughtered thousands of civilians, bombed and burned villages, and displaced millions of people,\u201d Tom Andrews, United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, said in a press release earlier this year. \u201cMore than 20,000 political prisoners remain behind bars. The economy and public services have collapsed. Famine and starvation loom over large parts of the population.\u201d",
      "Under the new travel ban, anyone who obtained a visa prior to the policy is still able to come to the U.S. But there\u2019s confusion over how the restrictions will be implemented and enforced. The Burmese American woman and her husband are among those with concerns, particularly as there have been several cases of lawful permanent residents and citizens being swept up in the dragnet of Trump\u2019s immigration policies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to think that they could be randomly picked up because somebody had a bad day at the office, or somebody didn\u2019t do their job or didn\u2019t believe that their visa was true,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frankly terrifying.\u201d",
      "For the woman, reunification with her brother has been a long time coming. She became a citizen in the late 1990s and began the process to help bring her sibling over a few years later. At the time, Myanmar had been under the control of a strict military junta that held power from the 1960s until 2011, and for decades had kept the country in a state of extreme isolation and deprivation. She said her brother, whose children were just a few years old then, hoped to come over and root his family in more stability.",
      "\u201cTheir circumstances in Myanmar at that time were very, very bad. That was the system that I grew up in. There was no future for them, no prosperity,\u201d the woman said. \u201cMy brother was concerned for his children\u2019s future and education.\u201d",
      "Amid moves and address changes, the couple said they never received the standard letter notifying them that the woman's brother had been able to progress in his visa process. They assumed the wait was a product of notorious immigration backlogs. It wasn\u2019t until the situation in Myanmar intensified again in recent years that the couple found out that the brother was close to finally being able to immigrate. But by then, the woman said, her brother\u2019s kids had aged out of the system.",
      "According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, those who turn 21 before being approved for legal permanent resident status are no longer considered a child for immigration purposes and need to file an entirely new application, prolonging the green card process.",
      "At this point, the woman said, her brother and sister-in-law said they were willing to risk possible detention to come to the U.S., particularly if it meant easier access to the American immigration system that would enable them to fight to get their children to come over as well. However, with Myanmar\u2019s military draft in effect, the family is particularly concerned for their safety now that the travel ban adds another barrier to leaving.",
      "\u201cThe reason they wanted to come here was for their kids,\u201d the woman said of her brother and sister-in-law. \u201cNow, it\u2019s really hard to bring my nephews here to save their lives.\u201d",
      "Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, said the bans are ultimately another part of \u201cthe engine of Trump\u2019s mass deportation machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s focused on demonizing immigrant families and communities by denying them family reunification, that we all rightfully deserve to be whole \u2014 especially now, when the world is more dangerous than ever,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "Rather than protecting individuals\u2019 safety, Dinh said, she believes Trump\u2019s policy punishes those who need an escape from dangerous conditions.",
      "\u201cIt perpetuates the violence that is happening across the world, as opposed to creating conditions for peace or humanitarian relief, and for these families who\u2019ve been separated,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "She also said she views the ban as evidence that the U.S. is misunderstanding its role as a humanitarian leader.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got people who are legitimately trying to escape a civil war,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cNow, because of some arbitrary decision by the Trump administration to pick a certain number of countries \u2026 without consideration of the actual cases, without an exception policy, it hurts them. They\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d"

      "\"It Ends With Us\" actor and director Justin Baldoni's legal battle with Blake Lively hit a roadblock Monday when a federal judge dismissed his $400 million countersuit.",
      "Baldoni and production company Wayfarer Studios sued Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, for defamation in January.",
      "He sought at least $400 million for damages that included lost future income. It also named publicist Leslie Sloane as a defendant.",
      "Baldoni filed his lawsuit about two weeks after Lively sued him and others tied to the film, alleging harassment and that a coordinated campaign was launched to ruin her reputation after she came forward about allegations of poor treatment on set. An amended complaint from Lively alleged that Baldoni also made other women on set feel uncomfortable.",
      "Baldoni also sued The New York Times for libel after he accused the newspaper of working with Lively to smear him. U.S. District Judge Lewis J. Liman tossed that lawsuit Monday.",
      "Liman said in the court filing that Baldoni's legal team can amend the claims of tortious interference with contract and breach of implied covenant by June 23.",
      "\"Today\u2019s opinion is a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties dragged into their retaliatory lawsuit, including Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Sloane and The New York Times,\" Lively\u2019s lawyers Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb said in a statement.",
      "They said Baldoni's lawsuit was a \"sham\" and that \"the court saw right through it.\"",
      "\"We look forward to the next round, which is seeking attorneys\u2019 fees, treble damages and punitive damages against Baldoni, Sarowitz, Nathan, and the other Wayfarer Parties who perpetrated this abusive litigation,\" Hudson and Gottlieb said.",
      "A New York Times spokesperson said the newspaper was grateful that the judge \"saw the suit for what it was: a meritless attempt to stifle honest reporting.\"",
      "\"Our journalists went out and covered carefully and fairly a story of public importance, and the court recognized that the law is designed to protect just that sort of journalism,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"We will continue to stand up in court for our journalism and for our journalists when their work comes under attack.\u201d",
      "Baldoni\u2019s attorney, Bryan Freedman, did not immediately return a request for comment Monday.",
      "The monthslong feud between Baldoni and Lively exploded after the pair wrapped filming of \"It Ends With Us,\" a film adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s book. Lively alleged in her initial complaint that she was sexually harassed by Baldoni while filming and was targeted after she expressed her concerns.",
      "Lively also accused him of hiring a crisis publicity firm to engage in a \u201csocial manipulation campaign\u201d to ruin her reputation. Baldoni has denied the allegations.",
      "Taylor Swift was dragged into the bitter legal battle after Baldoni\u2019s attorney tried to subpoena her as a potential witness. A spokesperson for Swift quickly blasted the subpoena as a way to \u201cuse Taylor Swift\u2019s name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait.\u201d",
      "Last week, a federal judge refused to let Lively dismiss claims of emotional distress on her terms. Lively had offered to drop the claims instead of providing her medical and mental health records as requested by Baldoni\u2019s legal team.",
      "Lively and Baldoni\u2019s trial is scheduled for March."

    "summary": "Trump's escalation of immigration arrests by shifting into workplaces ignited clashes between protesters and officers in the immigrant-heavy city.",
    "story": [
      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Four days of unrest in Los Angeles over President Donald Trump\u2019s push to increase immigrant arrests and deportations have led to the arrests of at least 56 people, clashes between protesters and law enforcement officials and the deployment of the National Guard and the Marines in the country's second-largest city.",
      "How did this happen?",
      "The tensions started Friday, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and others arrested over 40 immigrants in raids targeting day laborers at a Home Depot parking lot and workers at the Ambiance Apparel clothing manufacturer, searching for \u201cfictitious employee documents.\u201d",
      "As news of the raids spread fear and panic, relatives and protesters arrived to confront the federal agents wearing camouflage and bulletproof vests.",
      "Some protesters tried to stop vehicles carrying detained immigrants or used other methods to block arrests.",
      "Soon the clashes turned violent, with officers using pepper spray and batons, pushing crowds back with riot shields as some protesters fled or retaliated. A prominent labor leader was among those arrested. The protests spread from downtown Los Angeles into the communities of Paramount and Compton, where rumors of arrests also added to the flaring tensions.",
      "Trump, acting without agreement from state leaders, called in the California National Guard on Saturday. By Sunday, the troops, outfitted with heavy military equipment, had moved into the streets of downtown Los Angeles in a show of force in the state with the largest immigrant population.",
      "Trump said on his social media site, Truth Social, that he had directed the homeland security and defense secretaries and Attorney General Pam Bondi \u201cto take all such action necessary to liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion, and put an end to these Migrant riots.\u201d",
      "But the clashes dragged on through the day and into the night, with looting and driverless cars\u2019 being set on fire.",
      "The families of the arrested immigrants have accused the government of \u201ckidnapping\u201d their loved ones. Meanwhile, the presence of the troops has set up a battle between the Trump administration and lawmakers in a state that is known for its liberal immigration policies.",
      "\u2018I don\u2019t know where they\u2019ve taken him\u2019",
      "About two dozen members of the detained workers\u2019 families showed up to a rally and news conference outside Ambiance Apparel on Monday, holding up homemade signs with photos of their loved ones next to birthday cakes, holding their kids and smiling.",
      "\u201cIt has been incredibly painful to witness the arrest of my father and of his co-workers,\u201d said Sara\u00ed Ortiz, who said her father, Jos\u00e9 Ortiz, was among those arrested.",
      "\u201cMy father gave 18 years of his life to this company,\u201d she said at a news conference outside the site of the raid Friday. \u201cHe was always here. He was a loyal worker.\u201d",
      "At least four people at the news conference said they hadn\u2019t received updates from immigration authorities or been able to communicate with their detained family members.",
      "Jer\u00f3nimo Mart\u00ednez, 39, said in an interview through an interpreter that he\u2019s worried about L\u00e1zaro Maldonado, his nephew, because the family hasn\u2019t had any communication with him since Friday.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know where they\u2019ve taken him,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what place he might be in, so I am worried.\u201d",
      "A young man who identified himself as Carlos said he considers his brother, Jos\u00e9, to have been \u201ckidnapped,\u201d because his brother was taken by force in the Ambiance raid and is being held without being able to contact relatives or lawyers, which he said is the definition of kidnapping.",
      "\u201cThe only crime he committed was trying to live a better life and trying to get ahead and work. Because of that dream, I had to witness him being chained up like he was some dangerous animal. The whole process wasn\u2019t just inhumane; it was illegal,\u201d Carlos said.",
      "Trump also mobilized about 700 Marines on Monday to support the National Guard in protecting federal personnel and property, U.S. Northern Command said in a statement.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom blamed anarchists and troublemakers for the fires and any violence, not peaceful protesters, but he said, \u201cDonald Trump at the end of the day is the sponsor of these conditions.\" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement on X that \u201cTrump didn\u2019t inherit a crisis \u2014 he created one.\u201d",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta sued the Trump administration for federalizing the state\u2019s National Guard troops and deploying them to quell protests over objections of California government leaders.",
      "The raids were a striking departure by the administration from Trump's campaign statements that his plans for mass deportation would focus on violent immigrant criminals.",
      "The raids follow weeks of ICE officers and other federal agents\u2019 showing up at immigration courts across the country, including in California, to arrest people as they left the courthouses where their cases were dismissed.",
      "Those arrests have been accompanied by video on social media or captured by news outlets of some family members being arrested and of young children standing nearby as a parent or parents are handcuffed or restrained with zip ties.",
      "Increasingly, people are seeing ICE arrest and take away immigrants who've lived and worked in the United States for years or are part of their community, including people who are seeking asylum or had other temporary legal protection from deportation.",
      "NBC News reported last week that White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, angry over what he saw as low numbers of arrests and deportations, ordered senior ICE officials to begin detaining 3,000 migrants a day or be fired.",
      "Amid the turmoil, ICE was already ramping up arrests by using thousands more federal law enforcement personnel and up to 21,000 National Guard troops in what it had dubbed \u201cOperation At Large,\" NBC News reported.",
      "Before the clashes in Los Angeles, smaller confrontations between protesters and law enforcement had begun to erupt in other cities around the country. In Chicago on Wednesday, chaos unfolded as protesters confronted ICE officers over arrests during scheduled check-ins with immigration officials.",
      "In San Diego, a surprise raid by armed federal officers at a popular Italian restaurant drew protests. Officers dispersed the crowd with what were identified as flash bang grenades.",
      "In Los Angeles, protests and tensions continued.",

      "\u201cCall Her Alex,\u201d which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on Sunday and debuts on Hulu on Tuesday, chronicles the media figure\u2019s ascent to stardom, detailing her early childhood in Pennsylvania and her journey to become one of the most influential podcasters.",
      "In the two-part docuseries, which NBC News viewed screeners of, the \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d host alleges that her former coach Nancy Feldman \u201cfixated\u201d on her, \u201cwanting to know who I was dating ... making comments on my body, and always wanting to be alone with me.\u201d",
      "Cooper played on the team from 2013-2015, according to the B.U. women\u2019s soccer website. Feldman, who retired in 2022 after 27 years at the university, made comments about her appearance and her legs, Cooper alleges, and put her hand on Cooper\u2019s thigh. She said Feldman also once questioned her about a date, asking if she had sex the night before.",
      "\u201cI felt so deeply uncomfortable,\u201d she says in the docuseries, adding that she was attending B.U. on a full-tuition scholarship and felt if she \u201cdidn\u2019t follow\u201d Feldman\u2019s rules, she\u2019d be \u201cgone.\u201d",
      "In the docuseries, Cooper\u2019s mom says the family reached out to a lawyer who advised them to sue Feldman, but warned litigation could take years. Cooper said her parents reached out to B.U. to report the claims of sexual harassment. Her mom said she provided notes to B.U. that she took from her calls with Cooper over the years in which her daughter described the alleged incidents. The notes were shown in the docuseries.",
      "Cooper claims she told B.U. she wanted to play her senior year but she couldn\u2019t play for Feldman. The university, she alleges, said they told her they wouldn't be conducting an investigation and said they wouldn\u2019t fire Feldman. They said Cooper could keep her scholarship even if she didn\u2019t play her senior year.",
      "\u201cWithin five minutes, they had entirely dismissed everything I had been through,\u201d Cooper said.",
      "Feldman and a representative for Boston University did not  respond to requests for comment made on Monday. A spokesperson for Cooper said she is not commenting further.",
      "The docuseries does not include a statement from the university or from Feldman.",
      "During a Q&A with director Ry Russo-Young after the Tribeca screening, Cooper reflected on her decision to speak out 10 years after the alleged harassment.",
      "In the years since she graduated, Cooper, now 30, has built a media empire. Her millions of listeners, nicknamed the \u201cDaddy Gang,\u201d consider her the go-to voice on relationships, dating and life in your 20s and 30s. In addition to her podcast, one of the most listened to on Spotify, she launched the Unwell Network, a subsidiary of the media company Trending, which she founded with her now-husband, Matt Kaplan, and a drink brand.",
      "She said that while filming the documentary project she returned to B.U.\u2019s campus for the first time, and  she got emotional.",
      "\u201cAt this point in the filming process, I was not sure I wanted to talk about this experience,\u201d she said during the Q&A, according to People, which also shared a clip of the conversation on Instagram.",
      "\u201cThe minute I stepped back on that field, I felt so small,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI just felt like I was 18 years old again, and I was in a situation with someone in a position of power who abused their power, and I felt like I wasn\u2019t the \u2018Call Her Daddy\u2019 girl. I wasn\u2019t someone who had money and influence or whatever. I was just another woman who experienced harassment on a level that changed my life forever and took away the thing I loved the most.\u201d",
      "This is the first time Cooper has opened up about the allegations, though she has alluded to having a \u201ctraumatic experience\u201d with a coach during her time on the team in the past. In a 2023 interview with Cosmopolitan magazine, she described a \u201cspecific thing\u201d without mentioning what had happened, saying \u201cit\u2019s so personal to me and it took such a toll on my mental health.\u201d",
      "She said reconnecting with people she played soccer with, \u201cwho were around when things were happening,\u201d had been \u201cpretty cathartic\u201d for her.",
      "\u201cI met up with one of my teammates in Santa Monica who I hadn\u2019t seen since we graduated \u2014 we didn\u2019t even say hi, we just both started crying,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s another woman that went through it with me, and we finally saw each other recently, and it\u2019s just wild to talk about it together. Connecting with these other women with these scars, that\u2019s the first step to me actually being like, \u201cOh my god, I\u2019m feeling better.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Airplane tickets are getting cheaper, but it\u2019s getting more expensive to bring your family to an airport lounge.",
      "Capital One is the latest company to limit access to booming airport lounges to combat overcrowding.",
      "Starting Feb. 1, Venture X and Venture X Business cardholders will no longer be able to automatically take a guest into lounges or bring authorized second card users.",
      "They will instead have to pay $125 annually for each additional cardholder to keep their lounge access, $45 per adult guest per visit and $25 per guest 17 or younger. The $125 fee also includes second cardholder access to a network of Priority Pass lounges.",
      "\u201cAs airport lounges continue to grow in popularity across the industry, we\u2019ve seen our customers increasingly encounter wait times to enter them,\u201d Capital One said in a statement. \u201cIt is important to us that we maintain a great airport lounge experience for our Venture X and Venture X Business customers, while continuing to deliver best-in-class premium travel cards at an accessible price point.\u201d",
      "Primary cardholders will have to spend at least $75,000 per calendar year to bring up to two complimentary free guests to Capital One lounges and one guest to Capital One Landings, smaller lounges built for travelers who tend to spend less time at the airport, like those heading to short flights.",
      "The $75,000 spending requirement for complimentary guests matches what American Express announced two years ago, also a measure to minimize crowding and keeping the clubs feeling exclusive.",
      "Credit card companies have ramped up their airport lounge networks in recent years, opening new locations to handle demand. And airport lounge access has been a central perk attached to rewards cards, which generally come with an annual fee.",
      "The Venture X card, which launched in 2021, is $395 a year, less than the $695 a year American Express charges for its Platinum card or the $550 JPMorgan Chase charges for the Chase Sapphire Reserve, both of which come with airport lounges.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to lounges, Capital One is a challenger brand; they\u2019re an underdog,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, founder of Atmosphere Research Group.",
      "Capital One has lounges at Denver International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, Washington Dulles International Airport and Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas. It plans to open one this year at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport and one of its Landings at LaGuardia Airport.",
      "But the new restrictions show Capital One isn\u2019t immune to its popularity leading to big crowds.",
      "\u201cLike Amex, like Chase, these lounges have become victims of their own success,\u201d Harteveldt said. \u201cNo lounge operator wants them to be as overrun as the public areas of the airport.\u201d",
      "Airlines have also raised prices to access airport lounges and built larger ones to accommodate the influx.",
      "Delta Air Lines, for example, has made sweeping changes to its lounge access policies, like getting rid of unlimited visits in favor of annual caps.",
      "And last summer, Delta unveiled its first Delta One lounge, dedicated for customers in its highest class of cabin. It plans to open a new one in Seattle later this month.",
      "American Airlines and United Airlines have also expanded their airport lounges and opened new top-tier ones for customers traveling in premium classes on long-haul flights.",

    "story": [
      "Although they are very rare, cancers of the appendix are on the rise, a new study finds.",
      "An analysis of a National Cancer Institute database found that compared with older generations, rates of appendix cancer have tripled among Gen X and quadrupled among millennials, according to the report, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.",
      "\u201cThere is a disproportionate burden of appendix cancer among young individuals,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Andreana Holowatyj, an assistant professor of hematology and oncology at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center.",
      "Holowatyj\u2019s earlier research was \u201cthe first to show that 1 in every 3 appendix cancers is diagnosed among adults younger than age 50,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s compared to 1 in every 8 colorectal cancers diagnosed among adults younger than age 50.\u201d",
      "Still, appendix cancers are extremely rare: According to the National Cancer Institute, they occur at a rate of 1 to 2 per million people in the United States a year.",
      "To see whether rates of the cancer had changed over time, Holowatyj turned to the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program, which includes data from nationally representative cancer registries that cover about 45.9% of the U.S. population.",
      "Overall, there were 4,858 cases of appendix cancer from 1975 through 2019.",
      "When the large proportion of patients diagnosed between ages 18 and 49 is combined with the new finding of a generational rise in Gen X and millennials, it\u2019s \u201cimportant that we find the causes underpinning these statistics in order to reverse this trend and reduce the disease burden,\u201d Holowatyj said.",
      "The new study further confirms that there is a trend toward younger and younger patients from recent generations being hit with gastrointestinal cancers, said Dr. Andrea Cercek, a medical oncologist and a co-director of the Center for Early Onset Colorectal and GI Cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.",
      "In particular, rates of colorectal cancer in younger adults have been rising for several decades. The cause for the rise in such GI cancers needs more research.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s likely that there are environmental causes, which include exposures to food, water and micro plastics or lifestyle or dietary changes,\u201d said Cercek, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new research. \u201cYou can\u2019t really pin it down to one thing or another. It\u2019s likely multiple factors causing this rise after 1945.\u201d",
      "The appendix is a small pouch that hangs off the large intestine on the lower right side of the abdomen. A blockage can lead to infection and inflammation, called appendicitis, which needs emergency treatment.",
      "Unlike other cancers of the GI tract, appendix cancers aren\u2019t easily found because they\u2019re not as easy to see on abdominal scans and won\u2019t be picked up by colonoscopies, said Dr. Deborah Doroshow, an associate professor of medicine at the Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \u201cSo it\u2019s not easy to detect or screen for them.\u201d",
      "In fact, Holowatyj said, about 95% of appendix cancers aren\u2019t spotted until after a person has appendicitis and the appendix is removed and examined by pathologists. As a result, the cancers tend to be at a late stage with poorer long-term prognoses, she added.",
      "Doroshow, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study, said it\u2019s important for patients and their doctors to be more aware of subtle symptoms. Symptoms such as changes in energy level, a new persistent pain or unexplained weight loss in a young person shouldn\u2019t be ignored, she said.",
      "\u201cIf a person is feeling that something is not right it\u2019s always best to get an opinion,\u201d Doroshow said. \u201cWe\u2019ve diagnosed young people with cancer whom other health care providers had not taken seriously because they were young.\u201d",
      "Women and people of color may find they need to advocate for themselves, she added.",
      "Doroshow said people shouldn\u2019t be worrying about every single abdominal pain. Rather, it\u2019s persistent pain that would be a concern."

Raul Grijalva of Arizona and Sylvester Turner of Texas died in March, while Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., resigned from his House seat at the beginning of the year to join the Trump administration.",
      "Green, the chair of the Homeland Security Committee, represents a safe Republican district in Tennessee that covers middle and Western parts of the state, including parts of Nashville.",
      "Green, a former Army medic first elected in 2018, had announced his intentions to retire during Congress\u2019 previous session, but he reversed course weeks later. He won re-election in November with 59.5% of the vote.",
      "According to Tennessee law, Republican Gov. Bill Lee must order a special election within 10 days of Green's resignation, set a date for primary elections to occur within 55 to 60 days from the resignation and schedule a subsequent general election to take place within 100 to 107 days.",
      "As chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, Green oversaw impeachment proceedings against Alejandro Mayorkas, who was former President Joe Biden\u2019s secretary of homeland security. The impeachment vote fell short on the House floor."

      "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A federal judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing anti-diversity and anti-transgender executive orders in grant funding requirements that LGBTQ+ organizations say are unconstitutional.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar said Monday that the federal government cannot force recipients to halt programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion or acknowledge the existence of transgender people in order to receive grant funding. The order will remain in effect while the legal case continues, although government lawyers will likely appeal.",
      "The funding provisions \"reflect an effort to censor constitutionally protected speech and services promoting DEI and recognizing the existence of transgender individuals,\" Tigar wrote.",
      "He went on to say that the executive branch must still be bound by the Constitution in shaping its agenda and that even in the context of federal subsidies, \"it cannot weaponize Congressionally appropriated funds to single out protected communities for disfavored treatment or suppress ideas that it does not like or has deemed dangerous.\"",
      "The plaintiffs include health centers, LGBTQ+ services groups and the Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Historical Society. All receive federal funding and say they cannot complete their missions by following the president's executive orders.",
      "The San Francisco AIDS Foundation, one of the plaintiffs, said in 2023 it received a five-year grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand and enhance sexual health services, including the prevention of sexually transmitted infections. The $1.3 million project specifically targets communities disproportionately affected by sexual health disparities.",
      "But in April, the CDC informed the nonprofit that it must \"immediately terminate all programs, personnel, activities, or contracts\" that promote DEI or gender ideology.",
      "President Donald Trump has signed a flurry of executive orders since taking office in January, including ones to roll back transgender protections and stop DEI programs. Lawyers for the government say that the president is permitted to \"align government funding and enforcement strategies\" with his policies.",
      "Plaintiffs say that Congress \u2014 and not the president \u2014 has the power to condition how federal funds are used, and that the executive orders restrict free speech rights."

The bill failed to get the 60 votes it needed to advance in the Senate.",
      "One Nation, the nonprofit aligned with Senate Republicans' main super PAC, has spent at least $400,000 airing an ad reminiscent of a key tagline from one of Trump\u2019s anti-Harris ads from last year: \u201cMan-to-man defense isn\u2019t woke enough for Ossoff, he\u2019s playing for they/them.\u201d",
      "Carter\u2019s opening salvo of ads included a spot touting the congressman\u2019s MAGA credentials while a person purporting to be a transgender woman holds sports trophies and stands in front of a transgender pride flag talking about how Ossoff has been an ally to the community.",
      "Asked about the GOP criticism of that vote, Ossoff campaign communications director Ellie Dougherty told NBC News in a statement that \u201cAmerican parents don\u2019t need federal bureaucrats confirming our children\u2019s genitalia,\u201d a reference to how a state might enforce the mandate in the Republican bill.",
      "Scott Paradise, who managed Republican Herschel Walker\u2019s losing Senate campaign in 2022, told NBC News that Ossoff\u2019s first Senate run in 2020 provided a \u201cperfect storm\u201d that allowed Ossoff to position himself as a \u201ccentrist\u201d by narrowing his focus to \u201cbread-and-butter issues.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf he\u2019s talking about the economy or he\u2019s talking about moments where he has stood with the right \u2014 whether it's Middle East, to the extent he has on immigration \u2014 it\u2019s easier for him to muddy the waters. But this is such a black-and-white issue in a center-right state\u201d that allows Republicans to try to frame him as out of step, Paradise said.",
      "Polling broadly shows the American public doesn\u2019t support transgender women playing in female sports. Last month\u2019s NBC News Stay Tuned Poll, powered by SurveyMonkey found that 75% opposed it and 25% supported it. Other national polling has found similar trends.",
      "That\u2019s one reason why Trump\u2019s campaign focused heavily on the issue in ads, arguing that Harris was outside the mainstream and pointing to her past support for gender-affirming treatments for prison inmates. After the election, Democrats have disagreed over whether the party\u2019s position on transgender rights, particularly in women\u2019s sports, cost them electorally.",
      "Asked about the attacks last month during an interview on \"Political Breakfast,\" a podcast hosted by Georgia's public radio affiliate, Ossoff said the big early spending is a signal to him that \"demonstrates the national GOP understands the strength that I'll be bringing to this re-election campaign.\"",
      "The Democrat called Republicans, particularly GOP political consultants, \"obsessed and preoccupied with this issue.\"",
      "Thinking ahead about \"top of mind\" issues for voters in 2026, Ossoff added, will it be \"whether or not federal bureaucrats are investigating the sexual biology of adolescent athletes? I don\u2019t think so,\" he added.",
      "Amy Morton, a Democratic strategist in Georgia, elaborated that she believes the midterms will instead be a \"referendum on the economy\" and Trump's handling of it, emphasizing the Democratic attacks on the GOP's broad policy bill that's working its way through Congress.",
      "\"They're going to continue to lean into that issue because they don't want to talk about the issues that are really impacting Georgians,\" she said, adding, \"They made a strategic decision to wrap their arms around Donald Trump so there won't be a degree of separation between his failure as an executive and their failure.\"",
      "A Democratic strategist who worked on Sen. Raphael Warnock's successful re-election in Georgia in 2022 added that, like their former boss, Ossoff's high-profile elections have helped to define him in the state, making them skeptical that a GOP attempt to brand him as extreme will stick. They added that while Warnock's 2022 Republican opponent, Herschel Walker, leaned heavily on social issues during his unsuccessful bid, Kemp won comfortably with a very different message on the same ballot, showing how a campaign can focus on the issues it wants and leave others to the side.",
      "\"You saw Brian Kemp run an extremely disciplined race on the economy. You were hard-pressed to get Kemp on the record about abortion in 2022 \u2014 the man was laser-focused on small businesses, jobs and the economy. That was the consistent message you heard out of Brian Kemp. You compare that to Herschel Walker and, you can do the math: 300,000 votes,\" the Democrat said.",
      "But the economy was also a top issue in the 2024 election, and Trump and the Republican Party still managed to turn their attacks on trans issues into a memorable tagline that stuck with some voters. That's why one national Republican strategist told NBC News that the attack isn't a \"replacement\" for a cogent economic argument, but \"part of the equation.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an issue that obviously had a massive impact in 2024. The Trump campaign\u2019s \u2018Harris is for they/them\u2019 ad is one of the greatest ads of our generation in that it\u2019s so simple and was so effective,\u201d the strategist said.",
      "Ads about transgender participants in women's sports can run \"on top of: Oh, he also voted to help ensure that illegal immigrants get government-paid health care and he voted against the Laken Riley amendment in 2024 before it was convenient,\" the strategist added.",
      "While the transgender sports attacks are drawing headlines, both sides have been running ads focused on spending in Washington, too. Democrats have attacked the GOP\u2019s policy bill working its way through Washington, and Republicans hit Ossoff for backing former President Joe Biden\u2019s signature spending bill in 2022.",
      "Tharon Johnson, a Georgia Democratic strategist who worked for  Biden's 2020 campaign in the state, agreed that Republicans are \"going to be hard-pressed to make Jon Ossoff into this radical,\" in part because of his work both in office and on the campaign trail.",
      "And while he believes the situation Harris found herself in last year isn't the same one Ossoff finds himself in now, he said Democrats can still draw a lesson from it: \"Respond sooner, and more effectively.\"",
      "So far, Ossoff's response has been to stay focused on the economy and try to frame the debate as about local control."

    "published": "Mon, 09 Jun 2025 20:36:11 GMT",
    "summary": "The 17 members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s independent vaccine advisory committee are being removed from their posts, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
    "story": [
      "The 17 members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s independent vaccine advisory committee are being removed from their posts, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Monday afternoon.",
      "Kennedy announced the change in an editorial in The Wall Street Journal, claiming that the \u201ccommittee has been plagued with persistent conflicts of interest and has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.\u201d",
      "Such a claim is \"deeply insulting to the many scientists who contribute countless hours to the process,\" said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, an infectious disease expert with the American Academy of Pediatrics. \"We are, in fact, a model for the rest of the world.\"",
      "\"This is manufactured chaos,\" O'Leary said.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known more commonly as ACIP, consists of medical and public health experts \u2014 including pediatricians, epidemiologists and geriatricians \u2014 who make recommendations to the CDC about who should get certain vaccines, including the schedule for childhood vaccinations. Several times a year the committee holds public meetings where data is presented and reviewed.",
      "The committee reports the data to the CDC director, who then reviews the recommendations and can choose whether to adopt them. The CDC director isn't required to do so, but usually goes along with the ACIP recommendations.",
      "Members of ACIP, who undergo an extensive vetting process before being appointed, are required to disclose conflicts of interest and recuse themselves from voting on vaccines for which a conflict exists. The CDC released a database in March of some members\u2019 previous work on clinical trials or vaccine research funded by drug companies, but much of the information was already public. Many public health experts argue that past associations with the pharmaceutical industry is relevant and valuable expertise for ACIP members, as long as conflicts are disclosed.",
      "\u201cTo claim that you are doing this to restore faith in CDC is a special form of gaslighting,\u201d said a CDC employee, referring to Kennedy's comments. The employee did not want to speak on the record for fear of retribution.",
      "Dismantling the committee is among Kennedy\u2019s most aggressive actions so far to reshape U.S. vaccine policy. Kennedy rose to prominence as a high-profile figure in the anti-vaccine movement, and has made a variety of specious and debunked claims about vaccine harms. Since aligning himself with President Donald Trump and becoming head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has overseen a series of steps that have undercut vaccine access, including the pullback of funds for vaccine distribution to children of lower income families.",
      "In an interview, former CDC director Dr. Mandy Cohen said, \u201cSecretary Kennedy\u2019s unprecedented action spreads confusion and casts doubt on transparent public health processes that protect Americans. I\u2019m deeply concerned for families trying to navigate how to keep their loved ones safe.\u201d",
      "Kennedy\u2019s decision to fire ACIP members \u201cshould erase any remaining doubt that he intends to impose his personal anti-vaccine agenda on the American people,\u201d Dr. Richard Besser, the former acting director of the CDC and current president of the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said in a statement. He added that Monday\u2019s action will \u201cmake it far more difficult for pediatricians and other providers to care for their patients,\u201d since they rely on ACIP\u2019s guidance to make their own vaccine recommendations.",
      "In his editorial, Kennedy called for a \u201cclean sweep\u201d of the ACIP, but did not say who he planned to appoint to the now-vacant positions or provide a timeline for filling the roles. HHS said in a press release that ACIP will convene its next meeting from June 25 to June 27.",
      "\u201cWhat I think Kennedy is doing here is attempting to replace career civil servants with scientific expertise with those who may be more amenable to his and the Trump administration\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Matt Motta, an assistant professor of health law and policy at Boston University\u2019s School of Public Health.",
      "Motta said firing ACIP members is \u201can unequivocally clear attempt to break the promise\u201d that Kennedy made during his confirmation hearings to not limit vaccine access. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said in February that Kennedy had promised to maintain the ACIP \u201cwithout changes.\u201d Cassidy said Monday on X that he will continue to talk with Kennedy to ensure the ACIP is not \u201cfilled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion.\u201d",
      "Kennedy's shake up of the vaccine committee comes as the U.S. is experiencing a rise in vaccine-preventable outbreaks, including measles and whooping cough. Since last fall, 241 mostly unvaccinated children have died of flu-related illnesses, the highest number for a non-pandemic season since 2004.",
      "Members of the ACIP are appointed to four-year terms, and many were slated to serve on the committee for another three years. Kennedy wrote Monday that \u201cwithout removing the current members, the current Trump administration would not have been able to appoint a majority of new members until 2028.\u201d",
      "The move further degrades the federal government as a trusted source on vaccines and could force consumers, doctors and insurers to look elsewhere for expert guidance on vaccines, according to one ACIP member.",
      "\u201cThe clear implication is that CDC will no longer be credible in the space of vaccination,\u201d said the ACIP member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because their employer does not allow them to speak to the media. \u201cInsurers and other funding agencies will have to turn to the professional associations for recommendations about vaccines.\u201d"

      "After law enforcement officers spent days scouring a remote section of Washington state for a man accused of killing his three young daughters, the sheriff leading the manhunt turned the search over to federal authorities, officials said Monday.",
      "Since last week, the search for Travis Decker, 32, has covered hundreds of square miles by air, land and water, the Chelan County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a news release, and the department has reached the point \u201cwhere we need to rest our local resources.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur command staff continues to be engaged with the search command while we give our teams time off to rest and recuperate and be ready to rejoin the search for, and capture of, the suspect,\u201d the sheriff's office said.",
      "The sheriff\u2019s office remains the lead agency in the criminal investigation into the deaths of Decker\u2019s three daughters, Evelyn, 8, Paityn, 9, and Olivia Decker, 5, the department said.",
      "The girls were found dead June 2 near a campground east of Seattle after Decker failed to return them from a visitation three days before. An arrest warrant accuses him of first-degree murder and kidnapping.",
      "An autopsy completed Friday attributed the girls\u2019 deaths to suffocation, according to Monday\u2019s release. A detective previously wrote in an affidavit in support of an arrest warrant that they had bags over their heads and had been zip-tied.",
      "Two bloody handprints were found on Decker\u2019s white pickup, which was found near the girls, and one of the blood samples recovered from the scene was that of a man, the department said. Another blood sample was nonhuman.",
      "The sheriff\u2019s office said additional DNA and fingerprint analyses are being conducted.",
      "Authorities said they have collected a large amount of evidence from the scene, along with Decker\u2019s dog, which was turned over to a local animal rescue.",
      "Authorities have described Decker, a military veteran and active member of the Washington State National Guard, as a longtime outdoorsman known to go \u201coff-grid\u201d for months. The sheriff  has warned people with cabins in the area to lock their doors and leave their lights on at night.",
      "The affidavit shows that Decker\u2019s ex-wife, Whitney Decker, described her relationship with her ex-husband as cordial and said he\u2019d never previously failed to return their children. A parenting plan imposed by a court last year required him to seek mental health treatment and domestic violence-anger management counseling, but he hadn\u2019t done so, and he refused to sign the plan, according to the affidavit.",
      "Since the girls were found dead, Whitney Decker has called for reforms to the Amber Alert system, which sends out text messages to all cellphones in the area of missing children but wasn\u2019t used after she told authorities that her ex-husband had violated their parenting plan.",
      "A spokesman for the agency that manages the system, the Washington State Patrol, has said a request for an alert from local authorities didn\u2019t meet strict criteria required by the federal program."

      "CUPERTINO, Calif. \u2014 After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech\u2019s pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple tried to regain its footing Monday during an annual developers conference that focused mostly on incremental advances and cosmetic changes in its technology.",
      "The presummer rite, which attracted thousands of developers from nearly 60 countries to Apple\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters, was more subdued than the feverish anticipation that surrounded the event during the previous two years.",
      "Apple highlighted plans for more AI tools designed to simplify people\u2019s lives and make its products even more intuitive while also providing an early glimpse at the biggest redesign of its iPhone software in a decade. In doing so, Apple executives refrained from issuing bold promises of breakthroughs that punctuated recent conferences.",
      "In 2023, Apple unveiled a mixed-reality headset that has been little more than a niche product, and last year WWDC trumpeted its first major foray into the AI craze with an array of new features highlighted by the promise of a smarter and more versatile version of its virtual assistant, Siri \u2014 a goal that has hasn\u2019t been achieved yet.",
      "Apple had intended the planned Siri upgrade to herald its long-awaited attempt to become a major player in the AI craze after getting a late start in a phenomenon that so far has been largely led by OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and an array of cutting-edge startups.",
      "\u201cThis work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar,\u201d Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s top software executive, said Monday at the outset of the conference.",
      "The showcase unfolded amid nagging questions about whether Apple has lost some of the mystique and innovative drive that turned it into a tech trendsetter during its nearly 50-year history.",
      "Instead of making a big splash as it did with the Vision Pro headset and its AI suite, Apple took a mostly low-key approach that emphasized its effort to spruce up the look of its software while also unveiling a new hub for its video games and new features like a \u201cWorkout Buddy\u201d to help track physical fitness on its smartwatch.",
      "Apple executives promised will make its software more compatible with the increasingly sophisticated computer chips that have been powering its products while also making it easier to toggle between the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.",
      "\u201cOur product experience has become even more seamless and enjoyable,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told the crowd as the 90-minute showcase wrapped up.",
      "Even though it might look like Apple is becoming a technological laggard, Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson contends the company still has ample time to catch up in an AI race that\u2019s \u201cmore of a marathon, than a sprint. It will force Apple to evolve its operating systems.\u201d",
      "Besides redesigning its software. Apple will switch to a method that automakers have used to telegraph their latest car models by linking them to the year after they first arrive at dealerships. That means the next version of the iPhone operating system due out this autumn will be known as iOS 26 instead of iOS 19 \u2014 as it would be under the previous naming approach that has been used since the device\u2019s 2007 debut.",
      "The iOS 26 upgrade is expected to be released in September around the same time Apple traditionally rolls out the next iPhone models.",
      "In an early sign that AI was going to be a focal point of this year\u2019s conference, Apple opened the proceedings with a short video clip featuring Federighi speeding around a track in a Formula 1 race car. Although it was meant to promote the June 27 release of the Apple film, \u201cF1\u201d starring Brad Pitt, the segment could also be viewed as an unintentional analogy to the company\u2019s attempt to catch up to the rest of the pack in AI technology.",
      "While some of the new AI tricks compatible with the latest iPhones began rolling out late last year as part of free software updates, Apple still hasn\u2019t been able to soup up Siri in the ways that it touted at last year\u2019s conference. The delays became so glaring that a chastened Apple retreated from promoting Siri in its AI marketing campaigns earlier this year.",
      "While Apple has been struggling to make AI that meets its standards, the gap separating it from other tech powerhouses is widening. Google keeps packing more AI into its Pixel smartphone lineup while introducing more of the technology into its search engine to dramatically change the way it works. Samsung, Apple\u2019s biggest smartphone rival, is also leaning heavily into AI. Meanwhile, ChatGPT recently struck a deal that will bring former Apple design guru Jony Ive into the fold to work on a new device expected to compete against the iPhone.",
      "Besides grappling with innovation challenges, Apple also faces regulatory threats that could siphon away billions of dollars in revenue that help finance its research and development. A federal judge is currently weighing whether proposed countermeasures to Google\u2019s illegal monopoly in search should include a ban on long-running deals worth $20 billion annually to Apple while another federal judge recently banned the company from collecting commission on in-app transactions processed outside its once-exclusive payment system.",
      "On top of all that, Apple has been caught in the cross-hairs of President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China, a key manufacturing hub for the Cupertino, California, company. Cook successfully persuaded Trump to exempt the iPhone from tariffs during the president\u2019s first administration, but he has had less success during Trump\u2019s second term, which seems more determined to prod Apple to make its products in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe trade war and uncertainty linked to the tariff policy is of much more concern today for Apple\u2019s business than the perception that Apple is lagging behind on AI innovation,\u201d Husson said.",
      "The multi-dimensional gauntlet facing Apple is spooking investors, causing the company\u2019s stock price to plunge by nearly 20% so far this year \u2014 a decline that has erased $750 billion in shareholder wealth. After beginning the year as the most valuable company in the world, Apple now ranks third behind longtime rival Microsoft, another AI leader, and AI chipmaker Nvidia.",
      "Apple\u2019s shares slipped by more than 1% in Monday\u2019s late afternoon trading \u2014 an early indication the company\u2019s latest announcements didn\u2019t inspire investors."

      "The actor shared that she gained more than 30 pounds and spent months training for the role, telling W Magazine, \u201cMy body was completely different.\u201d",
      "\u201cI loved it,\u201d she said. \u201cI came onboard to play Christy, and I had about three and a half months of training. I started eating. I weight-trained in the morning for an hour, kickboxed midday for about two hours, and then weight-trained again at night for an hour.\u201d",
      "Amid her intense workout routine and weight gain, Sweeney shared that she went up four sizes and \u201cdidn\u2019t fit in any of my clothes.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m usually a size 23 in jeans, and I was wearing a size 27. My boobs got bigger. And my butt got huge. It was crazy! I was like, Oh my God,\u201d she reportedly laughed. \u201cBut it was amazing: I was so strong, like crazy strong.\u201d",
      "To also become Martin, the \u201cAnyone But You\u201d star also had to wear brown contact lenses and a brown wig that was styled as a mullet.",

      "The actor later shared footage of her boxing workout routine in the gym following a montage of negative comments about her appearance. Start TODAY trainer Stephanie Mansour previously noted that the moves Sweeney was performing in the quick video are upper body boxing moves which work the shoulders, biceps, back and core.",
      "In her W Magazine interview, it stated that Sweeney later had to drop the weight in seven weeks for her next project. While it didn\u2019t go into detail about how she shed the pounds, the actor did share that she\u2019s always loved sports.",
      "\u201cI love being outside. I was on the ski team, and I wakeboarded. I slalom ski on water. I was on the soccer team and the softball team. And then my parents got me into grappling, which is like wrestling, and kickboxing,\u201d she said. \u201cI was the only girl at the dojo. I trained there from 13 until about 19. I fought all guys. I liked to think that if s--- went down, I might be able to step up.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Demi Engemann is setting the record straight about her noticeable absence from the upcoming \"Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" reunion.",
      "Hulu recently announced that the hit reality series was getting a reunion special following the success of Season 2. When the streaming service released photos from filming, however, many eagle-eyed viewers quickly noticed that Engemann wasn't in attendance.",
      "Now, the #MomTok influencer is explaining why.",
      "While answering fan questions on her Instagram story on June 9, Engemann confirmed that she was invited to the reunion but was unable to attend.",
      "\"It was short notice and the only day they could get the location secured was the day that me and my entire family did Disneyland. We had already booked all of our flights and the Airbnb was nonrefundable or I would've moved the trip to be there,\" she noted. \"I tried to have production move it to another day and they couldn't swing it sadly.\"",
      "In a separate slide posted to her Instagram story, Engemann addressed the rumors that she wasn't invited to the \"MomTok: The Unholy Tea\" live event in Las Vegas, which took place on June 7 and featured many of her co-stars.",
      "\"I was and opted out of this one. It looked like it was fun though!\" the reality star wrote.",
      "Why is Demi feuding with her co-stars?",
      "Season 2 of \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" was fraught with drama and Engemann often found herself at the center of it.",
      "The #MomTok star was previously super tight with her co-star Jessi Ngatikaura, but their friendship was put to the test when rumors spread that Engemann may have been willing to accept a larger salary if it meant that Ngatikaura was no longer on the show.",
      "Things went further downhill when Taylor Frankie Paul told Ngatikaura that Engemann had previously talked negatively about her salon and her work as a hairstylist.",
      "Additionally, Engemann ran into some drama with Frankie Paul and suggested that she would leave #MomTok if Frankie Paul remained in the friend group.",
      "In an interview with Variety, Frankie Paul addressed her rift with Engemann, reminding readers that their feud occurred months ago.",
      "\"Time heals all wounds. For me, I don\u2019t have the energy to store the resentment, this hatred towards girlfriends. I am surviving things in my personal life, with my family and home, so I don\u2019t have the energy for that,\" she said.",
      "How to watch the 'Secret Lives of Mormon Wives' reunion",
      "The \"Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" reunion special will premiere on Tuesday, July 1, 2025 and will be hosted by Nick Viall. It will be available to stream on Hulu and Hulu on Disney+.",
      "According to a press release, the TV special will \"uncover secrets and scandals, never-before-seen footage, and a surprise announcement.\""

      "Blake Lively and her legal team are claiming a \"victory\" after a federal judge tossed out Justin Baldoni's $400 million countersuit against Lively, her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and their publicist \u2014 and also dismissed the \"It Ends with Us\" director and actor's lawsuit against The New York Times.",
      "On June 9, Judge Lewis J. Liman of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted a motion to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the Wayfarer Parties, which includes Baldoni, accusing Lively, Reynolds and their publicist, Leslie Sloane, of defamation and extortion after Lively filed a sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni, according to court documents obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "Baldoni's team also sued The New York Times for libel over an article published about Lively's sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni in December 2024.",
      "In the opinion section of his dismissal, Judge Liman said Baldoni and Wayfarer Parties \"have not alleged that Lively is responsible for any statements other than the statements in her CRD complaint, which are privileged.\"",
      "\u201cThe Wayfarer Parties have alleged that Reynolds and Sloane made additional statements accusing Baldoni of sexual misconduct and that the Times made additional statements accusing the Wayfarer Parties of engaging in a smear campaign,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cBut the Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Reynolds, Sloane or the Times would have seriously doubted these statements were true based on the information available to them, as is required for them to be liable for defamation under applicable law.\u201d",
      "Judge Liman added, \"Even if they turn out to be unneeded, an employee can insist on protections at workplace for sexual harassment without being accused of extortion. If an employer accedes, it cannot later claim to be a victim of the employee\u2019s wrongful threats.\u201d",
      "The judge is permitting Baldoni's team to resubmit an amended complaint against Lively, Reynolds, publicist Leslie Sloan and The New York Times for their contract-related claims by June 23. The civil extortion and defamation claims were dismissed with prejudice and cannot be resubmitted.",
      "Lively's lawyers Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb celebrated Judge Liman's dismissal of Baldoni's countersuit, claiming a \"complete vindication\" for their clients.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s opinion is a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties dragged into their retaliatory lawsuit, including Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Sloane and The New York Times,\u201d they told TODAY.com in a statement.",
      "\u201cAs we have said from day one, this \u2018$400 million\u2019 lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it. We look forward to the next round, which is seeking attorneys\u2019 fees, treble damages and punitive damages against Baldoni, Sarowitz, Nathan, and the other Wayfarer Parties who perpetrated this abusive litigation,\u201d they added.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to attorneys for Baldoni for comment.",
      "Lively and Baldoni's legal woes began in December 2024 when Lively filed her sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni for his alleged behavior on the set of \"It Ends with Us,\" which was primarily shot in New Jersey.",
      "Since then, the high-profile case has been filled with legal twists and turns that would be at home in a Hollywood courtroom drama.",
      "After Baldoni sued The New York Times in December 2024 for the newspaper's story about Lively's complaint, Lively initiated litigation against Baldoni the same month in a federal court in New York.",
      "In January 2024, Baldoni sued Lively for defamation. The following month, the actor and director launched a website about his lawsuit with Lively that included text messages between the two stars as well as between Baldoni and Reynolds.",
      "In February, Lively amended her sexual harassment complaint to suggest she wasn't the only one on the \"It Ends with Us\" set to accuse Baldoni of misconduct.",
      "The case is set to go to trial on March 9, 2026."

I thought we were just going to be here together. I thought it was just going to be me and you,'\" he said.",
      "\"And I reach in my backpack, and I'm like, 'Is this what you want?' And she goes, 'No! You will not propose to me like this!' So I stuffed ... the ring back in the bag, and somehow, we have a beautiful day,\" he continued.",
      "And about 24 hours later, the pair were watching the sun go down on a beach, recommended to him by his castmate Miles Teller.",
      "\"I'm just like panicking, freaking out and she turns and she like looks away to look at the sunset, and as she looks, I reach in my bag and I pull it out and she turns around and I say, 'Can we do this again? Will you marry me?' And that was it,\" he said.",
      "Jenna was delighted by the story: \"See? Even bad proposals end up OK! We all have them.\"",
      "Ellis and Senicar tied the knot in 2022 and share two children together: Nora Grace and Noa Gray."

    "story": [
      "Benicio del Toro was almost at a loss for words after Academy Award-winning director Wes Anderson asked him to be in his new movie, \"The Phoenician Scheme.\"",
      "On the June 8 episode of Sunday Sitdown with Willie Geist, del Toro recalled his conversation with Anderson, telling Geist, \"He said, 'I want you to be part of my next film.'\" He never said, 'I\u2019m writing something for you.'\"",
      "\"That would have scared the hell out of me,\" del Toro quips.",
      "\"It still scared the hell out of me when I read the script, because I thought it was fantastic and it was a lot of heavy lifting,\" he continued. \"Because f---, I\u2019m in it quite a bit. But when you get Wes Anderson calling you and offering you any part \u2014 but in this case, a hell of a part, it\u2019s like getting a motivational pill. You\u2019re just motivated.\"",
      "In \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\" del Toro plays Zsa-zsa Korda, a wealthy businessman, who has cheated death far too many times. Realizing that one day he might not be able to make it out alive, he decides to appoint his only daughter Liesel (Mia Threapleton), as his successor and finally complete his long-awaited project \u2014 the Korda Land and Sea Phoenician Infrastructure Scheme.",
      "When asked what it felt like to be the leading man in a Wes Anderson flick, del Toro said \"there\u2019s room for wiggling\" and \"room for doin\u2019 your thing within his.\"",
      "\"When you work with Wes, you trust him,\" he added.",
      "\u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\" is not the only movie that del Toro and Anderson have done together. In 2021, the pair teamed up for Anderson's film \"The French Dispatch,\" where del Toro played Moses Rosenthaler, a renowned artist serving life in prison for murder.",
      "\"How do you describe being inside the world of Wes Anderson?\" Geist asked.",
      "\"I got to be in the moment. Wes wants you to be as honest as you can be, like any other director,\" he said. \"I think Wes Anderson movies, when I see them \u2014 and I\u2019ve been in two \u2014 they feel like they\u2019re 3D, like they\u2019re almost tactile media. You almost can touch it, like a pop-up book in some ways. And also the humor and the heart.\"",
      "\u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d which hit theaters on May 30, featured a star-studded cast including Michael Cera, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks, among others. It also starred Threapleton, who is the daughter of Academy Award winner Kate Winslet.",
      "Del Toro talked about how he auditioned Threapleton for the role of his nun daughter.",
      "\"She was the top contender. We were doin\u2019 the scene, and then we finished, and I locked eyes with her, and she locked eyes with me, and she didn\u2019t blink,\" he recalled. \"And then we went on. And then I remember telling Wes, you know, 'I think that\u2019s exactly what Zsa-zsa needs.'\""

      "\u201cWe will dismantle Hamas because we cannot live with this terror organization right in our backyard, right across our border,\u201d Defrin said.",

    "story": [
      "Leaders of an aid organization that has sent more than 100 Haitian children with serious cardiac conditions to the U.S. for heart surgery said President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on travelers from 19 countries will stall or cancel lifesaving procedures for at least a dozen children or young adults.",
      "The ban, which goes into effect Monday, has led to widespread uncertainty for many and drawn condemnation from international leaders. The proclamation issued Tuesday offered exceptions for those who are lawful permanent U.S. residents and those traveling to the U.S. for the World Cup and the Olympics, among other examples. No such mention was made for cases of medical necessity, such as those who are seeking treatment in the U.S. through the International Cardiac Alliance.",
      "The International Cardiac Alliance\u2019s total waitlist for Haitians, ranging from infants to young adults, totals at least 316 people who need heart surgery, said Executive Director Owen Robinson. Some are placed in hospitals in the Dominican Republic and occasionally the Cayman Islands. But there are currently five open surgical slots in the U.S.",
      "\u201cSome of them might be able to wait a few months, and others, if they don\u2019t go now, they\u2019re going to pass away very quickly,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "The president\u2019s executive order adds that the secretary of state can issue exemptions for visas in cases that \u201cserve a United States national interest.\u201d It is unclear if clients of the International Cardiac Alliance with medical needs would fit into that description. Neither the White House nor the State Department responded to a request for comment on the matter.",
      "\u201cWe do have kids die every week waiting because there\u2019s not a lot of international slots for these kids,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "Some of the children in the program travel directly from their home country to the U.S., undergo surgery, and then return to Haiti. But for many Haitians, international travel requires multiple levels of logistical wrangling, Robinson said. Some patients and their parents who can secure surgeries in other countries must apply for a visa to the U.S., travel here, and then head to their eventual destination. The United States\u2019 travel ban now throws a wrench in that process.",
      "Fabienne Rene, 16, was diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in February. Because of her condition, Fabienne, who lives in Port-au-Prince, cannot even attend school since she experiences shortness of breath, said her father, Fignole Rene. The \u201cbad news\u201d he received about the travel ban causing the postponement or potential cancellation of his daughter\u2019s travel through the U.S. to the Dominican Republic is \u201creally disturbing and breaking my heart,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI was not waiting to hear something like that,\u201d Rene, 53, said in Creole through a translator. \u201cWe know for sure that there is nowhere in Haiti we can have this possibility. The only option that we have was just waiting to have an open door from the Cardiac Alliance.\u201d",
      "He also said the news will be troubling for his family to hear and that they don\u2019t know \u201cwhere they will find another open door that can give her a chance.\u201d",
      "Robinson said the U.S. Embassy in Haiti recently informed him that it most likely wouldn\u2019t be able to issue any visas due to the travel ban. In the past, the embassy has repeatedly issued visas for Haitian children to travel to the U.S. for care. The office of Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., has offered to reach out to the State Department to see if the children can receive exceptions, he added.",
      "Dr. John Clark, a pediatric cardiologist at Akron Children\u2019s Hospital in Ohio who has worked with the ICA, said many children in impoverished countries like Haiti suffer from Fabienne\u2019s condition because they are not seen by a doctor and treated for the common illness strep throat. Untreated, recurring strep infections can lead to rheumatic heart disease.",
      "St. Damien Pediatric Hospital in Port-au-Prince received visiting pediatric surgical teams from 2015 to 2019, Robinson said. Now, dangerous conditions in Haiti prevent doctors from other countries from entering or providing care. Meanwhile, Haiti does not have enough doctors practicing there, and the loss of opportunities for a medical education in Haiti only perpetuates the problem, Clark said.",
      "Clark participated in a surgical mission there in 2019, when visiting U.S. doctors were performing two heart surgeries per day, he said. A drastic rise in gang violence \u2014 including an attack on one of the hospital\u2019s ambulances and a worker being stoned to death \u2014 ended most medical missions to Haiti.",
      "Gang violence has only escalated since then, United Nations figures show, particularly after the assassination of Haiti\u2019s President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in 2021. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world, and more than half of Haitians live below the poverty line. The country is also plagued with government corruption, gang violence and food insecurity, as well as vulnerability to natural disasters, including a devastating 2010 earthquake that killed at least 220,000 people. Lack of adequate health care also fuels diseases like cholera, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\u201cI hope things can calm down one day enough that we can get back there [to Haiti],\u201d Clark said. \u201cBut right now, there\u2019s no way for us to go back down.\u201d",
      "Andrice Boncoeur of Port-au-Prince received free open-heart surgery at CEDIMAT Cardiovascular Center in the Dominican Republic to repair a valve when he was 9 years old. That procedure, however, was only meant to be a temporary solution. Now, plans for Andrice, 16, to travel through the U.S. for more permanent surgery have been disrupted.",
      "On Thursday, Andrice\u2019s father, Andre Boncoeur, said he had not yet told his son about the travel ban preventing him from passing through the U.S. Boncoeur said he knows \u201csomething can change at any time.\u201d",
      "Still, children like Andrice do not have much time to wait. In April, Andrice was once again hospitalized for three days at Haiti\u2019s Centre Hospitalier Eben-Ezer for heart failure. Boncoeur said his family has spent \u201ceverything that we had\u201d and that their funds are \u201calmost gone.\u201d He said he hopes the situation will change so that his son, who aspires to become a pastor, \u201ccan have a chance to live his life as a normal kid.\u201d",
      "Clark, Robinson and the patient\u2019s parents all agree it comes down to the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to accommodate the sick children.",
      "\u201cThese children are somebody\u2019s child and somebody\u2019s grandchild  and they don\u2019t have access to lifesaving care,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIs there any room for compassion?\u201d"

He asked for a \u201c400% increase in air and missile defense\u201d and added that \u201cmilitaries also need thousands more armored vehicles and tanks, millions more artillery shells, and we must double our enabling capabilities, such as logistics, supply, transportation, and medical support.\u201d",
      "\u201cWishful thinking will not keep us safe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot dream away the danger. Hope is not a strategy. So NATO has to become a stronger, fairer and more lethal alliance.\u201d",
      "Rutte's speech comes against the backdrop of European powers vowing to spend more on their military budgets, having relied for decades upon America's protection first against the Soviet Union and now Putin's revanchist Kremlin.",
      "NATO's constituents must also maintain a balancing act when it comes to Ukraine, which is not a member. Kyiv's allies want to support a neighbor it sees as a bulwark against Russian aggression while keeping a White House increasingly sympathetic to Moscow's worldview onside.",
      "Trump has described his \u201cvery, very good relationship\u201d with Putin, a man considered a pariah by former President Joe Biden and other Western leaders.",
      "Many officials and analysts in Europe acknowledge that Trump is right to demand that wealthy nations such as Germany be able to look after themselves without Washington's help.",
      "However, many of these same commentators have expressed their horror at the tactics used by Trump, who has suggested that the United States would not protect underpaying allies and openly invited Russia to \u201cdo whatever the hell\u201d it wants to them.",
      "That risks shattering the central premise of NATO: Article 5 of its founding charter \u2014 an \u201call-for-one and one-for-all\u201d mutual defense promise suggesting that if one ally is attacked, the rest would come to its aid.",
      "The scenario the founders had in mind was that the U.S. would join the fight if Russia decided to launch an act of aggression against a smaller European country. In practice, however, the only time it has been used in the real world was the other way round, when the alliance lent Washington symbolic defensive help after 9/11.",
      "Previous American presidents have always seen this as a good trade off: America underwrites European security, and in return has a huge influence over political, diplomatic and even cultural happenings on the continent and beyond. The soft power return on investment was always seen as a profitable one.",
      "However, Trump has repeatedly questioned this logic, not only undermining the promise behind Article 5 but using hostile language against those historically considered Western brethren.",
      "The realization among European allies that Washington is no longer committed to its mutual defense has sparked a drive to push up defense budgets and revive the long-since dormant arms industry on the continent."

    "story": [
      "The third U.N. Ocean Conference opens Monday, with Britain's Prince William among those raising the pressure on nations to turn decades of promises into real protection for the sea.",
      "The summit comes as just 2.7% of the ocean is effectively protected from destructive extractive activities, according to the nonprofit Marine Conservation Institute. That is far below the target agreed under the \u201c30x30\u201d pledge to conserve 30% of land and sea by 2030.",
      "Atop this year\u2019s agenda is ratification of the High Seas Treaty. Adopted in 2023, the treaty would for the first time allow nations to establish marine protected areas in international waters, which cover nearly two-thirds of the ocean and are largely ungoverned.",
      "Speaking ahead of the conference, Britain's Prince William said Sunday that rising sea temperatures, plastic pollution and overfishing were putting pressure on fragile ecosystems and the people who depend on them.",
      "\u201cWhat once seemed an abundant resource is diminishing before our eyes,\u201d William, heir to the British throne, told the Blue Economy and Finance Forum in Monaco. He described the challenge as being \u201clike none we have faced before\u201d.",
      "\u201cPut simply: the ocean is under enormous threat, but it can revive itself. But, only if together, we act now,\u201d he told the meeting of investors and policymakers.",
      "Mauro Randone, regional projects manager at the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s Mediterranean Marine Initiative, said that \u201cit\u2019s the Wild West out there with countries just fishing anywhere without any sort of regulation, and that needs to change.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe high seas belong to everyone and no one practically at the same time, and countries are finally committing to establish some rules,\u201d he added.",
      "The ocean is critical in stabilizing Earth\u2019s climate and sustaining life. It generates 50% of the oxygen we breathe, absorbs around 30% of carbon dioxide emissions and captures more than 90% of the excess heat caused by those emissions. Without a healthy ocean, experts warn, climate goals will remain out of reach.",
      "The treaty will only come into force once 60 countries ratify it. As of Monday, just 32 countries had. Advocates hope UNOC can build enough momentum to cross the threshold, which would allow for the first official Oceans Conference of Parties.",
      "\u201cTwo-thirds of the ocean is areas beyond national jurisdiction \u2014 that\u2019s half our planet,\u201d said Minna Epps, director of global ocean policy at the International Union for Conservation of Nature. \u201cWe cannot possibly protect 30% of the ocean if it doesn\u2019t include the high seas.\u201d",
      "South Korea, France and the European Union have championed the treaty, but most large ocean nations have yet to ratify it, including the rest of the G20. Thousands of attendees are expected in Nice, from delegates and heads of state to scientists and industry leaders. The United States has yet to confirm a formal delegation.",
      "Beyond new commitments, the conference highlights the growing gap between marine protection declarations and real-world conservation.",
      "France, the conference co-host, claims to have surpassed the 30% target for marine protection. But environmental groups say only 3% of French waters are fully protected from harmful activities such as bottom trawling and industrial fishing.",
      "\u201cThe government declares these as protected areas, but this is a lie,\u201d said Enric Sala, founder of the National Geographic Pristine Seas marine reserve project. \u201cMost of it is political box-ticking. It\u2019s all paper parks.\u201d",
      "That criticism is echoed across the continent. A new World Wildlife Fund report found that although more than 11% of Europe\u2019s marine area is designated for protection, just 2% of E.U. waters have management plans in place.",
      "Fabien Boileau, director of marine protected areas at France\u2019s Office for Biodiversity, acknowledged the presence of bottom trawling in French protected areas, but said it was part of a phased strategy.",
      "\u201cIn France, we made the choice to designate large marine protected areas with relatively low levels of regulation at first, betting that stronger protections would be developed over time through local governance,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, we\u2019re gradually increasing the number of zones with stricter protections within those areas.\u201d",
      "Advocates say industrial fishing lobbies continue to resist stricter protections, despite evidence that well-managed reserves boost long-term fisheries through the \u201cspillover effect,\u201d whereby marine life flourishes in nearby waters.",
      "\u201cProtection is not the problem \u2014 overfishing is the problem,\u201d Sala said. \u201cThe worst enemy of the fishing industry is themselves.\u201d",
      "The conference will feature 10 panels on topics such as blue finance, sustainable fisheries and plastic pollution. Deep sea mining is expected to feature in broader discussions, while small island states are likely to use the platform to advocate for increased climate adaptation funding.",
      "The outcome of these discussions will form the basis of the Nice Ocean Action Plan, a declaration of voluntary commitments to be adopted by consensus and presented at the United Nations in New York this July.",
      "\u201cThere cannot be a healthy planet without a healthy ocean,\u201d said Peter Thomson, U.N. special envoy for the ocean. \u201cIt\u2019s urgent business for us all.\u201d"

      "Israel says it has retrieved the body of a 35-year-old Thai hostage who was abducted into Gaza during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the war.",
      "Nattapong Pinta was among 31 Thais taken by the Hamas militant group. Thailand\u2019s foreign ministry in a statement Saturday confirmed that Pinta, the last Thai hostage in Gaza, was confirmed dead. It said the bodies of two others have yet to be retrieved.",
      "The ministry has said 46 Thais have been killed during the war. Thais were the largest group of foreigners held captive by Hamas. They were among tens of thousands of Thai workers in Israel. Here\u2019s a look at what they were doing.",
      "Why are there so many Thais in Israel?",
      "Israel once relied heavily on Palestinian workers, but it started bringing in large numbers of migrant workers after the 1987-93 Palestinian revolt, known as the first Intifada.",
      "Most came from Thailand, and Thais remain the largest group of foreign agricultural laborers in Israel today, earning considerably more than they can at home.",
      "Thailand and Israel implemented a bilateral agreement a decade ago to ease the way for workers in the agriculture sector.",
      "Israel has come under criticism for the conditions under which the Thai farm laborers work. A Human Rights Watch report in 2015 said they often were housed in makeshift and inadequate accommodation and \u201cwere paid salaries significantly below the legal minimum wage, forced to work long hours in excess of the legal maximum, subjected to unsafe working conditions and denied their right to change employers.\u201d",
      "A watchdog group found more recently that most were still paid below the legal minimum wage.",
      "How many Thai nationals work in Israel?",
      "There were about 30,000 Thai workers, primarily working on farms, in Israel prior to the attack by Hamas.",
      "In the wake of the attack, some 7,000 returned home, primarily on government evacuation flights, but higher wages than those available at home have continued to attract new arrivals.",
      "The Thai ambassador to Israel, Pannabha Chandraramya, recently said there are now more than 38,000 Thai workers in the country.",
      "What happened after some left?",
      "Faced with a labor shortage in the wake of the exodus, Israel\u2019s Agriculture Ministry announced incentives to try to attract foreign workers back to evacuated areas.",
      "Among other things, it offered to extend work visas and to pay bonuses of about $500 a month.",
      "Thailand\u2019s Labor Ministry granted 3,966 Thai workers permission to work in Israel in 2024, keeping Israel in the top four destinations for Thais working abroad last year.",
      "Thai migrant workers generally come from poorer regions of the country, especially the northeast, and even before the bonuses, the jobs in Israel paid many times what they could make at home."

      "The tattoos covering Iranian rapper Tataloo\u2019s face stand out against the gray prison uniform the 37-year-old now wears as he awaits execution, his own rise and fall tracing the chaos of the last decade of Iranian politics.",
      "Tataloo, whose full name is Amir Hossein Maghsoudloo, faces a death sentence after being convicted on charges of \u201cinsulting Islamic sanctities.\u201d It\u2019s a far cry from when he once supported a hard-line Iranian presidential candidate.",
      "Tataloo\u2019s music became popular among the Islamic Republic\u2019s youth, as it challenged Iran\u2019s theocracy at a time when opposition to the country\u2019s government was splintered and largely leaderless.",
      "The rapper\u2019s lyrics became increasingly political after the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini and the subsequent wave of nationwide protests. He also appeared in music videos which criticized the authorities.",
      "\u201cWhen you show your face in a music video, you are saying, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m here, and I don\u2019t care about your restrictions,\u2019\u201d said Ali Hamedani, a former BBC journalist who interviewed the rapper in 2005. \u201cThat was brave.\u201d",
      "The Iranian Supreme Court last month upheld his death sentence.",
      "\u201cThis ruling has now been confirmed and is ready for execution,\u201d judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir told reporters at a press conference last month.",
      "Activists have decried his looming execution and expressed concern for his safety after he reportedly tried to kill himself in prison.",
      "Tataloo began his music career in 2003 as part of an underground genre of Iranian music that combines Western styles of rap, rhythm-and-blues and rock with Farsi lyrics. His first album, released in 2011, polarized audiences, though he never played publicly in Iran, where its Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance controls all concerts.",
      "Tataloo appeared in a 2015 music video backing Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and Tehran\u2019s nuclear program, which long has been targeted by the West over fears it could allow the Islamic Republic to develop an atomic bomb. While he never discussed the motivation behind this, it appeared that the rapper had hoped to win favor with the theocracy or perhaps have a travel ban against him lifted.",
      "In the video for \u201cEnergy Hasteei,\u201d or \u201cNuclear Energy,\u201d Tataloo sings a power ballad in front of rifle-wielding guardsmen and later aboard the Iranian frigate Damavand in the Caspian Sea. The ship later sank during a storm in 2018.",
      "\u201cThis is our absolute right: To have an armed Persian Gulf,\u201d Tataloo sang.",
      "Tataloo even issued an endorsement for hard-liner Ebrahim Raisi in 2017. That year, the two sat for a televised appearance as part of Raisi\u2019s failed presidential campaign against the relative moderate Hassan Rouhani. Raisi later won the presidency in 2021, but was killed in a helicopter crash in 2024.",
      "Fame in Turkey, prison back in Iran",
      "In 2018, Tataloo \u2014 who faced legal problems in Iran \u2014 was allowed to leave the country for Turkey, where many Persian singers and performers stage lucrative concerts.",
      "Tataloo hosted live video sessions as he rose to fame on social media, where he became well-known for his tattoos covering his face and body. Among them are an Iranian flag and an image of his mother next to a key and heart.",
      "Instagram deactivated his account in 2020 after he called for underage girls to join his \u201cteam\u201d for sex. He also acknowledged taking drugs.",
      "\u201cDespite being a controversial rapper, Tataloo has quite the fanbase in Iran, known as \u2018Tatalities,\u2019\u201d said Holly Dagres, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near-East Policy. \u201cOver the years, they\u2019ve flooded social media with messages of solidarity for him and even campaigned for the rapper\u2019s release in the past when he was detained on separate charges.\u201d",
      "Tataloo\u2019s rebellious music struck a chord with disenfranchised young people in Iran as they struggled to find work, get married and start their adult lives. He also increasingly challenged Iran\u2019s theocracy in his lyrics, particularly after the death of Amini following her arrest over allegedly not wearing the hijab to the liking of authorities.",
      "His collaboration \u201cEnghelab Solh\u201d \u2014 \u201cPeace Revolution\u201d in Farsi \u2014 called out Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei by name.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want tear gas, because there are tears in everyone\u2019s eyes,\u201d he rapped.",
      "But the music stopped for Tataloo in late 2023. He was deported from Turkey after his passport had expired, and was immediately taken into custody upon arrival to Iran.",
      "Death sentence draws protests",
      "Tehran\u2019s Criminal Court initially handed Tataloo a five-year sentence for blasphemy. Iran\u2019s Supreme Court threw out the decision and sent his case to another court, which sentenced him to death in January. The rapper already faced ten years in prison for a string of separate convictions, including promoting prostitution and moral corruption.",
      "\u201cTataloo is at serious risk of execution,\u201d Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, the director of advocacy group Iran Human Rights, said in a statement. \u201cThe international community, artists and the public must act to stop his execution.\u201d",
      "Tataloo earlier expressed remorse at a trial.",
      "\u201cI have certainly made mistakes, and many of my actions were wrong,\u201d he said, according to the state-owned Jam-e Jam daily newspaper. \u201cI apologize for the mistakes I made.\u201d",
      "Tataloo married while on death row, his uncle said. Last month, Tataloo reportedly attempted to kill himself, but survived.",
      "His death sentence comes at a politically fraught moment for Iran as the country is at it\u2019s \u201cmost isolated,\u201d said Abbas Milani, an Iran expert at Stanford University.",
      "The Islamic Republic is \u201cdesperately trying to see whether it can arrive at a deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program and have the sanctions lifted,\u201d he said. Drawing the ire of Tataloo\u2019s fans is \u201cone headache they don\u2019t need,\u201d he added."

      "\u201cDespite prior warnings that the area is an active combat zone during nighttime hours, several suspects attempted to approach IDF troops operating in the Tel al-Sultan area overnight, in a manner that posed a threat to the troops,\u201d the IDF said. \u201cThe troops called out to the suspects to drive them away, but as they continued advancing in a way that endangered the troops, the soldiers responded with warning shots.\u201d",
      "The IDF did not specify what threat the \u201csuspects\u201d posed and did not take accountability for the reported deaths but said it \u201cis aware of the reports of casualties.\u201d",
      "This is the fourth incident in a week where local health officials said Palestinians were killed near aid distribution centers.",
      "On Sunday, more than 30 people were killed in Rafah and hundreds were injured, according to local health officials and aid workers. Speaking with NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground, four witnesses said they came under fire from the air and on the ground while they were waiting to collect aid near a distribution site.",
      "An Israeli military official told NBC News that troops fired \u201cwarning shots\u201d at \u201cseveral suspects\u201d about a half-mile from the aid distribution center, calling reports of casualties at the site \u201cfalse claims.\u201d",

      "The offer comes days after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a sweeping travel ban on 12 countries, including Afghanistan. The measure largely bars Afghans hoping to resettle in the United States permanently as well as those hoping to go to the U.S. temporarily, such as for university study.",
      "Trump also suspended a core refugee program in January, all but ending support for Afghans who had allied with the U.S. and leaving tens of thousands of them stranded.",
      "Afghans in neighboring Pakistan who are awaiting resettlement are also dealing with a deportation drive by the Islamabad government to get them out of the country. Almost a million have left Pakistan since October 2023 to avoid arrest and expulsion.",

      "The Russia-backed Wagner Group said Friday it is leaving Mali after more than three and a half years of fighting Islamic extremists and insurgents in the country.",
      "Despite Wagner\u2019s announcement, Russia will continue to have a mercenary presence in the West African country. The Africa Corps, Russia\u2019s state-controlled paramilitary force, said on its Telegram channel Friday that Wagner\u2019s departure would not introduce any changes and the Russian contingent will remain in Mali.",
      "\u201cMission accomplished. Private Military Company Wagner returns home,\u201d the group announced via its channel on the messaging app Telegram. It said it had brought all regional capitals under control of the Malian army, pushed out armed militants and killed their commanders.",
      "Mali, along with neighbors Burkina Faso and Niger, has for more than a decade battled an insurgency fought by armed groups, including some allied with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.",
      "As Western influence in the region has waned, Russia has sought to step into the vacuum, sweeping in with offers of assistance. Moscow initially expanded its military cooperation with African nations by using the Wagner Group of mercenaries. But since the group\u2019s leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was killed in a plane crash in 2023, after mounting a brief armed rebellion in Russia that challenged the rule of President Vladimir Putin, Moscow has been developing the Africa Corps as a rival force to Wagner.",
      "Africa Corps is under direct command of the Russian defense ministry.",

      "Beverly Ochieng, a security analyst specializing in the Sahel for Control Risks consultancy, said the Russian defense ministry had been negotiating with Mali to take on more Africa Corps fighters and for Wagner mercenaries to join Russia\u2019s state-controlled paramilitary force.",
      "\u201cSince the death of Prigozhin, Russia has had this whole plan to then make the Wagner Group fall under the command of the Ministry of Defense. One of the steps they made was to revamp or introduce the Africa Corps, which is the way in which the Russian paramilitaries would retain a presence in areas where the Wagner group has been operating,\u201d Ochieng said.",
      "Wagner has been present in Mali since late 2021 following a military coup, replacing French troops and international peacekeepers to help fight the militants. But the Malian army and Russian mercenaries struggled to curb violence in the country and have both been accused of targeting civilians.",
      "Last month, United Nations experts urged Malian authorities to investigate reports of alleged summary executions and forced disappearances by Wagner mercenaries and the army.",
      "In December, Human Rights Watch accused Malian armed forces and the Wagner Group of deliberately killing at least 32 civilians over an 8-month span.",
      "The announcement of Wagner\u2019s withdrawal comes as the Malian army and the Russian mercenaries suffered heavy losses during attacks by the al-Qaida linked group JNIM in recent weeks.",
      "Last week, JNIM fighters killed dozens of soldiers in an attack on a military base in central Mali.",
      "Rida Lyammouri, a Sahel expert at the Morocco-based Policy Center for the New South, said the major losses might have caused the possible end of Wagner\u2019s mission.",
      "\u201cThe lack of an official and mutual announcement from both the Malian authorities and Wagner indicate possible internal dispute which led to this sudden decision. Simultaneously, this could point to a new framework for Russian presence in the country,\u201d he said.",
      "Replacing Wagner with Africa Corps troops would likely shift Russia\u2019s focus in Mali from fighting alongside the Malian army to training, said Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel program at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation.",
      "\u201cAfrica Corps has a lighter footprint and focuses more on training, providing equipment and doing protection services. They fight less than the \u2018Rambo-type\u2019 Wagner mercenaries,\u201d Laessing said."

      "Israel says it has retrieved the body of a Thai hostage kidnapped into Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, as it continues its military offensive across the strip, killing at least 22 people overnight, according to health officials.",
      "The Prime Minister\u2019s office said Saturday that the body of Thai citizen Nattapong Pinta was returned to Israel in a special military operation.",
      "Pinta was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz and killed in captivity near the start of the war, said the government.",
      "This comes two days after the bodies of two Israeli-American hostages were retrieved. Fifty-five hostages remain in Gaza, of whom Israel says more than half are dead.",
      "The defense minister said Saturday that Pinta\u2019s body was retrieved from the Rafah area. He had come to Israel from Thailand to work in agriculture.",
      "The army said he was taken into Gaza by the Mujahideen Brigades, the small armed group that it said had also abducted and killed Shiri Bibas and her two small children. It\u2019s also the same group that took the two Israeli-American hostages, Judih Weinstein and Gad Haggai, whose bodies were retrieved by the army Thursday.",
      "Israel said it found Pinta\u2019s body based on information received from the hostage task force and military intelligence.",
      "A statement from the hostage forum, which supports the hostages, said it stands with Pinta\u2019s family and shares in their grief. It called on the country\u2019s decision makers to bring home the remaining hostages and give those who have died a proper burial.",
      "Thais were the largest group of foreigners held captive by Hamas militants. Many of the Thai agricultural workers lived in compounds on the outskirts of southern Israeli kibbutzim and towns, and Hamas militants overran those places first. A total of 46 Thais have been killed during the conflict, according to Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "Before Pinta\u2019s body was retrieved, three Thai hostages remained in captivity and two were confirmed dead. The fate of Pinta was uncertain until today, according to the hostage forum.",
      "The retrieval of Pinta\u2019s body comes as Israel continues its military campaign across Gaza. Hospital officials said they received the bodies of nearly two dozen people Saturday.",
      "Four strikes hit the Muwasi area in southern Gaza between Rafah and Khan Younis. In northern Gaza, one strike hit an apartment, killing seven people including a mother and five children. Their bodies were taken to Shifa hospital.",
      "Israel said Saturday that it\u2019s responding to Hamas\u2019 \u201cbarbaric attacks\u201d and is dismantling its capabilities. It said it follows international law and takes all feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.",
      "Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted 251 hostages. They are still holding 55 hostages, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages from Gaza and recovered dozens of bodies.",
      "Israel\u2019s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The offensive has destroyed large parts of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of roughly 2 million Palestinians."
