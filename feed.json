      "Sofia Coppola has been honored at the Museum of Modern Art Film Benefit in New York for her filmmaking achievements",
      "NEW YORK -- When Sofia Coppola was 20 years old and figuring out who she wanted to be in the world, Angelica Huston offered some advice: \u201cNot everyone\u2019s going to love you. Don\u2019t waste your time on the people who don\u2019t,\u201d Coppola recalled Wednesday night in New York at the Museum of Modern Art Film Benefit, where she was being honored for her films.",
      "Coppola was surrounded by family, friends and collaborators like Bill Murray, Josh Hartnett and Elle Fanning for the Chanel-presented event, which helps raise funds for the museum\u2019s film collection and preservation efforts.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s not just the daughter of a great filmmaker,\u201d Murray said. \u201cShe\u2019s a great filmmaker.\u201d",
      "But it's a distinction that was hard earned. Just over 27 years after her father Francis Ford Coppola encouraged her to make her first short film, Coppola reflected on starting a filmmaking career at a time when she was thought of as \u201ca nepo baby before they were charming\u201d and \u201cthe amateur actress who had single-handedly ruined \u2018The Godfather\u2019 films.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost people didn\u2019t think I had something to say that mattered,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I found a few who did.\u201d",
      "Since making her feature debut with \u201cThe Virgin Suicides,\u201d Coppola has written and directed seven narrative features and one documentary, about Marc Jacobs, that A24 plans to release next year. She's been both celebrated, winning an Oscar for writing \u201cLost in Translation,\u201d which also earned her a best director nomination, and dismissed. \u201cMarie Antoinette\u201d was infamously booed at Cannes, but over the next 20 years would become beloved and celebrated.",
      "Fanning remembered meticulously planning her outfit to meet Coppola for the first time at age 11, where she would go on to be cast as the daughter of a famous movie star in \u201cSomewhere.\u201d A few years prior she had convinced her grandmother to take her to see \u201cMarie Antoinette\u201d and she immediately became a fan.",
      "\u201cLiving in that cinema, in Sofia\u2019s world for a few hours, it would change my girlhood forever,\u201d Fanning said. \u201cIt was the place that I felt safe and seen, and I wanted to live in it a hundred times over.\u201d",
      "On \u201cSomewhere,\u201d Coppola made Fanning feel like an equal on set and saw beauty in things like her glasses and retainer and made them \u201ccool\u201d through her approval. At 18, she\u2019d reunite with Coppola to play the \u201cbad girl\u201d in the Civil War era film \u201cThe Beguiled.\u201d",
      "Hartnett also thanked Coppola for giving him one of his first big roles as a teenage heartthrob in \u201cThe Virgin Suicides.\u201d He recalled being in awe of her, the mixtapes she made for the cast and her \u201cincredible chill\u201d under the immense pressure of directing her first feature at only 26.",
      "\u201cSofia showed me at a young age what it is to be an artist,\u201d Hartnett said.",

She had many champions to thank as well: Her father for being a great film teacher and always wanting his kids on set; Her late mother Eleanor Coppola who loved contemporary art and was the one who told her she could have a family and a career; Her husband for helping to make that work and for his musical contributions to her films; Her brother Roman Coppola who told her to make the film she wanted when the studio was pressuring her to change the ending to \u201cLost in Translation.\u201d",
      "Things have changed for female directors since Coppola began, when an executive told her that you can\u2019t have movies focused on women because boys won\u2019t go to see films about girls. Yet there are still roadblocks.",
      "\u201cI hope we now recognize how much we need more women in positions of power and finance to support these filmmakers,\u201d Coppola said. Chanel, which not only sponsored the evening but MoMA Film as well \u2014 a collection that includes more than 30,000 films \u2014 has a long history of supporting women in filmmaking, including just last week at a luncheon with the film academy.",

      "\u201cThe movies that she makes and the person that she has become, the woman that she has become, are a result of paying attention and a self-awareness,\u201d Murray said. \u201cShe somehow figured out the reason for her career, the drive of it is this accumulation of moments \u2026 I feel like I was paying attention myself when I said, \u2018I want to work with this girl.\u2019\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Filmmaker Lotfy Nathan has turned the apocryphal Infancy Gospel of Thomas into a supernatural thriller called \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son,\u201d starring Nicolas Cage",
      "LOS ANGELES -- In the second century, as the canonical Gospels were being copied and circulated throughout the Roman Empire, another text about the life of Jesus was simultaneously spreading. Although the Infancy Gospel of Thomas didn\u2019t make it into the New Testament, it remained popular among Christians for centuries.",
      "When filmmaker Lotfy Nathan was introduced to the apocryphal text about Jesus\u2019 childhood by his history-loving father, he immediately began poring over it as a springboard for what would eventually become \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son,\u201d the supernatural thriller starring Nicolas Cage and opening in theaters Friday.",
      "\u201cThe thought gave me chills,\u201d recalled the writer and director, who was raised Coptic Orthodox. \u201cThe novelty of this, in a way, being an origin story that hadn\u2019t been told before.\u201d",
      "The film, which stars FKA twigs and Noah Jupe alongside Cage, follows Jesus as a young boy being tempted by Satan to rebel against his father, Joseph (Cage). The film\u2019s source material is established with an opening title card. \u201cBased on the Infancy Gospel of Thomas,\u201d it reads. But Nathan concedes he couldn\u2019t rely solely on the text and had to fill in narrative gaps, as with a storyline involving Satan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s written like a laundry list of events. It doesn\u2019t really have an arc, so to speak,\u201d he said of the apocryphal account of Jesus\u2019 life from ages 5 to 12. \u201cI had a historian pull a lot of research for me before I wrote the first draft.\u201d",
      "As fate would have it, Cage had already read the Infancy Gospel of Thomas years ago, during a period in his life of deep philosophical curiosity and reflection. When Nathan came to the Oscar winner with the script, Cage said he saw a through line to a type of story he\u2019s long been attracted to.",
      "\u201cFamily dramas, it\u2019s no secret, is one of my favorite subject matters or genres. I couldn\u2019t think of a more compelling family dynamic than the Nativity,\u201d Cage told The Associated Press. \u201cAs I read it and thought about it, I never thought of it as a horror film per se. I saw it as a family drama about an existential crisis.\u201d",
      "The Infancy Gospel of Thomas might seem novel and obscure for some contemporary audiences, but history attests to both its popularity and longevity, according to Tony Burke, a professor at York University in Toronto whose specialties include early Christian apocrypha.",
      "Stories within it permeated ancient Christian lore, art and even some medieval plays. One account from the text about Jesus giving life to clay birds even made its way into the Quran.",
      "Also referred to as the Paidika \u2014 a nod to its original Greek title, \u201cPaidika Iesou,\u201d which translates to \u201cThe Childhood Acts of Jesus\u201d \u2014 the Infancy Gospel of Thomas often surprises modern readers.",
      "\u201cThis is not the Jesus that they expect \u2014 a Jesus that kills a boy in the marketplace or strikes down his teacher,\u201d Burke said, though he argues that Christian audiences during that time wouldn\u2019t have been bothered by this characterization. \u201cIn the ancient world, it was not that uncommon to tell stories of revered holy men cursing as well as blessing.\u201d",
      "Many Christians today reject its legitimacy and say it conflicts with the Jesus of the Bible.",

      "Although Jesus movies aren't often described as horror films or supernatural thrillers, the second century text upon which \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d is based is \u201cquite disturbing,\u201d argues Joan E. Taylor, a professor of early Christianity at King\u2019s College London. She recently wrote \u201cBoy Jesus: Growing Up Judaean in Turbulent Times.\u201d",
      "\u201cJesus is portrayed as having these powers but not really having the moral compass in terms of how he uses his powers, or at least not the moral compass we would expect from, say, the Gospel of Luke,\u201d she said of the Paidika. \u201cYou have this child who has these supernatural powers and punishes those who come in his way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d isn\u2019t the only recent film to reimagine the apocryphal gospel. \u201cThe Young Messiah,\u201d the 2016 drama based upon Anne Rice's novel \u201cChrist the Lord: Out of Egypt,\u201d also pulls from the Paidika.",
      "Both films reinterpret some of the aspects of the text that are ostensibly at odds with the Jesus of the canonical Gospels. In \u201cThe Young Messiah,\u201d for example, it\u2019s Satan who kills the boy in the marketplace, then frames Jesus. That encounter is left out of \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d entirely.",
      "Despite their popularity, telling any story about Jesus on-screen is tricky, especially when filmmakers veer into territory outside of the canonical Gospels. Cage recalled seeing \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ,\u201d Martin Scorsese\u2019s notoriously controversial 1988 drama starring Willem Dafoe as Jesus, in theaters when it first came out.",
      "\u201cI was in line to get my tickets and I remember there were the picketers and they were angry. And I said, \u2018Well have you seen the movie?\u2019 And they said no,\u201d Cage recalled. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you should see it before you make a statement about it or judge it?\u201d",
      "Still, he\u2019s cognizant of the fact that any film tackling subjects sacred to people is vulnerable to critique. The American Family Association, a conservative Christian advocacy group, has denounced the film and urged people to sign a petition blocking its release.",
      "\u201cNobody wanted to offend anybody in the making of this movie,\u201d Cage said emphatically. \u201cIf anyone does go to this movie, they would see that everyone treated it with love and not with any approach of mockery or contempt. It was all about love.\u201d",

      "Fans of Danmei same-sex romance stories in China say the government is cracking down harder than ever on the popular genre",
      "For Cindy Zhong, like many young Chinese women, a relaxing night used to mean curling up with a steamy story about two men in love. Then her favorite authors, and their tales, started disappearing.",
      "Fans of the popular Danmei same-sex romance genre, written and read mainly by straight women, say the Chinese government is carrying out the largest crackdown yet on it, effectively neutering the enjoyment.",
      "In the vast world of fantasy, Danmei is relatively straightforward: Two men stand in for idealized relationships, from chaste to erotic. Some scholars believe the stories appeal to Chinese women as a way to sidestep the country\u2019s conservative gender values and imagine relationships on a more equal footing.",
      "\"Women turn to Danmei for pure love, especially as they face pressure from families, peers and society to get married and have kids,\u201d said Aiqing Wang, a senior lecturer at the University of Liverpool who studies Chinese popular culture and internet literature.",

      "Danmei \u2014 also known as \u201cBoys Love\u201d in English \u2014 has also caught the eye of Chinese authorities. At least dozens of writers have been interrogated, arrested and charged with producing and selling obscene materials in China in the past year, according to media reports and witness accounts online.",

      "China\u2019s government has been tightening its grip on the LGBTQ+ community, shutting down rights groups and social media accounts, despite removing homosexuality from its list of mental illness in 2001. Same-sex relationships are not criminalized.",
      "Even though China\u2019s censorship apparatus has long disapproved of same-sex love stories, the most popular Danmei stories have become bestselling books and been adapted into cartoons, video games and TV series. Adaptations often get around censorship by changing the characters to a heterosexual couple or presenting the relationship between male leads as an intense \u201cfriendship.\u201d",
      "The stories, usually published online by amateurs, are some of the most widely read fiction in China. Ranging from the flowery to the heavily erotic, they can include scenes of men fighting with a sword and a flute in ethereal ancient costumes or sex scenes in nature after rainfall.",
      "Danmei is \u201ca utopian existence,\u201d said Chen Xingyu, a 32-year-old freelance teacher living in the southwestern city of Kunming. \u201cI would be less happy without it.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors urged a judge on Wednesday to reject Harvey Weinstein \u2019s claims that his June sexual assault conviction was marred by threats and bullying among jurors.",
      "The disgraced movie mogul\u2019s lawyers submitted sworn affidavits last month from two jurors who said they regretted voting to convict Weinstein and only did so because others on the panel bullied them during five contentious days of deliberations.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said the jurors\u2019 claims were \u201cinconsistent and implausible\u201d and that they provided no legal basis for Weinstein\u2019s lawyers to challenge his conviction.",
      "One juror who claimed in an affidavit that he observed \u201cthreats\u201d and \u201cintimidation\u201d had told the judge during deliberations that he only saw \u201cplayground stuff,\" prosecutors said. Immediately after the trial ended, the same juror told reporters, \u201cit\u2019s not like a fight was going to break out. No, obviously not.\u201d",
      "Weinstein\u2019s bid to overturn his first-degree criminal sex act conviction \u201cutterly fails, on both the law and the facts, to meet the standard necessary to set aside the guilty verdict,\u201d prosecutors Matthew Colangelo, Nicole Blumberg, Shannon Lucey and Becky Mangold wrote.",
      "They cited a centuries-old rule that the U.S. Supreme Court has said gives \u201csubstantial protection to verdict finality\u201d and assures that once a trial is over, jurors won\u2019t be \"harassed or annoyed by litigants seeking to challenge the verdict.\u201d",
      "Judge Curtis Farber said he'll rule on Dec. 22.",
      "Prosecutors said they declined to interview any jurors before responding to the defense\u2019s claims because doing so would \u201ccause the very harms\u201d the centuries-old rule was meant to avoid.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s defense team, led by attorney Arthur Aidala, argued in court papers last month that the verdict was marred by \u201cthreats, intimidation, and extraneous bias,\u201d and that Farber failed to properly deal with it at the time.",
      "The two jurors said in their affidavits that they felt overwhelmed and intimidated by others on the panel who wanted to convict Weinstein on the criminal sex act charge, which accused him of forcing oral sex on TV and film production assistant and producer Miriam Haley in 2006.",
      "One of the jurors said she was screamed at in the jury room and told, \u201cwe have to get rid of you.\u201d The other juror said anyone who doubted Weinstein\u2019s guilt was grilled by other jurors and that if he could have voted by secret ballot, \u201cI would have returned a not guilty verdict on all three charges.\u201d",
      "\u201cI regret the verdict,\u201d that juror said. \u201cWithout the intimidation from other jurors, I believe that the jury would have hung on the Miriam Haley charge.\u201d",

      "It was the second time the Oscar-winning producer was tried on some of the charges. His 2020 conviction, a watershed moment for the # MeToo movement, was overturned last year. In addition to seeking to overturn his June conviction, Weinstein\u2019s lawyers are also fighting to avoid yet another retrial on the undecided count.",
      "Weinstein denies all of the charges. The first-degree criminal sex act conviction carries the potential for up to 25 years in prison, while the unresolved third-degree rape charge is punishable by up to four years \u2014 less than he already has served.",
      "The Oscar-winning producer has been behind bars since his initial conviction in 2020, and he later also was sentenced to prison in a separate California case, which he is appealing.",
      "Some of what the two jurors said in their affidavits echoed acrimony that spilled into public view during deliberations.",
      "As jurors weighed charges for five days, one juror asked to be excused because he felt another was being treated unfairly. Later, the foreperson complained that other jurors were pushing people to change their minds and that a juror yelled at him for sticking to his opinion and suggested the foreperson would \u201csee me outside.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- In the decade following her debut album, Meghan Trainor has lived myriad lives \u2014 but the message of her bright, cheery pop music has remained the same: Stay true to who you are and ignore the haters. That spirit endures on her lead single, the jovial \u201cStill Don't Care,\u201d the first tease of her forthcoming seventh full-length album, \u201cToy with Me,\u201d out April 24.",
      "And in true Trainor fashion, \u201cStill Don't Care\u201d was inspired by real life situations. \u201cI was seeing a lot of hate all over the world, but I was getting a lot of hate when I started posting more pictures of ... my fitness journey and my health journey. And I didn\u2019t really expect that,\u201d Trainor told The Associated Press. \u201cI would get really upset at comments and I was like, \u2018I wish I didn\u2019t feel like this. I wish I didn\u2019t give them so much power.\u2019",
      "\u201cAnd so, when I write songs, I always write in the perspective of how I wish I thought, like \u2018All About That Bass.\u2019 I didn\u2019t feel like that when I wrote it,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd all my self-love anthems. But when I perform them and I see how it affects other people, I start believing them.\u201d",
      "\u201cStill Don't Care\u201d is yet another example, with its maximalist, \u201880s pop production and choir courtesy of Pentatonix\u2019s Scott Hoying. Her mom, brother and sister-in-law contribute background vocals on it as well \u2014 perhaps softening the song's gloves-up approach to combating online hate. \u201cYou could tear me apart,\u201d Trainor sings. \u201cBut I sleep well at night.\u201d",
      "It's the first taste of \u201cToy with Me,\u201d which Trainor teases will have a few self-love bops, songs to excise her anger through and lots of familial love. \u201cThe only features I have right now in this moment are my kids, Riley and Barry, because I wrote them a beautiful song, the only, like, slower song. It\u2019s called \u2018Little One' and it's about how I wish they could stay little forever,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cWhen I play it, Riley goes, \u2018Oh, this is my song. Play my song!' It\u2019s literally my lullaby for them. And at the end of the song they say, \u2018I love you, Mama,\u2019 and it\u2019s just the cutest thing ever. And that\u2019s when everyone\u2019s crying.\u201d",
      "Trainor said she worked on the album for eight months. \u201cI exhausted myself, and I went a little too hard. I got excited to be home with the kids and work on my songs, but then I definitely, I overdid it, and my body started doing weird things, giving me signals. Like, my tongue started burning one day. And I was like, \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 And it wouldn\u2019t go away forever. And the dentist was like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re stressed,\u2019\u201d she recalled.",
      "Songwriting, too, was a challenge. \u201cI usually write a song in one day and I\u2019m done with it, but each song on this album took, like, months to finish,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that was the only difference from this album than any other album I\u2019ve done.\u201d",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Hundreds of bagpipers claimed a new world record on Wednesday by belting out AC/DC\u2019s rock and roll classic \u201cIt\u2019s a Long Way to the Top.\u201d",
      "Billed as \u201cThe Great Melbourne Bagpipe Bash,\u201d the eclectic performance took place in Melbourne\u2019s Federation Square, on Swanston Street, which was the scene of the Australian hard rock band\u2019s 1976 film clip in which they played the hit on the back of a flatbed truck traveling slowly through downtown traffic with music blaring from speakers.",
      "Federation Square is also a short stroll from the Melbourne Cricket Ground where AC/DC is scheduled to play their first Australian gig in a decade on Wednesday. Guitarist Angus Young, 70, is the only band member who played on the truck and is performing on the latest Australian tour.",
      "Thousands of spectators crammed the square for the world record attempt. Many of the 374 pipers had to squeeze through the crowd to the stage area. The oldest piper was 98-years-old, organisers said.",
      "Among the bagpipers was Les Kenfield and Kevin Conlon, two of the three members of Rats of Tobruk Memorial Pipes and Drums who played with AC/DC on the truck 49 years ago.",
      "\u201cIt didn't strike you at the time how big this event is until now,\" Kenfield told Australian Broadcasting Corp. \u201cNow it\u2019s one of the greatest things \u2014 probably the greatest thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life.\u201d",
      "Having been declared world record holders, the massed pipers played \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d on request, followed by an impromptu \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d to a cheering crowd, many using their phones to record the moment.",

      "The Monkey King, a beloved figure in Chinese mythology, is now the star of an opera",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A rascally superhero born from a stone egg, the Monkey King is beloved in Chinese mythology, appearing in everything from a 16th century epic to modern comics, animated movies and video games \u2014 even in poetry by Mao Zedong.",
      "And now he\u2019s the star of an opera.",
      "\u201cThe Monkey King,\u201d with music by Huang Ruo and libretto by David Henry Hwang, has its world premiere at the San Francisco Opera on Friday with performances through Nov. 30.",
      "It\u2019s adapted from \u201cJourney to the West,\u201d a 100-chapter novel inspired by the true story of a 7th-century Chinese monk who traveled to India to find Buddhist sutras, or scriptures, and bring them back home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essentially an allegory of how Buddhism came to China,\u201d Hwang said.",
      "His libretto, in both English and Mandarin, is based on early chapters of the epic, portraying Monkey King\u2019s birth and daring exploits, as well as the arrogance and pride that lead him to be imprisoned for 500 years until he learns humility, compassion and discipline. At the end of the opera he is finally worthy of accompanying the monk on his journey.",
      "For Hwang, part of the Monkey King\u2019s appeal is the way he undercuts stereotypes.",
      "\u201cEveryone associates the Chinese persona with respect and deference and conformity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Monkey represents this whole other side that doesn\u2019t normally get expressed in terms of being individualistic, being rebellious, being egotistical.",
      "\u201cAlso given the fact that Monkey is rebelling against a corrupt administration, people can look at that however they want to see it.\u201d",
      "Mounting the opera is an ambitious undertaking for the company, which has a long track record of producing new work but faced unique challenges in bringing Monkey\u2019s fantastical adventures to life.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s flying on clouds, diving underwater, soaring to the heavens,\u201d director Diane Paulus said. \u201cI thought, oh, my gosh, how are we going to do this on the stage? How do we realize this and in what style?\u201d",
      "One answer was to collaborate with puppeteer Basil Twist, who designed the sets as well as puppets, making extensive use of his trademark silks.",
      "\u201cThe whole notion of the ephemeral and letting go of things and the power of transformation to me is beautifully expressed by silk that can become water that then disappears and becomes clouds, and then becomes a giant column,\u201d she said.",
      "Since Monkey King has to perform supernatural feats, engage in acrobatic fighting, shift his shape at will, and also \u2014 this is an opera, after all \u2014 perform arias accompanied by full orchestra, the creators represent him by three different figures: a singer, a puppet and a dancer.",
      "\u201cI call it the Holy Trinity of Monkey King,\u201d said Kang Wang, the Chinese-Australian tenor who sings the title role.",
      "While that spares Wang from having to perform backflips or other complicated dance moves, it doesn\u2019t mean he can stand up straight the whole time. Whenever he\u2019s not singing full out, he has to crouch in a semi-squat the way a character would who is half-monkey, half-man.",

My colleagues were telling me they could see me losing weight. \u2026 It\u2019s like a CrossFit session every day.\u201d",
      "Other characters in the opera include the corrupt Jade Emperor, sung by tenor Konu Kim, and Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy who guides the Monkey King, sung by soprano Mei Gui Zhang. Carolyn Kuan conducts the orchestra, chorus and soloists.",
      "Huang Ruo, who has composed several other operas as well as concertos and chamber music, was born in China and studied music there before moving to the US. He uses a Western orchestra for \u201cThe Monkey King\u201d with the addition of a pipa, a Chinese four-stringed lute.",
      "\u201cI said I\u2019m not going to write a Western opera, or a Chinese opera, but I\u2019m going to call it a magical Kung Fu opera,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we have singing, and orchestra, all the good things, story-telling, emotional moments, all this from the operatic art form. But we also have Kung Fu fighting, operatic dance, and puppetry, and mixed media to convey this magical world.\u201d",
      "For Matthew Shilvock, the company\u2019s general director, the score is \u201cincredibly propulsive \u2026 but also lyrical.",
      "\u201cWe keep going in and out between two different sound worlds,\u201d Shilvock said. \u201cThere\u2019s all these hijinks with the Monkey in the battle sequences where he is taking on the gods \u2026 and then you have these moments of incredible serenity.\u201d",
      "Shilvock is hopeful the opera will appeal to audiences across cultural lines.",
      "\u201cFor people who grew up with the Monkey King there\u2019s a huge sense of nostalgia about it, so it\u2019s tapping into something deep,\u201d he said. \u201cFor people who are getting to know it for the first time you\u2019re being introduced to this extraordinary piece of world literature\u2026 so there\u2019s a wonderful sense of discovery.\u201d",
      "If Huang Ruo has his way, this may not be his last opera about the Monkey King.",
      "Borrowing inspiration from Richard Wagner whose \u201cRing\u201d cycle stretches over four operas, the composer said he and Hwang \u201chave this pipe dream to create the Monkey King Cycle.",
      "\u201cWhen we get to the last opera, they reach the land of bliss, where Buddha and his disciples live,\u201d he said. \u201cThe journey didn\u2019t start yet. It\u2019s just the beginning of the story-telling.\u201d",

      "The sudden resignation of two top bosses at the BBC over the editing of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump dealt a huge blow to the broadcaster",
      "LONDON -- The sudden resignation of two top bosses at the BBC over the editing of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump dealt a huge blow to the broadcaster, which is revered by some in Britain as a national treasure but derided by others as outdated and left-leaning.",
      "The century-old, publicly funded BBC faced criticism after its flagship TV news program spliced together sections of a speech Trump made on Jan. 6, 2021, so that it appeared he explicitly urged supporters to march on Capitol Hill and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "The BBC chairman apologized Monday for an \u201cerror of judgment.\u201d A letter from Trump\u2019s attorney threatened legal action, demanding that the broadcaster \u201cretract the false, defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory statements\u201d and compensate the president for the harm caused.",
      "Critics say the episode is just the latest example of bias at the BBC, but supporters maintain that it is one of the most trusted sources of news in the U.K. and around the world, and that the departure of its most senior executives casts a chill on public-service broadcasting.",
      "\u201cThis is an existential crisis for the BBC,\u201d said Julie Posetti, a journalism professor at City St. George\u2019s University of London. \u201cIn capitulating so quickly, it has sent a signal that it\u2019s relatively easy to cow the BBC.\u201d",
      "That is \u201cincredibly dangerous\u201d in an increasingly polarized environment \u201cwhere the information ecosystem is incredibly polluted,\u201d she warned.",
      "A look at the scandal, past criticism of the BBC and uncertainty about its future:",
      "The furor unfolded days after the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper last week published details from an internal memo compiled by a former external editorial standards adviser to the BBC.",
      "The memo raised concerns over how the BBC\u2019s \u201cPanorama\u201d documentary program edited a speech by Trump.",
      "The program, which was broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. election, as Trump ran for a second term, spliced together three quotes from two sections of the speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "Among the parts that were cut was a segment where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.",
      "The BBC\u2019s director general, Tim Davie, and head of news, Deborah Turness, both resigned Sunday.",
      "The broadcaster\u2019s chair, Samir Shah, acknowledged that the editing gave \u201cthe impression of a direct call for violent action.\u201d Turness said Monday that mistakes were made, but she insisted \"there\u2019s no institutional bias\u201d at the BBC \u2014 a position supported by Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "The memo also criticized BBC coverage of transgender issues, alleging that the broadcaster\u2019s reporters promoted a pro-trans agenda, and warned about an anti-Israel bias in the BBC\u2019s Arabic service.",
      "Reacting to the resignations Sunday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a screen grab of an article headlined \u201cTrump goes to war with \u2018fake news\u2019 BBC.\u201d Trump himself wrote on social media that BBC journalists were \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201ctried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.\u201d",
      "Critics have long charged that the broadcaster leans left, though some have also accused it of being too cautious to challenge successive Conservative Party governments. On Monday, the hard-right leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage, told a news conference that the BBC \u201chas been institutionally biased for decades\u201d to loud applause from supporters.",

      "The corporation is bound by the terms of its charter to be impartial and independent. It is not a state broadcaster beholden to the U.K. government. Its model has inspired the CBC in Canada, the ABC in Australia and other publicly funded outlets, Posetti said.",
      "Known affectionately \u2014 or mockingly \u2014 as \u201cAuntie,\u201d the BBC began in the 1920s and changed the history of television when many Britons bought a TV set specifically to watch the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.

      "Outside the U.K. the BBC World Service operates in over 40 languages and is one of Britain\u2019s most significant cultural exports.

The BBC has lost millions of pounds as more households stopped paying the fee in recent years.",
      "\u201cThis is the BBC\u2019s last chance,\u201d Farage said. \u201cIf the BBC doesn\u2019t now get a grip \u2026 then I think what you would see within the next couple of years are many, many millions just refusing, just not wanting to have the license fee.\u201d",

      "La Fenice opera house in Venice faces a dispute over the appointment of Beatrice Venezi as musical director",
      "VENICE, Italy -- The storied Venetian opera house La Fenice is embroiled in a dispute with its orchestra and chorus over the appointment of a young and telegenic musical director with ties to Premier Giorgia Meloni but none with the musicians she has been hired to conduct.",
      "La Fenice\u2019s general manager, Nicola Colabianchi, who joined the theater in March, has defended his choice of 35-year-old Beatrice Venezi, saying her youthful energy will bring a new audience to the theater where Giuseppe Verdi premiered \u2018\u2019Rigoletto\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019La Traviata\u2019\u2019 more than 170 years ago.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s young and dynamic, she\u2019s already written several books and she\u2019s conducted many orchestras. She\u2019s a person who attracts a great deal of media attention. So all of this will only bring attention to the theater and the theater\u2019s future,'' Colabianchi said in an interview. \u201dWe can\u2019t think the theater can survive with 80-year-old season ticket holders.\u2019\u2019",
      "In the six weeks since Venezi\u2019s appointment, effective next October, was announced by La Fenice on social media, striking workers forced the cancellation of an opera premiere and unions have called for Colabianchi\u2019s resignation.",
      "Another protest was planned for Monday, backed by other Italian opera houses in solidarity.",
      "Critics say Venezi doesn\u2019t have the requisite experience for a theater of La Fenice\u2019s profile, where famed conductors Arturo Toscanini, Claudio Abbado and Riccardo Muti have lifted their batons. They also suggest the choice was influenced by Venezi\u2019s ties to Meloni and her far-right Brothers of Italy.",
      "Venezi has not publicly commented on the La Fenice dispute, and canceled a public appearance to avoid polemics.",
      "She is the daughter of a prominent member of Forza Nuova, another hard-right party, and has identified with the right\u2019s conservative values. However, she told the daily La Stampa in 2023 that she was \u201coffended when they call me a little fascist.\u2019\u2019",
      "La Fenice\u2019s unions say they are not contesting Venezi\u2019s youth, gender or political leanings, but the lack of consultations with the musicians whom she must lead. They note that Colabianchi had pledged an open process just days before Venezi\u2019s appointment was announced.",

      "La Fenice\u2019s unions have asked Colabianchi to revoke Venezi\u2019s appointment, and relaunch the selection process, allowing the musicians time to work with and become familiar with any candidates, Venezi included. They also have demanded Colabianchi's resignation.",
      "Colabianchi, for his part, has apologized for hiring Venezi without more consultations, but he remains firm in his choice.",
      "\u2018\u2019I chose Beatrice Venezi because I had invited her, while I was the general manager in Caglieri, for three separate operas, and she was a huge success,'' Colabianchi said, adding she has a broad repertoire of more than 50 operas. \"She is young, and we need to promote the young; she is a woman, and we need to promote women.\u2019\u2019",
      "He said there was no question of his resigning and that he would bring Venezi to the theater as soon as the protests against her appointment cease. Her first appointment to conduct with the full orchestra would be in July, for a concert in St. Mark\u2019s Square, though others could be added earlier, Colabianchi said.",
      "\u201cThere is lots of time to get to know each other, to verify. You can\u2019t create polemics against someone without knowing them, just because of what you hear,\u2019\u2019 Colabianchi said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday praised Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s willingness to question established science and embrace nontraditional voices in the health care space, saying that often throughout history, \u201call the experts were wrong.\u201d",
      "In remarks in a fireside chat between the two men at a \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d summit in the nation's capital, Vance also propped up Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement, saying it has been \u201ca critical part of our success in Washington.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s words show how Kennedy, whose wrecking-ball approach to public health agencies and longstanding vaccine skepticism have made him a polarizing figure among the public and in Congress, has been embraced by the White House as a needed force for change.",
      "\u201cOf all the specific initiatives that you guys have worked on effectively, the most important thing is that your team is willing to ask questions that people in government haven't been asking in a long time,\u201d Vance told Kennedy onstage.",
      "The Vance-Kennedy event was livestreamed, but the summit was otherwise off limits to the press.",
      "Even as President Donald Trump and Kennedy have disagreed on issues from COVID-19 vaccines to abortion, the White House this year has largely left Kennedy alone as he has made sweeping changes to the agencies he leads, including laying off thousands of workers, firing science advisers and remaking vaccine guidelines.",
      "The Trump administration has touted Kennedy's efforts to phase out artificial dyes in foods, wage war on ultra-processed foods and update the national dietary guidelines. As health secretary, he has said he wants to find the root causes of chronic disease and help Americans reduce their exposure to toxins.",
      "Critics, including some of the country's leading medical associations, say that Kennedy\u2019s disregard for established science is fomenting public distrust in mainstream medicine and that his views, once considered fringe, are being amplified from his perch as health secretary.",
      "\u201cThis closed-door convention is nothing more than an ego-stroking symposium of \u2018wellbeing influencers\u2019 and \u2018MAHA moms\u2019 whose rejection of scientific expertise puts our public health at risk,\u201d said Erik Polyak, executive director of the progressive political action committee 314 Action, which works to elect Democratic scientists to office.",
      "Kennedy and his allies dispute that their agenda is anti-science.",
      "Vance nodded to the fact that many in Kennedy\u2019s network don\u2019t come from conventional medical circles, and some have more experience in business than in health. In fact, many of the health secretary's close allies and new hires have outright rejected medical consensus on topics including vaccines and how to heal chronic disease.",

      "The bill includes a reversal of the firing of federal workers by the Trump administration since the shutdown began. It also protects federal workers against further layoffs through January and guarantees they are paid once the shutdown is over. The bill for the Agriculture Department means people who rely on key food assistance programs will see those benefits funded without threat of interruption through the rest of the budget year.",

All other funding would be extended until the end of January, giving lawmakers more than two months to finish additional spending bills.",
      "Here's a look at how the shutdown started and is likely to end:",
      "Democrats made several demands to win their support for a short-term funding bill, but the central one was an extension of an enhanced tax credit that lowers the cost of health coverage obtained through Affordable Care Act marketplaces.",
      "The tax credit was boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic response, again through President Joe Biden's big energy and health care bill, and it's set to expire at the end of December. Without it, premiums on average will more than double for millions of Americans. More than 2 million people would lose health insurance coverage altogether next year, the Congressional Budget Office projected.",
      "\u201cNever have American families faced a situation where their health care costs are set to double \u2014 double in the blink of an eye,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.",
      "While Democrats called for negotiations on the matter, Republicans said a funding bill would need to be passed first.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are ready to sit down with Democrats just as soon as they stop holding the government hostage to their partisan demands,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said.",
      "Thune eventually promised Democrats a December vote on the tax credit extension to help resolve the standoff, but many Democrats demanded a guaranteed fix, not just a vote that is likely to fail.",
      "Thune's position was much the same as the one Schumer took back in October 2013, when Republicans unsuccessfully sought to roll back parts of the Affordable Care Act in exchange for funding the government. \u201cOpen up all of the government, and then we can have a fruitful discussion,\u201d Schumer said then.",
      "The first year of President Donald Trump's second term has seen more than 200,000 federal workers leave their job through firings, forced relocations or the Republican administration's deferred resignation program, according to the Partnership for Public Service. Whole agencies that don't align with the administration's priorities have been dismantled. And billions of dollars previously approved by Congress have been frozen or canceled.",
      "Democrats have had to rely on the courts to block some of Trump's efforts, but they have been unable to do it through legislation. They were also powerless to stop Trump's big tax cut and immigration crackdown bill that Republicans helped pay for by cutting future spending on safety net programs such as Medicaid and SNAP, formerly known as food stamps.",
      "The Democrats' struggles to blunt the Trump administration's priorities has prompted calls for the party's congressional leadership to take a more forceful response.",
      "Schumer experienced that firsthand after announcing in March that he would support moving ahead with a funding bill for the 2025 budget year. There was a protest at his office, calls from progressives that he be primaried in 2028 and suggestions that the Democratic Party would soon be looking for new leaders.",

      "This time around, Schumer demanded that Republicans negotiate with Democrats to get their votes on a spending bill. The Senate rules, he noted, requires bipartisan support to meet the 60-vote threshold necessary to advance a spending bill.",
      "But those negotiations did not occur, at least not with Schumer. Republicans instead worked with a small group of eight Democrats to tee up a short-term bill to fund the government generally at current levels and accused Schumer of catering to the party's left flank when he refused to go along.",
      "\u201cThe Senate Democrats are afraid that the radicals in their party will say that they caved,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said at one of his many daily press conferences.",
      "The political stakes in the shutdown are huge, which is why leaders in both parties have held nearly daily press briefings to shape public opinion.",
      "Roughly 6 in 10 Americans say Trump and Republicans in Congress have \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201cquite a bit\u201d of responsibility for the shutdown, while 54% say the same about Democrats in Congress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "At least three-quarters of Americans believe each deserves at least a \u201cmoderate\u201d share of blame, underscoring that no one was successfully evading responsibility.",
      "Both parties looked to the Nov. 4 elections in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere for signs of how the shutdown was influencing public opinion. Democrats took comfort in their overwhelming successes. Trump called it a \u201cbig factor, negative\" for Republicans. But it did not change the GOP's stance on negotiating. Instead, Trump ramped up calls for Republicans to end the filibuster in the Senate, which would pretty much eliminate the need for the majority party to ever negotiate with the minority.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office says that the negative impact on the economy will be mostly recovered once the shutdown ends, but not entirely. It estimated the permanent economic loss at about $11 billion for a six-week shutdown.",
      "Beyond the numbers, though, the shutdown created a cascade of troubles for many Americans. Federal workers missed paychecks, causing financial and emotional stress. Travelers had their flights delayed and at times canceled. People who rely on safety net programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program saw their benefits stopped, and Americans throughout the country lined up for meals at food banks.",

      "Canada is no longer measles-free because of ongoing outbreaks, international health experts said Monday, as childhood vaccination rates fall and the highly contagious virus spreads across North and South America.",
      "The loss of the country\u2019s measles elimination status comes more than a year after the highly contagious virus started spreading.",
      "Canada has logged 5,138 measles cases this year and two deaths. Both were babies who were exposed to the measles virus in the womb and born prematurely.",
      "Measles elimination is a symbolic designation, but it represents a hard-won battle against the infectious disease. It is earned when a country shows it stopped continuous spread of the virus within local communities, though occasional cases might still pop up from travel.",
      "Measles typically begins with a high fever followed by a telltale rash that starts on the face and neck. Most people recover, but it\u2019s one of the leading causes of death among young children, according to the World Health Organization. Serious complications, including blindness and swelling of the brain, are more common in young children and adults over age 30.",

      "Canada eliminated measles in 1998, followed by the United States two years later. After hugely successful vaccination campaigns, the Americas became the first region in the world to be free of measles in 2016. Health officials estimate the measles vaccine prevented 6.2 millions deaths in the Americas between 2000 and 2023.",
      "But vaccination rates have since slipped below the 95% coverage rate needed to stop outbreaks. Large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018 and 2019 cost the region its elimination status. It was reclaimed in 2024, but ends again with Canada\u2019s loss.",
      "Experts from the Pan American Health Organization, an independent health agency, made the determination after analyzing data on Canada\u2019s outbreaks that showed the virus has spread continuously for a year.",

      "The virus is one of the most contagious known to medicine. One infected person can spread it to up to 9 out of 10 unprotected people they come into close contact with. Health experts say, by far, the best prevention against measles is the vaccine, which provides 97% protection after two doses.",
      "Barbosa's organization has confirmed nearly 12,600 cases this year across 10 countries, a 30-fold increase from 2024. The vast majority are in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, but Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Belize also have active outbreaks.",

      "The request is the latest in a flurry of legal activity over how the program that helps 42 million Americans buy groceries should proceed during the historic U.S. government shutdown. Lower courts have ruled that the government must keep full payments flowing, but the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to keep them frozen for now.",

      "Trump\u2019s administration initially said SNAP benefits would not be available in November because of the shutdown. After some states and nonprofit groups sued, judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled the administration could not skip November\u2019s benefits entirely.",
      "The administration then said it would use an emergency reserve fund to provide 65% of the maximum monthly benefit. On Thursday, Rhode Island-based U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell said that wasn\u2019t good enough, and ordered full funding for SNAP benefits by Friday.",
      "Some states acted quickly to direct their EBT vendors to disburse full monthly benefits to SNAP recipients. Millions of people in at least a dozen states \u2014 all with Democratic governors \u2014 received the full amount to buy groceries before Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson put McConnell\u2019s order on hold Friday night, pending further deliberation by an appeals court.",

He had served in various posts under the elder Marcos starting when the latter won the presidency in 1965. in 2022, the current president appointed Enrile as chief presidential legal counsel, at age 98.",
      "Among the departments Enrile led were justice and finance, including a stint as Bureau of Customs commissioner. He served three terms in the Senate, where he became president from 2008 to 2013. He was a former member of the House of Representatives to represent the northern province of Cagayan, where he was born on Feb. 14, 1924.",

Criminal complaints have also been filed against 86 construction company executives and nine government officials for allegedly evading taxes totaling nearly 9 billion pesos ($152 million).",

      "Fans of Danmei same-sex romance stories in China say the government is cracking down harder than ever on the popular genre",
      "For Cindy Zhong, like many young Chinese women, a relaxing night used to mean curling up with a steamy story about two men in love. Then her favorite authors, and their tales, started disappearing.",
      "Fans of the popular Danmei same-sex romance genre, written and read mainly by straight women, say the Chinese government is carrying out the largest crackdown yet on it, effectively neutering the enjoyment.",
      "In the vast world of fantasy, Danmei is relatively straightforward: Two men stand in for idealized relationships, from chaste to erotic. Some scholars believe the stories appeal to Chinese women as a way to sidestep the country\u2019s conservative gender values and imagine relationships on a more equal footing.",
      "\"Women turn to Danmei for pure love, especially as they face pressure from families, peers and society to get married and have kids,\u201d said Aiqing Wang, a senior lecturer at the University of Liverpool who studies Chinese popular culture and internet literature.",
      "The once-niche Chinese literary subculture has seen a boom in recent years, with novels adapted into blockbuster television series and translated into Western languages.",
      "Danmei \u2014 also known as \u201cBoys Love\u201d in English \u2014 has also caught the eye of Chinese authorities. At least dozens of writers have been interrogated, arrested and charged with producing and selling obscene materials in China in the past year, according to media reports and witness accounts online.",
      "Some writers have stopped publishing or taken work offline. Websites have shut down or removed many stories, leaving the tamest behind.",
      "\u201cChinese female readers can no longer find a safe, uncensored space to place our desires,\u201d said Zhong, an educator in her 30s.",
      "Writers have said they enjoy directing lives that aren\u2019t their own.",
      "\u201cWhen I was writing, I felt so powerful that I could create a world,\u201d said Zou Xuan, a teacher who used to write Danmei for fun and has been reading them for a decade.",
      "China\u2019s government has been tightening its grip on the LGBTQ+ community, shutting down rights groups and social media accounts, despite removing homosexuality from its list of mental illness in 2001. Same-sex relationships are not criminalized.",
      "Even though China\u2019s censorship apparatus has long disapproved of same-sex love stories, the most popular Danmei stories have become bestselling books and been adapted into cartoons, video games and TV series. Adaptations often get around censorship by changing the characters to a heterosexual couple or presenting the relationship between male leads as an intense \u201cfriendship.\u201d",
      "The stories, usually published online by amateurs, are some of the most widely read fiction in China. Ranging from the flowery to the heavily erotic, they can include scenes of men fighting with a sword and a flute in ethereal ancient costumes or sex scenes in nature after rainfall.",
      "Danmei is \u201ca utopian existence,\u201d said Chen Xingyu, a 32-year-old freelance teacher living in the southwestern city of Kunming. \u201cI would be less happy without it.\u201d",
      "Some of the most popular stories, such as Heaven Official\u2019s Blessing and Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation, have been translated into English, building a global fan base and cracking The New York Times paperback bestseller list.",

      "The coordinated assaults on Nov. 13, 2015 turned the French capital into a theater of blood and calamity: gunfire on caf\u00e9 terraces, explosions at a stadium, a massacre at the Bataclan concert hall. Many in France and abroad have described the attacks as the country\u2019s 9/11.",
      "The attacks killed 132 people, including two survivors who later died by suicide, and hundreds more were wounded. The night hardened France\u2019s security reflexes while deepening a sense of solidarity that has endured a decade later \u2014 with many families now measuring time as \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe are told to turn the page,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the absence is immense, the shock is intact and the incomprehension remains. I\u2019d like to know why, I\u2019d like to understand. I\u2019d like these attacks to stop.\u201d",
      "President Emmanuel Macron and first lady Brigitte Macron stood beside her for a wreath-laying and a minute of silent remembrance during the first in a day of tributes at the places where Islamic State group gunmen and suicide bombers hit a soccer match, neighborhood caf\u00e9s and a rock concert in the space of minutes. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo also was present.",
      "\u201cTen years. The pain remains,\u201d Macron wrote earlier on X, saying France remembers \u201cthe lives cut short, the wounded, the families and the loved ones.\u201d",
      "From Saint-Denis, Macron is traveling to each attack site in sequence: the Carillon and Petit Cambodge caf\u00e9s in the 10th arrondissement, then La Bonne Bi\u00e8re, Le Comptoir Voltaire and La Belle \u00c9quipe in the 11th, and finally the Bataclan, where 90 people were killed during a three-hour siege. Families of the victims are being placed closest to plaques at each location in what the presidency calls a \u201cfamilies first\u201d protocol.",
      "At the caf\u00e9 terraces, the names of the 39 people killed there were read aloud.",
      "Outside the Bataclan, the boulevard fell silent as an afternoon ceremony began. Families and survivors gathered alongside current and former officials \u2014 including ex-President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and former Prime Minister Manuel Valls \u2014 while religious leaders and representatives of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, whose premises were also attacked just months before, joined them in tribute.",

      "\u201cTen years later, the emotion is still intact\u201d and hope must be shared \u201cdespite the pain and the absence,\" Hidalgo said at the event.",
      "The commemorations were set to culminate with the inauguration of the \u201cNovember 13 Memory Garden\" opposite City Hall.",
      "Conceived with victims\u2019 associations, it is a stone enclosure from which granite blocks rise to evoke the attack sites, engraved with the victims\u2019 names. The evening ceremony, attended by Macron, will be built around music in tribute to the spirit of festivity the attackers tried to destroy.",

Church bells across the capital, including those of Notre-Dame Cathedral, are due to ring in the early evening in memory of what the city\u2019s archbishop called \u201ca long night of anguish.\u201d",

The ensuing chaos led many children to be separated from their families, who keep searching for them 40 years later.",
      "On the night of the eruption, L\u00f3pez and her husband heard strange noises and left the house to see if something was wrong. She had heard on the news that the volcano was erupting, but left Sergio, 5 years old at the time, sleeping at home because she thought they were far enough away.",
      "But soon the lava melted the volcano\u2019s snow-capped peak and merged with the riverbeds, generating an avalanche that rushed down the mountains. The river overcame L\u00f3pez and her husband, overturning their car and causing them to take refuge in a tree and then house.",
      "Their house was destroyed, and she never saw Sergio again.",

      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- Hundreds of top economists and other experts, including former U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, called on Friday for the world to set up an independent international panel on income and wealth inequality.",
      "The call in an open letter came before the Group of 20 summit in South Africa next weekend, when a report on global inequality chaired by Nobel Prize-winning American economist Joseph Stiglitz is due to be presented to world leaders.",
      "That report, which was released this month, said that the world is facing an inequality emergency as well as a climate emergency, leading to more political instability and conflicts, and \u201cdecreased confidence in democracy.\u201d",
      "Between 2000 and 2024, the richest 1% captured 41% of all new wealth created in the world, the report said. Meanwhile, one in four people globally \u2014 around 2.3 billion people \u2014 now face moderate or severe food insecurity, meaning they regularly skip meals. That number has increased by 335 million people since 2019, the report said.",
      "The report recommended a new International Panel on Inequality to advise governments on how to address the issue in the same way the U.N.-appointed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change does to help develop climate policies.",

      "Airlines are optimistic they can resume normal operations just a few days after the government lifts its order to cut some flights at 40 busy airports, but it's not clear how soon that will happen even though the federal shutdown is over.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration did announce Wednesday night that airlines won't have to cut more than 6% of flights at those airports because air traffic controller staffing has improved significantly in the last few days. Originally the order that took effect last Friday called for those flight cuts to increase to 8% Thursday and top out at 10% on Friday.",
      "A number of air traffic controllers missed work while they were going without pay during the shutdown, and the spike in understaffing at airport towers and regional control centers prompted the flight cut order due to concerns about safety. The existing shortage of several thousand controllers is so bad that even a small number of absences in some locations caused problems.",
      "Officials at FAA and the Transportation Department didn't offer any updates Thursday morning about when they will decide to lift the order. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has said the decision will be based on the safety data that experts at the FAA are watching closely.",
      "The airlines say they will be ready and expect that normal operations will resume within three or four days after the order is lifted. Some experts have suggested that problems might linger longer than that and could affect Thanksgiving travel, so it is difficult to predict whether the airlines will be able to recover from this as quickly as they do after a major snowstorm disrupts their operations and leaves planes and crews out of position.",
      "The airlines focused their cuts on smaller regional routes to minimize the impact on their main hubs. By late Thursday morning, about 1,000 flights had been cancelled across the country.",

      "Duffy has said that controllers and other FAA employees should receive 70% of their back pay within 24-48 hours of the end of the shutdown with the rest to come over the next couple paychecks. The financial pressure on controllers drove some of them to seek out side jobs to help make ends meet and call out of work while they dealt with the stress.",
      "Last Saturday, the staff shortages peaked when 81 different FAA facilities warned they were running low on workers, forcing the airlines to cut additional flights. On Thursday morning, the FAA didn\u2019t list any staffing warnings at airports and other radar facilities across the country.",
      "American Airlines CEO Robert Isom and Chief Operating Officer David Seymour told employees in a letter Thursday that they are already seeing improvements as controller staffing stabilized over the last day or so even though more flight cuts will be needed until FAA lifts the order. But travelers should already be seeing fewer delays and cancellations on the day of their flights.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The six-week government shutdown that came to an end late Wednesday will be another drag on an economy already facing many challenges, though the full impact will take months to measure.",
      "About 1.25 million federal workers haven't been paid since Oct. 1. Roughly 10,000 flights have been cancelled since last week and disruptions will continue, the officials say, even as air traffic controllers return to work. Government contract awards have slowed and many food aid recipients have seen their benefits interrupted.",
      "Most of the lost economic activity will be recovered when the government reopens, as federal workers will receive back pay. But some canceled flights won't be rebooked, many canceled restaurant reservations won't be made again, and some postponed purchases will never happen.",
      "The shutdown also cut off the flow of economic data on jobs, inflation, and consumer spending, which could lead the Federal Reserve to skip what had been an expected interest rate cut at its next meeting in December.",
      "\u201cThe shutdown has been harmful to the U.S. economy and to critical data collection about employment, prices and more,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a six-week shutdown will reduce growth in this year's fourth quarter by about 1.5 percentage points. That would cut growth by about half from the third quarter. The reopening should boost first-quarter growth next year by 2.2 percentage points, the CBO projected, but about $11 billion in economic activity will be permanently lost.",
      "The previous longest government shutdown, in 2018-2019, lasted 35 days but only partially shut the government because many agencies had been fully funded. It only nicked the economy by about 0.02% of GDP, the CBO said then.",
      "This year's shutdown adds to the economy's existing challenges, which include sluggish hiring, stubbornly elevated inflation, and President Donald Trump's tariffs, which have caused uncertainty for many businesses. Still, few economists foresee a recession.",
      "Here are the ways the government closure has weighed on the economy:",
      "All told, federal workers missed about $16 billion in wages, the CBO estimates. That has meant less spending at stores, restaurants, and likely reduced holiday travel. Large purchases will probably be postponed, slowing the broader economy.",
      "Trump had threatened during the shutdown to not provide back pay but the deal struck in Congress would replace those lost wages once the government reopens.",
      "The shutdown has added to the Washington, D.C. area's economic woes, where the unemployment rate was already 6% before the shutdown, after Trump's cuts to the federal workforce this spring. While the Washington, D.C. area \u2014 including the nearby suburbs in Virginia and Maryland \u2014 has the highest concentration of federal workers, most live and work outside of the nation's capital.",
      "Federal workers make up about 5.5% of Maryland's workforce, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. But they also comprise 2.9% of New Mexico's workers, 2.6% of Oklahoma's, and 3.8% of Alaska's.",
      "Then there are the federal contractors. Bernard Yaros, an economist at Oxford Economics, estimates they could total as many as 5.2 million, and they are not guaranteed back pay once the shutdown ends.",
      "The government shutdown cut off the flow of economic data on unemployment, inflation, and retail spending that the Federal Reserve depends on to monitor the economy\u2019s health. Even as the government reopens, some of that data may not ever be reported, while other data will be delayed. As a result, the Fed may not deliver a third interest rate cut at its December meeting, which was widely expected before the shutdown.",

The government has missed two monthly jobs reports and the October inflation data, scheduled to be published Thursday, will likely never be issued.",

      "Some are drawn to side jobs because of instability in their workplace, or the perception that they may lose their income. Still others, reluctant to trust one employer to provide a steady job that lasts, are supplementing their main roles with gig work on apps such as Uber and Grubhub.",
      "\u201cWe have seen stagnant salaries, we\u2019ve seen inflation, we\u2019ve seen the cost of living overall increasing, even beyond our inflation measures,\u201d said Alexandrea Ravenelle, sociologist and gig economy researcher at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cSo people are looking for ways to supplement and to build themselves a little bit of a safety net.\u201d",
      "Some are creating \u201cportfolio careers\u201d where they work a variety of jobs, each building different valuable skills. In Cusick's case, side work keeps her social media marketing skills current.",
      "\u201cRather than having one job that you can have for many, many years and thinking about your career progression as a linear pathway, some people are putting together multiple side hustles based on their skills and interests and making the money work by having multiple revenue streams,\u201d said Elaine Chen, director of the Derby Entrepreneurship Center at Tufts University.",
      "Career experts and those with side jobs share tips on how to get started and what to avoid if you\u2019re considering branching out from your 9-to-5.",
      "If you're embarking on a side business on top of a full-time job, consider picking something you're naturally interested in, since you'll spend a lot of free time on the venture.",
      "\u201cYou have to love it,\u201d Chen said. \u201cUsually it is something that the person is really passionate about.\u201d",
      "For Josie White, 31, that passion was mental health. After struggling with schizoaffective disorder and finding effective treatment, she wanted to help others who have mental health challenges feel less alone.",
      "While working full-time as a fundraiser for Shelter the Homeless, a nonprofit organization in Salt Lake City, White decided to pursue public speaking on the side and began looking for opportunities to address groups and conferences where she could share her own experiences with mental illness \"to reassure people that there is hope and a light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d",
      "Launching a side hustle may require initial investment, and it can take a considerable amount of time before it generates income.",
      "When White started her side business, she began by offering her speaking services as an unpaid volunteer. She landed some gigs training nonprofit staff and speaking about fundraising, which wasn\u2019t her original goal, but those opportunities helped her gain experience.",
      "Over the past year she\u2019s booked 10 speaking engagements, and four of those will be paid, she said. She's taken the money she earned so far and re-invested it into developing her public speaking skills.",

      "Federal workers are expressing relief and frustration as the longest government shutdown has come to an end",
      "WASHINGTON -- Jessica Sweet spent the federal government shutdown cutting back. To make ends meet, the Social Security claims specialist drank only one coffee a day, skipped meals, cut down on groceries and deferred paying some household bills. She racked up spending on her credit card buying gas to get to work.",
      "With the longest shutdown ever coming to a close, Sweet and hundreds of thousands of other federal workers who missed paychecks will soon get some relief. But many are left feeling that their livelihoods served as political pawns in the fight between recalcitrant lawmakers in Washington and are asking themselves whether the battle was worth their sacrifices.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating to go through something like this,\u201d said Sweet, who is a union steward of AFGE Local 3343 in New York. \u201cIt shakes the foundation of trust that we all place in our agencies and in the federal government to do the right thing.\u201d",
      "The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Its end emerged when eight Democratic-aligned senators agreed to a deal to fund the government with no extension of the expiring subsidies.",
      "The shutdown created a cascade of troubles for many Americans. Throughout the shutdown, at least 670,000 federal employees were furloughed, while about 730,000 others were working without pay, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.",
      "The plight of the federal workers was among several pressure points, along with flight disruptions and cuts to food aid, that in the end ratcheted up the pressure on lawmakers to come to an agreement to fund the government.",
      "Throughout the six-week shutdown, officials in President Donald Trump's administration repeatedly used the federal workers as leverage to try to push Democrats to relent on their health care demands. The Republican president signaled that workers going unpaid wouldn't get back pay. He threatened and then followed through on firings in a federal workforce already reeling from layoffs earlier this year. A court then blocked the shutdown firings, adding to the uncertainty.",
      "The deal that is bringing an end to the shutdown will reverse the dismissals that occurred since Oct. 1, while also ensuring back pay for furloughed federal workers the Trump administration had left in doubt. The bipartisan deal provides funding to reopen the government, including for SNAP food aid and other programs.",
      "But the whiplash of the past six weeks, coupled with the concern that the longest shutdown ever may not be the last they face, has shaken many in the workforce.",
      "\u201cStress and hunger are great tactics for traumatizing people,\u201d Sweet said.",
      "For Sweet, the feelings of frustration are only compounded by a feeling that she was betrayed by the Democratic-aligned senators who broke with the party on the health care subsidies.",

      "Quantavia Smith, who was often homeless for a decade, now has a studio apartment in Los Angeles with easy access to public transit",
      "BOSTON -- After years of living on the street and crashing on friends' couches, Quantavia Smith was given the keys to a studio apartment in Los Angeles that came with an important perk \u2014 easy access to public transit.",
      "The 38-year-old feels like she went from a life where \u201cno one cares\u201d to one where she has a safe place to begin rebuilding her life. And the metro station the apartment complex was literally built upon is a lifeline as she searches for work without a car.",
      "\u201cIt is more a sense of relief, a sense of independence,\" said Smith, who moved in July. She receives some government assistance and pays 30% of her income for rent \u2014 just $19 a month for an efficiency with a full-market value of $2,000.",
      "\u201cHaving your own space, you feel like you can do anything.\"",
      "Metro areas from Los Angeles to Boston have taken the lead in tying new housing developments to their proximity to public transit, often teaming up with developers to streamline the permitting process and passing policies that promote developments that include a greater number of units.",
      "City officials argue building housing near public transit helps energize neglected neighborhoods and provide affordable housing, while ensuring a steady stream of riders for transit systems and cutting greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the number of cars on the road.",
      "\u201cTransit-oriented development should be one of, if not the biggest solution that we\u2019re looking at for housing development,\u201d said Yonah Freemark, research director at the Urban Institute\u2019s Land Use Lab, who has written extensively on the topic.",
      "\u201cIt takes advantage of all of this money we\u2019ve spent on transportation infrastructure. If you build the projects and don\u2019t build anything around the areas near them, then it\u2019s kind of like money thrown down the drain,\u201d Freemark said.",
      "The Santa Monica and Vermont Apartments where Smith lives is part of an ambitious plan by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build 10,000 housing units near transit sites by 2031 \u2014 offering developers land discounts in exchange for affordable housing development and other community benefits.",
      "In Washington D.C., the transit authority has completed eight projects since 2022 that provided nearly 1,500 apartments and a million square feet of office space. About half were in partnership with Amazon, which committed $3.6 billion in low-cost loans and grants for affordable housing projects in Washington, as well as Nashville, Tennessee, and the Puget Sound area in Washington state. Almost all are within a half-mile of public transit.",
      "\u201cBig cities face the greatest challenges when it comes to traffic congestion and high housing costs,\u201d Freemark said. \u201cBuilding new homes near transit helps address both problems by encouraging people to take transit while increasing housing supply.\u201d",
      "Among projects Boston has built, the Pok Oi Residents in Chinatown is a 10-minute walk to the subway and a half-dozen bus stops. That's a draw for Bernie Hernandez, who moved his family there from a Connecticut suburb after his daughter got into a Boston university.",
      "\u201cThe big difference is commuting. You don\u2019t need a car,\u201d said Hernandez, who said he can walk to the grocery story and pharmacy. His 17-year-old daughter takes the subway to school. Now, his car mostly sits idle, saving him money on gas and time spent in traffic.",
      "\u201cYou get to go to different places very quickly. Everything is convenient,\" Hernandez said.",
      "States from Massachusetts to California are passing laws targeting restrictive zoning regulations that for decades prohibited building multifamily developments and contributed to housing shortages.",
      "Last month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a state law allowing taller apartment buildings on land owned by transit agencies and near bus, train and subway lines.",
      "\u201cBuilding more homes in our most sustainable locations is the key to tackling the affordability crisis and locking in California\u2019s success for many years to come,\u201d said State Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who authored the bill.",

      "Among her most potent tools is a 2021 law that requires 177 towns or communities nearby to create zoning districts allowing multi-family housing. The state provided nearly $8 million to more than 150 communities to help create these zones, while threatening to cut funding for those that don't. More than 6,000 housing units are in development as a result.",
      "\u201cYou put housing nearby public transit\" Healey said. \"It\u2019s great for people. They can literally get up, leave their home, walk to a commuter rail and get to work.\u201d",
      "Among the first to comply was Lexington, which has approved 10 projects, including a $115 million complex with 187 housing units and retail space.",
      "Walking past earth-moving equipment and dump trucks at the construction site earlier this year, project manager Quinlan Locke said: \u201cThis is a landscape yard. It\u2019s commercial. It\u2019s meant for trucking.\u201d",
      "But, he added, in \u201ctwo years from now, it\u2019s going to be meant for people who live here, work here and play here. This is going to become someone\u2019s home.\u201d",
      "Some advocates argue the lofty goals of transit housing are falling short due to fierce local resistance and lack of funding and support at the federal and state levels.",
      "Higher mortgage interest rates, more government red tape, rising construction costs and lack of investment at transit stations also have contributed to a troubling trend \u2014 nine times more housing units built far from public transit versus near it in the past two decades, according to a 2023 Urban Institute study.",
      "In Massachusetts, 19 communities still haven't created new zones. Some unsuccessfully sued the state to halt the law, while residents rejected new zones in others. Lexington eventually shrank its zone from 227 acres to 90 acres after residents complained.",
      "\u201cIf we allow the state to come in and dictate how we zone, what else are they going to come in and dictate?\u201d said Anthony Renzoni, a selectman from the town of Holden, which sued the state and is drawing up a new zoning map after residents rejected the first one.",
      "In Los Angeles, the six-story complex where Smith lives in East Hollywood is home to 300 new residents since opening in February. It's revitalizing the area around the metro site, with a Filipino grocery, medical clinic and farmers market opening early next year.",
      "Half the 187 units are reserved for formerly homeless residents like Smith, who had been living in a rundown motel paid for with a voucher and before that on the street. She's been assigned a case worker and is getting help with basic life skills, budgeting and finding work.",
      "Equally important: Smith, who can't afford a car, doesn't need one.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very very fortunate to be somewhere where the transit takes me where I want to go,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere I want to go is not that far.\u201d",

      "More than 1,000 unionized Starbucks workers are planning to strike at 65 U.S. stores starting Thursday",
      "More than 1,000 unionized Starbucks workers plan to strike at 65 U.S. stores Thursday to protest a lack of progress in labor negotiations with the company.",
      "The strike was intended to disrupt Starbucks' Red Cup Day, which is typically one of the company's busiest days of the year. Since 2018, Starbucks has given out free, reusable cups on that day to customers who buy a holiday drink.",
      "Starbucks Workers United, the union organizing Starbucks baristas, said stores in 45 cities would be impacted, including New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, San Diego, St. Louis, Dallas, Columbus, Ohio, and Starbucks' home city of Seattle. There is no date set for the strike to end, and more stores are prepared to join if Starbucks doesn't reach a contract agreement with the union, organizers said.",
      "Starbucks emphasized that the vast majority of its U.S. stores would be open and operating as usual Thursday. The coffee giant has 10,000 company-owned stores in the U.S., as well as 7,000 licensed locations in places like grocery stores and airports.",
      "Around 550 company-owned U.S. Starbucks stores are currently unionized. More have voted to unionize, but Starbucks closed 59 unionized stores in September as part of a larger reorganization campaign.",
      "Here's what's behind the strike.",
      "Striking workers say they're protesting because Starbucks has yet to reach a contract agreement with the union. Starbucks workers first voted to unionize at a store in Buffalo in 2021. In December 2023, Starbucks vowed to finalize an agreement by the end of 2024. But in August of last year, the company ousted Laxman Narasimhan, the CEO who made that promise. The union said progress has stalled under Brian Niccol, the company\u2019s current chairman and CEO.",
      "Workers say they're seeking better hours and improved staffing in stores, where they say long customer wait times are routine. They say too many workers aren't getting the required 20 hours per week they need before Starbucks' benefits kick in. They also want higher pay, pointing out that executives like Niccol are making millions.",
      "The union also wants the company to resolve hundreds of unfair labor practice charges filed by workers, who say the company has fired baristas in retaliation for unionizing and has failed to bargain over changes in policy that workers must enforce, like its decision earlier this year to limit restroom use to paying customers.",

In a letter to employees last week, Starbucks\u2019 Chief Partner Officer Sara Kelly said the union walked away from the bargaining table in the spring.",
      "Kelly said Starbucks remained ready to talk and \u201cbelieves we can move quickly to a reasonable deal.\u201d Kelly also said surveys showed that most employees like working for the company, and its barista turnover rates are half the industry average.",
      "Unionized workers have gone on strike at Starbucks before. In 2022 and 2023, workers walked off the job on Red Cup Day. Last year, a five-day strike ahead of Christmas closed 59 U.S. stores. Each time, Starbucks said the disruption to its operations was minimal. Starbucks United said the new strike is open-ended and could spread to many more unionized locations.",
      "The number of non-union Starbucks locations dwarfs the number of unionized ones. But Todd Vachon, a union expert at the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said any strike could be highly visible and educate the public on baristas' concerns.",
      "Unlike manufacturers, Vachon said, retail industries depend on the connection between their employees and their customers. That makes shaming a potentially powerful weapon in the union\u2019s arsenal, he said.",
      "Starbucks' same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, rose 1% in the July-September period. It was the first time in nearly two years that the company had posted an increase. In his first year at the company, Niccol set new hospitality standards, redesigned stores to be cozier and more welcoming, and adjusted staffing levels to better handle peak hours.",
      "Starbucks also is trying to prioritize in-store orders over mobile ones. Last week, the company's holiday drink rollout in the U.S. was so successful that it almost immediately sold out of its glass Bearista cup. Starbucks said demand for the cup exceeded its expectations, but it wouldn't say if the Bearista will return before the holidays are over.",

      "Two Federal Reserve officials expressed opposition Wednesday to another interest rate cut at the central bank\u2019s next meeting in December, further muddying the outlook for the Fed\u2019s next steps",
      "WASHINGTON -- Two Federal Reserve officials expressed opposition Wednesday to another interest rate cut at the central bank's next meeting in December, further muddying the outlook for the Fed's next steps.",
      "The remarks by Susan Collins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Raphael Bostic, president of the Atlanta Fed, suggest that the central bank's rate-setting committee could be tilting against what had been an expected third straight cut next month.",
      "The officials cited several reasons for keeping rates unchanged, after a reduction in September and in October. They argued that inflation is stubbornly elevated and has been above the Fed's 2% target for nearly five years, while the economy is resilient and doesn't appear to need more rate cuts. The job market is stumbling, with hiring nearly at a standstill, but layoffs still seem muted, they said.",
      "Another factor has been the government shutdown, which has cut off the economic data the Fed relies on to discern the economy\u2019s path. On Wednesday White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that the jobs and inflation reports for October would likely never be released.",
      "\u201cFormulating an economic outlook is challenging \u2014 and the limited data compounds the difficulty,\u201d Collins said in a speech in Boston.",
      "\u201cIt will likely be appropriate to keep policy rates at the current level for some time ... in this highly uncertain environment,\u201d she added.",
      "That is a shift from her previous speech in October, when she expressed support for at least one more rate cut.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Bostic said he remains concerned inflation is too high, and added that, \"I ... favor keeping the funds rate steady until we see clear evidence that inflation is again moving meaningfully toward its 2% target.\u201d Bostic said earlier Wednesday that he will retire when his current term ends on Feb. 28, 2026.",
      "Their remarks come at an unusually challenging time for the Fed, with the economy facing both weak hiring and elevated inflation. Typically, the Fed would reduce its rate to encourage borrowing, spending and job gains, while it would keep it unchanged \u2014 or even raise it \u2014 to combat inflation.",
      "The 19 officials on the Fed's rate-setting committee narrowly supported three rate cuts this year at their September meeting, but Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference late last month that the committee remains divided and another cut in December was not a \u201cforegone conclusion.\u201d",

      "Researchers are reporting two promising approaches to counteract malaria's growing drug resistance",
      "NEW YORK -- Researchers on Wednesday reported two promising new approaches to counteract malaria\u2019s growing resistance to medication \u2014 one involving a new class of drugs.",
      "Switzerland-based Novartis released results of what it called a next-generation treatment. A study of its experimental drug in 12 African countries found it works well against the mosquito-borne parasite that causes malaria and seems to block spread.",
      "The drug, called GanLum, is not yet licensed and more than a year away from being available.",
      "It's needed, said Dr. David Sullivan, a malaria expert at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "The parasite that causes the disease is developing resistance to existing drugs, meaning \u201cthe ice is thinning,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cIt hasn't given way, but we're concerned.\u201d",
      "GanLum has been given as a packet of tiny powder-like granules, once daily for three days. But getting people to take malaria drugs over several days has been challenging \u2014 some stop after one or two doses makes them feel better. Experts say a third or more of malaria patients fail to complete the current standard three-day treatment course, a problem that can encourage drug resistance and allow curable cases to intensify.",
      "In an effort to offer a one-time treatment, another team of researchers said an experiment in West Africa found a single dose of four widely available malaria drugs proved to be an effective cure.",
      "The two studies were presented Wednesday at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene conference in Toronto.",
      "Malaria is caused by a parasite that spreads through mosquito bites. Infected people can suffer fever, chills and flu-like illness that, if left untreated, can lead to severe complications and death. It's mainly found in tropical and subtropical climates. The largest death toll in recent years has been seen in children in sub-Saharan Africa.",
      "The medical battle against malaria has ebbed and flowed, as new drugs come along, but the parasite gradually develops the ability to resist them.",
      "At the beginning of this century, for example, resistance to the drug chloroquine was widespread and malaria killed more than 1.8 million people per year. But then came a class of drugs known as artemisinins, which worked well and helped drive a dramatic decline in global malaria death rates.",
      "Artemisinin-based compounds remain the first-line treatment in most cases. But signs of partial resistance have been reported, and \u2014 for several reasons \u2014 malaria death rates have plateaued or even started to rise in some parts of the world.",
      "Dr. Ghyslain Mombo-Ngoma led a study in Gabon in which researchers gave a single-dose treatment combining an artemisinin with three other antimalarial medications \u2014 pyronaridine, sulfadoxine, and pyrimethamine.",
      "From May 2024 to October 2025, he and his colleagues treated more than 1,000 patients, half of them younger than 10, who were sick with malaria but not suffering life-threatening symptoms. A little over half got the four-drug, one-time treatment. The rest got a standard, artemisinin-based treatment.",

      "Mombo-Ngoma said there are discussions underway with a drug manufacturer to produce a single capsule or packet of pills to help create an inexpensive, easy-to-take cure.",
      "Sullivan, however, noted that resistance is already established to some components of the treatment, meaning it likely will prove to be \u201ca short-term fix.\"",
      "Novartis' GanLum is a combination of a new drug, ganaplacide, and an existing long-acting medication, lumefantrine.",
      "In a study involving about 1,700 adults and children in 12 African countries, GanLum was found to have a cure rate of better than 97%, which was a little higher than a common artemisinin-based treatment. It was also highly effective against mutant malaria parasites with partial drug resistance, Novartis officials said.",
      "Side effects included fever and anemia \u2014 similar to what's seen in patients who take some of the current antimalarials, Novartis officials said. There was a higher level of vomiting right after the drug was given, which company officials say may stem from its taste. The company is exploring flavoring or sweetening, a spokesman said.",
      "Novartis officials said they are working toward regulatory approvals. George Jagoe of the Medicines for Malaria Venture, which collaborated with Novartis, said he hopes to see GanLum begin rolling out to patients within 18 months.",
      "The new treatment approaches can complement other efforts against malaria, including treated mosquito bed nets and new vaccines, said Dr. Andrea Bosman, a malaria expert with the World Health Organization.",
      "But the promising news comes at a time when funding from the United States and some other sources is being cut, which could impact the ability of scientists to monitor drug resistance or make prevention and treatments available to people who need them, Bosman noted.",

      "California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver\u2019s licenses given to immigrants after discovering the expiration dates went past when the drivers were legally allowed to be in the U.S., state officials said Wednesday.",
      "The announcement follows harsh criticism from the Trump administration about California and other states granting licenses to people in the country illegally. The issue was thrust into the public\u2019s consciousness in August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California\u2019s action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state acted improperly even though it previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver\u2019s licenses it issued after Duffy raised concerns.",
      "\u201cAfter weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we\u2019ve exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\u201d Duffy said, referring to the state's governor. \u201cThis is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.\u201d",
      "Newsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose license is being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government. At first, his office declined to disclose the exact reason for revoking the licenses, saying only they violated state law. Later, his office revealed the state law it was referring to was one that requires the licenses expire on or before a person\u2019s legal status to be in the United State ends, as reported to the DMV.",
      "Still, Newsom\u2019s spokesperson Brandon Richards shot back at Duffy in a statement.",
      "\u201cOnce again, the Sean \u2018Road Rules\u2019 Duffy fails to share the truth \u2014 spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,\u201d Richards said.",
      "Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only adding to the concerns.",
      "Duffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards.",
      "Duffy revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don't invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state's effort to comply.",
      "The new rules for commercial driver's licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting them extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant\u2019s immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant\u2019s visa expires sooner.",

H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won\u2019t be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.",

      "The people who are attending the Conference of the Parties, or COP30, have a wide range of hopes for the outcome. This year is different than in past years, because leaders aren't expected to sign one big agreement at the end of it; instead, organizers and analysts have said it's about getting specifics to execute on past promises to act on climate change.",
      "But many of the activists have some goals in common. They want nations to center the needs of historically marginalized communities who bear the brunt of the climate crisis with the least resources to adapt. That means including those communities in leadership and decision-making. And they want to see political will toward stopping the greenhouse gas emissions, resource extraction and other practices driving the problem.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re bridging what\u2019s happening in the mind, when we talk about policy, we need to bridge to the heart, and touch our spirit when we do the work,\u201d said Whaia, another member of A Wisdom Keepers Delegation, a Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu woman from New Zealand. \u201cIt takes both arms, both branches of the tree to really be strong, to be able to find our resilience in this space.\u201d",
      "The ability to express thoughts and feelings freely is a welcome respite for many arriving in Brazil after several years of these talks being held in countries where governments imposed limitations on free speech and demonstrations.",
      "On Tuesday night, that freedom ran up against security personnel as a group of activists briefly tried to force their way into the main COP venue before they were pushed back.",
      "The evolution that needs to happen for the world to take action is \"not in the halls of the U.N. COP, but it\u2019s in the streets and it is with our people,\u201d said Jacob Johns, an Akimel O'Otham and Hopi member of A Wisdom Keepers Delegation who witnessed the security breach.",

      "President Donald Trump ordered the cancelation of the penny earlier this year, noting that the cost of making them had became more than their value.",
      "Here's what you should know about the penny's long history in the U.S.",
      "The penny was one of the first coins made by the U.S. Mint after its establishment in 1792, when only the half-cent was being produced along with the 1-cent coin.",
      "Congress eventually discontinued the unpopular half cent in 1857, but kept the modest penny after deciding to making it smaller to save money on the copper needed to make the coin. Today, the penny is made with 97.5% zinc with copper plating.",
      "There are an estimated 250 billion pennies still in circulation in the U.S., according to the American Bankers Association. This means the last pressed pennies won't disappear, but circulation will slow. Pennies still remain legal tender, and will largely remain worth the same humble 1-cent.",
      "On Wednesday, U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach told reporters that they would auction off the final pennies printed in Philadelphia.",
      "There are about 114 billion pennies currently in circulation in the United States, but they are greatly underutilized, according to the Treasury.",

      "However, defenders of the penny say the cost is a bargain compared to the nickel, which costs almost 14 cents to mint. Each dime costs nearly 6 cents to make and distribute, and a quarter costs nearly 15 cents.",

      "The penny has also remained useful not only for charity drives but also for those who continue to use physical cash and coins for purchases.",

      "NEW YORK -- Asked what viewers should expect when television's MSNBC makes its corporate divorce from NBC News official this weekend, network president Rebecca Kutler points to a poster on the wall of a conference room at its new offices off Times Square.",
      "Its message reads: \u201cSame Mission. New Name.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo me, that encapsulates exactly what we need to be saying,\u201d Kutler said. \u201cOur job in the next few weeks is to flood the zone ... and make sure they know the thing that they love will be the exact same thing on Nov. 15.\u201d",
      "Saturday is when MSNBC officially becomes MS NOW, standing for My Source for News, Opinion and the World. That's the most visible manifestation of parent company Comcast's decision to spin off most of its cable networks into a new company known as Versant.",
      "It's tough enough when one partner tells another that they're leaving for someone new. In this case, they're just leaving the partner behind; a cable television network is considered such a diminishing asset in today's media world that giant companies would rather be free of them.",
      "\u201cA lot of us really didn't know what it meant,\u201d said prime-time host Jen Psaki, \u201cand it didn't feel great initially.\u201d",
      "Left on its own, MS NOW is embracing the ethos of a startup, suggesting it will be better positioned to experiment without ties to the more corporate NBC News. \u201cMorning Joe\u201d is starting its own newsletter. Podcast ideas are encouraged. The network is expanding live events, letting its television stars interact with the audience; Rachel Maddow has one in Chicago later this month.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see this as a divorce,\u201d said nighttime host Michael Steele. \u201cI see this as the kid growing up and leaving home. We all know what that\u2019s like.\u201d",
      "As Kutler says, the network's focus on news and commentary with a liberal perspective remains intact. So does its lineup of stars \u2014 Maddow, Nicolle Wallace, Ari Melber and the like. MS NOW has built its own reporting and support staff, and is moving into a new headquarters west of Broadway in Manhattan that is, not incidentally, the former longtime headquarters of The New York Times.",
      "The new office, tricked out with the latest electronics, ends one geographical oddity: No longer are the political polar opposites MSNBC and Fox News Channel located across Sixth Avenue from one another.",
      "The MS NOW news staff has about three dozen reporters, among them Washington Post alums Jackie Alemany and Carol Leonnig. It has signed partnerships with Sky News for international reporting and AccuWeather for forecasting.",
      "\u201cBeing divorced from NBC News gives it the opportunity to make deals on its own to supplement its cable existence,\u201d said longtime broadcast and cable news executive Kate O'Brian, who spent several years at ABC. They have a strong identity and a built-in audience of people who oppose President Donald Trump, she said.",

Fox News Channel, popular with Trump supporters, is up 14% to 3.11 million viewers.",
      "Yet MSNBC has roughly twice the audience of CNN, which saw an identical 29% decrease in viewers over the first nine months of 2025. MSNBC was also buoyed by a strong election night performance where it ran neck-and-neck with Fox, even while missing the khaki-clad numbers nerd, Steve Kornacki, who chose to remain with NBC News.",

      "As president of one of the Fed\u2019s 12 regional banks, Bostic, 59, serves on the 19-member committee that meets eight times a year to decide whether to change a key short-term interest rate that influences borrowing costs throughout the economy. Only 12 of the 19 participants vote on rates at each meeting. The regional Fed presidents rotate as voters, and the Atlanta Fed\u2019s president will next vote in 2027.",

He has recently expressed concerns that inflation is still too high for the Fed to deeply cut its key rate, and suggested he supported just one rate cut this year, while the Fed has cut twice.",
      "Bostic did not provide a reason for stepping down, but is speaking later Wednesday and could provide more details.",
      "In 2022, Bostic acknowledged that many of his financial investments and trades in previous years had violated Fed ethics rules and revised all his financial statements dating back to 2017. At the time, he said the trades were made by investment managers that he did not directly oversee and that he was unaware of the transactions.",
      "The Fed\u2019s Washington, D.C.-based board of governors will vote on whether to approve Bostic\u2019s replacement. Trump has sought to gain more control over the Fed's board, which would potentially give the administration more sway over the approval of the regional Fed presidents.

      "Visa and Mastercard have been in litigation with a class-action group of merchants for nearly 20 years over the costs they impose on merchants to use their payment networks, known as interchange. A previous settlement was rejected by the judge overseeing the case last this year, requiring Visa and Mastercard\u2019s lawyers to go back to the drawing board on the scope and size of the settlement.",
      "The new part of the settlement announced Monday addresses the \u201chonor all cards\u201d rule, a cornerstone of how credit and debit cards work in the U.S.",
      "The \u201chonor all cards\u201d rule states that if a merchant accepts Visa or Mastercard as a form of payment, they are required to accept all iterations of Visa and Mastercard products, regardless of who issues it and the cost to the merchant.",
      "That has led to consternation among merchants over the years because rewards-heavy credit cards, like the Chase Sapphire Reserve or Citi Strata Elite, use a premium version of a Visa or Mastercard. For the Sapphire Reserve, Chase uses the Visa Infinite card, and for a card like Strata Elite, it\u2019s issued as a World Elite Mastercard. These cards have gotten far more popular in the last decade.",
      "Both a Visa Infinite and World Elite Mastercard cost more for a merchant to accept. The amount of additional interchange a merchant will pay varies on size and industry, but one example is the Visa Infinite, which can be 15 basis points (0.15%) more expensive than a Visa Signature (a mid-tier credit card) for a merchant to accept.",
      "Under the proposed settlement, merchants could discriminate between the different tiers of Visa and Mastercard products, meaning high-reward credit card users may be declined at checkout if the merchant has opted out of accepting the higher-tier card. A merchant may also be able to pass along the higher cost to accept the rewards cards to the customer in the form of a surcharge on their bill, under the proposed settlement.",
      "This will place merchants in the position of making a choice: accept all cards with the higher fees or reject some of the higher-fee cards and likely upset wealthier consumers who typically enjoy earning points on routine purchases.",

      "Like the previous settlement last year, merchants would receive a temporary reduction on swipe fees for a few years. In this settlement it would be a 10 basis point reduction in swipe fees for five years, and standard credit card transactions would be processed at 1.25% of the purchase price for eight years.",
      "When the settlement was announced on Monday, the major merchant and retail lobby groups came out in opposition, so it\u2019s not certain whether this settlement will ultimately be the one that is finalized. Merchants and lobbyists have been pushing for years to get Congress to regulate interchange fees, as they do with debit cards. The merchant groups say this settlement does not go far enough.",
      "\u201cOnce again, this proposal is all window dressing and no substance. The reduction in swipe fees doesn\u2019t begin to go far enough, and the change in the honor-all-cards rule would accomplish nothing. If the courts can\u2019t fix this, it\u2019s time for Congress to take action,\u201d said Stephanie Martz, chief administrative officer and general counsel for the National Retail Federation, in a statement.",
      "The payment networks, who are ready to put the matter behind them after two decades of litigation, say this may be the best solution for the merchants to potentially avoid a drawn out trial-and-appeal process.",
      "\u201cWe believe that this is the best resolution for all parties, delivering the clarity, flexibility and consumer protections that were sought in this effort,\u201d a Mastercard company spokesperson said.",
      "The settlement involves Visa and Mastercard only. American Express, which uses a closed-loop system where it's both the issuing bank and payment network for their cards, is not involved in this ongoing litigation. The settlement also does not impact debit cards.",

      "More than 80 organizations that provide health care for women all over the world received grants Wednesday totaling $250 million from Melinda French Gates after a year-long application process.",
      "French Gates said the majority of the recipients of the Action for Women\u2019s Health challenge have not previously received funding from her organization, Pivotal, or from the Gates Foundation, which she founded with her ex-husband Bill Gates. She stepped away from the Gates Foundation last year.",
      "\u201cIt will be instructive for the world to see what it looks like when organizations like this aren\u2019t so chronically underfunded,\u201d French Gates said in written responses to The Associated Press, which receives funding from Pivotal for news coverage.",
      "The grants, which range between $1 million and $5 million, were awarded through a competition that was open to nonprofit organizations from most countries. French Gates said the point of holding such an open call is to learn about organizations that aren't already known to major funders. The Chicago-based nonprofit Lever for Change ran the application process and said more than 4,000 organizations from 119 countries applied.",
      "\u201cThis seems to be a topic that resonates,\" said Cecilia Conrad, CEO of Lever for Change, of global women's health. \u201cSo I\u2019m excited about helping to uplift and elevate the profile of these organizations with other funders.\u201d Her organization often provides donors, both large and small, with advice about what organizations to support, drawing from the list of finalists who have applied to the grant competitions they run.",
      "This is the second largest funding competition that Lever for Change has hosted, after MacKenzie Scott gave $640 million to community-based nonprofits in the U.S. in March 2024.",
      "For the Likhaan Center for Women\u2019s Health based in the Philippines, the $5 million grant represents 10 years of funding at their current annual budget.",
      "\u201cI could not contain the joy of people in the room,\u201d said executive director Junice Melgar when she and her staff learned they had been selected.",
      "For 30 years, Likhaan has provided primary care to very poor communities and advocated for policy changes to reflect community needs. Beyond the money, Melgar said the recognition affirms the effectiveness and sustainability of their community-based model.",
      "The investment in global women's health organizations is part of a $1 billion commitment that French Gates made to support women's rights over two years. She also gave $20 million each to 12 individuals to distribute to nonprofits of their choice and has pledged $150 million to boost gender equity in workplaces.",
      "Lisel Lifshitz, the executive director of the small nonprofit Mujeres Aliadas, which also received a grant, said her organization makes \"magic\u201d with every dollar they receive. Located in Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, Mujeres Aliadas trains midwives and provides education to women and teens about sexual and reproductive health.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t know what it takes to be very creative in more rural and complicated contexts, talking about security, about poverty, about the many, many things that are missing here,\u201d she said.",

      "Rahel Nardos, director of Global Women\u2019s Health at the Center for Global Health and Social Responsibility, University of Minnesota, said the historic exclusion of women from medical research and a lack of research into issues that impact women specifically, like menopause, contribute to women's poor health.",

      "Less appealing are higher fuel bills and the expense of buying an SUV that\u2019s showroom-fresh. The experts at Edmunds have found five solutions on the used market to keep costs in line. Choosing a used hybrid SUV saves money at the point of purchase, and the hybrid engine helps lower the cost of refueling for many miles down the road.",
      "Using a price cap of $25,000, Edmunds\u2019 team has compiled five used hybrid-powered SUVs that are practical and kind to a car shopping budget.",
      "The Escape Hybrid is the fuel-sipping cousin of Ford\u2019s popular compact SUV. Getting it down the road is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder paired to an electric motor. Front-wheel drive is standard; all-wheel drive is optional. In terms of fuel economy, both the front-wheel-drive and all-wheel drive models delivers an EPA-estimated 39 mpg combined. Edmunds has complimented the Escape\u2019s comfortable ride, easy-to-use controls and everyday practicality.",
      "Look for:Arriving for the 2020 model year, the fourth-generation Escape Hybrid is a well-rounded driving companion. For 2023, Ford updated the infotainment system and exterior design. For added peace of mind, it\u2019s worth knowing the hybrid has always come standard with Ford\u2019s Co-Pilot360 bundle of driver assist features.",
      "The Honda CR-V has long been a top choice for SUV shoppers looking for reliable transportation at an affordable price. During testing, Edmunds complimented the driving refinement of the CR-V with the available hybrid powertrain. Braking and handling are equally polished, though Edmunds noted accelerating from 0 to 60 mph took 8.5 seconds \u2014 1 second longer than the non-hybrid model. Fuel economy is strong at an EPA-estimated 38 mpg combined city/highway for 2020-2022 models. The spacious interior has good outward visibility and generous cargo space.",
      "Look for:The hybrid version of the previous generation CR-V ran from 2020 through 2022. Standard equipment included all-wheel drive, a 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and the Honda Sensing suite of driver assist features. Honda dropped the entry-level LX trim for the 2021 model year, so used prices tick upward from that point.",
      "Making a styling statement isn\u2019t always high on car shoppers\u2019 priority list. Hyundai didn\u2019t get that memo because the Tucson Hybrid\u2019s eye-catching design is highlighted by a sculpted exterior and headlights hidden within the pattern of the grille. Under the hood is a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder and electric motor coupled to standard all-wheel drive. Fuel economy is up to 38 mpg combined depending on the trim and model year. Better still, Edmunds notes this peppier drivetrain addresses the non-hybrid Tucson\u2019s sluggish acceleration.",
      "Look for:The redesigned Tucson created a splash when it arrived for the 2022 model year. Its upscale interior matched the bold exterior; the cabin was filled with high-quality materials, and standard features included an 8-inch touchscreen with wireless smartphone connectivity. The Tucson also has an outstanding warranty, including 10 years/100,000 miles of powertrain coverage.",

A class-leading warranty and up to an EPA-estimated 53 mpg combined, depending on the trim and model year, are two additional standout qualities.",
      "Look for:A redesign for the 2023 model year gave the Niro a futuristic shape and improved cabin quality. Edmunds complimented the interior design but found some audio and climate controls overly finicky. The Niro is also front-wheel-drive, with no option to add all-wheel drive. Yet its budget-friendly prices mean used versions readily come in below $25,000.",
      "The RAV4 Hybrid uses the strong foundation of Toyota\u2019s best-selling SUV and adds greater fuel economy and speedier acceleration. Edmunds found the all-wheel-drive RAV4 Hybrid needed 7.8 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph \u2014 a second faster than the non-hybrid version. Fuel economy is excellent thanks to EPA-estimated combined average of up to 40 mpg depending on trim and model year. The RAV4 also has near class-leading cargo space, plus a low load floor that\u2019s appreciated when loading heavy items.",
      "Look for:The fifth generation of the RAV4 and RAV4 Hybrid was available from 2019 to 2025. Outside of some upgraded tech touches \u2014 such as a larger touchscreen and improved smartphone connectivity \u2014 changes were minimal. The RAV4 holds onto its resale value, so older used models will more easily fall under $25,000.",

      "Major League Soccer\u2019s owners have voted to shift the league\u2019s season to a summer to spring calendar in 2027, bringing it more in line with its international counterparts",
      "Major League Soccer owners voted Thursday to shift the league's season to a summer-to-spring calendar in 2027, bringing it more in line with its international counterparts.",
      "The move aims to put MLS in a more competitive position for player transfers, while also freeing up players for national team duty during the summer, when many major international tournaments take place.",
      "This season the league started play in late February, with a break for the Club World Cup over the summer. The MLS Cup championship game is set for Dec. 6.",
      "The vote came at the Board of Governors meeting in Palm Beach, Florida. Under the new calendar, league play will begin in mid- to late July 2027, with the final day of the regular season in April 2028. The playoffs and championship will take place in May.",
      "The league would go on an extended break during the winter, with just a few games played in early December and no games in January before resuming in early to mid-February.",
      "The league is working with the Major League Soccer Players Association to finalize the transition.",
      "MLS Commissioner Don Garber told reporters on a conference call Thursday afternoon that the move was \u201cone of the most important decisions in our league\u2019s history.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is an opportunity for us to eliminate the competition that we've had for our playoffs as they exist today in a very crowded time of the year. It allows us to be aligned with the international transfer windows, which we think is incredibly important. It gives us a wide variety of opportunities that will expand our ability to be on this path to be one of the top and leading leagues in the world,\u201d Garber said.",
      "While there were concerns about weather challenges during the winter months, teams like Minnesota United and the Chicago Fire already face cold and sometimes snowy conditions. In a March 2024 match, Real Salt Lake and LAFC played in blizzard conditions in Sandy, Utah.",
      "But with a warming climate, matches in the summer months have become problematic, too. Soaring temperatures were a concern at some of the Club World Cup matches this past July and August.",
      "\u201cTo be sure, the calendar change discussion also raised challenges related to the weather for a number of the league\u2019s most northern-based teams, but we are confident in the efforts that have been made, and will remain a priority for the entire league, to address it,\u201d Toronto FC said in a statement released following the MLS announcement. \u201cIt was our view that with more than 90 percent of the proposed MLS schedule staying consistent with its current format, the benefits to the future league product outweighed the potential challenges.\u201d",

      "More than 150 Turkish referees are alleged to have bet on games, including seven who are approved to handle top-level games and 15 top-level assistants. It is unclear if any of the match officials are on the FIFA list approved to handle international games for national or club teams.",

    "summary": "A $2.8 billion NCAA settlement will let schools pay athletes directly, ending the amateur model that defined college sports for over a century",
    "story": [
      "A $2.8 billion NCAA settlement will let schools pay athletes directly, ending the amateur model that defined college sports for over a century",
      "Morgan State athletic director Dena Freeman-Patton faced a tough choice this year as she considered a new framework that allows colleges and universities to pay athletes directly.",
      "While opting in to the House settlement allows schools to remain competitive and attract top athletes, it can also create new financial pressure. Meanwhile, there are concerns that new limitations on roster sizes could shut women out from opportunities to compete, especially in non-revenue-producing sports like track and field.",
      "This is a familiar conundrum for leaders across the U.S. in the wake of the $2.8 billion antitrust settlement, which dismantled an amateur model that defined college sports for more than a century. But the challenges are especially acute for historically Black colleges and universities like Morgan State and other underfunded schools that remain committed to women\u2019s sports even as they navigate fierce budget pressures.",
      "\u201cWhen you make that decision then your question is, \u2018OK, where\u2019s the money coming from?\u2019\u201d Freeman-Patton said. \u201cOne of the things we were adamant (about) is that we\u2019re not going to cut from what we are already offering to our student athletes.\u201d",
      "\u201cEspecially,\u201d she added, \u201cour women\u2019s programs.\u201d",
      "Morgan State is one of more than 300 schools that ultimately agreed to the settlement, which took effect in July. The school committed to equal revenue-sharing pools for men\u2019s and women\u2019s programs. But the revenue tied to athletics at Morgan State \u2014 about $21.7 million in the 2023-2024 fiscal year, according to federal Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act filings \u2014 pales in comparison to the hundreds of millions that bigger schools in the Power Four regularly rake in.",
      "As schools grapple with the new framework, female athletes say the benefits largely favor football and men's basketball players. That, they say, poses a serious equity risk by including virtually no mandates on gender parity and relying on schools to uphold Title IX on their own.",
      "\"I don\u2019t even see how the spirit of Title IX is kept in place, let alone Title IX at all,\" said bobsledder Elana Meyers Taylor, a five-time Olympic medalist and former softball player at George Washington. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about maybe top SEC schools that can actually afford this. What are the other schools going to do?\u201d",
      "Some of those smaller schools are already cutting sports in anticipation of the sweeping changes, which include roster limits.",
      "Prairie View A&M, a Texas-based HBCU with about a $15.4 million operating budget in the 2023-24 fiscal year, recently cut its women\u2019s and men\u2019s tennis programs. The school cited a \u201ctough decision\u201d tied to \u201cthe evolving landscape of collegiate athletics.\u201d",
      "In May, Stephen F. Austin announced it would eliminate beach volleyball, bowling and men\u2019s and women\u2019s golf programs for budgetary reasons. A Title IX lawsuit brought by six female athletes temporarily blocked the cuts, a development that might discourage more schools from cutting programs.",
      "In the meantime, some athletes say they're confused about what the future holds for their sport.",
      "\u201cThe lack of information is scarier than the settlement itself,\u201d said Emily Pierce, a distance runner at Campbell, \u201cbecause most of us aren\u2019t fully sure what it means or how it will impact us.\u201d",
      "Roster cuts have already affected some of the athletes on her team, which she hopes could benefit from improved facilities and increased recruiting support through the settlement.",

      "\u201cThe roster cuts have been pretty scary, and it\u2019s definitely taken a toll on my team knowing that there may be more in the future,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cWe just want to make sure opportunities aren\u2019t taken away, especially in women\u2019s sports, where it\u2019s taken such a long time to get to where we are now.\u201d",
      "No HBCU has the $200 million operating budget of many Power Four schools. But some went along with the settlement anyway because they feared opting out would make it even harder to recruit athletes and generate more revenue. Many of the schools that agreed to the settlement are finding creative ways to come up with the money to pay their athletes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve always felt we\u2019ve had the short end of the stick,\u201d said Linda Bell, athletic director at Dillard, Louisiana\u2019s oldest HBCU. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been able to adjust and adapt. And so what we have to do now is adjust and adapt to these ways.\u201d",
      "Some are looking beyond traditional game-day revenues by opening their arenas and stadiums for concerts and community events to generate additional income. Tara Owens, athletic director at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, said her school will opt into the settlement for only men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball \u2014 its only revenue-generating sports.",
      "It\u2019s common for bigger power-conference schools to pay smaller Division I schools to visit and help fill out their non-conference schedules, a practice called \u201cguarantee games.\u201d The Maryland Eastern Shore men, for example, are playing at Georgia Tech, Georgia, Nebraska, Creighton, Virginia and Virginia Tech this season. The women are going to Northwestern, Oklahoma and Virginia.",
      "And Owens has plans for those checks.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have football,\u201d Owens said, \u201cso that helps us a great deal. And women\u2019s and men\u2019s basketball, their revenue sharing will come from their guarantee games, so it is not even using operational dollars from the institution. We decided that we would pull from one source. That would be it to start us off and we\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d",
      "If there's an upside to all of the changes, Sydney Moore hopes that it is a reignited conversation on Title IX, which is supposed to ensure that there\u2019s a proportionality to the access and opportunities for male and female athletes. She said many schools are still falling short, especially for women in non-revenue-generating sports who struggle to secure basics like access to trainers and facilities.",
      "\u201cThere is a feeling on campuses that there are perks to being a football player, basketball player or a high-attention, high-prioritized sport at some of these Division I institutions that are so beyond the resources we get,\u201d said Moore, a former volleyball player at Cornell and Syracuse. \u201cI\u2019m talking about, \u2018Why can a football player go in and get a haircut at any time of the day and we don\u2019t have applesauce in the snack room?\u2019\u201d",

Once Earth and Mars are properly aligned next fall, the duo will get a gravity assist from Earth to head to the red planet, arriving in 2027.",
      "Once around Mars, the spacecraft will map the planet\u2019s upper atmosphere and scattered magnetic fields, studying how these realms interact with the solar wind. The observations should shed light on the processes behind the escaping Martian atmosphere, helping to explain how the planet went from wet and warm to dry and dusty.

      "Several lawsuits emerged across the U.S. \u2014 and were later consolidated \u2014 after AT&T notified millions of customers that information ranging from Social Security numbers to call records were compromised in these breaches last year. Plaintiffs alleged that the telecommunications giant \u201crepeatedly failed\u201d to protect consumer data. While AT&T has continued to deny wrongdoing, it opted to settle earlier this year.",
      "\u201cWe have agreed to this settlement to avoid the expense and uncertainty of protracted litigation,\u201d AT&T said in a Thursday statement, adding that the company remains \"committed to protecting our customers\u2019 data and ensuring their continued trust in us.\u201d",

      "The other breach involved call and text records of nearly all AT&T customers from May through October of 2022, as well as a small subset from Jan. 2, 2023. AT&T said it learned that data was \u201cillegally downloaded from our workspace on a third-party cloud platform\u201d in April of last year \u2014 and began notifying customers in July 2024, after launching an investigation.

      "There's a new frontier in treating autoimmune diseases",
      "Scientists are trying a revolutionary new approach to treat rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus and other devastating autoimmune diseases \u2014 by reprogramming patients\u2019 out-of-whack immune systems.",
      "When your body\u2019s immune cells attack you instead of protecting you, today\u2019s treatments tamp down the friendly fire but they don\u2019t fix what\u2019s causing it. Patients face a lifetime of pricey pills, shots or infusions with some serious side effects \u2014 and too often the drugs aren\u2019t enough to keep their disease in check.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re entering a new era,\u201d said Dr. Maximilian Konig, a rheumatologist at Johns Hopkins University who\u2019s studying some of the possible new treatments. They offer \u201cthe chance to control disease in a way we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d",
      "How? Researchers are altering dysfunctional immune systems, not just suppressing them, in a variety of ways that aim to be more potent and more precise than current therapies.",
      "They\u2019re highly experimental and, because of potential side effects, so far largely restricted to patients who\u2019ve exhausted today\u2019s treatments. But people entering early-stage studies are grasping for hope.",
      "\u201cWhat the heck is wrong with my body?\u201d Mileydy Gonzalez, 35, of New York remembers crying, frustrated that nothing was helping her daily lupus pain.",
      "Diagnosed at 24, her disease was worsening, attacking her lungs and kidneys. Gonzalez had trouble breathing, needed help to stand and walk and couldn\u2019t pick up her 3-year-old son when last July, her doctor at NYU Langone Health suggested the hospital\u2019s study using a treatment adapted from cancer.",
      "Gonzalez had never heard of that CAR-T therapy but decided, \u201cI\u2019m going to trust you.\u201d Over several months, she slowly regained energy and strength.",
      "\u201cI can actually run, I can chase my kid,\u201d said Gonzalez, who now is pain- and pill-free. \u201cI had forgotten what it was to be me.\u201d",
      "CAR-T was developed to wipe out hard-to-treat blood cancers. But the cells that go bad in leukemias and lymphomas \u2014 immune cells called B cells \u2014 go awry in a different way in many autoimmune diseases.",
      "Some U.S. studies in mice suggested CAR-T therapy might help those diseases. Then in Germany, Dr. Georg Schett at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg tried it with a severely ill young woman who had failed other lupus treatment. After one infusion, she\u2019s been in remission \u2014 with no other medicine \u2014 since March 2021.",
      "Last month, Schett told a meeting of the American College of Rheumatology how his team gradually treated a few dozen more patients, with additional diseases such as myositis and scleroderma \u2014 and few relapses so far.",
      "Those early results were \u201cshocking,\u201d Hopkins\u2019 Konig recalled.",
      "They led to an explosion of clinical trials testing CAR-T therapy in the U.S. and abroad for a growing list of autoimmune diseases.",
      "How it works: Immune soldiers called T cells are filtered out of a patient\u2019s blood and sent to a lab, where they\u2019re programmed to destroy their B cell relatives. After some chemotherapy to wipe out additional immune cells, millions of copies of those \u201cliving drugs\u201d are infused back into the patient.",
      "While autoimmune drugs can target certain B cells, experts say they can\u2019t get rid of those hidden deep in the body. CAR-T therapy targets both the problem B cells and healthy ones that might eventually run amok. Schett theorizes that the deep depletion reboots the immune system so when new B cells eventually form, they\u2019re healthy.",
      "CAR-T is grueling, time consuming and costly, in part because it is customized. A CAR-T cancer treatment can cost $500,000. Now some companies are testing off-the-shelf versions, made in advance using cells from healthy donors.",
      "Another approach uses \u201cpeacekeeper\u201d cells at the center of this year\u2019s Nobel Prize. Regulatory T cells are a rare subset of T cells that tamp down inflammation and help hold back other cells that mistakenly attack healthy tissue. Some biotech companies are engineering cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases not to attack, like CAR-T does, but to calm autoimmune reactions.",

      "Global leaders have descended upon Brazil for COP30, and with the conference often comes a lot of negative news that evokes climate anxiety and dread",
      "Every autumn, news feeds get flooded with stories about climate change. That's because around this time each year, global leaders gather to discuss collective efforts to limit our emissions of planet-warming gases, released primarily from oil, gas and coal.",
      "Some of the information coming out of the COP30 conference is bleak. But it's not just COP. Climate stories can be difficult to consume year-round, whether it's about natural disasters, victims of heat waves or sea level rise or new studies about global warming impacts.",
      "\u201cWhen you throw a ton of scary facts and information at people, their nervous system shuts down. It\u2019s a coping mechanism,\u201d said Sarah Newman, founder and executive director of the Climate Mental Health Network.",

      "It activates different parts of the brain, according to a study published by the National Institutes of Health. While Generalized Anxiety Disorder often involves the part of the brain that handles fear, threat and emotion, climate anxiety activates parts of the brain that help with high cognition, willpower and tenacity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing larger problem that I need to attend to over time and that is largely out of my control,\u201d climate psychologist Thomas Doherty said. \u201dI can\u2019t just flip a switch around climate change.\u201d",
      "The anxiety is more complex than a stove left on, because climate change is a more complex problem. The threat is indefinite, it\u2019s largely out of each person\u2019s control and addressing it requires repeated and variable action.",
      "Doherty, who wrote a book about coping with climate anxiety, said that it isn't inherently negative. It's a natural reaction to a threat, and it's the first step in a cyclical relationship with climate change.",
      "\u201cThe rest of the cycle is ultimately taking some action to resolve the threat as best that we can,\u201d he said.",
      "Newman said that one of the most effective ways to combat climate anxiety is to find other people who are experiencing it too, and to talk about it.",

      "Between 15 and 20 people showed up to one event about finding connection and hope in the face of climate change. It was intimate, but so is confiding feelings of dread and isolation with a room full of strangers.",

      "Motsoaledi said that while South Africa experienced relatively low levels of cholera, many countries in Africa often hit hard by outbreaks would greatly benefit. He said the COVID-19 pandemic exposed how vulnerable African countries were to pandemics as they relied on imported vaccines.",

      "The world has seen faster climate change than expected since the Paris Agreement a decade ago",
      "The world has changed dramatically in the decade since leaders celebrated a historic climate agreement in Paris a decade ago, but not quite in ways they expected or wanted.",
      "Earth's warming climate has gotten nastier faster than society has been able to wean itself from burning the coal, oil and natural gas that emits carbon pollution that triggers global warming, several scientists and officials said.",
      "There's been progress \u2014 more than a degree Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) has been shaved off future warming projections since 2015 \u2014 but the lack of enough of it will be a big focus for the next two weeks as diplomats gather in Belem, Brazil, for annual United Nations climate negotiations.",
      "\u201cI think it's important that we're honest with the world and we declare failure,\u201d said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research in Germany. He said warming's harms are happening faster and more severely than scientists predicted.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re actually in the direction that we established in Paris at a speed that none of us could have predicted,\u201d said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres, who helped shepherd that agreement, which requires countries to come up with plans to fight warming.",
      "But the speed of humanity's climate-fighting effort is slower than the acceleration of climate's harms, she said, adding that means that \"the gap between the progress that we see on the ground and where we ought to be, that gap is still there and widening.\u201d",
      "U.N. Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said that the world is \u201cobviously falling behind.\u201d",

      "The planet's annual temperature jumped about 0.46 degrees Celsius (0.83 degrees Fahrenheit) since 2015, one of the biggest 10-year temperature hikes on record, according to data from the European climate service Copernicus. This year will be either the second or third hottest on record, Copernicus calculated. Each year since 2015 has been hotter than the year of the Paris climate deal.",
      "Deadly heat waves have struck not just traditional hot spots like India and the Middle East, but even in more temperate places such as the Pacific Northwest in North America and Russia's Siberia.",
      "Earth has been hit repeatedly with more costly, dangerous and extreme weather. The decade since 2015 has seen the most Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes and the most billion-dollar weather disasters in the United States, according to records kept by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. America has been hit by 193 disasters that cost at least $1 billion in the past 10 years for a total bill of $1.5 trillion.",

      "Since 2015, more than 7 trillion tons of ice in the world's glaciers and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica have disappeared, ice scientists calculate. That's the equivalent of more than 19 million Empire State Buildings.",
      "Sea level rise is accelerating. In the past decade, the world's seas have gone up 40 millimeters (1.6 inches). It may not sound like much, but it's enough water to fill 30 lakes the size of Lake Erie, according to Steve Nerem, a University of Colorado professor who researches sea level rise.",

      "Oxfam International looked at global emissions by income level and found that the richest 0.1% of people increased their carbon emissions by 3% since 2015. Meanwhile, the poorest 10% of people reduced their emissions by 30%.",

    "story": [
      "A power struggle over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned Dutch semiconductor maker, is impacting global auto production",
      "A battle for control of a little-known chipmaker has threatened global auto production by choking off the semiconductor supply chain, though there are signs the crisis is inching toward a resolution.",
      "The power struggle over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned Dutch semiconductor maker, highlights how technology supply chain vulnerabilities are squeezing auto makers, most notably forcing Honda to halt production at a Mexican factory making its popular HR-V crossover for North American markets. It also exposes how Europe is caught in the middle of the wider geopolitical showdown between Washington and Beijing.",
      "Here's a look at the dispute:",
      "The turmoil erupted into public view in mid-October, when the Dutch government announced it had invoked a rarely used World War II-era law to take effective control of Nexperia weeks earlier.",
      "The Dutch ministry of economic affairs said it took action because of national security concerns. Officials said they intervened because of \u201cserious governance shortcomings\u201d at Nexperia, asserting control to prevent the loss of crucial tech know-how that could threaten Europe's economic security.",
      "Nexperia\u2019s Chinese owner Wingtech Technology, a partially state-owned company, is at the heart of the dispute. Amid the boardroom battle, a Dutch court granted the ministry's request to oust Nexperia's Chinese CEO Zhang Xuezheng. American officials told the Dutch government he would have to be replaced to avoid trade restrictions, according to a court filing.",
      "Nexperia makes simple semiconductors such as switches and logic chips. The auto industry \u2014 one of Nexperia's biggest markets \u2014 uses its chips for numerous functions, such as adaptive LED headlight controllers, electric vehicle battery management systems and anti-lock brakes.",
      "Headquartered in the Dutch city of Nijmegen, Nexperia was spun off from Philips Semiconductors two decades ago. It was eventually purchased by China's Wingtech Technology in 2018 for $3.6 billion.",
      "Nexperia has wafer fabrication plants in Britain and Germany. It operates an assembly and testing center in China's southern manufacturing heartland of Guangdong \u2014 which accounts for around 70% of its end-product capacity \u2014 and similar centers in the Philippines and Malaysia.",
      "The dispute is part of the broader struggle between the U.S. and China over tech supremacy, which has left Europe caught in the middle.",
      "It stems from Washington\u2019s decision late last year to place Wingtech on its \u201centity list,\" which subjects companies to export controls because of national security risks. In late September, the U.S. expanded that list to Wingtech\u2019s subsidiaries, including Nexperia, pressuring allies to follow suit.",
      "After the Dutch government asserted control of Nexperia, Beijing responded soon after, blocking the export of Nexperia chips from its assembly plant in the Chinese city of Dongguan. It blamed the Netherlands for \u201cturmoil and chaos\u201d in the chip supply chain.",
      "There were signs of hope following last month's high-profile meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, when the White House said Beijing would ease the export ban as part of a U.S.-China trade truce.",
      "Despite Beijing also confirming exports would be allowed to resume, Nexperia\u2019s Chinese unit said headquarters suspended shipments of wafers used to make chips to its Chinese factory, potentially crimping its ability to deliver finished products.",
      "Nexperia\u2019s head office hit back in a statement Wednesday, saying the Chinese unit refused to pay for the wafers and accused it of \u201cignoring the lawful instructions\" from its global management team. The company said it can\u2019t guarantee the quality of any chips delivered from its China plant since Oct. 13.",
      "Modern automobiles rely on so-called discrete chips made by companies like Nexperia, which, unlike more advanced microprocessors, perform a single function. Leaders at big carmakers spelled out their worries in the latest round of earnings calls, saying that finding a replacement for Nexperia at scale in the short term will be difficult.",

      "Charvet Drucker was on a rented 20-foot (6-meter) boat near her home on an island in the Salish Sea about 40 miles northwest of Seattle when she spotted a pod of at least eight killer whales, also known as orcas.",
      "The orcas' coordinated movements and tail slaps suggested they were hunting. Drucker used the zoom lens on her camera to spot a harbor seal that was trying to flee from the pod. One of her shots showed the seal flying through the air above the scrum of orcas frothing the water, and she assumed she was witnessing the seal's last moments alive.",
      "But as the orcas got closer to the boat, Drucker and her group realized the pod was still chasing the seal. In line with wildlife boating regulations, they had cut the engine to prevent any injury to the whales. The seal clambered out of the water and onto a swimming platform at the stern of the boat near the motor \u2014 claiming it as a life raft of sorts.",
      "Wildlife regulations also prohibit touching or interfering with the seal, but Drucker began filming video.",
      "\u201cYou poor thing,\u201d Drucker can be heard saying, as the seal looks up at her. \"You\u2019re good, just stay, buddy.\u201d",

      "The orcas did not give up immediately, but instead appeared to team up to rock the boat and make the seal fall off. Drucker's cellphone video shows the orcas lining up and moving in on the boat with staggered dives to create waves. The \u201cwave-washing\u201d technique has been documented since by scientists since at least the 1980s, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "The seal on Drucker's boat slid off at least once, but managed to climb back on, and the orcas swam away after about 15 minutes.",
      "Drucker has photographed dead seals in the mouths of orcas before, and she says she\u2019s generally happy when the whales get to eat.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely Team Orca, all day, every day. But once that seal was on the boat, I kind of turned (into) Team Seal,\u201d she said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "The killer whales that hunt seals and a diverse set of marine animals in the area are known as Bigg\u2019s or \u201ctransient\u201d orcas. They are better fed then other more specialized species like the salmon-focused \u201cresident\u201d orcas who are on the endangered species list, according to NOAA.",

      "The Alabama commission last month discussed the possibility of dropping PBS and is expected to discuss the matter again its Nov. 18 meeting.",
      "The possibility comes after President Donald Trump and Congress in July withdrew funding for the nonprofit The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides grants to public radio and television, and as some state commissioners accused PBS of being an unneeded expense or politically biased.",
      "\u201cWe have to figure out what our options are,\u201d said Ferris W. Stephens, the chairman of the commission. \u201cBefore we decide those things, I just think we need a lot more information.\u201d Stephens said he does not expect a vote at the November meeting.",
      "Alabama Public Television Executive Director Wayne Reid said some commissioners asked him to research the possibility and ramifications of ending the contract with PBS. Ending the affiliation would cause APT to lose access to popular programs such as \u201cSesame Street\u201d and \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d, as well as its ability to distribute content on streaming platforms. Reid said the state network would have to buy other programming to replace it.",
      "\u201cIf we cut ties, all of that would be gone. Right now, we\u2019re doing a ton of research. Everybody here is working on what it would take to replace the things that are affected by PBS,\u201d Reid said.",
      "Reid said he was also asked to research if they could keep PBS but drop the news programs \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d and \u201cWashington Week.\u201d Reid said the decision ultimately belongs to the commission.",
      "No other statewide network has cut ties with PBS to date, a spokesperson for PBS confirmed.",
      "The possibility prompted a backlash from Alabama public television viewers and donors.",
      "Jennifer Greer, a retired writer and educator, is one of the volunteers helping to mount a postcard campaign to urge the state to keep the PBS affiliation. Preschoolers, students and adults across the state benefit each day from PBS programs, she said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Now that the government shutdown is over, House and Senate Republicans say they will negotiate with Democrats on whether to extend COVID-era tax credits that help tens of millions of Americans afford their health care premiums. But finding bipartisan agreement could be difficult, if not impossible, before the subsidies expire at the end of the year.",
      "The shutdown ended this week after a small group of Democrats made a deal with Republicans senators who promised a vote by mid-December on extending the Affordable Care Act subsidies. But there is no guaranteed outcome, and many Republicans have made clear they want the credits to expire.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called the subsidies a \u201cboondoggle\u201d immediately after the House voted Wednesday to end the shutdown, and President Donald Trump said the Obama-era health overhaul was \u201cdisaster\u201d as he signed the reopening bill into law.",
      "It is far from the outcome that Democrats had hoped for as they kept the government closed for 43 days, demanding that Republicans negotiate with them on an extension before premiums sharply increase. But they say they will try again as the expiration date approaches.",
      "\u201cIt remains to be seen if they are serious,\u201d said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. But he said Democrats \u201care just getting started.\u201d",

Others, like Johnson and Trump, want to start a new conversation about overhauling \u201cObamacare\u201d entirely \u2014 a redo after a similar effort in 2017 failed.",
      "Health care has long been one of the most difficult issues on Capitol Hill, marked by deep ideological and political divides. Partisan disagreement over 2010 law has persisted for more than a decade, and relationships are already strained from weeks of partisan tensions over the shutdown.",
      "Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said that while Republicans have promised negotiations and a Senate vote, Democrats are wary. She noted that Johnson has not committed to anything in the House.",
      "\u201cDo I trust any of them? Hell no,\u201d DeLauro said.",
      "If the two sides cannot agree, as many as 24 million people who get their health care from the exchanges created by the law could see their premiums go up Jan. 1. New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, one of the Democrats who struck a deal with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., to reopen the government, said she thinks an agreement on the tax credits is possible.",
      "During the talks that led to the shutdown\u2019s end, Shaheen said she and other moderate Democrats sat across from Thune and \u201clooked him eye to eye\u201d as he committed to a serious effort.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a chance to vote on a bill that we will write by mid-December, in a way that gives us a chance to build \u2014 hopefully build \u2014 bipartisan support to get that through,\u201d Shaheen said.",
      "While Democrats would like to see a permanent extension of the tax credits, most realize that is unlikely. Just before the shutdown ended, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York proposed a one-year extension and a bipartisan committee to address Republican demands for changes to the ACA. But Thune said that was a \u201cnonstarter\u201d as the government remained shut down.",
      "In the House, Democrats have proposed a three-year extension.",
      "While Republicans have long sought to scrap Obamacare, they have had challenges over the years in figuring out what would replace it. That problem plagued the 2017 effort, when then-Sen.

      "A specialty court in Las Vegas once covered minor crimes originating from the Strip and another popular tourism hub in Southern Nevada",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Nevada judges instituted a unique court two years ago to penalize crimes such as petty theft, assault, drug offenses and loitering committed on the Las Vegas Strip by barring offenders from the state's marquee tourist area for a year.",
      "The program was hailed as a success by the state's powerful casino and resort owners, but others questioned its legality and judges voted to disband it a year and a half later.",
      "But now with tourism in Las Vegas slumping and resorts and convention centers reporting fewer visitors compared to last year, lawmakers are poised to revive the idea in a special session that began Thursday even as crime has been dropping.",
      "Major casinos and labor unions have teamed up on the amendment to Gov. Joe Lombardo\u2019s sweeping crime package to bring back the Resort Corridor Court, saying it's necessary to make the Strip safer for workers and more appealing to tourists.",

      "Lombardo's crime package, called the \u201cSafe Streets and Neighborhoods Act,\" also proposes increased penalties for repeat offenders as well as a long list of crimes, including smash-and-grab robberies, possession of child pornography, assault and battery against hospitality employees, and DUIs involving a death. It also would expand crimes such as stalking to include cyberstalking.",
      "Corridor court critics, however, have questioned the legality of barring people from an area, and say this is more about optics than reality.",
      "Athar Haseebullah, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, said the now-defunct court unfairly targeted homeless people living in the area and was an attempt to privatize public streets \u2014 since people violating the order could be arrested for walking on the sidewalk outside of a resort.",

      "Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Union Local 226, which represents 60,000 hospitality workers in Las Vegas and Reno, said the union has been supportive of the corridor court because it acts as a deterrent for crime and thus keeps its workers safe when commuting to and from work, as well as while working in the casinos.",

      "The whole process becomes a \u201crevolving door for our most vulnerable population in that area,\u201d Shepack said. \u201cWe\u2019re adding new layers of punishment and supervision onto individuals who are deeply struggling and we can\u2019t fine, fee and arrest our way out of these problems.\"",

      "BOSTON -- It wasn\u2019t a croc \u2014 there really was an alligator on the loose in Boston.",
      "And the story of the city's slithering saurian appears to have a happy ending. The small alligator, spotted along the Charles River in Boston multiple times this week, has been rescued and delivered to safety, wildlife officials in Massachusetts said Thursday.",
      "The approximately foot-long crocodilian startled a few people and became an instant star on social media after confused onlookers took videos of it slithering away from sight. But the animal is not native to Massachusetts, and couldn't possibly survive the harsh New England winter, so the search for the wayward gator was on.",
      "A local wildlife educator captured the critter on Wednesday night, and it's now awaiting a permanent home, officials said.",
      "Harvard University graduate student Whitney Lieberman was among the residents who caught a glimpse of the exotic visitor. She said she notified wildlife authorities when she saw the creature while she was jogging to work.",
      "\u201cYeah, I did a double-take. For a second, I had to check myself \u2014 alligators are not native to Boston waterways, right?\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cI texted my co-workers because I had a morning meeting: \u2018Hey guys, this is a good excuse to be late for work. There is an alligator right in front of me and I don\u2019t know what to do.'\"",
      "The animal was in jeopardy due to the chilly temperatures on the Charles, which was 51 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) on Thursday. Alligators prefer temperatures above 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius). They are cold-blooded and can't regulate their own temperature, so they enter a dormant, energy-saving state called brumation to survive colder temperatures.",

      "DeSantis has ordered more executions in a single year than any Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. The previous record was set in 2014 with eight executions. After Jennings, executions this year are scheduled Nov. 20 for Richard Barry Randolph and Dec. 9 for Mark Allen Geralds, which would bring the year's total so far to 18.",

      "BOSTON -- After years of living on the street and crashing on friends' couches, Quantavia Smith was given the keys to a studio apartment in Los Angeles that came with an important perk \u2014 easy access to public transit.",
      "The 38-year-old feels like she went from a life where \u201cno one cares\u201d to one where she has a safe place to begin rebuilding her life. And the metro station the apartment complex was literally built upon is a lifeline as she searches for work without a car.",
      "\u201cIt is more a sense of relief, a sense of independence,\" said Smith, who moved in July. She receives some government assistance and pays 30% of her income for rent \u2014 just $19 a month for an efficiency with a full-market value of $2,000.",

      "The Santa Monica and Vermont Apartments where Smith lives is part of an ambitious plan by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build 10,000 housing units near transit sites by 2031 \u2014 offering developers land discounts in exchange for affordable housing development and other community benefits.",
      "In Washington D.C., the transit authority has completed eight projects since 2022 that provided nearly 1,500 apartments and a million square feet of office space. About half were in partnership with Amazon, which committed $3.6 billion in low-cost loans and grants for affordable housing projects in Washington, as well as Nashville, Tennessee, and the Puget Sound area in Washington state. Almost all are within a half-mile of public transit.",
      "\u201cBig cities face the greatest challenges when it comes to traffic congestion and high housing costs,\u201d Freemark said. \u201cBuilding new homes near transit helps address both problems by encouraging people to take transit while increasing housing supply.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Cleto Escobedo III, longtime bandleader of the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" show, has died, Jimmy Kimmel announced on Tuesday. He was 59 years old.",
      "The late-night talk show host\u00a0mourned the death of one of his oldest friends \u2014 whom he met when he was 9 years old \u2014 writing on Instagram that \"[t]o say that we are heartbroken is an understatement.\"",
      "\"The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true. Cherish your friends and please keep Cleto's wife, children and parents in your prayers,\" Kimmel wrote.",
      "Escobedo and Kimmel met as children in Las Vegas, where they grew up across the street from each other. Kimmel wrote on Tuesday that they were \"inseparable.\"",
      "\"We just met one day on the street, and there were a few kids on the street, and him and I just became really close friends, and we kind of had the same sense of humor. We just became pals, and we've been pals ever since,\" Escobedo said in a 2022 interview for Texas Tech University's Southwest Collection oral history archive, disclosing that he and Kimmel were huge fans of David Letterman as kids.",
      "Escobedo would grow up to become a professional musician, specializing in the saxophone, and touring with Earth, Wind and Fire's Phillip Bailey and Paula Abdul. He recorded with Marc Anthony, Tom Scott and Take Six. When Kimmel got his own ABC late-night talk show in 2003, he lobbied for Escobedo to lead the house band on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"",
      "\"Of course I wanted great musicians, but I wanted somebody I had chemistry with,\" Kimmel told WABC in 2015. \"And there's nobody in my life I have better chemistry with than him.\"",
      "In 2016, on Escobedo's 50th birthday, Kimmel dedicated a segment to his friend, recalling pranks with a BB gun or mooning people from the back of his mom's car.",
      "\"Cleto had a bicycle with a sidecar attached to it. We called it the side hack. I would get in the sidecar and then Cleto would drive me directly into garbage cans and bushes,\" Kimmel recalled.",
      "News of Escobedo's death comes after Thursday's episode of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" was abruptly canceled. David Duchovny, Joe Keery and Madison Beer were set as the show's guests. The date and cause of Escobedo's death weren't immediately known.",
      "Escobedo's father is also a member of the Kimmel house band and plays tenor and alto saxophones. In January 2022, the father-son duo celebrated nearly two decades of performing on-screen together.",
      "\"Jimmy asked me, 'Who are we going to get in the band?' I said, 'Well, my normal guys,' and he knew my guys because he had been coming to see us and stuff before he was famous, just to come support me and whatever. I'd invite him to gigs, and if he didn't have anything to do he'd come check it out, so he knew my guys,\" Escobedo recounted in the 2022 interview. \"Then he just said, 'Hey, man, what about your dad? Wouldn't that be kind of cool?' I was like, 'That would be way cool.'\"",
      "In the 2022 interview, Escobedo said the bandleader job had one major benefit: family time.",
      "\"Touring and all that stuff is fun, but it's more of a young man's game. Touring, also, too, is not really conducive for family life. I've learned over the years, being on the road and watching how hard it is, leaving your kids for so long. Sometimes they're babies; you come back and then they're talking, it's like, 'What?'\" he said.",
      "Escobedo's survivors also include his wife Lori and their two children.",

      "\"It really is an absolute rewiring of how you move through your life,\" LaRue told \"CBS Mornings\" on Tuesday. \"There's no way to ever go back to innocence.\"",
      "In 2007 LaRue, who starred in \"CSI: Miami,\" and her young daughter, Kaya, first started getting threatening phone calls and letters from an anonymous person. Her story is told in a new two-part documentary called \"My Nightmare Stalker: The Eva LaRue Story.\"",
      "\"What is crazy is we, on 'CSI: Miami,' we were solving cases in 43 minutes, not including commercials. In real life we did not have the technology we were pretending to have on the show,\" LaRue said.",
      "The Emmy Award-winning actress said she and her daughter had to move twice. At one point, her stalker found her daughter's high school and pretended to be her father, \"and told her to stand out in front of the school and he was going to pick her up.\"",
      "The stalking went on for more than a decade and affected her physically, causing hair loss and hives.",
      "\"There was no place to hide because you don't know where he could be, so you are really in a prison of your own making because you are trying to be four steps ahead of what he could do and those possibilities are endless,\" she said.",
      "\"Take my life back\"",
      "LaRue described a moment of an epiphany when a friend invited her and her daughter to Italy while \"CSI: Miami\" wasn't filming.",
      "\"We weren't there 36 hours, in the middle of the night, it's like 3 in the morning and I have jet lag and I'm kind of awake and rolling around. The bedroom door opens up and it is lit from the back,\" she said, explaining she couldn't see the individual's face at the door, but thought it was her friend.",
      "The next morning, she found out it was a break-in \u2014 but not her stalker.",
      "\"All I had done was pray all day and all night for months at that point for some sort of guidance. I really felt like it was my answer that God literally said in that moment, 'If I wanted you dead, I'll follow you to Italy,'\" she said.",
      "\"So I felt in that moment, oddly enough, this weird sense of peace. That was the first time I could kind of take my life back.\"",

      "LaRue's stalker was caught in 2019 through DNA, 12 years after the threats began.",

      "Asked if she feels safe, LaRue said, \"I don't think we'll ever feel safe.\"",
      "\"Your brain never goes back to not being hyper vigilant,\" she said about moving forward.",
      "She said she almost didn't do the documentary and understands why some celebrities don't.",

    "story": [
      "As a public figure with a massive social media following, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy is no stranger to threats and abuse online. But recently, the entrepreneur says he's become \"far more aware\" of how he could face these threats in everyday life.",
      "\"You know, you start getting into these yahoos on social media, and there's, like, yahoos,\" Portnoy told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil in an interview airing on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" this weekend. \"I don't even know what they're saying. But they start talking about me, trying to get my name probably used because they're just in this endless cycle of needing to stay in the news.\"",
      "Conversations about him can quickly spiral online and \"open the floodgates on just lunatics,\" Portnoy said. In response, the businessman and social media personality said he has installed round-the-clock security at his house. \"It only takes one,\" Portnoy added.",
      "Recently, a man was overheard on video shouting an antisemitic comment and throwing coins toward Portnoy while he was recording his famous \"One Bite\" pizza review outside of a Mississippi restaurant. Starkville Police on Monday arrested the alleged heckler, identified as 20-year-old Patrick McClintock, on a misdemeanor charge of disturbing the peace.",
      "\"Every person has the right to feel safe and respected in our community. Offensive words alone are protected, but when behavior disrupts a public event or risks violence, the Starkville Police Department will take steps to help maintain safety and security,\" the police said in a statement to CBS News, adding that the state could impose enhanced penalties if a violation meets the criteria for bias-motivated or discriminatory reason. The incident remains under investigation.",
      "\"Imagine hating somebody just because of their religion in this f---ing country,\" Portnoy said in a social media video posted after the incident.",
      "Antisemitic incidents have increased almost 900% in the past 10 years, according to the Anti-Defamation League, in many cases involving violence.",
      "Even before that recent incident, there had been a \"definitive shift\" toward antisemitism, Portnoy told Dokoupil, adding that it was a form of hate that he experiences on a daily basis.",
      "\"For me, being a Jewish person, like, you got to step up,\" he said. \"You're kind of someone people look up to in the Jewish community. You have to be, like, 'All right, this is not normal ha-ha with the guys. People are coming up with real hate.'\"",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Nov 2025 10:07:29 -0500",
    "summary": "The actor, writer and musician has been an unconventional and unforgettable presence, from his Oscar-winning \"Sling Blade,\" to his rock band, The Boxmasters. He's now back in Season 2 of the Paramount+ series \"Landman,\" set in the oil fields of West Texas.",
    "story": [
      "Billy Bob Thornton's irreverence mixes with his Southern charm like a good ol' whiskey sour. After all, he can deliver lines with a sincerity that is almost mocking. He even, with a wink and a nod, played a not-so-saintly St. Nick. Some saw that as a brave choice. He doesn't. \"A brave choice is to see someone being attacked in a park and go intervene; that's a brave choice,\" he said. \"It's not a brave choice to do some weird thing in the middle of a scene, you know what I mean?\"",
      "For his current role, he's making choices, too, mostly just to be himself. \"Well, I mean I pretty much am playing myself if I were a landman.\"",
      "In the Paramount+ show \"Landman,\" viewers get a peek behind the curtain of a world we really usually see. \"I mean, the movie 'Giant,' one of my favorites, I mean, that took place in the oil business of West Texas,\" he said. \"I always tell people that this is kind of like 'Giant,' with cursing!\"",
      "Fans have been waiting a long time for \"Landman\"'s second season. It debuts next Sunday.",
      "To watch a trailer for Season 2 of \"Landman\" click on the video player below:",
      "According to his co-star Ali Larter, Thornton doesn't like to rehearse. \"You have to be ready to go,\" she told us. \"Fresh. Like, whatever happens is going to happen.\"",
      "Thornton's hillbilly vibe isn't a put-on \u2013 he proudly calls himself a Tex-Arkansan, the product of a lot of rural places that even the railroads passed by.",
      "But he wouldn't trade growing up in a small town for anything: \"You know, I keep my upbringing in my back pocket all the time,\" he said. \"You never forget it.\"",
      "While he never worked on an oil rig, he did have his fair share of jobs where dangerous machinery decided if you came home at night or not. \"Machine shops and sawmills are both not exactly the safest places to work, especially when you're a dumb little skinny hippie kid with hair to your waist,\" he said. \"We always had a joke about sawmill workers, which was, do you know what this is? [He holds up three fingers.] It's a sawmill worker ordering five beers.\"",
      "He went from sawdust to Hollywood fairy dust in a pretty unconventional way. \"I only took drama 'cause I thought I gotta get a C in something, you know, because I was not good in school,\" he said.",
      "His idols were Robert Duvall, Bruce Dern, and Sam Elliott. But in Los Angeles, at a cocktail party where Thornton was working as a bus boy, famed screenwriter and director Billy Wilder told him acting wasn't for him.",
      "\"He said, 'Forget about it. You're too ugly to be a leading man,'\" Thornton recalled. \"And he said, 'You're too pretty to be a character actor.' I said, 'What do I do?' He said, 'Can you write?' I said, 'Yeah, I do write.' He goes, 'Write your own stories, create your own characters, don't stand in line with everybody else.'\"",
      "He did write his own story, and create his own character. \"Sling Blade\" (1996), which he wrote and directed, earned him an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay, and an Oscar nomination for best actor to boot.",
      "Asked if he thinks he'll go back to writing and directing, he replied, \"You know, I don't know that anybody wants to see what I have to say as a director or writer, 'cause all my stuff is based on Southern literature. And I don't think that those stories would really be relevant to anyone right now. So, I doubt I ever do it again.\"",
      "Letting go of things he loves isn't easy. We were stunned to find out he hasn't felt truly care-free since the short-lived TV show \"The Outsiders\" \u2013 more than 30 years ago. \u00a0\"I had no responsibility,\" he said. \"I was making $2,500 an episode. Never thought I'd see that kind of money. Then, my brother Jimmy died, and changed my life. He was my best friend.\"",
      "\"So, that's when you talk about carrying it around in your back pocket?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\"",
      "They both grew up playing in bands. To this day, Billy Bob still idolizes his brother's musical talent. \"He played every instrument, except drums,\" Thornton said. \"He looked like he had a disorder when he tried to play drums.\"",
      "Thornton never gave up his love of music. His band, The Boxmasters, has recorded 19 albums, and this past Summer they opened for The Who. \"We're just there to waste 45 minutes while they're getting ready, ya' know?\" he said. \"So hopefully the fans will be with us.\"",
      "He doesn't act his age, and in hindsight we probably shouldn't have asked about it.",
      "\"Any thoughts on turning 70?\" I said.",
      "\"What did you say\" Thornton replied, raising an eyebrow. \"But uh, no, You know what, it's so funny you're scared of every milestone. But this one actually did affect me in a way that I had to, you know, have a few meetings with myself late at night.\"",
      "In the end, what Billy Bob Thornton has found is that he and so many of his older contemporaries, including his friend Sam Elliott (who is still acting with him at 81), are still defined by their good work.",
      "\"We've all seen each other get older,\" Thornton said. \"And when I see that wisdom and see the respect that people have for them, it just kind of makes everything melt away somehow. I mean, I'm in a successful band and I'm in a successful show. Every day when I wake up, I just say I'm blessed. That's really it.\"",

    "summary": "She's been called \"the acting world's best-kept secret.\" But Oscar-nominee Jessie Buckley's latest role, playing the wife of William Shakespeare in \"Hamnet,\" may change that.",
    "story": [
      "She's been called \"the acting world's best-kept secret.\" But Jessie Buckley's latest role, in the film \"Hamnet,\" may change that. As Rolling Stone put it, people \"will be talking about Jessie Buckley's performance for years.\"",
      "Buckley plays the wife of William Shakespeare (portrayed by fellow Irish actor Paul Mescal). Adapted from Maggie O'Farrell's novel, it's a fictionalized tale about the death of Shakespeare's son, Hamnet. It imagines the tragedy inspired him to write \"Hamlet.\"",
      "\"I just knew I had to go somewhere mentally, emotionally,\" Buckley said of her work.",
      "I said, \"You have this fire inside you \u2013 that's what we see on film.\"",
      "\"I don't know, do you?\" she replied.",
      "\"I'd say so, in what I've seen, you see it!\"",
      "\"I have fire, but I tell you what 'Hamnet' gave me, which I also was looking for, was tenderness. And sometimes it's just as strong as fire.\"",
      "She said when she started shooting the more difficult scenes, like the death of her child, she told her husband she needed to go away for two weeks. So, Buckley came to Hampstead Heath, a vast green space in London, where she'd go swimming each morning. \"I just need to be in nature and start my day and wake up that way, and then go to the set and see what came out,\" she said.",
      "She says \"Hamnet\" director Chlo\u00e9 Zhao (an Oscar-winner for \"Nomadland\") reminded her cinema is not just escapism. \"Our jobs as actors and the storytellers are to touch the most heightened expressions that are too hard to hold on our own,\" Buckley said. \"I get to incubate the bits of us, myself, the shadow bits.\"",
      "\"What are the shadow bits of you that came out for this role?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm not telling you!\" she laughed. \"You have to watch it and make up your own mind.\"",
      "\"The sacred flame of star quality\"",
      "Her breakthrough role was playing a single mom just out of prison in 2018's \"Wild Rose.\" Then, in 2022, Buckley got an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress in \"The Lost Daughter.\" Her other credits included \"I'm Thinking of Ending Things,\" \"Beast\" and \"Women Talking,\" and the TV series \"Fargo.\"",
      "She said, \"I never in a million years thought I'd make a film.\"",
      "Because? \"I didn't have a TV 'til I was 15,\" she said. \"And it was exotic, like, it was in Hollywood. It wasn't in Kerry.\"",
      "In rugged County Kerry, in Ireland's southeast, Buckley grew up in an artistic family, playing harp, clarinet and piano. She sang and did school productions. But it was the British talent show, \"I'd Do Anything,\" that put her on a bigger stage \u2013 and in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber. He praised her, saying, \"Jessie has the sacred flame of star quality.\"",
      "She lost that competition, but quickly landed theater roles. Her first Shakespeare performance was near the spot in London where Shakespeare's early plays were first performed, at the original Rose Playhouse, built in 1587.",
      "Shakespeare changed everything for her: \"I think before, I felt like music was the only way to contain what was kind of wanting to come out, and then Shakespeare's words and his worlds were so titanic that it just made me realize how powerful words could be,\" she said.",
      "Of acting opposite Mescal in \"Hamnet,\" Buckley said, \"I absolutely adore that man. And from our very first chemistry read \u2026\"",
      "\"Chemistry read is to make sure you have chemistry?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah,\" she laughed. \"I mean, it would be really depressing if I didn't, wouldn't it? I'd be like the only woman in the world who failed to find chemistry with Paul Mescal!\"",
      "The 35-year-old actor says she also found chemistry with Christian Bale for her next film, in which she plays the bride of Frankenstein's monster. Directed by Maggie Gyllenhall, it's genre- and expectation-bending.\u00a0 \"It's punk, it is proper punk,\" Buckley said. \"I remember when I read it first, it was like being plugged into an electrical socket.\"",
      "I said, \"Maggie Gyllenhaal referred to you as kind of a wild animal.\"",
      "\"Hmm. Good,\" Buckley said.",
      "\"Do you think there's a truth to that?\"",
      "\"I have a lot of life in me!\"",
      "That life and vitality that we now see on film is the journey that brought Buckley to London as a teenager. At the time, she says, she was in a dark place. \"I had depression and I wasn't very well,\" she said. \"And I wanted a lot from life. I was really hungry for it. And I felt like there was no place for that. And I think that's when it imploded in on me, and when I got sick and lost myself, you know?\"",
      "\"How did your deal with it?\"",
      "\"I got help,\" she replied. \"I got therapy. Singing. I mean, I honestly think it's kind of saved me. Something wasn't alive then, let's just say, like it is now.\"",

      "Raised as a coal miner's daughter in a small town in West Virginia, to becoming a world championship boxer, Martin made headlines as a pioneer in women's boxing. But few knew of the personal battles she was facing outside the ring.",
      "In the episode, \"48 Hours\" details the story of Martin's struggles with identity, acceptance, drug addiction, and domestic violence at the hands of her former husband and trainer, Jim Martin. \"The same story that you guys got, Sydney puts out there for the people to see and to gain inspiration from,\" Martin recently told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Sweeney spent months preparing for the role, including intense boxing training to recreate Martin's actual fights. In addition to physical preparations, Sweeney told \"48 Hours\" about the research she did to play Christy. \"I mean, I had a lot to be able to pull from and go off of. She had her book, there was the '48 Hours' special \u2026 There were interviews and fight footage. So there was a lot I could prepare with before I met Christy, and then I had Christy in my corner, so I was able to ask her questions and have her by my side and be able to watch her.\"",
      "Martin requested the writers not to \"Hollywoodize\" her life as they scripted her story. Martin said writer Mirrah Foulkes responded, \"There's enough crazy s*** that's happened in your life, we don't have to.\"",
      "As her survival story continues to reach more people, Martin hopes it can help inspire others. \"We're showing a pathway to get out of a domestic violence situation. We're showing how important it is for parents, relatives, friends to be accepting of someone who's a little different ... But I'm the ultimate underdog \u2026 If you can believe it, you can achieve it. Dream big. My Dad used to tell me to dream big, and I think I did.\"",

      "A clip was shown from Zevon's final appearance on the show in 2002, when he was dying of cancer. \"Enjoy every sandwich,\" Zevon said when Letterman asked what he'd learned about mortality.",
      "Letterman was tearful as he showed the crowd a guitar that Zevon gave him later that night.",
      "\"He's never going away,\" Bruce Springsteen said in a recorded tribute. \"He's got a body of work that's as good as anybody's.\"",
      "Letterman outlined several categories of Zevon's cleverly emotional tunes, the final one being \"songs about werewolves\" to a big laugh from the crowd. 1978's \"Werewolves of London\" was Zevon's biggest, and most unlikely, hit.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "\"If you're going to do science, why not discover something important?\" That, James Watson (April 6, 1928-Nov. 6, 2025) told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2003, was his motivation when, at age 23, he arrived at Cambridge University eager to take on the mysteries of DNA.",
      "A zoologist who'd just earned his Ph.D. in Chicago, Watson teamed up with the brilliant physicist Francis Crick, who was 12 years his senior. As Crick theorized, Watson built models, burning through idea after idea. \"You're obsessed,\" Watson explained. \"It's like being obsessed with a girl or something. You know, she's there, and you can't get her out of your mind.\"",
      "The team had competition, from researchers at King's College in London, and from Linus Pauling in America. When Maurice Wilkins at King's College showed him an X-ray of a DNA molecule, taken by colleague Rosalind Franklin, Watson saw the direction he had to go: a double helix.",
      "On Feb. 28, 1953, Watson and Crick walked into a pub off the Cambridge campus and announced that they'd discovered the secret to life. Their theory about the double-helix structure of DNA appeared in the British science journal Nature that April. In 1962, Watson, Crick and Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize for divining the structure of DNA \u2014 key to understanding how genetic material works. Their discovery opened the door to genetic engineering, gene therapy, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples, tracing family trees via DNA, and monoclonal antibodies.",
      "Beyond years spent at the California Institute of Technology and Harvard University (where he helped create their program for molecular biology), Watson later helped lead the human genome project, which accelerated genetic research. But while the birth of Dolly the sheep in 1996 suggested that the concept of cloning wasn't mere science fiction, Watson himself wasn't comfortable with the possibilities. \"You can just imagine 200 Meg Ryans in New York City. You know, it would be a mess,\" he said.",
      "In 2007 he was suspended from his job as chancellor of the prestigious Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York after he was widely condemned for making racist remarks. He retired shortly after. His inflammatory tendencies were evident years before. In his bestselling 1968 book about the DNA discovery, \"The Double Helix,\" Watson wrote, \"A goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.\"",
      "For success in science, he wrote: \"You have to avoid dumb people. ... To make a huge success, a scientist has to be prepared to get into deep trouble.\""

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-hormone-therapy-marty-makary-interview/",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 08:48:09 -0500",
    "summary": "In an interview with CBS News, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary explains what went into the decision to drop the most serious warnings on hormone therapy for menopause.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will remove the \"black box\" warning labels on many hormone therapy drugs used for menopause and perimenopause symptoms \u2014 a major turnaround that's likely to encourage more women to seek treatment. FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in an exclusive CBS News interview that the change ends a decades-long \"fear machine,\" and he called the demonization of menopause hormone therapy, also known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), \"an American tragedy.\"",
      "\"With the exception of vaccines or antibiotics, there's no medication that can improve the health of women on a population level more than hormone replacement therapy,\" Makary told senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell, explaining that studies show that menopause hormone therapy can reduce the risk of heart attacks, the leading cause of death in women.",
      "The products affected by this change include medicines containing both estrogen and progesterone, systemic estrogen and topical estrogen.",
      "The \"black box\" warning labels were based on what many experts now consider flawed research on HRT from more than 20 years ago. Part of the criticism is that back in 2002, researchers on the Women's Health Initiative study overstated the risks of breast cancer because the data focused on older women.",
      "More recent studies have shown the benefits outweigh the risk for many women if hormone therapy is used in the early years of menopause, before the age of 60.",
      "\"We now have a more nuanced understanding, and we want to put that fear machine in its proper context and let people know that there are tremendous long-term health benefits,\" Makary said.",
      "In addition to heart health, those benefits include lowering the risk of cognitive decline or Alzheimer's and preventing osteoporosis, a major factor in hip fractures.",
      "Hormone therapy can help ease menopause symptoms, which can be debilitating, taking both a mental and physical toll. There are a wide range of symptoms, including hot flashes, insomnia, night sweats, mood swings, joint pain, weight gain and more \u2014 with some experiencing more intense effects than others.",
      "Menopause typically occurs in a woman's late 40s or early 50s, when the ovaries produce less estrogen and menstruation stops. Perimenopause refers to the transitional years leading up to it.",
      "What studies say now",
      "Over the past two decades, fears about breast cancer led doctors to steer millions of women away from hormone therapy.",
      "\"It's an American tragedy. I do think it's one of the biggest mistakes in modern medicine,\" Makary said, denouncing the \"groupthink\" among doctors in the wake of the 2002 study.",
      "As a result, he told CBS News, \"50 to 70 million women over the last 23 years have been denied the incredible, life-changing, life-saving benefits of hormone replacement therapy because of the dogma.\"",
      "Those millions, he said, included his own mother.",
      "\"She had gone through perimenopause right around that time, but [was] never offered this therapy,\" even though she was a good candidate for it. \"Well, she went on to have two different falls recently where she had bone fractures. \u2026 And I can't help but think if her bones had been stronger from hormone replacement therapy, she wouldn't have gone through that.\"",
      "Menopause significantly speeds bone loss and increases the risk of osteoporosis, according to the Endocrine Society, an international medical organization. The group says 1 in 2 postmenopausal women will have osteoporosis, and most will suffer a bone fracture during their lifetime, which can lead to a cascade of other health problems.",
      "Markary added he knows breast cancer is a sensitive topic that needs to be treated very carefully, but said no clinical trial has ever shown that hormone therapy increases a woman's risk of dying from breast cancer.",
      "One of the things scientists have learned, he said, is that hormone therapy is best started soon after a woman's body stops producing estrogen.",
      "\"Hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women needs to be started within 10 years of the onset of menopause or perimenopause, and generally, the rule of thumb is not to start it after age 60,\" Makary said. After around 60, aging and lack of estrogen mean blood vessels have begun to harden and narrow, raising the risk of stroke and heart attack; taking estrogen earlier can help prevent that.",
      "Women should discuss the best options with their doctor.",
      "\"Look, I'm a regulator. I don't want to tell people what to take. And I'm not prescribing anything,\" Makary said. \"But we want people to have the right information. And part of that is addressing this fear machine that has been going on for 23 years, that has been magnified by the FDA's 'black box' warning on estrogen products for perimenopausal women.\"",
      "Non-hormonal therapy treatments",
      "While hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for hot flashes and night sweats, it is not suitable for everyone, especially women with a history of breast cancer.",
      "Earlier this month, the FDA approved a new, non-hormonal option called Lynkuet, known generically as elinzanetant. The drug is the second medication to directly target the brain pathways involved in body temperature control. The first, called Veozah, was approved in 2023.",
      "Despite how common menopause is, research funding to study it has historically been limited.",
      "Even medical education on the topic has been limited, Markary said.",
      "\"The general philosophy was, why are we teaching about this, about menopause? Because there's nothing we can do for it,\" he said. \"Well, that dogma, unfortunately, resulted in a lot of omission of menopause in medical education.\"",
      "But, with more women in the field, that's starting to change.",

Now, roughly half of our medical students at Johns Hopkins were women, and that's a trend nationwide,\" Markary said. \"And they're starting to say, 'Hey, wait a minute, this is something where women are coming to their doctors and they're not getting the right answer.'\"",

Among them: Carrie Richardson, now 44, whose family carries the PSEN1 gene, making them genetically predisposed to developing early-onset Alzheimer's.",

      "Excerpt from an advocacy speech given in 2015 by Carrie Salter-Richardson",
      "My father was diagnosed at the age of 36 with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease. He had already lost his mother and two of his brothers. He and his younger brother were diagnosed about the same time, and for seven years, I watched my dad and my uncle slowly wither away. On August 22, 1996, my father turned 43. A friend drove me to the nursing home to take him balloons and wish him happy birthday. I struggled with my faith as a young teenager but on that day, I prayed to God for my father's death. I knew when I left there, it would be the last time I would see him alive, if that's what you want to call it. My dad died the next day.",
      "We didn't really speak about Alzheimer's again until 2009 when I got a call from a long-lost relative letting me know that my oldest cousin had been diagnosed and was already in a nursing home. He died two months later at the age of 37. After his death, we began to do some research and discovered DIAN or the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network. They helped us determine that our family carries the PSEN1 gene, and we enrolled in an observational study at Washington University in St. Louis.",
      "As part of the study, we were offered genetic testing to determine if we carried the same gene mutation. My brother Bryan was the first to have the genetic test done. Bryan and I are 18 months apart. We've always been best friends. He was always the best at everything. He excelled at sports and performing arts. He was popular and outgoing and the funniest person I know. When I got the phone call that he had tested positive for the gene, a piece of me died.",
      "On December 4, 2012, I drove to UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham) to hear my results. I remember sitting in a little room for what seemed like hours waiting for the doctor and genetic counselor. When the door finally opened, I knew my answer. It was written all over their faces. But to hear the words, \"It's not good news,\" took the wind out of me. I showed little emotion while the doctor was talking. I just nodded my head and thought about sitting in that nursing home with my dad. I thought about how I would tell my children. Would they too pray for my death? I knew there were many people waiting for my phone call and hoping for good news. I dreaded making those phone calls.",
      "For a few weeks, I let it consume me, felt sorry for myself, and spent a lot of time crying. But I knew there were three people who depended on me, so I decided to make a lifetime of heartache into a quest for hope. I joined a clinical trial through DIAN. I became a volunteer for the Walk to End Alzheimer's, which led me to become a congressional ambassador for the Alzheimer's Association. I've traveled to Washington, DC, to meet with representatives and senators, advocating for more federal funding for Alzheimer's. I've been to the Montgomery statehouse. I'm now the chair of the walk. I don't ever want my children to see me give up. I don't want them to feel hopeless.",
      "It is my hope that my story and the stories of others just like me will start a conversation and end the stigma that comes along with this disease. Just maybe I can bring a new face to Alzheimer's so people know that it can happen to anybody, not just the elderly. I don't know where my story will end. But I do know that I will never give up hope for a world without Alzheimer's.",
      "* * * * *",
      "In the spring of 2021, I spoke with Carrie and planned a trip to Montgomery, Alabama, to photograph her and her brother Bryan.",
      "Carrie told me, \"I was 15 when my dad died, but when he was diagnosed, I was only seven. I didn't understand. Nobody ever really tried to educate us about it. My dad was the last one to die of the kids that got it. After that, we didn't even think about it anymore. We just kind of went on with our lives as far as Alzheimer's was concerned.",
      "\"Growing up with my dad's illness \u2014 him and my youngest uncle are like Bryan and I, the same distance apart in age \u2014 they went through it together. Because we didn't understand the symptoms of the disease, we were really embarrassed by our dad. We didn't want our friends to be around him. We laughed at everything he did and said. It was silly. It's hard to look back and think the last years I had with my dad were me just being embarrassed by him. He played baseball in college. He played minor league baseball for the Phillies. He did a lot of great stuff, but all that we remember now is how his life ended in a nursing home. He weighed 70 pounds on a feeding tube in a nursing home.\"",
      "I asked Carrie how that experience informed her decision to become a vocal advocate and she replied, \"I didn't know how the reactions would be, putting it all out there. Trying to break that stigma. It really helped me heal from the devastation of the news. I think that it showed my kids that I'm not going to just lie down and cry and do nothing. I'm going to try to educate people. Of course, I'm not an expert on the disease at all, but I think the best thing I ever did was to sit down and talk with my kids, because it inspired my daughter Hannah to want to do something about it.",
      "\"My oldest daughter is a student at WashU. She's a sophomore. She is working as an undergrad in an Alzheimer's research lab right now. It's really awesome. She's actually my best friend. She's at school now, so it's hard.\"",
      "I asked, \"Does she give back to you with messages of encouragement or hope? What does she say back to you now that she's an adult?\"",
      "\"She just tells me that she's proud of me, and she'll tell me if I'm slipping up on stuff. She's kind of like a mama bear, but she's a nine-hour drive away. We FaceTime a lot. She calls me every day just to make sure I'm good.\"",
      "I asked Carrie, \"Do you talk to your brother (Bryan) about how you're feeling and how he's feeling?\"",
      "\"We just make jokes about it to each other, because I feel like we're the only ones that can joke about it. He's very witty. He comes up with some really funny stuff. We don't sit there and have deep discussions about it, because he doesn't think that he is symptomatic, and everybody else knows that he is, and I'm not going to tell him otherwise. We just kind of interact the same way we always have, which is by goofing off, joking around.\"",
      "\"Does Bryan have kids too?\"",
      "\"No. He's gay. He never had kids. I'm the only one that had children, which makes me feel very guilty. I do carry a lot of guilt for that, because now they all have a 50 percent chance of developing it as well.",
      "\"My mom would have you think I'm about halfway in my grave. She's a hard one to deal with. I give her a hard time, but Bryan does need the help, and she does help me with a lot of stuff too. If I get stressed, she'll do my healthcare and all the things that really frustrate me. For some reason, I get stressed out so easily. She'll do it. She'll fill it out for me. She's helpful, but then she's also overbearing. Maybe that's how all moms are. I don't know.",
      "\"I know the differences that are happening with me, and my kids definitely know. They mention it. I do get flustered a lot easier than I used to. I used to be able to manage a lot more things on my plate than I can manage now. Just little things. I try to write everything down in a planner, but then I forget to look at my planner. I do have bouts of crying spells, which is weird for me, because I've not done that before. I won't even know why I'm crying. I'm just crying.\"",
      "* * * * *",
      "A few weeks later, I was able to photograph Bryan and Carrie together in the backyard of their mother Mary's house in Montgomery. A few years ago, Bryan was struggling to live on his own and had to move back home from Atlanta. Mary is now Bryan's primary care partner. She helps Bryan with life's daily tasks and helped secure him a job at a local nursery where he can still enjoy work but in a safe and caring environment. Carrie had told me ahead of time that, despite only being eighteen months older than her, Bryan's Alzheimer's is much more advanced, and he has trouble communicating.",
      "I asked Bryan and Carrie what they would tell someone who was newly diagnosed.",
      "Bryan looked at Carrie and blurted, \"You go first!\" Carrie laughed and responded, \"When you're first diagnosed, at that moment you think it's the end of the world and your whole life is crashing down. But it's the complete opposite. It's given me so much more courage and brought me to meet so many wonderful people.\"",
      "Bryan paused with a sigh and said, \"I'm bad at speaking. Sometimes I struggle at work. But I get through it. Pennies and nickels and stuff ... the register ... it drives me nuts! You know what I mean? If someone is trying to use a check I have to ask for help. I struggle every day at work. But I still like it. I'm not very good at the computer. I can't type really fast. Sometimes I lose my train of thought. I used to be the wittiest person in the room, but I feel like it's kind of dimming for me. But I can still pull some jokes out.\"",
      "* * * * *",
      "Hannah Richardson was a sophomore in college when we met on the Washington University campus in St. Louis. I had previously interviewed and photographed her uncle Bryan (forty-one) and her mother Carrie (thirty-nine).",
      "I asked Hannah about her family and her journey as a young Alzheimer's advocate and now college student. Because Hannah was so young when her mom Carrie was first diagnosed, she had to face the stigma and stereotypes of people living with Alzheimer's very early.",
      "She told me, \"I've had multiple people in my life tell me that my mom is lying. I've had people, friends and classmates tell me that since my mom is so young, there's no way she could have Alzheimer's. To my face people have told me that, and it's so hard to deal with that. When that first happened, I was fourteen and my mom was already doing some advocacy work.",
      "\"I was just shocked that someone would even think that or say that to me. That pushed",
      "me to follow my mom and try to be more active in the advocacy realm and to educate people my age, I started volunteering with my mom, and I eventually started my own chapter of the Youth Movement Against Alzheimer's at my high school. It was really empowering and it kind of pushed me to want to do more advocacy- and education-type work.",
      "\"It was such a surprise to see how little people actually knew about it, even into college.\" I asked Hannah to tell me about her mother and how she copes, and she told me, \"There have been moments where I feel so devastated and defeated by it that it literally breaks me down.",
      "\"My therapist said, 'It's like grief, like you've lost someone, but you haven't lost them yet, but you know it's coming.' To me, I feel that's even harder, because you're waiting, and also my mom has been asymptomatic.",
      "\"I don't think she's asymptomatic now. She still does. But in the last few years, I've started to see those little signs, and those little, subtle changes slowly happen. It was reality hitting me in the face.\"",
      "I asked, \"What are the little signs that you've been noticing, because your mother and your uncle Bryan present very differently?\"",
      "Hannah said, \"They definitely do. My mom was asymptomatic until probably about two years ago. She still tells people she's asymptomatic, because no doctor's told her she's neurologically symptomatic. She's not forgetting things. She's not having the same things my uncle is experiencing, but I still think she is, because behaviorally she's not the same person she was. When I was growing up, my mom loved to be very social. She was always around her friends. She played tennis. She had all these different friend groups that she spent time with. She cared a lot about her friends, and now she has no friends. She does not see anybody.",
      "\"Going to the store stresses her out. Me FaceTiming her on the phone gives her so much stress, and she gets overwhelmed by it. Any type of social interaction, if it's more than just someone talking to her in the kitchen, it's overwhelming to her, and she gets agitated and frustrated and just lashes out.",
      "\"Three or four years ago, that was not the case. If you try to bring that up to her, she's in full denial of it. It's really hard, because she's definitely interacting with other people very differently than she used to.",
      "\"When I go home and when I talk to her on the phone and I see these things, it's definitely really hard, because it's like my mom isn't who my mom used to be, and she doesn't even realize it or acknowledge it. I think that makes it even harder, because if you try to bring it up to her, she denies it and thinks that I'm just pulling it out of thin air, but I'm not, and other people see it too. It makes it a lot harder to acknowledge and deal with it. I think her way of coping is not acknowledging it and not grieving it or being upset about it and just not even trying to think about it happening.",
      "\"That's been hard, because I think that was part of why I didn't face reality for so long, because she just tried to help others and didn't act like it affected her. But it does. And it affects her and my siblings. I think it made it a harder journey in that sense, and I wish that she would acknowledge it more. I don't know how to change that, but it definitely makes it harder. I get sad about it and I get anxious about it. I worry for my future because I know that I have a 50 percent chance of having Alzheimer's. I don't want to lose her and lose my siblings. I don't want to die!",
      "\"I get anxious and sad, and I've never heard her talk about that. I've had to kind of cope with those emotions and go through that in my own way, because she wasn't there. I didn't see how she did it, and I didn't see how she was doing as something to relate to.\"",
      "I asked Hannah, \"How did your family's history with Alzheimer's influence your decision to study medicine?\"",
      "\"I saw how in the beginning my mom didn't just shut down when she got her diagnosis but",
      "tried to be active in the community and try to educate others. That was really inspiring to me, because she didn't just sit down and take it. I want to do that as well, because my mom's always been someone I've looked up to my entire life, and I just admire her strength.",
      "\"When I was in high school, I started going with my mom to her yearly visits at WashU and",
      "seeing what the doctors do. I told them I was really interested in science, and they'd let me go in during some of her scans. They'd tell me about the brain and stuff. It was really cool, and I really enjoyed it. These people are doing work that actually impacts people's lives, and that's something that I really want to do. I got really inspired and thought 'I want to go to WashU. I want to go into research. I want to do what these doctors are doing and help people.' I just focused on that a lot. It's also a way to cope with what my family is going through. I can do this, and it will help, and that will be something I can be doing that's proactive to help my family and other families and everyone in the Alzheimer's and dementia community.",
      "\"I think my wish is like everybody else's \u2014 I want there to be a cure or treatment, because it terrifies me to think that I could have this. It's the scariest thing I can think of, and I don't want it. All I can hope is that there's something that someone somewhere can figure out to stop this and stop people from dying from it. Stop people from having to go through it, and watching their loved ones go through it. Because I sure as hell don't want to watch my mom go through it, or my uncle, and I don't want to watch me go through it or my siblings. Knowing there's nothing right now, you just feel so hopeless and helpless. I think that's part of the reason why I want to go into research, because I don't want to feel helpless and hopeless. That is what scares me most in the entire world.\"",

      "The veterans who fought and defeated fascism during World War II, and those who supported the war effort on the home front, have been called \"The Greatest Generation.\" But David Nasaw, professor of history at the City University of New York, says that description may be misleading. His new book, titled \"The Wounded Generation\" (Penguin Press), examines the invisible psychic wounds experienced by service members that went undiagnosed or ill-treated, as they returned to a nation that had also changed following years of war.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Lesley Stahl's interview with David Nasaw on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" November 9!",
      "\"The Wounded Generation\" by David Nasaw",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Introduction",
      "In its duration, geographical reach, and ferocity, World War II was unprecedented, and the effects on those who fought it and their loved ones at home, immeasurable. The veterans who returned home were not the ones who had left for war. \"They are very different now,\" wrote the GI cartoonist Bill Mauldin in Up Front, published in June 1945. \"Don't let anybody tell you they aren't. ... Some say the American soldier is the same clean-cut young man who left his home. \u2026 They are wrong.\"",
      "Most returning veterans found it difficult, if not impossible, to get a full night's sleep. Many were troubled by recurring nightmares and flashbacks. They were irritable, angry, plagued by uncontrollable rages, feelings of social isolation, and fears of places and events that evoked memories of the war, their proximity to death, and the dead left behind. Large numbers sought relief by drinking to excess, as they had during the war and while awaiting repatriation. Those who sought professional help were told that they suffered from nothing more than battle fatigue that time would cure. It did not. The true cause of their distress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), would go undiagnosed and untreated for decades to come.",
      "Nearly 16.4 million Americans, 12 percent of the total population, 32 percent of males between eighteen and forty-five, served in the armed forces of the United States in World War II. They left behind four million spouses, two million children, and tens of millions of parents, siblings, lovers, friends, and neighbors. The book that follows is an account of the aftereffects that lived on in the bodies, hearts, and minds of those who fought, those who awaited their return, and the nation that had won the war but had now to readjust to peace.",
      "The war itself lasted nearly four years. The men and women who fought it on two oceans, in the air, and on the landmasses of Africa, Alaska, Asia, Europe, and the islands of the Pacific served an average of thirty-three months, three-quarters of them overseas for sixteen months on average, three times as long as their counterparts in World War I. Never before or since have so many been called away to war \u2014 and for so long.",
      "The brutality and carnage of a global war were brought home in graphic reports and visual images in the daily press, the weeklies, Hollywood films, and newsreels. The human costs were made manifest with the arrival stateside of troopships bearing cargoes of servicemen of no further use to the military. In 1943 alone, more than one million were sent home, half of them with disability discharges. The overall numbers were alarming, but more so the percentage of those disabled and discharged \u2014 40 percent for the army \u2014 with \"neuropsychiatric defects.\"",
      "Why had so many hale and hearty young men broken down? In 1948, three years after the cessation of hostilities, Dr. William Menninger, chief consultant in neuropsychiatry to the army surgeon general, explained that the higher incidence of psychological breakdowns in World War II as compared with World War I was due in large part to the fact that the second world war was \"a 'tougher' one as nearly three times as long; it was fought on a rapidly moving and shifting basis instead of on fixed lines; it required many amphibious landings; it was fought in every extreme of climate; the lethal devices were far more devastating and nerve-racking than ever before; and more men were kept away from home for longer periods.\"",
      "There was a great deal of truth in Menninger's analysis, but his explanation brought neither solace nor relief to those who returned home with PTSD symptoms that could not be treated because they were not understood \u2014 by the veterans, their families, and the doctors and psychiatrists from whom they sought help.",
      "The nation to which the veterans returned was not the one they had left behind. There were shortages of every conceivable consumer item: white shirts and men's suits; meat and maple syrup; beef, bread, and barley; cars, used and new; and, most critically, affordable housing. What was most troubling was the lingering, inescapable fear that a return to economic depression was just around the corner, that the layoff of millions of war workers and the discharge of millions more servicemen would lead to massive unemployment.",

      "\"I just know that my brain's not right,\" said Carrie Richardson, 44. \"And so, I hate it. I just want it to be normal.\"",
      "At 41, Carrie developed early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The condition is caused by rare genetic mutations that essentially guarantee a person will develop the disease. Her mother, Mary Salter, of Montgomery, Alabama, knows the toll of the disease all too well. \"I've lost seven family members from the ages of 37 to 44,\" she said \u2026 including her son, Bryan, who died last year.",
      "Mary, Carrie, and Carrie's daughter Hannah have been coming to the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis to participate in some of the world's first clinical trials in Alzheimer's prevention. \"It's the least I can do to help,\" said Hannah. \"I feel like I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do it.\"",
      "Dr. Randy Bateman, who leads international clinical trials at WashU Medicine, said, \"Now we have a chance to change the course of the disease in a way we've never been able to do before.\"",
      "One reason for Bateman's optimism: For the first time, there's finally success treating mild Alzheimer's with medication that removes amyloid plaques \u2013 the protein deposits that build up on the outside of nerve cells in the brain, interfering with memory and thinking. These drugs have been shown to slow cognitive decline.",
      "\"People who had the plaques removed are 30 percent better than the people who didn't have the plaques removed,\" Bateman said. \"It doesn't stop the dementia. Dementia still continues, but at a slower rate.\"",
      "The point of the trials, Bateman said, is to study what happens when treatment is started even before Alzheimer's symptoms are evident: \"If you look at the people who are treated in these trials, the people who are at the earlier stages, the earlier stage you go, the better off they do. Some of them actually have been stable. And so, what this suggests is that timing is critically important.\"",
      "Within a particular family with early-onset Alzheimer's, symptoms usually start at about the same age, so researchers can figure out when to start treatment to try to prevent the disease. \"In these people, we have near-100-percent certainty they will get Alzheimer's disease dementia,\" Bateman said. \"And we know about when they're going to get it.\"",
      "Though these rare mutations account for less than one percent of Alzheimer's patients, the lessons learned about when to start treatment may apply to everyone.",
      "\"A death sentence\"",
      "Jake Heinrichs is a Broadway theater electrician from Brooklyn who carries one of the early-onset genes. The disease claimed his grandmother, uncle, father and brother, all within the same age range. \"Symptoms in the 40s and, and dying in 50s,\" he said.",
      "For Heinrichs growing up, the word Alzheimer's was \"a death sentence.\"",
      "He started getting treatment in Bateman's study in 2013. Though he's definitely getting an antibody called lecanemab now, for the first seven years, he did not know if he was receiving an antibody or placebo. \"I was at an age where I should have been showing signs,\" Heinrichs said, \"and I am now at an age that I should probably not even be alive.\"",
      "His wife is Broadway director Rachel Chavkin. She says over the past three years, he will occasionally repeat a question, but otherwise has shown no cognitive decline since she fell in love with him twenty years ago. \"Jake is now 51, which is the age that his father was when he died,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration's budget cuts have stopped or delayed millions of dollars in Alzheimer's research. The situation has already had an impact on Bateman's trials. \"It's a precarious time,\" he said. \"Research is not like building a building or painting a wall where you can start and then stop for a few years and then go back and resume what you were doing. It's much more like feeding a baby \u2026 if you stop doing that for a few weeks, it's irrecoverable.\"",
      "\"Let's double-down on this disease\"",
      "With federal research money threatened, philanthropist Bill Gates says the effect of decreasing investment delays any breakthrough. \"The data these young researchers have to consider different ideas is so much better than even five years ago,\" he said. \"So, this is the time where you think, wow, let's double-down on this disease.\"",
      "That's exactly what Gates is doing. The billionaire Microsoft co-founder is using his wealth and influence to bring together industry and government to tackle Alzheimer's. He's already personally invested more than $300 million. \"I'm going to stay very involved in this,\" he said.",
      "At a time of such possibility, uncertainty about funding is threatening momentum. \"It's quite up in the air,\" Gates said. \"If you talk to researchers, they're dealing with the uncertainty of, should they hire young people, or buy new equipment? And so, hopefully in the next several months, this gets resolved and, you know, that we can go full speed ahead.\"",
      "Gates has spent a considerable amount of his fortune to improve public health. And for him, it so happens Alzheimer's is personal. Bill Gates Sr., an attorney and philanthropist who died five years ago at the age of 94, also had Alzheimer's. \"He was lucky enough to have 24-hour care,\" said Gates. \"But there was no medicine, no, nothing that could bring his cognition back.\"",
      "Gates is supporting research to improve early diagnosis, treatment, and patient enrollment in trials. And \u2013 surprise \u2013 he sees a huge role for artificial intelligence. \"AI is going to impact everything we do,\" he said. \"The biology of the brain is so complex that AI's ability to take large amounts of data and find meaning in that data means that this research is going to go a lot faster.\"",
      "The early-onset clinical trials are expected to continue for at least another five years involving hundreds of people at 40 sites around the world. If successful, it could usher in routine screening for Alzheimer's with a simple blood test, just as we do now for high cholesterol and diabetes.",
      "Could people be tested now? Bateman said, \"Right now in medicine, we don't test people without symptoms, because the treatments aren't yet proven to work in people without symptoms.\"",
      "Finding effective treatments is a hot area of research, and may include giving cocktails of medications that target not only amyloid but other possible culprits, such as brain inflammation and a damaging nerve cell protein called tau.",
      "Bateman said, \"If this trial holds up and we can continue to demonstrate benefit year-after-year that these people are protected, then I actually think that will predict what's gonna happen in the near future in ongoing prevention trials: That they will be positive, they will work, they will give people years of dementia-free life.\"",
      "So, Jake Heinrichs undergoes regular MRIs, physicals, memory testing, spinal taps, and PET scans to monitor his brain function, and see if he can prevent an almost-certain genetic destiny.",
      "Four-year-old Sam Heinrichs is living proof of what can come from a belief in science \u2013 and a leap of faith.",
      "I asked Jake, \"What made you finally say, you know what, even though there's a 50-percent chance he might get the gene, we're going to go ahead and try to have a baby?\"",
      "\"Because I've been part of this study, and it seems to be effective,\" Jake replied. \"It gave me hope that the scourge of Alzheimer's is something that we're not going to fear in the future. Anything could happen. But right now, I have hope.\"",

    "summary": "One child was rushed to the hospital via air ambulance, her parents said.",
    "story": [
      "The parents of at least two babies sickened in an infantile botulism outbreak are suing the makers of the ByHeart baby formula at the heart of a nationwide recall.",
      "Stephen and Yurany Dexter, of Flagstaff, Arizona, said their 4-month-old daughter, Rose, had to be flown by air ambulance to a children's hospital two hours from home and treated for several weeks this summer.",
      "Michael and Hanna Everett, of Richmond, Kentucky, said their daughter, Piper, also 4 months, was rushed to a hospital Nov. 8 with worsening symptoms of the rare and potentially deadly disease.",
      "\"It was just absolutely terrifying,\" Hanna Everett told CBS News in an interview Thursday. \"You know, we just kind of felt like we failed as a parent in some ways.\"",
      "Everett said they were unaware of the recall prior to her daughter consuming the ByHeart formula.",
      "\"She had finished that entire can, literally, the day before the recall,\" Everett said.",
      "The lawsuits, filed in federal courts in two states, allege that the ByHeart formula the babies consumed was defective and that the company was negligent in selling it. They seek financial payment for medical bills, emotional distress and other harm.",
      "\"My hopes right now is that they're able to catch it before their children get too sick, before they have to be on ventilators,\" Everett said.",
      "Both families said they bought the organic formula to provide what they viewed as a natural, healthier alternative to traditional baby formulas, and that they were shocked and angered by the suffering their children endured.",
      "\"I wouldn't guess that a product designed for a helpless, developing human in the United States could cause something this severe,\" said Stephen Dexter, 44.",
      "\"She's so little and you're just helplessly watching this,\" Hanna previously told the Associated Press. \"It was awful.\"",
      "Rose Dexter and Piper Everett are among at least 15 infants in a dozen states who have been sickened in the outbreak that began in August, according to federal and state health officials. No deaths have been reported.",
      "Both received the sole treatment available for botulism in children less than a year old: an IV medication called BabyBIG, made from the blood plasma of people immunized against the neurotoxins that cause the illness.",
      "Investigations into more potential botulism cases are pending after ByHeart, the New York-based formula manufacturer, recalled all of its formula nationwide on Tuesday. At least 84 U.S. babies have been treated for infantile botulism since August, including those in the outbreak, California officials said.",
      "It can take up to 30 days for signs of infantile botulism infection to appear, medical experts said. The symptoms can include drooping eyelids, diminished suck and gag reflexes, and a weak and altered cry, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Children suspected of being sick with infant botulism should get medical attention as soon as possible, the CDC says.",
      "ByHeart sells about 200,000 cans of formula per month. FDA commissioner Marty Makary told CBS News that the company sells about 1% of the baby formula purchased in the U.S., and that there is no risk of a formula shortage due to the recall.",
      "California officials confirmed that a sample from an open can of ByHeart formula fed to an infant who fell ill contained the type of bacteria that can lead to illness.",
      "The lawsuits filed Wednesday could be the first of many legal actions against ByHeart, said Bill Marler, a Seattle food safety lawyer who represents Dexter.",
      "\"This company potentially faces an existential crisis,\" he said.",
      "ByHeart officials didn't respond to questions about the new lawsuits but said they would \"address any legal claims in due course.\"",
      "\"We remain focused on ensuring that families using ByHeart products are aware of the recall and have factual information about steps they should take,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "In a separate statement provided to CBS News Thursday, the company said, \"We express our deepest sympathy to the families currently impacted by the cases of infant botulism.\"",
      "In Rose Dexter's case, she received ByHeart formula within days of her birth in July after breast milk was insufficient, her father said. Stephen Dexter said he went to Whole Foods to find a \"natural option.\"",
      "\"I'm a little concerned with things that are in food that may cause problems,\" he said. \"We do our best to buy something that says it's organic.\"",
      "But Rose, who was healthy at birth, didn't thrive on the formula. She had trouble feeding and was fussy and fretful as she got sicker. On Aug. 31, when she was 8 weeks old, her parents couldn't wake her.",
      "Rose was flown by air ambulance to Phoenix Children's Hospital, where she stayed for nearly two weeks.",
      "Hanna Everett told the AP she used ByHeart to supplement breastfeeding starting when Piper was 6 weeks old.",
      "\"It's supposed to be similar to breast milk,\" she said.",
      "Last weekend, Piper started showing signs of illness. Everett said she became more worried when a friend told her ByHeart had recalled two lots of its Whole Nutrition Infant Formula. When a family member checked the empty cans, they matched the recalled lots.",
      "\"I was like, 'Oh my god, we need to go to the ER,\" Everett recalled to the AP.",
      "At Kentucky Children's Hospital, Piper's condition worsened rapidly. Her pupils stopped dilating correctly and she lost her gag reflex. Her head and arms became limp and floppy.",
      "Doctors immediately ordered doses of the BabyBIG medication, which had to be shipped from California, Hanna said. In the meantime, Piper had to have a feeding tube and IV lines inserted.",
      "In both cases, the babies improved after receiving treatment. Rose went home in September and she no longer requires a feeding tube. Piper went home this week.",
      "They appear to be doing well on different formulas, the families said.",

      "Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to the latest data from Purdue's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "While the prevalence of food insecurity around the U.S. fluctuates month to month, the overall rate had been declining since 2022, when an average of 15.4% of households were food insecure as inflation hit 40-year highs following the pandemic.",
      "Although the pace of inflation has declined since 2022, food insecurity is likely rising because food prices remain far above pre-pandemic levels, according to Poonam Gupta, a research associate at the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"Even though inflation slowed a lot this year, we're nowhere near the amount that we were spending on food even just a couple of years ago,\" she said.",
      "Gupta also said more Americans could struggle to put food on the table in 2026, with an estimated 2.4 million SNAP recipients potentially losing benefits due to new work requirements in the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill signed into law in July by President Trump.",
      "The Purdue researchers define food insecurity as some members of a household at times not being able to afford a balanced meal, as well as occasionally having to skip a meal or eating less for financial reasons.",
      "Purdue's survey has become one of the few remaining national measures of food insecurity, since the U.S. Department of Agriculture canceled its annual Household Food Security survey in September, which had been conducted since 2001.",

    "story": [
      "Anthropic said Thursday that Chinese hackers used its artificial intelligence technology in what the company believes is the first cyberespionage operation largely carried out using AI.",
      "Anthropic said the cybercriminals used its popular chatbot, Claude, to target roughly 30 technology companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government agencies. The hackers used the AI platform to gather usernames and passwords from the companies' databases that they then exploited to steal private data, Anthropic said, while noting that only a \"small number\" of these attacks succeeded.",
      "\"We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention,\" Anthropic said in a statement.",
      "The San Francisco-based company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Anthropic said it began detecting suspicious activity in mid-September. A subsequent investigation by the company revealed that the activity stemmed from an espionage campaign that Anthropic said was likely carried out by a state-sponsored group based in China.",
      "According to the investigation, hackers allegedly duped Claude into thinking it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm and that it was being used for defensive testing. Anthropic also said the cybercriminals sought to hide their tracks by breaking down the attack into small tasks.",
      "Unlike conventional cyberattacks, the operation required minimal human intervention, according to the company. \"The AI made thousands of requests per second, an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match,\" Anthropic said.",
      "Anthropic said it expects AI cyberattacks to grow in scale and sophistication as so-called agents become more widely used for a range of services. AI agents are cheaper than professional hackers and can operate quickly at a larger scale, making them particularly attractive to cybercriminals, MIT Technology Review\u00a0has pointed out.",

      "Under the 2019 law, workers who miss paychecks during a lapse in federal funding must be paid retroactively as soon as the shutdown ends. It directs agencies to issue back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"",

      "\"A lot of times a company already has a person in mind before it's public information, or there's a lot of weight on the scales for a particular person. A lot of hiring, whether we like it or not, is done this way,\" career coach Cynthia Pong told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "This makes professional networking even more crucial.",
      "When applying for a job can be as easy as clicking a button, recruiters find themselves inundated with digital applications they have to weed through, according to Pong. She said a personal recommendation can be tremendously helpful in getting a hiring manager's attention.",
      "\"If we're smart about leveraging our network, it goes a long way in  cutting through the noise that is the pile of digital or paper resumes  on [the] other person's side,\" she said.",
      "How do you network?",
      "Pong says she often works with job seekers who don't trust that the people they know can be helpful in their job searches.",
      "\"A lot of people say they have no network, their community doesn't know anyone. I am used to hearing that preliminary objection. I press people and say, you do know people, and those people also know people \u2014 and that's a network,\" she said.",
      "She encourages job seekers to spend 70% to 80% of their time networking, versus blasting out resumes and cold applying to posted openings.",
      "Start by making a list of people you know in broad categories, such as through family, high school, college and graduate school, and from past jobs and internships. One way to identify contacts from your past is to go through your own resume or LinkedIn profile.",

      "Next, organize your contacts into a list or spreadsheet and set performance goals for yourself.",
      "\"Each week say, 'I'm going to reach out to x number of people on this list. In a couple weeks, you'll have made progress,\" Pong said.",
      "Once you connect, end every conversation by asking your contact who else they recommend you reach out to in order to grow your network.",
      "When you apply to a job at the recommendation of a contact, it boosts your chances of getting noticed and also eases hiring managers' workloads.",
      "\"You're doing them a favor by becoming visible to them and differentiating yourself from everybody else in this day and age of easy-apply, one-click applications,\" Pong said.",
      "Optimize your online presence",
      "It's easy for recruiters to search for a candidate online and access reams of personal and professional information about them.",
      "This is why one's online presence is increasingly important.",
      "\"Think about what someone who Googles your name sees,\" Pong said. \"Do they even see me if I have a common name? If they do see me, is something coming up that is not just my LinkedIn profile? What's better is if it's that plus other things that demonstrate in the first couple of hits what you stand for, what your value add is and what are you passionate about.\"",
      "That can be achieved by building a personal website highlighting past work, for example.",

      "The increasing cost of dating apps, matchmaking services and, for those looking for an even bigger edge, love coaching can require singles to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars in pursuit of finding a partner \u2014 and that's before the first date.",
      "Although most apps operate on a so-called \"freemium\" model, upgrades and premium features that dating services claim will your boost success rate can greatly increase expenses. Popular dating apps such as Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, The League and others still offer free versions, but charge users for additional features the companies promise will deliver better experiences \u2014 and more desirable romantic prospects \u2014 as the services look to monetize their platforms.",

      "On Match Group-owned Hinge, for example, upgrading to Hinge+ costs $100 for six months, or $17 a month. That allows users to \"like\" an unlimited number of prospects, see who likes them and be more choosy about prospective matches.

      "New York-based entrepreneur Bretton Auerbach, a Harvard University graduate and founder of real estate marketplace Triple.com, has been paying for dating apps for years. When he first started using dating apps, including Tinder, roughly a decade ago, he quickly encountered two challenges: First, it was taking up a lot of his time and second, he was bumping up against limits on how many peoples' profiles he could like.",
      "To save time and meet more people, Auerbach signed up for paid versions of a handful of dating apps and found himself spending around $1,000 per month on paid features. That allowed him to view roughly 100 profiles, which he'd whittle down to a date or two.",
      "\"If you're not paying, you're not getting dates,\" Auerbach said. He compared these features such as \"boosts\" that raise your profile's visibility to \"going into a casino where you buy a bunch of chips, throw them in a slot machine where the wheels spin, and you hope you see someone attractive.",
      "Notably, he also conceded that he's spent \"a lot of money\" on dating apps, and ultimately hasn't found them that useful.",

    "story": [
      "Walt Disney Co. executives on Thursday warned that the company's dispute with YouTube could drag on, leaving subscribers to the Google-owned video platform without access to ABC, ESPN, FX and other programming from the entertainment giant.",
      "Disney channels went dark on YouTube TV on Oct. 30 amid a so-called carriage dispute between the two companies. YouTube\u00a0said in a blog post\u00a0last month that Disney had followed through on a threat to pull its networks \"as a negotiating tactic to force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers.\"",
      "Asked in a Thursday investor call about the ongoing negotiations, Disney Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said that \"these discussions could go for a little while,\" without providing a timeframe or additional details.",
      "\"[W]e care deeply about our consumer,\" Disney CEO Robert Iger said in the call. \"And our priority has always been to remain on their service without interruption to close a deal on a timely basis so that interruption does not occur. The deal that we have proposed is equal to or better than what other large distributors have already agreed to.\"",
      "What are carriage fees?",
      "Providers of pay-TV services like YouTube TV pay carriage fees to network owners, including Disney, for the right to broadcast their channels. Disputes over the fees are common, with content providers often at loggerheads with TV networks over commercial terms when their deals expire.",
      "The conflicts sometimes result in viewers losing access to a company's channels or content if the negotiations extend beyond the end of a contract.",
      "Disney claimed last month that YouTube TV is refusing to pay fair rates for its channels and has chosen to \"deny their subscribers the content they value most,\" pointing to its ESPN sports broadcasts and ABC shows such as \"High Potential.\"",
      "YouTube has countered that Disney \"is proposing costly economic terms that would raise prices on YouTube TV customers and give our customers fewer choices,\" according to an Oct. 23 blog post.",
      "YouTube, the largest internet TV provider in the U.S. with more than 9 million subscribers, said last month that it would offer a $20 credit if Disney's content remains unavailable on YouTube TV for \"an extended period of time.\" The streaming platform costs $82.99 per month.",
      "Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Johnston's comment or whether YouTube is currently offering the $20 credit to customers.",
      "Disney on Thursday also reported mixed fourth-quarter results, with weaker growth from cable and the box office somewhat offset by strength in its streaming business and theme parks.",
      "Although the company's profit topped analyst estimates, Disney's $22.4 billion in revenue for the quarter fell short of Wall Street forecasts of $22.8 billion. Sales at its Disney Entertainment unit, which includes the company's movie studios and streaming service, dropped 6%, while revenue for its parks division climbed 6%.",

      "The pay schedule was laid out in an agency-by-agency projection by the White House's Office of Management and Budget. The memo was first reported by Semafor, and an OMB official confirmed its contents to CBS News.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of essential employees continued working during the shutdown without pay, while nonessential employees were furloughed. Both groups are entitled to back pay for the paychecks they missed while the government was closed.",
      "The administration has a goal of completing its list of backlogged payments by Nov. 19.",
      "Differing dates among agencies are due to different pay schedules and payroll providers, an OMB official said. The official added that the original projected pay dates were supposed to be later, but the White House urged agencies to get checks out \"expeditiously and accurately to not leave anyone waiting longer than necessary.\"",
      "Most of the first post-shutdown paychecks to employees will only include pay from Oct. 1 to Nov. 1. They will be limited to base pay, meaning no bonuses, overtime or benefits. Pay for days after Nov. 1, as well as for overtime or bonuses, will be issued in the next pay period.",
      "Up first are Army and non-Army civilian employees at the Defense Department, as well as staffers at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Energy and Health and Human Services.

These checks cover the entire period of the shutdown, including from Nov. 1 to Nov. 13.",
      "Federal employees going without pay became a major pain point during the Senate's fight over funding the government, and was one of several factors that ultimately pushed eight Senate Democrats to join Republicans to end the stalemate. The package cleared the House on Wednesday evening, and President Trump quickly signed it into law, ending the shutdown.",

      "Starbucks Workers United is calling the strike the \"red cup rebellion,\" since it coincides with the coffee chain's annual Red Cup Day promotion, when it gives away free reusable holiday cups at its retail locations. Starbucks Workers United, which represents more than 9,500 baristas across 550 Starbucks cafes, is asking for better pay, increased staffing and a resolution of labor disputes.",
      "The strike will start with more than 65 stores in over 40 cities across the country, the union said, noting that the labor action has no prescribed end date.",
      "\"There are already stores that have been shut down for the day, and we anticipate there to be dozens more that have to shut down today as well,\" Starbucks Workers United spokesperson Michelle Eisen, who has worked as a barista at Starbucks for 15 years, said during a press call Thursday morning.",
      "Workers United said it is prepared to escalate the strike if Starbucks does not deliver a contract and \"resolve unfair labor practice charges.\"",
      "\"If Starbucks keeps stonewalling a fair contract and refusing to end union-busting, they'll see their business grind to a halt,\" Eisen said in a statement. \"No contract, no coffee is more than a tagline \u2014 it's a pledge to interrupt Starbucks operations and profits until a fair union contract and an end to unfair labor practices are won.\"",
      "Starbucks describes strike impact as \"minimal\"",
      "Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson said the company is seeing \"minimal impacts\" on Thursday morning across its more than 17,000 U.S. coffeehouses. Less than 1% of the company's stores are impacted by the strike, she noted.",
      "In October,\u00a0Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol told \"CBS Mornings\" that the company has \"the best benefits\" and \"the best wages\" in the industry.",
      "\"What their requests to date have been, has been unreasonable,\" Niccol said. \"We're willing to, you know, negotiate and have 'em come back to the table and find a solution.\"",
      "Starbucks said it offers the equivalent of $30 an hour in pay and employee benefits. However, Workers United claims that many workers aren't getting enough hours to qualify for benefits. The union told CBS News that the starting wage for baristas is $15.25 in a majority of states.",
      "\"The reality is I make $17 an hour, and I live paycheck to paycheck,\" said Starbucks barista and Chicago resident Diego Franco. \"I can't sustain myself on that. I can't sustain my mom's medical bills.\"",
      "Starbucks Workers United announced last week that its members had\u00a0voted to authorize a strike, with 92% of members backing a work stoppage.",
      "\"We are disappointed that Workers United, who only represents around 4% of our partners, has voted to authorize a strike instead of returning to the bargaining table,\" Anderson told CBS News in a statement at the time. \"When they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "Contract talks between Starbucks and Workers United began in April 2024 but fell apart in December. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are non-economic proposals.",
      "Sharon Block, a professor at Harvard Law School, told CBS News the fitful contract negotiations between Starbucks and its organized workforce highlight the weakness of federal labor law in bringing employers to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The law just seems to be incapable of ensuring a fair playing field for these workers who take big risks,\" added Block, a former official in the federal Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs during the Biden administration.",
      "The strike marks the union's third national work stoppage in the past year. Workers United last protested in May over Starbucks' new dress code, and thousands also walked off the job in December 2024.",

      "After weeks of uncertainty, millions of Americans will soon start receiving federal nutrition assistance benefits again, after President Trump on Wednesday night signed a bill passed by Congress to end the longest\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0in U.S. history.",
      "The legislation funds Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits through September 2026. It also reimburses the program's contingency reserves to account for expenditures during the government shutdown.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture told states last month that it would not fund SNAP, also known as food stamps, for November if the shutdown continued. Nearly 42 million Americans receive SNAP benefits to help pay for groceries.",
      "An agency spokesperson told CBS News on Wednesday that SNAP recipients in most states will get their benefits \"within 24 hours\" after the government shutdown ends. The Office of Management and Budget did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Experts told CBS News they expect the flow of benefits to start relatively quickly once the shutdown ends, but noted that the exact timeline could differ by state.",

      "SNAP timing differs by state",
      "At least 19 states, plus the District of Columbia, issued full benefits to at least some recipients last week, according to The Associated Press.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-affordable-care-act-premium-tax-credits-what-next/",
    "published": "Thu, 13 Nov 2025 08:35:37 -0500",
    "summary": "An extension of enhanced ACA tax credits appears unlikely, experts say, leaving millions of Americans facing potentially higher health plan costs in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "The cost of health care remains in limbo for roughly 22 million Americans after the U.S. government reopened late Wednesday without a deal to extend an expiring federal tax credit that offsets the cost of some Affordable Care Act plans.",
      "The fate of the enhanced premium tax credit had been at the center of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history as Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidy in order to reopen the government.",
      "Seven Democratic senators and one independent who caucuses with Democrats voted late Sunday with Republican senators to end the shutdown without resolving the future of the tax credit.",
      "On Wednesday, the House passed a funding package \u2014 also without an extension of the tax credits \u2014 to end the 43-day shutdown in a 222 to 209 vote. Six Democrats voted with Republicans to send the bill to President Trump, who signed the legislation later the same evening.",
      "While Senate Republicans have agreed to hold a vote on extending the ACA tax credits by mid-December, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise on Wednesday said he wouldn't commit\u00a0to such a plan.",
      "Americans are now choosing their 2026 health plans on the ACA's online marketplaces, and without congressional action, the tax credits will expire Dec. 31.",
      "\"A lot of people are sort of in this limbo state where they have to buy their insurance for next year, but they really don't know how this is going to shake out at the federal level,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at nonprofit health policy site KFF, told CBS News.",
      "What happens without an extension?",
      "Without any action on Congress's part, the enhanced premium tax credits, which were introduced in 2021 through the American Rescue Plan Act, will disappear at the end of 2025.",
      "That means low- and middle-income households that previously qualified for the tax credits would likely see their ACA premiums more than double next year, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a KFF analysis.",
      "Faced with higher costs for ACA insurance, about 4 million people are likely to drop their health coverage, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "\"Americans are really just seeing how expensive health care is in this country, and it's just completely unaffordable for a lot of people to pay their own entire health insurance premium,\" Wager said.",
      "Currently, the enhanced ACA premium tax credit is available for people who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which sets the upper threshold at $62,000 for an individual, according to KFF. However, some Americans who earn above that 400% benchmark can qualify for the tax credit if their insurance rates exceed 8.5% of their income.",
      "Three-quarters of Americans favor renewing the subsidies, according to recent KFF polling. That includes 94% of Democrats and about half of Republicans.",
      "If Congress renews the subsidies, federal and state marketplaces would need to retool the 2026 plans already available to consumers. It's possible a new plan could be made retroactive to January 2026, even if it's passed later in the year, Wager said.",
      "\"At that point, people are sort of locked in on whatever plan they chose, but they can retroactively receive the tax credit,\" she noted.",
      "Are there other options from Congress?",
      "Congress could pursue other ways to make health coverage more affordable. On Saturday, President Trump called for sending the money saved by not extending the tax subsidies \"directly to the people.\" On his Truth Social platform, he criticized the ACA and said Americans should be able to use the savings to purchase other kinds of insurance.",
      "\"In other words, take from the BIG, BAD Insurance Companies, give it to the people, and terminate, per Dollar spent, the worst Healthcare anywhere in the World, ObamaCare,\" he wrote.",
      "Wager said it remains to be seen if Mr. Trump's plan is feasible, saying \"we haven't seen a concrete enough proposal at this point.\"",
      "Some lawmakers have offered similar proposals, such as Senate Health Committee Chair Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana. In a floor speech last week, he said eligible Americans could be sent \"a pre-funded federal flexible spending account\" to use for health expenses, from dental care to prescription drugs and preventive services.",
      "In the meantime, as 2026 approaches and the future of the enhanced premium tax credit remains unclear, enrollees should consider speaking with a health insurance expert to get advice on their options, Wager advised.",
      "\"The most important thing that you can do is talk to somebody \u2014 an agent, broker or a navigator \u2014 who can help you make sure that you really understand what your options are and that you get the best plan for your financial situation and your health care situation,\" she said.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Nov 2025 07:14:12 -0500",
    "summary": "One contentious point was whether Shikha Garg suffered pain in her final moments, with Boeing arguing that passengers didn't experience physical pain before impact.",
    "story": [
      "A federal court jury has awarded over $28 million to the family of a United Nations consultant who died in the crash of a Boeing 737 Max jetliner in Ethiopia more than six years ago.",
      "The verdict was reached Wednesday on behalf of the relatives of Shikha Garg after two hours of jury deliberation that capped a weeklong trial in Chicago, where Boeing used to have its headquarters. It was the first civil trial stemming from the March 2019 disaster that killed all 157 people on board Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.",
      "\"We and the family are gratified by the jury's verdict. It provides public accountability for Boeing's wrongful conduct,\" the family's lawyers, Shanin Specter and Elizabeth Crawford, said in a statement after the verdict was read in court.",
      "Boeing will pay an additional $3.45 million to Garg's husband, Soumya Bhattacharya, as part of a deal between him and the company reached outside of court. That, along with a 26% interest charge, brings the total amount Boeing will pay to Garg's family to $35.8 million.",
      "The aircraft maker has negotiated pre-trial settlements in most of the dozens of wrongful death lawsuits filed in connection with the crash and a similar 737 Max disaster five months earlier off the coast of Indonesia, although details of the settlements were confidential and not disclosed. Lawyers say less than a dozen lawsuits remain unresolved.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, Boeing apologized to all the victims' families and said it respects their right to pursue their claims in court.",
      "Jurors weren't tasked with weighing the aircraft maker's liability in the crash because Boeing has already accepted responsibility. Instead, they were asked to award damages for matters such as loss of income and grief suffered by Garg's family.",
      "Like a number of the other passengers, Garg, a consultant for the United Nations Development Programme, was on her way to attend a U.N. environmental assembly in Nairobi, Kenya.",
      "At trial, Specter painted a picture for the jury of a young and accomplished PhD candidate who was married just months before she boarded the fatal Ethiopian Airlines flight. A citizen of India, Garg wore on the flight a sari and held flower garlands in line with Indian tradition.",
      "The then-new Boeing Max crashed minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport. Specter called Garg's death \"senseless\" and \"preventable.\"",
      "Boeing lawyer Dan Webb, a former U.S. attorney, urged jurors to focus on \"fair and reasonable\" compensation for Garg's family. One contentious point was whether Garg suffered pain in her final moments before death, with Boeing arguing that the passengers didn't experience physical injury before impact.",
      "\"There would not have been time for them to feel any physical pain when they hit the ground,\" Webb said.",
      "The payout awarded to Garg's family by the jury includes $10 million for the \"pain and suffering and emotional distress\" she experienced before the crash, according to the family's lawyers.",
      "From nearly the moment pilots flying for Ethiopian Airlines took off in their new Boeing jetliner, they encountered problems with the plane. The pilots were bombarded by alarms for six minutes as they fought to fly the plane before entering a final nosedive at nearly 700 miles per hour.",
      "Days later, all Max jets around the world were grounded. Flights resumed in December 2020, but Indonesia didn't lift its ban on the Max for another year and Ethiopian Airlines didn't resume flying the plane until February 2022.",
      "Amid the trial, a federal judge in Texas approved a Justice Department request to dismiss its long-running criminal case against Boeing in connection with the two 737 Max crashes. In exchange, Boeing says it will pay or invest an additional $1.1 billion toward fines, compensation for victims' families, and internal safety and quality improvements.",
      "U.S. prosecutors had charged the company with conspiracy to commit fraud, accusing it of deceiving government regulators about a flight-control system it developed for the 737 Max. In both crashes, the software had pitched the nose of the planes down repeatedly based on faulty readings from a single sensor.",
      "Last year, the Justice Department said Boeing accepted a plea deal stemming from the crashes after the government determined the company violated an agreement that had protected it from prosecution for more than three years.\u00a0 The deal only covers wrongdoing by Boeing involving the two deadly crashes. It does not give Boeing immunity for other incidents, including a\u00a0panel that blew off a Max jetliner during an Alaska Airlines flight\u00a0in January 2024.",
      "A scathing report by the House Transportation Committee released in 2020 found multiple Boeing engineers and test pilots expressed concerns about the system that would ultimately be linked to the two deadly 737 Max crashes \u2014 and yet those problems were never fixed. The plane was deemed compliant by the FAA according to existing standards, but was \"demonstratively unsafe,\" casting doubt on the certification process, according to committee investigators.",

While a vote to reopen the government would come as a relief to consumers, as well as to air traffic controllers and other Transportation Department personnel tasked with working without pay during the impasse, the system will take some time to recover.",
      "\"My guess is it's going to take a couple weeks,\" aviation security expert Sheldon Jacobson, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, told CBS News. \"They have to get people back in places, airplanes back in places. This is non-trivial.\"",
      "He likened the process of ramping operations back up to turning a dial, rather than \"flicking a switch,\" noting that some airlines may have sent planes for maintenance as the Federal Aviation Administration throttled air traffic\u00a0at major airports last week because of the shutdown.",
      "\"They didn't furlough crew and put equipment away, but they might have put it in heavy maintenance,\" Jacobson said.",

      "Amazon added, \"Our dedicated Accommodations team reviews each request individually to make sure employees have access to the accommodations and adjustments they need, and we continuously evaluate our approach to best address their needs.\"",
      "The lawsuit was filed in a federal court in New York by a woman named Cayla Lyster, who started working as an Amazon employee in 2022 in upstate New York.

    "published": "Wed, 12 Nov 2025 13:05:28 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump on Sunday floated the idea of tapping his administration's tariff revenue to send checks to most Americans.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Sunday said he wants to give most Americans a $2,000 payment funded from tariffs as he defended what's become one of his administration's signature policies.",
      "Mr. Trump touted his tariff policy as helping the U.S. raise new revenue, which he said has driven \"record investment\" in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,\" Mr. Trump wrote Sunday in a\u00a0Truth Social post. He didn't provide additional details on how such rebates would be disbursed to Americans.",
      "On Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News that the rebates would likely be given to families making \"less than, say, $100,000.\"",
      "That threshold is still in discussion, though, Bessent added.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously\u00a0floated the idea of tariff rebates for individuals. In July, he said the administration was considering giving Americans a small rebate based on the billions the federal government has collected in tariff revenue since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The president's suggestion comes as a core section of his tariff policy is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, with some of the justices appearing skeptical last week of Mr. Trump's use\u00a0of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to authorize wide-ranging import duties.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on how the administration would disburse the checks.",
      "How could a rebate work?",
      "Typically, rebates and stimulus payments are issued through the tax code, requiring Congress to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks.",
      "For instance, the three stimulus checks issued during the pandemic were authorized by Congress, with the payments signed into law by Presidents Trump and Biden.",
      "Earlier this year, Congress overhauled the tax code through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill, which created new breaks such as eliminating taxes on some tipped income and overtime. The law doesn't include rebates or dividends for taxpayers.",
      "Bessent on Sunday told Fox News that the dividend \"could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways.\"",
      "He added, \"You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda \u2014 you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans.\"",
      "Is there enough tariff revenue to pay a $2,000 dividend?",
      "Paying $2,000 to about 150 million adults earning $100,000 or less would require roughly $300 billion in revenue, according to Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation,\u00a0in a\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far,\" she said.",
      "For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the federal government raised $195 billion in customs duties,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "U.S. importers have paid nearly $89 billion in tariffs imposed under the IEEPA, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. The Trump administration has also tapped other regulations aside from IEEPA to introduce new tariffs.",
      "If the Supreme Court rules that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful, those businesses could be entitled to refunds, curtailing the tariff revenue available for rebate checks.",
      "A rebate for most taxpayers would also add to the national debt, York added.",
      "\"The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs: a dollar of tariff revenue offsets about 24 cents of income and payroll tax revenue,\" she said. \"Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump's proposed $300 billion rebate.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that \"money left over\" from the payments would be used to pay down the national debt.",
      "Could tariff checks boost inflation?",
      "The stimulus checks during the pandemic were credited by economists with boosting inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022. Sending ew tariff checks to almost every U.S. household could risk another bout of inflation by stimulating demand for goods and services without boosting their supply, York said.",
      "That could occur at a time when inflation is already inching higher, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs,\u00a0according to economists. While U.S. businesses are eating some of the tariffs in the form of lower profits, they're also passing some costs onto consumers.",
      "Tariff dividends \"would be another factor pushing inflation up rather than bringing it down,\" she said, noting that the stimulus checks likely boosted inflation by between one to three percentage points.",
      "\"It would be smaller, but it would still increase the budget deficit by giving people more money,\" she added.",
      "A White House official said that \"the economists making that assertion are baselessly speculating\" about a possible inflationary impact, noting that there aren't many details yet about the plan.",

    "summary": "The president is hosting some of the nation's top financiers for a White House dinner Wednesday as part of his effort to bring manufacturing back home.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is hosting a private White House dinner Wednesday with some of Wall Street's biggest names, as part of his effort to forge stronger ties with America's business leaders and convince them to invest in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, whose relationship with the president has had its ups and downs, will be attending, as well as Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman, Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone, Morgan Stanley's Ted Pick, BlackRock's Larry Fink and David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, sources familiar with the event planning said.",
      "Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the NYSE, helped organize the dinner, according to the sources. Lynn Martin, the president of the NYSE, will also be attending.",
      "Others who plan to attend the 7:30 p.m. dinner include Citadel founder Ken Griffin, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts co-founder Henry Kravis, Apollo Global Management's Marc Rowan and SoftBank's Masayoshi Son, sources said. NYSE President Lynn Martin will also be in attendance.",
      "Many of those attending have been longtime donors to Mr. Trump, and some, like Son, have announced their companies would make significant investments in the U.S.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick are on the guest list, too.",
      "Bankers have been pitching the administration on handling the IPO for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which will be a major event on Wall Street. Mr. Trump announced in May that he wanted to take the two mortgage giants public, noting at the time that the two had returned to profitability after the government took them over during the 2008 financial crisis. The two entities buy mortgages from lenders and hold them in their portfolios or package them into mortgage-backed securities to be sold.",
      "Fannie and Freddie are not the focus of the dinner, sources said. Instead, Mr. Trump and top administration officials want to discuss affordability, an issue that Americans said was their top concern in the elections last week, where Democrats swept the major races. By Wednesday afternoon, however, the focus of the meeting was still unclear to some attendees, a banking industry source said Wednesday.",
      "In September, the president hosted more than a dozen tech industry tycoons at the White House, including the CEOs of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta. And he's held one-on-one events in the Oval Office with a succession of tech and pharmaceutical executives, often to announce multibillion-dollar manufacturing deals.",
      "Last month, JPMorgan Chase \u2014 the nation's largest bank in terms of deposits \u2014 announced it intends to invest $1.5 trillion over the next decade to support \"industries critical to national economic security and resiliency,\" including critical minerals, defense technology and artificial intelligence. That represents a 50% increase from the $1 trillion in investments it had planned, the company said.",
      "Mr. Trump often uses Wall Street as one barometer for his handling of the economy. In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" that aired earlier this month, he touted a recent S&P 500 record.",
      "\"We're doing really well, and everybody knows it,\" he said.",
      "But some in the business community have chafed at the president's policies. Stocks plunged in April when Mr. Trump unveiled hefty tariffs on dozens of countries. Though markets have recovered since then, many economists worry the tariffs could lead to higher prices and slower economic growth.",
      "His pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates could also clash with Wall Street's strong preference for an independent Fed, and Mr. Trump has faced pushback from the pro-business Chamber of Commerce over a plan to charge hefty fees for high-skilled worker visas.",
      "Mr. Trump's relationship with Dimon, who has helmed JPMorgan Chase since before the 2008 financial crisis, has gone through a couple of rough patches. In 2023, Mr. Trump called Dimon a \"Highly overrated Globalist,\" after he talked up Mr. Trump's GOP primary rival, Nikki Haley. But the following year, Mr. Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek he had \"a lot of respect for Jamie Dimon.\"",
      "Dimon cautioned in April that Mr. Trump's tariffs could slow economic growth, but told CNBC three months later that the tariffs had been \"greatly moderated.\" He also supported the tax provisions in the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Earlier this year, Dimon told \"60 Minutes\" he understood why Mr. Trump won in 2024, and believed people had \"legitimate concerns\" about issues like immigration. He said that \"people wanted kind of more pro-growth and pro-business policies, that they didn't want to be lectured to on social policies continuously.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump signed an executive order earlier this year directing federal regulators to combat alleged \"debanking\" of conservatives by financial institutions, that is, the refusal of banking services on the basis of \"political affiliations, religious beliefs or lawful business activities,\" according to the order.",
      "JPMorgan Chase reported this month that it was \"responding to requests from government authorities\" regarding its internal policies.",

      "Americans may soon be paying more for their favorite Italian pasta brands \u2014 or even have trouble finding imported spaghetti \u2014 as the Trump administration eyes a new import duty on 13 of Italy's largest pasta exporters.",
      "The proposal, published by the Commerce Department in September, would add a new 92% antidumping duty after a U.S. government probe\u00a0found\u00a0that some Italian pasta brands, including La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, were selling their products below U.S. market prices. Combined with the existing 15% tariff on European Union imports, the total duties on Italian-made pasta could rise to 107%.",
      "That would represent one of the Trump administration's highest import duty rates on any product, according to the Wall Street Journal, which earlier\u00a0reported\u00a0on the pasta dispute.",
      "If the anti-dumping duty goes into effect, the impact on American consumers would be substantial, according to Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru. Some Italian pasta makers may simply stop exporting their products to the U.S., while others might raise their prices, he added.",

Even if both 30- and 50-year loans carried the same 6.25% rate \u2014 which experts say is unlikely \u2014 borrowers choosing the longer term would save only about $250 a month, Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS News.",
      "In reality, rates on 50-year mortgages would probably run higher than 30-year loans, meaning those monthly savings could shrink even further, he added.",
      "Yet total interest on that same 50-year loan would accrue to about $816,000, almost double the $438,000 in interest paid over a 30-year term, he calculated.",
      "At the same time, buyers with a 50-year mortgage would build equity far more slowly than those with shorter loans, Wood noted. That's because a larger share of early payments goes toward interest, leaving less to chip away at the principal.",
      "\"Paying down the loan over so much time could also mean building equity at an incredibly slow pace,\" she said.",
      "Addressing the affordability crisis",
      "The 50-year mortgage proposal aims to spur housing demand at a time when many Americans are priced out of the market by high mortgage rates and soaring home values, Berner noted.",
      "The typical homeowner now spends 39% of their income on housing, well above the 30% affordability threshold recommended by financial experts, according to Redfin.",
      "Mortgage rates have eased this year but remain above 6%, more than double the pandemic-era lows. Meanwhile, home prices, though slightly down from their peak, averaged $410,800 in the second quarter, about 25% higher than in early 2020, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "While 15-year mortgages are also available, most homebuyers opt for 30-year loans because the terms allow them to spread out payments over a longer timeframe, lowering monthly costs,\u00a0according to the personal finance website  Bankrate.",
      "The Federal Housing Finance Agency said it is \"evaluating all options to address housing affordability,\" including making mortgages assumable or portable. A White House official added that \"President Trump is always exploring new ways to improve housing affordability for everyday Americans.\"",
      "What about the interest rate on a 50-year loan?",
      "A half-century mortgage would give Americans an even longer window to pay back their loan, but experts say the monthly savings would be relatively modest because interest rates for 50-year loans would likely be higher than for 30-year terms.",
      "That's because lenders view longer time frames as carrying higher risks of default, notes NerdWallet's Wood. Likewise, rates for 15-year mortgages are generally lower than for 30-year loans because lenders view the shorter timeframe as less risky.",
      "The typical 15-year loan today has an interest rate of about 5.6%, according to Bankrate, versus about 6.25% for the 30-year loan.",
      "Extending loan terms could lift buyer demand, but that might push home prices even higher unless more housing is built, Berner added \u2014 erasing any benefit from lower monthly payments.",
      "\"This is not the best way to solve housing affordability,\" Berner said.",
      "Mr. Trump defended the 50-year mortgage in a Fox News\u00a0interview\u00a0on Monday after host Laura Ingraham questioned the president over criticisms of the plan. Ingraham noted that some in his MAGA base argue the proposal would benefit banks while making it take longer for Americans to fully own their homes.",
      "\"It's not even a big deal,\" Mr. Trump said in response. \"You go from 40 to 50 years, and what it means is you pay something less.\"",

    "summary": "After Sonder said it was shutting down, one guest told CBS News he returned to his short-term rental to find his luggage in the hallway.",
    "story": [
      "Sonder, a short-term rental company and former Airbnb rival, abruptly went out of business after Marriott ended its licensing deal on Nov. 9 \u2014 leaving guests scrambling as they were told to vacate their rooms immediately, according to accounts shared with CBS News and on\u00a0social media.",
      "Paul Strack, 63, visiting Boston from Little Rock, Arkansas, told CBS News he received an email from Marriott on Sunday about his Sonder stay, but he initially mistook it for a scam. The email said that Marriott's agreement with Sonder had ended, and that \"we are unable to continue your reservation beyond today.\"",
      "\"[W]e are kindly requesting that you check out of the property as soon as you are able,\" the email read, according to a copy obtained by CBS News.",
      "Because he had mistaken it for spam, he ignored it. But on Monday, after exploring Boston and returning to the family's accommodation at the end of the day, Strack found his room's door wide open and his family's belongings packed up and left in a hallway.",
      "\"Even our dirty clothes and toiletries were packed up, and our laptops were in plastic bags,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Sonder on Monday said\u00a0it would wind down operations immediately, and that it expects to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy to liquidate its U.S. assets. The company describes itself as a global operator of \"premium, design-forward apartments and intimate boutique hotels serving the modern traveler\" that has faced financial challenges related to its agreement with Marriott, which the hotel chain terminated on Sunday.",
      "\"We are devastated to reach a point where a liquidation is the only viable path forward,\" Janice Sears, interim chief executive officer of Sonder said in a statement Monday. \"Unfortunately, our integration with Marriott International was substantially delayed due to unexpected challenges in aligning our technology frameworks, resulting in significant, unanticipated integration costs, as well as a sharp decline in revenue arising from Sonder's participation in Marriott's Bonvoy reservation system.\"",
      "\"We explored all viable alternatives to avoid this outcome, but we are left with no choice other than to proceed with an immediate wind-down of our operations and liquidation of our assets,\" she added.",
      "Strack, who said he'd booked Sonder residences in the past, and until recently had enjoyed the experiences, was frustrated by his subsequent interactions with Marriott personnel, which he called \"not helpful.\"",
      "Marriott did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on its communications with Sonder guests after ending the partnership.",
      "Marriott recommended he stay at a nearby property for the remainder of the family's stay, according to Strack, which he estimated would have cost around $700 a night.",
      "Ultimately, the family spent their final night in Boston in the room that they had been kicked out of.",

    "story": [
      "Wendy's plans to close hundreds of U.S. restaurants in the coming months as revenue and profits decline, with the company citing cutbacks by lower-income consumers that it expects will persist through year's end.",
      "On a Friday investor call, Ken Cook, Wendy's interim CEO, didn't disclose the exact number or locations of restaurants that it plans to shutter. But he said the Dublin, Ohio-based company is likely to close in the \"mid-single digit percentage\" of its 6,011 U.S locations, or roughly 300 store closures if it shuts 5% of its existing restaurants.",
      "Wendy's said the closures will start in the fourth quarter this year. Closing underperforming locations will improve traffic and profitability at its remaining U.S. restaurants, Cook added.",
      "Fast-food chains have been struggling to lift sales as lower-income consumers feel increasingly squeezed by rising food costs. Both Wendy's and McDonald's have introduced value meals to entice diners, but Cook said he doesn't expect the financial strain on these households to ease soon.",
      "\"We do see more pressure on the lower-income consumer,\" he said Friday. \"We continued to see that in [the third quarter] and we expect that to continue into the fourth.\"",
      "The new round of closures comes on top of the closure of 240 U.S. Wendy's locations in 2024. At the time, Wendy's said that many of the 55-year-old chain's restaurants are simply out of date.",
      "Cook became Wendy's CEO in July after the company's previous CEO, Kirk Tanner, left to become the president and CEO of Hershey Co.",
      "Cook said in some cases, Wendy's will make improvements to struggling stores, including adding technology or equipment. In other cases, it will transfer ownership to a different operator or close the restaurant altogether.",
      "\"When we look at the system today, we have some restaurants that do not elevate the brand and are a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective. The goal is to address and fix those restaurants,\" Cook said during a conference call with investors.",
      "In the first nine months of this year, Wendy's said its U.S. same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, fell 4% compared to the same period last year. Wendy's revenue fell 2% to $1.63 billion in the same period, while its net income fell 6% to $138.6 million.",
      "Cook said $5 and $8 meal deals \u2014 which have been matched by McDonald's \u2014 have helped bring some traffic back to its U.S. stores. But Wendy's isn't doing a good job of bringing in new customers, Cook said, so the company plans to shift its marketing to emphasize its value and the freshness of its ingredients.",

    "story": [
      "An outbreak of botulism tied to ByHeart baby formula has made at least 15 infants sick in 12 states, a California health official said Monday. The company announced Tuesday that it is expanding its voluntary recall to include all products while the investigation continues.",
      "Nine cases of infant botulism type A have been confirmed, with results on six others pending, said Dr. Erica Pan, health officer for the California Department of Public Health. That's an increase from 13 cases in 10 states reported on Saturday.",
      "Federal and state officials are investigating the outbreak, which began in mid-August. No deaths have been reported.",
      "ByHeart, a maker of organic baby formula based in New York, initially recalled two lots of its Whole Nutrition Infant Formula over the weekend. It has now expanded that recall to include all batches of ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula cans and Anywhere Packs nationwide.",
      "\"The safety and well\u2011being of every infant who uses our formula is, and always will be, our highest priority,\" Mia Funt, co\u2011founder and president of ByHeart, said in a statement. \"This nationwide recall reflects our commitment to protecting babies and giving families clear, actionable information. Alongside this recall, we are conducting a comprehensive investigation to do our part to get the answers parents expect and deserve.\"",
      "\"Consumers in possession of this product should stop using it immediately,\" California officials said.",
      "Here's what to know about the outbreak and infant botulism",
      "The outbreak has sickened babies aged 2 weeks to 5 months since mid-August. The infants were hospitalized after consuming ByHeart powdered formula, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "California officials confirmed that a sample from an open can of ByHeart baby formula fed to an infant who fell ill contained the type of bacteria that causes the toxin linked to the outbreak. The tests to confirm contamination involve injecting mice with the cultured bacterium and then waiting up to four days to see if they get sick.",
      "\"These mice got sick really quickly,\" Pan said in an interview.",
      "ByHeart officials called for testing of unopened cans of formula. \"Testing unopened cans will provide reliable evidence that will help bring clarity to families who are understandably concerned,\" the company said in a statement Monday.",
      "At least 84 babies in the U.S. have been treated for botulism since August, California officials said. That includes those confirmed to have been fed ByHeart formula. The FDA is investigating whether any of the others are also linked to the same baby formula.",
      "Infant botulism typically affects fewer than 200 babies in the U.S. each year. It is caused by a type of bacterium that produces a toxin in the large intestine. The bacterium is spread through hardy spores present in the environment that can cause serious illness, including paralysis.",
      "Infants younger than 1 are particularly vulnerable to infection because their gut microbiomes are not developed enough to prevent the spores from germinating and producing the toxin. They can be sickened after exposure to the spores in dust, dirt or water or by eating contaminated honey.",
      "Symptoms can take weeks to develop and can include poor feeding, loss of head control, drooping eyelids and a flat facial expression. Babies may feel \"floppy\" and can have problems swallowing or breathing.",
      "No known outbreaks of infant botulism tied to powdered formula have previously been confirmed, said Dr. Steven Abrams, a University of Texas nutrition expert.",
      "\"This would be extremely rare,\" he said.",
      "The only treatment is known as BabyBIG, an IV medication made from the pooled blood plasma of adults immunized against botulism. California's Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program developed the product and is the sole source worldwide.",
      "BabyBIG works to shorten hospital stays and decrease the severity of illness in babies with botulism. Because the infection can affect the ability to breathe, infants often need to be placed on ventilators.",
      "All of the children in the ByHeart outbreak have received the medication, the CDC said. The treatment is delivered in vials that cost $69,300 apiece, Pan said.",
      "There is little danger of infant formula shortages because of this outbreak. ByHeart, which was founded in 2016, accounts for an estimated 1% of national formula sales, according to the CDC. The company sells formula through its website and in retail stores nationwide.",
      "That's far different from the crises in late 2021 and 2022, when four infants were sickened by a different germ after consuming formula made by Abbott Nutrition. Two of the babies died. No direct link was found between the Abbott products and the infections caused by cronobacter sakazakii, but FDA officials closed the company's Michigan plant after contamination and other problems were detected.",
      "Abbott's recall involved top-selling brands of infant formula, triggering a massive nationwide shortage that lasted months.",
      "In 2022, ByHeart recalled five batches of infant formula after a sample at the company's packaging plant tested positive for cronobacter sakazakii, the germ at the heart of the Abbott crisis. In 2023, the FDA sent a warning letter to the company detailing \"areas that still require corrective actions.\"",
      "Federal health officials have vowed to overhaul the U.S. food supply and are taking a new look at infant formula.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has directed the FDA to review the nutrients and other ingredients in infant formula, which fills the bottles of millions of American babies.",
      "The effort, dubbed \"Operation Stork Speed,\" is the first deep look at the ingredients since 1998.",

    "story": [
      "Turkeys aren't known for flying but their prices are soaring ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A September outlook report from the United States Agriculture Department estimates that wholesale prices for frozen turkeys will be $1.32 per pound this year, a 40% increase from 2024's\u00a0average of $0.94 per pound.",
      "The wholesale price is what retailers pay to buy items in bulk. Retailers then decide how much they want to charge consumers.",
      "The reason the birds \u2014 traditionally the centerpiece at the Thanksgiving table \u2014 are getting more expensive comes down to supply. The number of available turkeys has shrunk in recent years amid slightly weakened demand and avian flu outbreaks, according to USDA\u00a0data.",
      "More than 3 million turkeys have been impacted by bird flu outbreaks this year, including over half a million this month alone, USDA data shows.",
      "That translates to fewer turkeys: USDA forecasts that farmers raised around 195 million turkeys in 2025 compared with 200 million in 2024, a 3% decrease. To be sure, the number of turkeys in supply has been sliding over the last decade. In 2016, farmers raised around 245 million turkeys, roughly 50 million more than today's supply.",
      "Deals abound",
      "Amid the rise in wholesale turkey prices, several companies are floating deals in an attempt to win over budget-conscious customers.",
      "Walmart announced Tuesday that it is offering Butterball turkeys for $0.97 per pound this year. The retailer also said its 10-person meal deal will cost under $4 per person. Grocery chain Aldi has\u00a0offered a similar deal, at $40 for 10 people.",
      "\"Retailers typically use turkeys as a loss leader,\" David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University, told CBS News. \"That is, they price them very competitively \u2014 sometimes even below cost \u2014 to draw shoppers into stores ahead of Thanksgiving.\"",
      "Both deals represent a decrease in the average cost for a Thanksgiving meal from 2024, which was $58 for 10 people, according to a\u00a0report from the American Farm Bureau Federation. Frozen turkeys that year accounted for a large share of Americans' holiday grocery bill, at an average retail cost of $25 for a 16-pound bird.",
      "Despite the surge in wholesale turkey prices in 2025, Bernt Nelson, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation\u00a0 doesn't expect consumer prices to increase much.",
      "\"We see that uptick right now in the wholesale price by about 40%, so we'll definitely see some price increases there, but I don't think they're going to go a whole lot higher above where they are at,\" he said on a Farm Bureau podcast.",
      "\"Higher wholesale prices for turkeys are likely to translate into somewhat higher prices at the grocery store, but the increase consumers see will probably be smaller than what's happening upstream,\" Ortega explained.",
      "In other welcome news for shoppers, CBS News' price tracker shows that prices for Thanksgiving dinner ingredients like butter, milk and potatoes haven't budged much compared with prices the same time last year.",

      "Veterans Day is here, the holiday celebrated annually to honor Americans who have served in the military.",
      "The history of Veterans Day dates back to 1919, when President Woodrow Wilson set Nov. 11 that year as the first commemoration of Armistice Day after World War I. In 1956, Congress voted to change the name of the holiday from \"Armistice Day\" to \"Veterans Day\" to honor all veterans of all U.S. wars, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.",

      "Yes, U.S. financial markets are open on Nov. 11, as the\u00a0Nasdaq\u00a0and\u00a0New York Stock Exchange do not observe Veterans Day as a holiday. The stock market will next close on Thanksgiving Day, which falls on Nov. 27 this year.",

    "summary": "The three emails appear to be exchanges between convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as the author Michael Wolff and Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democrats on the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday released emails exchanged between Jeffrey Epstein and others about President Trump.",
      "Among the documents is a 2011 message from Epstein to Ghislaine Maxwell, his longtime associate, that said Mr. Trump \"spent hours at my house\" with one of Epstein's victims, whose name is redacted. In another email in 2019 to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote, \"Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.\"",
      "Maxwell\u00a0was convicted of conspiring in Epstein's sex trafficking ring and is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Wolff has written several books about Mr. Trump.",
      "House Democrats said the emails were turned over by Epstein's estate, which they said released more than 23,000 documents that lawmakers are now reviewing. The full Oversight Committee also released more than 20,000 pages of records from Epstein's estate Wednesday and claimed Democrats \"cherry-pick\" from the material \"to generate clickbait.\" The latest batch includes emails, records from court proceedings, transcripts from depositions, press clippings and other material.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously said he cut ties with Epstein years ago, and he has not been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Democrats of selectively leaking emails to \"create a fake narrative\" to harm Mr. Trump. She said the unnamed victim in the emails is the late Virginia Giuffre, who met Epstein in the summer of 2000, just before she turned 17,\u00a0while working at the spa\u00a0at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's South Florida club. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April,\u00a0had not accused the president of any wrongdoing. She said in her memoir that Mr. Trump \"couldn't have been friendlier,\" when she met him in his office.",
      "\"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,\" Leavitt said in a statement. \"These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump's historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again.\"",
      "CBS has not independently verified the emails.",
      "In one of the messages from Epstein to Maxwell, dated April 2, 2011, the late financier wrote, \"i want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump. [Victim 1] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.\"",
      "Maxwell then replies, \"I have been thinking about that\u2026\"",
      "In a second email that appears to be from Epstein to Wolff, dated Jan. 31, 2019, Epstein references a victim, whose name is redacted, and mentions Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's South Florida resort.",
      "\"Trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever. of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" the message from Epstein reads.",
      "In the third exchange released by House Democrats, which appears to be between Epstein and Wolff, Wolff writes on Dec. 15, 2015, \"I hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you\u2013either on air or in scrum afterwards.\"",
      "According to the email exchange, Epstein then replies, \"if we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\" Wolff responds, \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt. Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his first run for the White House in June 2015 and would have been on the campaign trail when the emails between Wolff and Epstein were exchanged.",
      "Wolff authored a book about the first few months of Mr. Trump's first term in office, titled \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\" that was released in 2018.",
      "In an Instagram post on Wednesday, Wolff acknowledged there were email exchanges between him and Epstein, and said \"perhaps we're getting close to the smoking gun\" between Epstein and Mr. Trump.",
      "Wolff also spoke on the Daily Beast podcast about his correspondence with Epstein, saying there were recorded conversations between them. \"I've discussed many, many places, there are hours and hours, upwards of 100 hours of Jeffrey Epstein talking about many things, but many hours of him talking about Donald Trump and his relationship to Donald Trump,\" Wolff said.",
      "White House spokesperson Steven Cheung on Thursday said Wolff \"routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Epstein were friends for years and ran in the same social circles in New York and Florida from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. But the president said they had a falling out around 2004, more than a decade before Epstein was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019.",
      "Epstein had separately reached a deal with federal prosecutors in Florida in 2008, in which he agreed to plead guilty to two state prostitution charges and serve an 18-month prison sentence.",
      "Epstein died by suicide at a Manhattan correctional facility while awaiting trial.",
      "Congress to vote on release of more Epstein files",
      "The new release comes amid a push for more transparency on the Epstein files in Congress.",
      "The newest House member, Democrat Adelita Grijalva, was sworn in Wednesday after a 7-week delay, becoming the final signature needed on a discharge petition to circumvent House GOP leaders and force a vote on a measure to compel the Justice Department to release all of the files from its investigation into Epstein. Speaker Mike Johnson said it would be brought to a vote on the House floor next week.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0claimed\u00a0on social media Wednesday that the \"Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects. Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap.\"",
      "\"There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our Country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!\" the president wrote.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, urged the Justice Department in a statement Wednesday to make the Epstein files public \"immediately,\" pledging that the panel \"will continue pushing for answers and will not stop until we get justice for the victims.\"",
      "\"The more Donald Trump tries to cover up the Epstein files, the more we uncover,\" Garcia said. \"These latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the President.\"",
      "Several tranches of records have been turned over to congressional investigators, including from Epstein's estate. The House Oversight Committee has also sought information from a slew of former attorneys general and FBI directors, as well as former President Bill Clinton.",
      "Lawmakers have also questioned Alex Acosta, who was the U.S. attorney in South Florida when prosecutors investigated Epstein in the 2000s and reached the nonprosecution agreement with him.",
      "Acosta went on to serve as Labor secretary during Mr. Trump's first term but resigned in 2019 amid questions about his handling of Epstein's case.",

    "summary": "Most senators whose phone records were obtained by investigators in special counsel Jack Smith's office said they won't seek damages under a new law that allows senators to sue for $500,000.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Most of the Republican senators whose phone records were obtained by investigators as part of special counsel Jack Smith's 2020 election probe said they won't seek damages under a new law that allows senators to sue for $500,000 if their data is unknowingly seized.",
      "The provision was tucked into an appropriations bill that passed as part of the legislative package to end the government shutdown. It allows senators to seek monetary damages if federal law enforcement obtains their data without meeting strict notification requirements, and applies retroactively to 2022.",
      "The new law came in response to GOP senators' release of an FBI document in October that showed investigators obtained records in 2023 about phone calls that eight senators and one House member made in the days surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. The revelation infuriated Republican senators, who said the Justice Department under the Biden administration was targeting GOP lawmakers for political purposes with the investigation, dubbed Arctic Frost.",
      "According to the FBI document, the agency collected \"limited toll records.\" Toll records include information like which numbers participated in a call and how long it lasted, but not the actual contents of the conversation.",
      "In an Oct. 21\u00a0letter to lawmakers, attorneys for Smith defended his actions as \"entirely lawful, proper and consistent with established Department of Justice policy.\" Smith's lawyers have also previously said he would like to testify publicly about the two Trump investigations he oversaw.",
      "The provision in the shutdown deal requires service providers to notify Senate offices and the Senate sergeant at arms if federal law enforcement requests data from the lawmakers' offices, with some exceptions if the senators are targets of criminal investigations. Senators can pursue damages of $500,000 if law enforcement seeks an order blocking notification or if the data is obtained without notice.",
      "Proponents of the legislation have argued that the steep penalty is necessary to deter future abuses by the executive branch, framing the law as a way to protect the Senate as an institution.",
      "But the prospect of senators reaping a windfall of taxpayer money under legislative language they inserted at the last minute angered many House Republicans, who said they felt blindsided. House Speaker Mike Johnson said the lower chamber would fast-track a bill to repeal the lawsuit provision, calling it \"way out of line.\" GOP Rep. Greg Steube of Florida cited the law as his reason for voting against the funding bill, saying it was a \"self-indulgent legal provision for certain senators to enrich themselves.\"",
      "But most of the senators whose phone records were searched are saying they will not be seeking damages under the law.",
      "The eight senators whose records were seized in 2023 are Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama.",
      "Five of them \u2014 Hagerty, Blackburn, Johnson, Hawley and Sullivan \u2014 indicated on Thursday that they have no plans to pursue compensation.",
      "\"I am for accountability for Jack Smith and everyone complicit in this abuse of power. I do not want and I am not seeking damages for myself paid for with taxpayer dollars,\" Hagerty wrote in a post on X, adding that he believes Smith \"should be in jail.\"",
      "Blackburn said in a statement to CBS News that she would \"support the effort to reverse\" the language in the bill if it comes before the Senate.",
      "\"This fight is not about the money; it is about holding the left accountable for the worst weaponization of government in our nation's history,\" Blackburn said. \"If leftist politicians can go after President Trump and sitting members of Congress, they will not hesitate to go after American citizens.\"",
      "Blackburn\u00a0said in late October that she would be taking legal action against the Justice Department over the phone records. But a spokesperson said Thursday that her plan \"has always been to seek a declaratory judgment \u2014 not monetary damages \u2014 to prevent leftists from violating the constitutional rights of conservatives.\"",
      "Asked if he would seek damages for the phone records search, Johnson said in a statement to CBS News: \"I have no plans at this time. If I did sue, it would only be for the purpose of using the courts to expose the corrupt weaponization of federal law enforcement by the Biden and Obama administrations. With the full cooperation in our congressional investigations from the Trump DOJ and FBI, that shouldn't be necessary.\"",
      "Hawley called the revelations over the phone records \"outrageous\" but said that he prefers other avenues of accountability.",
      "\"I think the Senate provision is a bad idea,\" he said in a statement. \"There needs to be accountability for the Biden DOJ's outrageous abuse of the separation of powers, but the right way to do that is through public hearings, tough oversight, including of the complicit telecomm companies, and prosecution where warranted.\"",
      "Sullivan's office said the Alaska Republican \"first learned about this provision when he and his staff were reading the bill to reopen the government.\"",
      "\"He does not plan on suing and is supportive of the House bill to repeal the provision,\" the statement from Sullivan's office said.",
      "At least one senator whose records were seized indicated that he plans to seek monetary damages under the law. Graham told reporters in South Carolina on Wednesday that he is \"going to pursue, through the court system, remedies.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Nov 2025 18:40:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton of Arkansas told CBS News the threat is \"severe and growing.\"",
    "story": [
      "Unauthorized drone flights over U.S. military installations, border facilities and mass public events are climbing to unprecedented levels, prompting warnings from top lawmakers that the country faces an escalating aerial security risk while it remains hamstrung by a patchwork of airspace protection capabilities.",
      "Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, said in an interview with CBS News this week that the threat to military sites and large civilian gatherings \"is severe and growing.\" He cited evidence of persistent drone incursions and gaps in law enforcement authorities, many of which lapsed for weeks during the record-long government shutdown.",
      "There were more than 350 unauthorized drone flights over about 100 military installations in 2024, according to the Defense Department, and government data shows there were more than 27,000 drones detected within 500 meters of the U.S. southern border in the last half of that year.",
      "And while the number of stadium incursions waned slightly last year, the overall trend is continuing to move upward, according to NFL data, with drone incursions almost doubling, from 1,300 to 2,300, between 2021 and 2024.",
      "Some of the incursions may be the fault of hobbyists or unwitting individuals, Cotton said, but inexpensive drone technologies have also proliferated across criminal organizations and non-state actors, raising the risks of mass-casualty attacks.",
      "\"It could be\u2026unwittingly probing to see what the responses are \u2013 and responses have not been particularly strong, given these legal limitations,\" he said of some drone overflights of sensitive U.S. military installations. Citing classification concerns, Cotton, who also sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, declined to comment on how many overflights may have a connection to a foreign government, or which foreign governments may be involved.",
      "U.S. security officials have previously issued public warnings that drone incursions near military bases, energy facilities and other critical infrastructure pose surveillance risks. Many of them may be traced to foreign-made or unidentified systems capable of collecting imagery or signals intelligence. The threat underscores legal holes in detection and authority as drone activity increasingly probes sensitive American airspace \u2013 potentially, some officials have warned, in preparation for kinetic attacks.",
      "The coordinated drone strikes by Ukraine deep inside Russian territory on June 1 - known as Operation Spider's Web \u2014 showed in dramatic fashion how relatively inexpensive unmanned systems can reach far-flung military targets. The operation reportedly deployed 117 drones to strike more than 40 Russian aircraft and caused approximately $7 billion in damage.",
      "This example has been widely cited in U.S. security policy circles as a harbinger of how drone overflights or strikes might one day be carried out against U.S. or allied installations if defenses are not modernized, and authorities are not made more coherent.",
      "Defense officials say many U.S. military bases, for example, aren't authorized under current law to deploy defensive counter-drone systems. In February, at a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, commander of both U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, testified that only about half of U.S. military installations qualify as \"covered\" sites, which are authorized to intercept drones that pose security threats.",
      "And while a handful of federal entities \u2014 including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Energy and Justice \u2014 are currently authorized to detect, track, or disable drones, state and local agencies remain largely powerless even when drones threaten civilian sites, including airports or stadiums.",
      "Cotton pointed to the rise in drone activity over major sporting venues as evidence of the broader vulnerability of civilian targets, with heightened risks expected around the Olympics and World Cup \u2013 both set to be hosted by the U.S. next year.",
      "A sports industry security official confirmed in a phone interview with CBS News that the threat to civilian targets at mass gatherings from drone overflights is \"real and it's increasing.\"",
      "\"The vast majority are the clueless or the careless,\" the official said, referring to drone operators who ignore or misunderstand temporary flight restrictions over stadiums and arenas. \"But there are also cases where the drone operator has acted very aggressively and evaded detection,\" the official said, estimating there are about \"a dozen\" such cases each year.",
      "\"Thankfully, just by luck, we haven't had something bad happen \u2014 whether an accident where somebody crashes their drone into fans, or whether they weaponize a drone and drop something dangerous into a stadium,\" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive security considerations.",
      "While no mass-casualty or payload-delivery plot targeting a U.S. sporting event has ever been publicly confirmed, security officials say that the volume and frequency of incursions make it more plausible.",
      "Cotton, along with bipartisan co-sponsors, is backing two measures aimed at closing enforcement gaps. The first, co-sponsored by Democratic Senator Jacky Rosen of Nevada, is the DEFENSE Act, which would allow trained state and local law enforcement officers to detect, track and disable hostile drones at large public gatherings. The second measure, the COUNTER Act, is co-sponsored by New York Democratic senator Kirsten Gillibrand and expands the definition of a covered site to allow more American bases to track and neutralize drones.",
      "If Congress does not act urgently to match its laws to the evolving threat, Cotton warned, the U.S. may find it's reacting after a catastrophic event, rather than being prepared before one occurs. And while the federal government is now funded through January 30, the next major funding showdown is already looming.",
      "That means critical airspace protection authorities \"remain in place until the end of January \u2013 a week before the Super Bowl is going to be played,\" Cotton said.\u00a0 \"I think we should try to make those authorities permanent, not just so it's not hostage to government funding anymore, but so DHS, working with other federal agencies, can be more certain in what it can plan for and train for.\"",

In the letter, lawyers working for Mr. Trump alleged that the Oct. 28, 2024, episode of the network's \"Panorama\" documentary program, which was produced by an external production company, sought to mislead viewers by editing together three separate sections of the speech made by Mr. Trump.",
      "\"BBC Chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the Corporation are sorry for the edit of the President's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" the BBC Press Office said in its statement Thursday. \"The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms.\"",

      "The official, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, has leveled similar accusations against several other officials, including Democrats New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Sen. Adam Schiff, and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.",
      "James was indicted on one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution last month and pleaded not guilty. James' attorneys have argued the case is politically motivated, saying the administration is targeting her for her role in bringing civil fraud charges against President Trump in New York.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in August after Pulte accused her of making misrepresentations on mortgage documents. But Cook filed a lawsuit arguing her removal was unlawful, and the Supreme Court will hear arguments in January on whether Mr. Trump can fire her from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",

      "\"As the most vocal critic of Donald Trump over the last decade and as the only person who still has a surviving lawsuit against him, the only thing I am surprised about is that it took him this long to come after me,\" he said in a statement. \"Like James Comey and John Bolton, Adam Schiff and Lisa Cook, Letitia James and the dozens more to come \u2014 I refuse to live in fear in what was once the freest country in the world.\"",
      "Swalwell filed a civil lawsuit against Mr. Trump in March 2021 over his actions relating to the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. In the suit, the California Democrat accuses the president of inciting the violence at the Capitol with his tweets and speech outside the White House on the morning of Jan. 6, in violation of federal civil rights laws and D.C. law.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 With the government shutdown finally in the rearview mirror, the focus in the Senate is turning to an upcoming fight over health care, with Democrats hoping to regroup after splintering in the final stages of the showdown.",
      "Eight Senate Democrats broke ranks to reach a deal with Republicans to end the shutdown, dashing the party's effort to win an extension of expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits in return for their vote to reopen the government. Now, Democrats face a quick timeline to shift their strategy.",
      "As part of the deal, Democrats secured a promise to hold a vote next month on the tax credits, which help millions of Americans pay for health insurance premiums for plans purchased on state exchanges. And while Democrats have pledged to continue the fight, exactly what that looks like, and whether it could find enough support to pass, remains to be seen.",
      "\"What we have to make sure of now is that the health care fight lives outside of the appropriations process and doesn't depend entirely on the government being shut down,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told reporters earlier this week. \"So now we have a fight in front of us.\"",
      "Reaching consensus on health care",
      "Senate Democrats must now weigh their approach. With the promise of a vote on legislation of their choosing, they have an opportunity to try to chart a bipartisan path forward, with the option of forcing Republicans to take a politically perilous vote if a deal fails to materialize.",
      "In recent days, Democrats have said they see signs of bipartisan interest in addressing health care costs. A handful of moderate Republicans have expressed openness to a tax-credit extension, albeit with some reforms. Any bill would need 60 votes to pass in the Senate.",
      "Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, said on Monday that she's \"talked to so many of my Republican colleagues who want to do something here \u2014 who want to keep health care costs down for their constituents.\" But when Baldwin sought to amend the funding package to include a one-year extension of the ACA tax credits, the vote didn't pick up GOP support. Days earlier, when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would reopen the government if Republicans agreed to a one-year extension of the health insurance tax credits, Republicans likewise rejected the offer.",
      "But with the shutdown behind them, Republicans have expressed willingness to negotiate on the health care issue. And Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters this week that he sees a bipartisan path forward, noting that any extension of the tax credits \"obviously \u2026 can't be without reforms.\"",
      "\"But my expectation is at some point, the president is going to be very inclined to want to do something to make health care more affordable in this country,\" Thune said. \"So if there is a willingness on the part of Democrats to work with Republicans to deal with the unaffordability of Obamacare in its current form, then there might be an opportunity to do something bipartisan.\"",
      "Thune has said that a number of Republicans are already engaged in conversations on the health care issue or have a high level of interest. He pointed to Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas, a physician, as someone with expertise on the issue, along with Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Mike Crapo of Idaho and Rick Scott of Florida, who lead the relevant committees.",
      "\"So there are a number of them that have already started to work on some things, and there are already some discussions going on with folks on the other side of the aisle about what might be a path forward,\" Thune said. \"We'll see where it lands.\"",
      "Similarly, Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, said she supports an extension of the ACA tax credits, \"but they need reform,\" she said, citing specifically a need for caps on the income of those who are eligible for them.",
      "Collins said there are other ideas that have been raised by Republicans on reforming the ACA to make health insurance more affordable, pointing to pledges from Crapo and Cassidy to hold hearings on the issue and Thune's commitment to bring up a vote.",
      "But other parts of the conference seem to be eyeing a different approach.",
      "A Republican split",
      "The efforts to find bipartisan consensus on the tax credits were complicated by President Trump's criticism of the Affordable Care Act in recent days. He urged Republicans to take bolder action by overhauling Obamacare and redirect funds from insurance companies straight to the American people.",
      "Republicans have heavily criticized the Affordable Care Act since it became law in 2010. But last weekend, following a flurry of posts from the president on Truth Social, a number of GOP senators spent hours railing against the Affordable Care Act on the Senate floor, while some expressed support for broader changes to the health insurance industry.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close ally of the president, touted Mr. Trump's call to overhaul Obamacare over the weekend, congratulating the president for getting \"into the game,\" saying \"he's given us a pathway forward. I am going to heed his advice and counsel.\"",
      "Graham said Mr. Trump would \"like to sit down and see if we can come up with a better solution.\"",
      "Democrats pledge to continue the fight",
      "Even if some version of an extension does pass the Senate, House Speaker Mike Johnson has not committed to bringing it up in the House, where a compromise would likely face stronger headwinds.",
      "And some Senate Democrats have appeared less positive about a bipartisan solution, though they pledged to continue the fight to lower health care costs.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray of Washington criticized Republicans for refusing an offer from Democrats for a one-year extension of the ACA tax credits on Monday, saying it's \"truly the most straightforward and common-sense thing we can do for people facing gigantic premium hikes this year.\"",
      "\"Republicans have gone from saying nothing about health care costs all year long to saying 'later, later, later,' even after we are over a week into open enrollment, and wasting every bit of time we had for real negotiations,\" Murray said. \"Then, incredibly, Republicans started saying, let's scrap the Affordable Care Act altogether.\"",
      "Still, she insisted that \"this fight is not over \u2014 far from it \u2014 because I and many of us have no intention of letting Republicans off the hook.\"",
      "\"The reality is, there is a point where it will be too late to make a meaningful difference,\" Murray said. \"But until we reach that point of no return, we do have to fight tooth and nail to force Republicans to actually work with us on that issue.\"",
      "Schumer likewise pledged to keep up the fight on health care, saying it \"will and must continue.\"",
      "\"We will not give up this fight,\" Schumer said. \"We will deliver for the American people.\"",
      "Jaala  Brown\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:39:15 -0500",
    "summary": "Lawyers for James Comey and Letitia James argued their indictments should be dismissed because the appointment of the interim U.S. attorney in Virginia was unlawful.",
    "story": [
      "Alexandria, Va. \u2014 Lawyers for former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James faced off against the Justice Department Thursday before a federal judge, arguing the indictments against them should be dismissed because the appointment of the interim U.S. attorney who brought both cases is unlawful.",
      "Soon after James' arraignment, the court decided to consolidate the arguments for dismissal. Legal teams for both Comey and James argued that Lindsey Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney was invalid and unconstitutional.",
      "The hearing before U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie lasted more than an hour, and the judge said she planned to issue an order before Thanksgiving. Comey was present for the proceeding.",
      "Henry Whitaker, a Justice Department lawyer, told the court that questions about whether Halligan was properly appointed are an effort by Comey and James to \"elevate at best what is a paperwork error,\" and shouldn't doom the indictments against them. He said that under a federal law governing U.S. attorney vacancies, the attorney general has the power to appoint a person to fill that role temporarily for 120 days, and each new appointment triggers its own 120-day clock.",
      "But Ephraim McDowell, who argued on behalf of Comey, said that Halligan's role in the indictment against his client is a \"fundamental defect,\" and he argued that the Senate's advise-and-consent function in approving a president's nominees for U.S. attorney posts around the country \"would be eviscerated\" if Currie sides with the Justice Department. The Trump administration, he said, is attempting an \"end run\" around the Senate's confirmation process.",
      "McDowell noted that Halligan was the sole prosecutor who presented the cases against both Comey and James to grand juries, and only Halligan's signature is on both indictments. He argued that the charges against Comey must be dismissed if Currie finds Halligan's appointment was invalid, and allowing the case to continue poses a threat to the \"fundamental integrity\" of the grand-jury process.",
      "Dismissing the case, and not allowing the Justice Department to file new criminal charges, would \"deter and not reward\" the government for violating the Constitution's Appointments Clause and federal law.",
      "After a review of grand jury proceedings in both cases, Currie said that \"all the evidence\" in her review of the case \"is that Ms. Halligan acted alone\" in securing the indictments.",
      "Currie also questioned the government about what she said was a missing portion of the transcript from the grand jury proceedings and suggested that Attorney General Pam Bondi could not have reviewed the grand-jury proceedings as the attorney general said she had. Currie said that part covers 4:28 p.m. to when the indictment was returned on Sept. 25. It is not clear exactly how long that time period was, but brief proceedings before a U.S. magistrate judge that followed the grand jury's vote to indict Comey began at 6:47 p.m. according to a transcript obtained by CBS News.",
      "The judge said it appears no court reporter was present during that part of Halligan's presentation, so Bondi \"couldn't have\" reviewed all of the material. If a court reporter was in the room, she didn't transcribe that portion, Currie said.",
      "How could the attorney general have ratified Halligan's actions before the grand jury and say she looked at the materials \"when they didn't exist\" in the Justice Department's records, the judge asked.",
      "Whitaker told Currie that Bondi had reviewed the \"material facts.\"",
      "The criminal cases against Comey and James",
      "Halligan was named to the post days after Erik Siebert resigned as acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia amid pressure from President Trump to bring prosecutions against his political foes. Just before Siebert's resignation, sources had told CBS News that prosecutors from the district were concerned he could be removed for not prosecuting James.",
      "Halligan, a former Trump defense lawyer who later joined him in his second administration, was tapped as interim U.S. attorney in September after serving as a senior aide to Mr. Trump in the White House. Halligan, who was previously an insurance lawyer, took the helm of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Alexandria with no prosecutorial experience. Mr. Trump nominated her for U.S. attorney in late September.",
      "Comey was indicted in September on one count of making false statements to Congress and one count of obstruction of justice, related to Senate testimony he gave five years ago. Comey pleaded not guilty to both counts.",
      "James was indicted last month on one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution and pleaded not guilty. The Justice Department alleges James bought a house in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020 with a mortgage that required her to use it as a second home, but instead ultimately rented it to a family and used it as an investment property. The department accuses James of misrepresenting how the house would be used, so she could obtain a lower interest rate.",
      "Sources told CBS News that Halligan presented evidence to the Comey and James grand juries alone, rather than with the line prosecutors who had worked on the cases. She was also the only attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia to sign the indictments. After Halligan became that district's interim U.S. attorney, several prosecutors left the office or were fired.",
      "Since the indictments, lawyers from U.S. Attorneys' Offices in North Carolina and Missouri have joined Halligan in working on the cases involving Comey and James, respectively.",
      "Bondi has used a federal law governing U.S. attorney vacancies to appoint Halligan and several others around the country as the top federal prosecutors in their respective offices. The law limits the term for an interim U.S. attorney to 120 days, after which the district court in that area can either extend that official's term or appoint a new U.S. attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled.",
      "In the case of the Eastern District of Virginia, Bondi tapped Siebert as interim U.S. attorney in January and\u00a0ahead of the 120-day deadline in May, judges of that region voted to keep Siebert in the post. Siebert had also been nominated for the permanent position.",
      "He left the position in September, and though Siebert said he resigned, Mr. Trump wrote on social media, in a Sept. 20 post directed at Bondi, that he had ousted Siebert and praised Halligan as a \"really good lawyer.\" Halligan was sworn in as interim U.S. attorney days later.",
      "Halligan and the 120-day term for interim U.S. attorneys",
      "At the heart of the argument was the 120-day term for interim U.S. attorneys appointed by the attorney general. Comey's lawyers said the clock for a temporary U.S. attorney in Virginia has already wound down, and they assert that the law sets a total 120-day time limit that is tied to the attorney general's initial appointment of an interim U.S. attorney \u2014 which would be Bondi's selection of Siebert in January.",
      "\"The period does not start anew once the 120-day period expires or if a substitute interim U.S. Attorney is appointed before the 120-day period expires,\" they wrote in filings.",
      "Allowing the attorney general to make back-to-back sequential appointments would effectively allow the president to circumvent Senate confirmation and the district court's role, Comey's lawyers wrote in court papers.",
      "Halligan \"was defectively appointed to her office as an interim U.S. Attorney,\" they said. Arguing that \"no properly appointed\" official from the executive branch had obtained the indictment against Comey, his lawyers said \"the indictment is equally a nullity\" and should be dismissed.",
      "Comey's legal team cited in court papers a 2024 decision from a federal judge in South Florida dismissing criminal charges against Mr. Trump that were brought by then-special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was overseeing the case against the president, ruled that the appointment of Smith violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause, and said dismissal of the indictment was the \"only appropriate solution.\"",
      "Mr. Trump faced 40 charges stemming from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents after leaving the White House at the end of his first term. The case ended after he won a second presidential term in November 2024.",
      "In their filing, Comey's lawyers wrote that in the case against Mr. Trump, the court dismissed the indictment \"on Appointments Clause grounds because of a defect in the appointment of the prosecutor who secured the charges.\"",
      "\"Here, the court should dismiss the indictment because of Ms. Halligan's unlawful appointment,\" they wrote. \"When Ms. Halligan secured and signed the indictment in this case, she was exercising power that she 'did not lawfully possess.'\"",
      "James' attorney, Abbe Lowell, is seeking a court order that would block Halligan from supervising the prosecution of James' case and from exercising any other duties as interim U.S. attorney.",
      "Halligan, he wrote, \"had no authority to litigate this case on behalf of the United States.\"",
      "\"[B]ecause this indictment would not have been sought or obtained absent Ms. Halligan's unlawful appointment \u2026 the indictment's flaws cannot be brushed aside as harmless error,\" Lowell wrote. \"This Court must reject the Executive Branch's brazen attempt to sidestep the constitutional and statutory limitations on the appointment of U.S. Attorneys.\"",

      "The Justice Department responded to the motions from Comey and James by arguing that Mr. Trump and Bondi have the authority to appoint an interim U.S. attorney after a previous interim pick has already served the 120-day maximum.",
      "The department said that even if the judge overseeing the challenges sides with Comey and James, Bondi has retroactively appointed Halligan as special attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, which would allow her to conduct criminal and civil proceedings in the district.",
      "The Justice Department submitted to the court an order from Bondi, dated Oct. 31, in which she says she is ratifying Halligan's actions before the grand juries and her signature on indictments returned by the grand jury in both cases, and appoints Halligan special attorney for the Justice Department as of Sept. 22.",
      "\"Even were Ms. Halligan's appointment invalid, the motions to dismiss should be denied,\" Justice Department attorneys wrote. \"While Defendants challenge Ms. Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. Attorney, the actions they challenge do not hinge on her validly holding that particular office.\" The Justice Department also argued that \"any government attorney can present a case to a grand jury or sign an indictment.\"",
      "\"At minimum, any dismissal should be without prejudice to permit the government to seek new indictments now that the Attorney General has cured any arguable flaw in Ms. Halligan's authority to prosecute,\" the Justice Department continued.",
      "They also argued that each appointment to interim U.S. attorney triggers its own 120-day term.",
      "But Lowell argued that if Currie accepts the Justice Department's arguments that Bondi is able to retroactively ratify indictments pursued by lawyers named special attorneys after-the-fact, \"even a person like Steve Bannon or Elon Musk could have brought the indictment and then the attorney general could ratify after.\"",
      "How courts have ruled so far on legality of other temporary U.S. attorney appointments in Trump's second term",
      "The Trump administration has run into issues in other courts that have considered the legality of temporary U.S. attorney appointments during Mr. Trump's second term. In cases involving Alina Habba, the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey, and Sigal Chattah, Nevada's acting U.S. attorney, two judges each ruled they are serving unlawfully. A federal judge in California also issued a similar ruling for the acting U.S. attorney in the Central District of California, Bill Essayli.",
      "In the challenge to Habba's appointment, U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann wrote that under federal law, the attorney general can make appointments of different people to serve as interim U.S. attorneys, \"but for an aggregate term of 120 days.\"",
      "The Justice Department has appealed the decisions involving Habba and Chattah.",
      "Federal judge from South Carolina presides over arguments",
      "Currie, from South Carolina, presided over Thursday's arguments. She was brought into the case because all of the federal judges in the Eastern District of Virginia have a conflict of interest in hearing the arguments because of Halligan's role as head of the prosecutor's office in the district.",
      "Currie was appointed to the federal bench by President Bill Clinton in 1994.",
      "Earlier this month, Currie said in an order that a transcript she requested from prosecutors from Halligan's presentation to the grand jury that voted to indict Comey was incomplete, and \"fails to include remarks made by the indictment signer both before and after the testimony of the sole witness, which remarks were referenced by the indictment signer during the witness's testimony.\"",
      "After the grand jury indictment was returned, a federal magistrate judge expressed confusion and surprise after she received two versions of the indictment.",
      "A majority of the grand jury that reviewed the Comey matter voted not to charge him with one of the three counts presented by prosecutors, according to a form that was signed by the grand jury's foreperson and filed in court. He was indicted on two other counts \u2014 making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding \u2014 after 14 of 23 jurors voted in favor of them, the foreperson told the judge.",
      "But two versions of the indictment were published on the case docket: one with the dropped third count, and one without. The transcript reveals why this occurred.",
      "\"So this has never happened before. I've been handed two documents that are in the Mr. Comey case that are inconsistent with one another,\" the magistrate judge said to Halligan. \"There seems to be a discrepancy. They're both signed by the (grand jury) foreperson.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department on Thursday sued to block new congressional district boundaries approved by California voters last week, joining a court battle that could help determine which party wins control of the House in 2026.",
      "The complaint filed in California federal court targets the new congressional map pushed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in response to a similar Republican-led effort in Texas backed by President Trump. It sets the stage for a high-stakes legal and political fight between the Republican administration and the Democratic governor, who's seen as a likely 2028 presidential contender.",
      "California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 50, a constitutional amendment changing the congressional boundaries to give Democrats a shot at winning five seats now held by Republicans in next year's midterm elections.",
      "The Justice Department is moving to join a case challenging the new map that was brought by the California Republican Party last week. The Trump administration accuses California of racial gerrymandering in violation of the Constitution by using race as a factor to favor Hispanic voters with the new map. It asks a judge to prohibit California from using the new map in any future elections.",
      "\"Race cannot be used as a proxy to advance political interests, but that is precisely what the California General Assembly did with Proposition 50 \u2014 the recent ballot initiative that junked California's pre-existing electoral map in favor of a rush-job rejiggering of California's congressional district lines,\" the lawsuit says. It alleges that the map \"manipulates district lines in the name of bolstering the voting power of Hispanic Californians because of their race.\"",
      "Prop 50 was Newsom's response to Mr. Trump's maneuvers in Texas, where Republicans rejiggered districts in hopes of picking up five seats of their own ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when House control will be on the line.",
      "Democrats need to gain just a handful of seats next year to take control of the chamber, which would imperil Mr. Trump's agenda for the remainder of his term and open the way for congressional investigations into his administration. Republicans currently hold 219 seats, to Democrats' 214.",
      "The showdown between the nation's two most populous states has spread nationally, with Missouri, Ohio and a spray of other states either adopting new district lines to gain partisan advantage or considering doing so.",
      "The national implications of California's ballot measure were clear in both the money it attracted and the high-profile figures who became involved. Tens of millions of dollars flowed into the race, including a $5 million donation to opponents from the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super political action committee tied to House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana.",
      "Former action movie star and Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger opposed it, while former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, appeared in ads supporting it, calling it a \"smart\" approach to counter Republican moves aimed at safeguarding House control.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. government reopened Wednesday, Nov. 12, after a record-breaking 43-day-long shutdown that began Wednesday, Oct. 1, as President Trump and congressional Republicans were unable to avert a lapse in federal funding.",
      "With travel delays looming going into the Thanksgiving holiday and SNAP benefits at risk, seven Democrats and one independent senator who caucuses with Democrats worked out a deal with Republicans on Sunday to advance a spending measure to fund the government. The House took up the measure on Wednesday, and Mr. Trump signed it later that night, ending the 2025 government shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018 and early 2019, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",

The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

      "Republicans brought the funding measure to the Senate floor more than a dozen times over the next 40 days, but it failed to pick up any more Democratic support until Nov. 9, when five more Democrats signed on\u00a0after striking a deal with Republicans. In exchange for funding the government through Jan. 30, the deal included a promise for a future vote on a one-year extension of the ACA tax credits \u2014 with no guarantee of Republican support \u2014 reversing the federal layoffs that the Trump administration implemented during the shutdown and preventing any further cuts in the federal workforce until the end of January.",

      "The pay schedule was laid out in an agency-by-agency projection by the White House's Office of Management and Budget. The memo was first reported by Semafor, and an OMB official confirmed its contents to CBS News.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of essential employees continued working during the shutdown without pay, while nonessential employees were furloughed. Both groups are entitled to back pay for the paychecks they missed while the government was closed.",
      "The administration has a goal of completing its list of backlogged payments by Nov. 19.",
      "Differing dates among agencies are due to different pay schedules and payroll providers, an OMB official said. The official added that the original projected pay dates were supposed to be later, but the White House urged agencies to get checks out \"expeditiously and accurately to not leave anyone waiting longer than necessary.\"",
      "Most of the first post-shutdown paychecks to employees will only include pay from Oct. 1 to Nov. 1. They will be limited to base pay, meaning no bonuses, overtime or benefits. Pay for days after Nov. 1, as well as for overtime or bonuses, will be issued in the next pay period.",
      "Up first are Army and non-Army civilian employees at the Defense Department, as well as staffers at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Energy and Health and Human Services. Their paychecks are projected to be processed on Sunday, Nov. 16. The checks will include base pay and payments for overtime and hazard pay.",
      "More than 150,000 employees at the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, National Science Foundation, Social Security Administration, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Departments of Education, State, Interior and Transportation are expected to get their paychecks on Monday, Nov. 17. This only includes base pay, with corrections set to be made in the next pay cycle.",

These checks cover the entire period of the shutdown, including from Nov. 1 to Nov. 13.",
      "Federal employees going without pay became a major pain point during the Senate's fight over funding the government, and was one of several factors that ultimately pushed eight Senate Democrats to join Republicans to end the stalemate. The package cleared the House on Wednesday evening, and President Trump quickly signed it into law, ending the shutdown.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The longest government shutdown in history came to an end on Wednesday after 43 days and more than a dozen attempts to reopen the government.",
      "Here's how the shutdown started, and eventually came to an end:",
      "A Senate standoff",
      "The standoff began in late September as lawmakers faced a deadline to fund the government by the start of a new fiscal year on Oct. 1. House Republicans passed a short-term funding measure on Sept. 19 to keep the government funded at existing levels until Nov. 21. But with Democratic support needed to move forward with any funding measure in the Senate, the chamber was at an impasse.",
      "The top Democrats in Congress had been pushing since August to meet with GOP leaders and the White House on the funding issue, ramping up their calls to address expiring health care tax credits as the Oct. 1 shutdown deadline drew near.",
      "With few opportunities to exert influence with a GOP-controlled House, Senate and White House, Democrats set out to center health care issues in the funding fight \u2014 setting their sights on the expiring health insurance tax credits as their key demand. The credits, under the Affordable Care Act, help millions of Americans pay for health insurance premiums for plans purchased on state exchanges. Their expiration would mean eye-popping increases in insurance costs for those with ACA plans.",
      "Months earlier, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer faced intense pushback for voting to advance a GOP measure during the last funding fight, increasing the pressure on him to dig in this time around.",
      "Democrats sought to negotiate, introducing a counter-proposal to the House-passed measure to fund the government that included their health care demands. But Republicans remained steadfast in their belief that health care and other issues should be negotiated outside the context of funding the government, and urged Democrats to agree to a \"clean\" temporary funding extension.",
      "Over the course of seven weeks, Republicans and Democrats traded blame for the funding impasse. Senate Republicans put forward the House-passed funding measure for a vote 14 times, seeking to peel off support from Democrats as the caucus remained largely united in their opposition. But throughout it all, member-level bipartisan conversations seeking an offramp were bubbling under the surface.",
      "As the weeks dragged on, the real-world effects of the shutdown began to take their toll, raising the stakes for the continuing stalemate and pushing Democrats to make a deal. Millions of federal workers began missing paychecks, straining those with little savings or no access to credit. Chaos began to emerge at airports after the Trump administration said it would reduce flight traffic amid staffing shortages caused by strained air traffic controllers. And millions of Americans were at risk of losing access to food aid under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.",
      "A bipartisan undercurrent",
      "As early as the first days of the shutdown, a small group of moderate senators began signaling tepid interest in finding a way out at the member level, while leaders refused to engage.",
      "What began as a large bipartisan huddle on the Senate floor would go on to involve a number of senators from across both the Democratic caucus and Republican conference.",
      "The conversations across the aisle ramped up as the shutdown neared the longest on record. Sen. Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican and appropriator, told reporters on Oct. 30 she had spoken with Schumer to \"lay the foundation\" on continued appropriations work. And although Schumer didn't vote for the final deal to end the shutdown, the long-term funding efforts became a key to unlocking an eventual agreement by demonstrating Republicans' willingness to work on the appropriations process on a bipartisan basis.",
      "The contours of the eventual deal began to emerge during the first week of November, with senators discussing an agreement that would fund the government alongside a trio of long-term appropriations bills. In exchange for their support, Democrats would be promised a vote on extending health insurance tax credits that they had demanded.",
      "Britt told reporters on Nov. 4 that she made calls through the prior weekend on the funding package, saying she was hopeful it could be part of what ends the stalemate. Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican involved in the talks, said on the same day that the appropriations package might entice Democrats to \"vote for something other than just simply a continuing resolution\" while providing \"a path forward\" beyond a vote on the health care tax credits. And Democrats involved in the talks generally remained tight-lipped, signaling that things were close.",
      "But the impasse would stretch on for a few more days, after Democrats swept key races in off-year elections. The victories emboldened the holdouts, who argued that voters had given them marching orders not to cave on their health care demands.",
      "Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson made clear that he would not commit to a vote on the health insurance tax credits in the lower chamber. That comment underlined concerns from some Democrats that a future Senate vote on health care, which they were set to receive as part of a deal to reopen the government, would go nowhere.",
      "Still, the shutdown's toll on Americans continued to ratchet up pressure on senators to reach a resolution.",
      "On Nov. 7, Senate Democrats presented an offer to Republicans, saying they would end the government shutdown in exchange for a one-year extension of the health care tax credits and a plan to continue broader talks. But the proposal was swiftly rejected by Republicans as a \"nonstarter,\" as Senate Majority Leader John Thune maintained the position that negotiations on health care could only come after the government reopened.",
      "The long-sought breakthrough",
      "On Nov. 9, the deal to end the shutdown finally came together, with a group of eight Democrats agreeing to advance a funding measure as part of a broader agreement to end the shutdown.",
      "Led by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Sen. Angus King of Maine, the deal they struck with Thune and the White House secured a vote in December on the Affordable Care Act tax credits. The deal attached the trio of full-year funding bills, while restoring food aid at higher levels, and paving the way for a bipartisan appropriations process on other spending bills. And it reversed all government layoffs that occurred during the shutdown, while preventing them for a limited time going forward.",
      "The moderates viewed the deal \u2014 after Republicans leaders refused Schumer's offer \u2014 as the best possible offer they could secure, arguing that continuing the shutdown would only inflict more pain without any hopes of a better deal.",
      "The final turn seemed to come with the provision in the bill that would address the Trump administration's layoffs. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, one of the eight Democrats to back the funding deal, had long called the issue his principal priority in the shutdown fight. And he said he joined the group of Democrats just 48 hours before the deal was announced.",
      "GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma told reporters that the language in the new continuing resolution reversing the layoffs came from the White House. Mullin said the White House told Republicans they were willing to revert the layoffs if it could help win Kaine over.",
      "\"It was the right provision which brought him over, which brought a couple other people over, too,\" Mullin said. \"That's what got it over the finish line.\"",
      "With coordination with the House and White House, the deal was on a glidepath to passage in the lower chamber, and to swiftly secure the president's signature.",
      "The House passed the bill late Wednesday, and Mr. Trump signed it during an Oval Office ceremony hours later. He applauded congressional Republicans and the Democratic senators who voted for the deal, while lashing out at most other Democrats.",
      "\"We're sending a clear message that we will never give in to extortion,\" he said.",

      "The ordeal began in late September, after the GOP-led House\u00a0passed a measure that would have kept the government running through Nov. 21. The bill failed to make it out of the Senate, though, as most Democrats pushed for an extension of expiring health insurance tax credits.",
      "Senate Republicans were unable to garner the support they needed until Monday, when a group of Democrats crossed the aisle and voted to reopen the government until late January in exchange for a separate Senate vote on the health insurance credits. The House passed the bill two days later, also with some Democrats' support, sending it to Mr. Trump's desk.",
      "Here's a look at the government shutdown by the numbers:",
      "14: Number of failed Senate votes on funding the government",
      "Starting in mid-September, the Senate held 14 failed votes to advance the House-passed resolution to fund the government until late November \u2014 keeping the government closed for upward of a month with little movement.",
      "The Senate has 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. Until last weekend, there were as many as 55 votes in favor of funding the government, five short of the 60 needed to move the bill forward.",
      "The Senate requires only a simple majority of 51 votes to pass most legislation. But the Senate's filibuster rule effectively requires nearly all legislation \u2014 including the House's continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government \u2014 to reach a 60-vote threshold first. A single senator may delay a bill during debate by invoking a filibuster, which can only be ended if a supermajority of 60 senators votes to end debate.",
      "Then, on Nov. 9, a deal to end the shutdown finally came together, with a group of seven Democrats and one independent who caucuses with Democrats agreeing to advance a funding measure as part of a broader agreement. On a 15th vote, the\u00a0measure finally advanced with 60 senators voting to end debate. The Senate passed the bill a day later, on Nov. 10.",

      "1: Number of Senate Republicans who opposed the bill",

Jared Golden of Maine, Adam Gray of California, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, Don Davis of North Carolina, Henry Cuellar of Texas and Tom Suozzi of New York.",

But the USDA said last month that funding for the benefits, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, had run out due to the shutdown.",

      "A federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the USDA to use that contingency fund, which the Trump administration appealed. On Nov. 9, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson\u00a0granted a stay on behalf of the court, blocking the lower court's order that the administration transfer some $4 billion from other food security programs to SNAP payments.",

The New York Times reported that the donor is Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and scion to the Mellon family banking fortune.",

      "At least $7 billion: The economic cost of the shutdown",
      "The shutdown was expected to temporarily cut the nation's economic output by billions of dollars as unpaid federal workers curtailed their spending and SNAP benefits were paused, leading to a 1-percentage-point GDP drop if the shutdown lasted four weeks and a 2-point dip if it dragged on for eight weeks, the Congressional Budget Office said in an Oct. 29 estimate.",
      "Much of that decline will be reversed after the government reopens and the spigot of federal spending turns back on \u2014 but not all of it. The GDP would face a sustained drop of $7 billion after a four-week shutdown, $11 billion after six weeks and $14 billion after eight weeks, the CBO said.",
      "This story has been updated to correct the length of the longest previous shutdown; it was 35 days.",

      "The bill, which President Trump signed into law on Wednesday, will keep the government open until Jan. 30. It also reverses federal layoffs during the shutdown, and includes three-year-long funding bills that cover military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Agriculture and FDA; and operations for the legislative branch.",
      "It passed the Senate earlier this week after negotiations between Republicans and eight members of the chamber's Democratic caucus, who voted for the bill in exchange for a promise by the GOP to hold a separate vote on extending expiring health insurance tax credits.",
      "Here's a look at the House Democrats who voted yes:",
      "Jared Golden of Maine",
      "Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, a moderate representing the largely rural northernmost reaches of New England, was the sole House Democrat to vote in favor of a GOP-backed measure in September that would have averted the government shutdown. When the shutdown began last month, he blamed it on \"hardball politics\" by \"far-left groups.\"",
      "In a social media post after Wednesday's vote, he said he \"voted to reopen the government, pay federal workers, and get food assistance and other critical programs up and running again.\"",
      "He also urged lawmakers to \"take immediate action\" to extend the health insurance subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of this year.",
      "\"We still have a window to pass bipartisan legislation to extend these credits,\" he said.",
      "Golden won reelection last year by 0.6 percentage points, or just under 3,000 votes. In the same year, Mr. Trump won in Golden's district by about 9 points. He said last week he will not run for reelection next year, a move he linked in part to the \"unnecessary, harmful\" shutdown.",
      "Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington",
      "Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, who is known for occasionally breaking with her party, said in a statement she \"voted to end this partisan car crash of a shutdown.\"",
      "\"Americans can't afford for their Representatives to get so caught up in landing a partisan win that they abandon their obligation to come together to solve the urgent problems that our nation faces,\" she wrote. \"The last several weeks have been a case study in why most Americans can't stand Congress. None of my friends who rely on SNAP would want to trade their dinner for an ambiguous D.C. beltway 'messaging victory' and I'm glad this ugly scene is in the rearview mirror.\"",
      "She won reelection by 3.8 points last year, after initially getting elected to Congress by an 0.8-point margin in 2022.",
      "Henry Cuellar of Texas",
      "Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, who has represented the Rio Grande Valley for over 20 years, said in a statement that \"Washington's inaction created unnecessary hardship for the communities I represent,\" pointing to disruptions to food aid. He pressed Congress to extend the health insurance tax credits next.",
      "\"The problem is, when Democrats or Republicans think they're winning at the end of a long shutdown, it's the American public that loses,\" Cuellar told NewsNation after the vote.",
      "He won reelection by 5.6 points last year.",
      "Adam Gray of California",
      "Rep. Adam Gray of California explained his vote in an op-ed in the Turlock Journal, a newspaper in his Central Valley congressional district. He said he voted yes because the bill will keep the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funded until the end of September \u2014 preventing any more interruptions to food aid if there's another shutdown.",
      "\"No parent should have to choose between feeding their children and keeping the lights on because someone in Washington thinks chaos is a negotiating tactic,\" he wrote, blaming the Trump administration for \"using vulnerable Americans as political leverage.\"",
      "He later said, \"Is this a perfect deal? No. But lasting policy in this country is not born of hostage\u2011taking. It is born of compromise.\"",
      "He pressed for an extension to health insurance tax credits, but wrote: \"Protecting families from hunger today does not prevent us from lowering health care costs tomorrow.\"",
      "Gray won his first term in Congress by just 187 votes in 2024, after losing by a razor-thin 564 votes two years earlier.",
      "Don Davis of North Carolina",
      "Rep. Don Davis of North Carolina, whose already-competitive district was redrawn this year and made more favorable to Republicans, said an \"increasing number of families have shared with me that they have been suffering daily\" over the course of the shutdown.",
      "He said in a statement he voted for the bill to \"alleviate the suffering,\" and in the hopes that negotiations can take place on extending the health insurance subsidies.",
      "\"While some Washington politicians from both parties have failed rural communities, the battle for healthcare is not over,\" Davis wrote.",
      "Davis won reelection by 1.7 points last year.",

      "Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York said on X after the House vote he's \"relying on the representations of some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, that they want to get something done to extend the Premium Tax Credits.\"",
      "But he added that \"we cannot rely on the White House, which has chosen to make this process needlessly painful,\" noting the interruptions to food aid.",
      "Suozzi won reelection by 3.6 points in November. He previously represented his Long Island district for\u00a0 three terms, left Congress in 2023 to run for governor, and returned to the House in an early 2024 special election to replace the expelled GOP Rep. George Santos.",

      "\"House Democrats are in this fight until we win this fight,\" Jeffries said in an interview with \"CBS Evening News\" anchor John Dickerson. \"This fight is not over for us. We're just getting started.\"",
      "Speaking hours before the House voted Wednesday evening on a bill that would fund the government until late January, Jeffries told CBS News that \"Democrats remain strongly opposed\" to the bill, which passed the Senate with some Democratic support. The House passed it 222 to 209 Wednesday night, with six Democrats breaking with their party to vote yes.",
      "Democrats in both the House and Senate had long pressed for Congress to extend Biden-era enhanced health insurance tax credits in exchange for their votes to reopen the government. The credits are set to expire at the end of the year, which could lead to higher premiums for millions of people who buy insurance on Affordable Care Act exchanges.",
      "But over the weekend, eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus signed onto a bill to reopen the government and approve a trio of full-year spending bills, in exchange for a promise from Senate GOP leadership to hold a vote on the tax credits at some point. House GOP leaders have not committed to holding a vote in the lower chamber.",
      "Asked by Dickerson what he's heard from constituents about the Senate Democrats who voted for that deal, Jeffries said he hasn't heard much, but his constituents do want Democrats to \"keep up the fight, protect the health care of the American people.\"",
      "\"Grocery costs are too high, utility bills and electricity bills are through the roof, and health care costs are way too high,\" said Jeffries. \"We need you to do something about it.\"",
      "The New York Democrat touted a separate bill that would extend the health insurance tax credits for three years.",
      "He said \"we're going to force Republicans to vote on that, if not today, at some point soon,\" referring to his plan to attempt to force a vote using a procedural move called a discharge petition. Jeffries will need several House Republicans to sign the petition, though.",
      "\"Republicans claim that they want to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" he said. \"They'll have an opportunity to do so, since their leadership refuses to do that.\"",
      "Asked if he believes the fight that led to the shutdown was worth it, Jeffries said Republicans were responsible.",

      "Hours before the House voted Wednesday to approve a Senate-passed funding package to end the shutdown, Jeffries was asked by \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor John Dickerson if he found any Republican allies during the 43-day impasse.",
      "The Democratic leader replied: \"Three words \u2014 Marjorie Taylor Greene.\"",
      "\"She's been very clear that this health care crisis is not made up, it's real, Republicans have no health care plan, and that Democrats are correct in fighting to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries continued.",
      "Health insurance played a central role in the shutdown fight. Most Democrats refused to back any deal to fund the government that didn't include an extension of Biden-era tax credits that expanded the subsidies available to Americans who buy their insurance on the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces. If the credits expire, many people who rely on the tax credits could see their premiums double, according to KFF.",
      "The conflict ended after eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus agreed to reopen the government in exchange for a promise from Senate Majority Leader John Thune to hold a separate vote on the tax credits. Most Democrats voted against that deal, which passed in both chambers this week.",
      "Meanwhile, Greene \u2014 an often-pugnacious and controversial Georgia Republican who isn't shy about criticizing Democrats \u2014 has repeatedly lashed out against her party's leadership, accusing them of failing to come up with a plan to deal with the expiring subsidies.",
      "\"Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING,\" she wrote on X last month in a post that noted she's \"not a fan\" of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.",
      "Weeks later, she wrote: \"Apparently I have to go into a SCIF to find out the Republican healthcare plan,\" referring to the secure facilities that government agencies use to handle highly classified documents.",
      "Greene has also criticized Speaker Mike Johnson for keeping the House out of session during the shutdown: \"It's an embarrassment,\" she told \"The View,\" and she pushed Republicans to focus more on addressing the cost of living (\"I see Republicans losing the House if Americans are continuing to go paycheck-to-paycheck,\" she told Semafor).",
      "And she's suggested the Trump administration has focused too much on foreign policy in recent months, leading President Trump to say: \"I don't know what happened to Marjorie \u2014 nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.\"",
      "Over the course of the shutdown, Jeffries and other Democrats have regularly pointed to Greene, citing the hard-right lawmaker's comments on health care to back up their own views. It's an odd alliance, just under five years after House Democrats voted to take away Greene's committee assignments over conspiratorial statements she made before joining Congress.",
      "On Wednesday, Dickerson asked Jeffries how he would've reacted if he were told six months ago that he'd eventually be quoting Greene.",

      "Washington \u2014 An effort to force a House vote on compelling the Justice Department to release materials related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein secured the final signature it needed Wednesday after House Speaker Mike Johnson delayed the swearing-in of a newly elected Democrat for seven weeks.",
      "The effort, known as a discharge petition, defies House GOP leaders, who have opposed putting legislation backed by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky on the floor. Khanna and Massie introduced the measure, titled the Epstein Files Transparency Act, in July as pressure intensified on the Trump administration to release more Epstein-related files.",
      "Their bill, as well as several other endeavors to release the materials, led to the disruption of several committee meetings and stalled floor action on other legislation before the House began its August recess days early.",
      "Massie vowed to keep the Epstein issue a priority and filed a discharge petition upon their return in early September. A discharge petition enables members of the lower chamber to bypass House leadership if they can get a majority of members \u2014 218 \u2014 to sign on.",
      "All House Democrats and four Republicans have added their names. Besides Massie, GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Lauren Boebert of Colorado have signed on. Two special elections in Virginia and Arizona in September provided the final two signatures from Democrats to reach the 218 threshold.",
      "Rep. Adelita Grijalva, who was elected on Sept. 23 to fill the seat of her late father Raul, added her name to the petition on Wednesday, shortly after she was sworn in. She pointed to Epstein survivors in the House gallery who she said were present for her swearing-in.",
      "\"Just this morning, House Democrats released more emails showing that Trump knew more about Epstein's abuses than he previously acknowledged,\" Grijalva said. \"It's past time for Congress to restore its role as a check and balance on this administration and fight for we, the American people.\"",
      "The House has been on break since Sept. 19, when it voted to pass a Republican bill to avert the government shutdown. The House was scheduled to be back in late September, but GOP leaders had extended the break until this week to increase pressure on the Senate to pass a short-term funding measure.",
      "Supporters of the discharge petition interpreted the break as a move to avoid swearing in Grijalva, who had said she would add her name to the petition. Her signature on Wednesday starts the clock on a waiting period of seven legislative days before a member can motion to bring it to the floor. After that, leadership has two legislative days to schedule a vote, putting the timeline for a vote as soon as early December.",
      "But Johnson said Wednesday night he would bypass the seven-day waiting period and put it on the floor next week.",
      "\"We're going to put that on the floor for a full vote next week, as soon as we get back,\" he told reporters.",
      "It's unclear if the Senate would take it up if it clears the House.",
      "\"I believe we're going to get 40, 50 Republicans voting with us on the release,\" Khanna told reporters Wednesday. \"And if we get that kind of overwhelming vote, that's going to push the Senate and it's going to push for a release of the files from the Justice Department.\"",
      "In September, Massie said GOP leaders were in \"full panic\" over the discharge petition and had \"actually threatened\" some of the cosigners \u2014 \"politically, not physically.\"",
      "The bipartisan legislation calls for the release of documents relating to all investigations into Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who has been convicted of sex trafficking. The bill would compel the release of flight logs, travel records, names of individuals and entities referenced in any Epstein case and internal Justice Department communications within 30 days. It would also make public any records \"concerning the destruction, deletion, alteration, misplacement, or concealment of documents, recordings, or electronic data\" related to Epstein and his associates, as well as documentation about his death.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has opposed the legislation, arguing that it does not go far enough to protect victims. He has criticized the discharge petition as \"unnecessary,\" citing the House Oversight Committee's investigation into the Epstein case.",
      "During its investigation, the Oversight Committee has released tens of thousands of Epstein-related records, including a new trove of documents unveiled on Wednesday.",
      "Hours before Grijalva added her signature to the petition, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released emails exchanged between Epstein and others about President Trump.",
      "The emails include a 2011 message from Epstein to Maxwell, his longtime associate, that said Mr. Trump \"spent hours at my house\" with one of Epstein's victims, whose name is redacted. In another email in 2019 to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote, \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has previously said he cut ties with Epstein years ago, and he has not been accused of wrongdoing. The White House said Wednesday that the unnamed victim in the emails is the late Virginia Giuffre, who met Epstein in the summer of 2000, just before she turned 17, while working at the spa at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's South Florida club. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, had not accused the president of any wrongdoing. She said in her memoir that Mr. Trump \"couldn't have been friendlier,\" when she met him in his office in 2000.",
      "Republicans on the committee claimed Democrats \"cherry-pick\" from the Epstein-related materials \"to generate clickbait.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Democrats of selectively leaking emails to \"create a fake narrative\" to harm Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump on Wednesday accused Democrats of using the emails to distract from the government shutdown.",
      "Among the other items previously released was a book Maxwell compiled for Epstein's 50th birthday, which included a letter allegedly signed by Mr. Trump. The president has denied penning the message, which is typed within what appears to be the outline of a woman's body.",
      "Ibrahim  Aksoy\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "The president is hosting some of the nation's top financiers for a White House dinner Wednesday as part of his effort to bring manufacturing back home.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is hosting a private White House dinner Wednesday with some of Wall Street's biggest names, as part of his effort to forge stronger ties with America's business leaders and convince them to invest in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, whose relationship with the president has had its ups and downs, will be attending, as well as Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman, Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone, Morgan Stanley's Ted Pick, BlackRock's Larry Fink and David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, sources familiar with the event planning said.",
      "Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the NYSE, helped organize the dinner, according to the sources. Lynn Martin, the president of the NYSE, will also be attending.",
      "Others who plan to attend the 7:30 p.m. dinner include Citadel founder Ken Griffin, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts co-founder Henry Kravis, Apollo Global Management's Marc Rowan and SoftBank's Masayoshi Son, sources said. NYSE President Lynn Martin will also be in attendance.",
      "Many of those attending have been longtime donors to Mr. Trump, and some, like Son, have announced their companies would make significant investments in the U.S.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick are on the guest list, too.",
      "Bankers have been pitching the administration on handling the IPO for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which will be a major event on Wall Street. Mr. Trump announced in May that he wanted to take the two mortgage giants public, noting at the time that the two had returned to profitability after the government took them over during the 2008 financial crisis. The two entities buy mortgages from lenders and hold them in their portfolios or package them into mortgage-backed securities to be sold.",
      "Fannie and Freddie are not the focus of the dinner, sources said. Instead, Mr. Trump and top administration officials want to discuss affordability, an issue that Americans said was their top concern in the elections last week, where Democrats swept the major races. By Wednesday afternoon, however, the focus of the meeting was still unclear to some attendees, a banking industry source said Wednesday.",
      "In September, the president hosted more than a dozen tech industry tycoons at the White House, including the CEOs of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta. And he's held one-on-one events in the Oval Office with a succession of tech and pharmaceutical executives, often to announce multibillion-dollar manufacturing deals.",
      "Last month, JPMorgan Chase \u2014 the nation's largest bank in terms of deposits \u2014 announced it intends to invest $1.5 trillion over the next decade to support \"industries critical to national economic security and resiliency,\" including critical minerals, defense technology and artificial intelligence. That represents a 50% increase from the $1 trillion in investments it had planned, the company said.",
      "Mr. Trump often uses Wall Street as one barometer for his handling of the economy. In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" that aired earlier this month, he touted a recent S&P 500 record.",
      "\"We're doing really well, and everybody knows it,\" he said.",
      "But some in the business community have chafed at the president's policies. Stocks plunged in April when Mr. Trump unveiled hefty tariffs on dozens of countries. Though markets have recovered since then, many economists worry the tariffs could lead to higher prices and slower economic growth.",
      "His pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates could also clash with Wall Street's strong preference for an independent Fed, and Mr. Trump has faced pushback from the pro-business Chamber of Commerce over a plan to charge hefty fees for high-skilled worker visas.",
      "Mr. Trump's relationship with Dimon, who has helmed JPMorgan Chase since before the 2008 financial crisis, has gone through a couple of rough patches. In 2023, Mr. Trump called Dimon a \"Highly overrated Globalist,\" after he talked up Mr. Trump's GOP primary rival, Nikki Haley. But the following year, Mr. Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek he had \"a lot of respect for Jamie Dimon.\"",
      "Dimon cautioned in April that Mr. Trump's tariffs could slow economic growth, but told CNBC three months later that the tariffs had been \"greatly moderated.\" He also supported the tax provisions in the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Earlier this year, Dimon told \"60 Minutes\" he understood why Mr. Trump won in 2024, and believed people had \"legitimate concerns\" about issues like immigration. He said that \"people wanted kind of more pro-growth and pro-business policies, that they didn't want to be lectured to on social policies continuously.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump signed an executive order earlier this year directing federal regulators to combat alleged \"debanking\" of conservatives by financial institutions, that is, the refusal of banking services on the basis of \"political affiliations, religious beliefs or lawful business activities,\" according to the order.",
      "JPMorgan Chase reported this month that it was \"responding to requests from government authorities\" regarding its internal policies.",

      "Kit Prendergast at the university's School of Molecular and Life Sciences discovered the bee while surveying a critically endangered wildflower in 2019 and was immediately drawn to the insect's unique appearance.",
      "\"The female had these incredible little horns on her face,\" she said.",
      "A fan of the Netflix TV show \"Lucifer,\" she said the name was the perfect fit for the bee's distinctively devilish appearance.",
      "Prendergast said DNA barcoding confirmed the new species didn't match any known bees in DNA databases. She also said the specimens she retrieved did not match any in museum collections.",
      "\"It's the first new member of this bee group to be described in more than 20 years, which really shows how much life we still have to discover,\" Prendergast said.",
      "She added that she hopes the discovery will raise awareness about the number of undiscovered species that could still be out there, especially in areas threatened climate change and mining.",

    "story": [
      "Blue Origin launched its second heavy-lift New Glenn rocket Thursday, putting two small NASA satellites onto a long, looping course to Mars to learn more about how the sun has slowly blown away the red planet's once-thick atmosphere.",
      "The centerpiece of Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos' space ambitions, the towering 321-foot-tall New Glenn rocket's seven methane-burning main engines ignited at 3:55 p.m. ET, majestically pushing the booster skyward atop 3.8 million pounds of thrust.",
      "The launch came three days late due to stormy weather on Earth and in space, where a powerful solar storm buffeted Earth's atmosphere with a torrent of high-energy radiation that could have caused electrical problems with the rocket or its payloads.",
      "The storm had abated by launch time Wednesday, and Blue Origin employees, looking on from viewing sites several miles from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station launch pad, cheered and applauded as the booster climbed skyward, followed moments later by the booming roar of its engines sweeping across the Space Coast.",
      "The New Glenn's maiden flight last January successfully boosted a  Blue Origin payload into orbit, but the reusable first stage failed in  its attempt to reach an offshore landing ship, named after Bezos'  mother Jacklyn.",
      "The 188-foot-tall first stage launched Wednesday,  nicknamed \"Never Tell Me The Odds,\" featured a variety of upgrades to  improve performance. This time around, the big rocket flew itself to an  on-target touchdown, prompting more cheers and applause from Blue Origin  workers.",
      "Much like returning SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets, the larger New Glenn booster will be hauled back to Port Canaveral and, depending on its condition, be refurbished and readied for use on an upcoming New Glenn flight.",
      "The second stage, meanwhile, pressed ahead, carrying out two firings of its twin engines to reach the planned Earth-escape trajectory. Thirty-three minutes after liftoff, the ESCAPADE satellites were released to fly on their own.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley, Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission. The acronym stands for Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers.",
      "The probes were built for UC Berkeley by Rocketlab under a NASA program intended to develop lower-cost, fast-track planetary missions.",
      "ESCAPADE cost $107.4 million, a bargain compared to the cost of more traditional, more sophisticated planetary spacecraft that can cost hundreds of millions to well over a billion dollars each.",
      "The ESCAPADE probes were originally expected to hitch a ride to Mars a few years ago with NASA's Psyche asteroid probe. But for a variety of reasons, the Mars satellites mission ultimately ended up on New Glenn's second flight.",
      "Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "To make Wednesday's New Glenn launch work in 2025, mission planners with Advanced Space LLC came up with an innovative flight plan, one that will take Blue and Gold longer to reach Mars but will enable more flexible trajectories for future missions.",
      "The probes were deployed on a trajectory that will carry them a million miles out, well past the moon's orbit, where they will loiter for the next 11 months before heading back toward Earth.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars.",
      "In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "\"We are using a very flexible ... approach where we go into a loiter orbit around Earth in order to sort of wait until Earth and Mars are lined up correctly in November of next year to go to Mars,\" said Robert Lillis, the principal investigator.",
      "\"This is an exciting, flexible way to get to Mars because in the future ... we could potentially queue up spacecraft using the approach that ESCAPADE is pioneering\" without having to wait for a planetary launch window to open, Lillis said.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",
      "Without a protective global field like Earth's, the Martian atmosphere faces a constant barrage of high-speed electrons and protons blown away from the sun and from dense clouds of charged particles erupting from powerful solar storms.",
      "Working in tandem, first in the same orbit at different distances from each other and then from different altitudes, Blue and Gold will measure how the solar wind and energetic electrons and protons from solar storms interact with the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Data from earlier Mars satellites showed the planet's atmosphere is constantly being stripped by those interactions, but exactly how that happens over time is not fully understood.",
      "\"We really, really want to understand the interaction of the solar wind with Mars better than we do now,\" Lillis said. \"We know that atmospheric escape from Mars is a major driver for the evolution of the Martian climate. We know that Mars at least was episodically warm and wet for a couple billion years, but hasn't been so for about 2 billion years or so. And we think atmospheric escape is a major reason for that.\"",
      "Blue and Gold will provide what amounts to a stereo view of those processes.",
      "\"If you only have one spacecraft, you can either measure what the sun is throwing at Mars, the so-called space weather environment upstream of Mars, or you can measure the conditions close to Mars in its upper atmosphere, where the atmosphere is escaping,\" Lillis said.",
      "\"You can't be in two places at once. But we can, because we have two spacecraft to do this. So we can really get that cause-and-effect at the same time. We've never had that before, and that's really exciting,\" Lillis said.",

    "summary": "A severe geomagnetic storm could cause widespread disruption to infrastructure technology and make northern lights visible for much of the northern half of the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "A severe geomagnetic storm is forecast to hit Earth's magnetic field on Wednesday, which could cause widespread disruption to infrastructure technology and make northern lights visible for much of the northern half of the U.S.",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Tuesday issued a G4, or severe, geomagnetic storm watch in response to recent coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, from the sun. CMEs are huge bubbles of coronal plasma that the sun occasionally ejects, NASA says. The highest geomagnetic storm level is G5, which is considered extreme.",
      "The latest CME was the \"most energetic and fastest of the CMEs\" that erupted in the past few days, NOAA said. It was also associated with one of the strongest solar flares of the current solar cycle. The flare\u00a0peaked around 5 a.m. ET Tuesday and was classified as an R3 or \"strong\" flare, meaning it has the potential to cause major disruptions to high-frequency radio on the sunlit side of Earth and cause low-frequency navigation signal issues.",
      "The severe storm is expected to impact Earth around midday Wednesday, the Space Weather Prediction Center said, although it noted the forecast is \"tough\" and it only had a \"moderate level of certainty\" on the timing.",
      "Another G3, or strong, geomagnetic storm was expected to affect Earth on Thursday, NOAA said.",
      "Northern lights forecast",
      "While the potential geomagnetic storms can cause disruptions to critical communication infrastructure, they could also make the aurora visible as far south as Alabama and in Northern California beginning Tuesday night, NOAA said.",
      "The University of Alaska and Space Weather Prediction Center forecasts say the best chance of seeing the northern lights starts as early as 10 p.m. ET Tuesday and will last until around 1 a.m. Wednesday.",
      "During that time, \"highly active auroral displays\" might be visible in places like Portland, Oregon; Cheyenne, Wyoming, and New York City, the University of Alaska said. The northern lights might also be visible close to the horizon as far south as Oklahoma City and Raleigh, North Carolina, the university said.",
      "In May 2024, a\u00a0powerful coronal mass ejection\u00a0brought the strongest\u00a0geomagnetic storm\u00a0in more than 20 years to Earth. During the CME, multiple X-class solar flares\u00a0were recorded. That storm caused some radio blackouts.",
      "Another strong geomagnetic storm in October 2024\u00a0led to the northern lights\u00a0being visible as far south as Florida and over bright areas like New York City and Chicago.",

    "story": [
      "Anthropic said Thursday that Chinese hackers used its artificial intelligence technology in what the company believes is the first cyberespionage operation largely carried out using AI.",
      "Anthropic said the cybercriminals used its popular chatbot, Claude, to target roughly 30 technology companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government agencies. The hackers used the AI platform to gather usernames and passwords from the companies' databases that they then exploited to steal private data, Anthropic said, while noting that only a \"small number\" of these attacks succeeded.",
      "\"We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention,\" Anthropic said in a statement.",
      "The San Francisco-based company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Anthropic said it began detecting suspicious activity in mid-September. A subsequent investigation by the company revealed that the activity stemmed from an espionage campaign that Anthropic said was likely carried out by a state-sponsored group based in China.",
      "According to the investigation, hackers allegedly duped Claude into thinking it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm and that it was being used for defensive testing. Anthropic also said the cybercriminals sought to hide their tracks by breaking down the attack into small tasks.",
      "Unlike conventional cyberattacks, the operation required minimal human intervention, according to the company. \"The AI made thousands of requests per second, an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match,\" Anthropic said.",
      "Anthropic said it expects AI cyberattacks to grow in scale and sophistication as so-called agents become more widely used for a range of services. AI agents are cheaper than professional hackers and can operate quickly at a larger scale, making them particularly attractive to cybercriminals, MIT Technology Review\u00a0has pointed out.",

      "\"Ninety-seven percent could not distinguish between music entirely generated by AI and human-created music,\" said Deezer in a statement.",

      "Deezer said more than half of the respondents felt uncomfortable at not being able to tell the difference.",
      "Pollsters also asked broader questions about the impact of AI, with 51 percent saying the technology would lead to more low-quality music on streaming platforms and almost two-thirds believing it will lead to a loss of creativity.",
      "\"The survey results clearly show that people care about music and want to know if they're listening to AI or human made tracks or not,\" Deezer CEO Alexis Lanternier said in a statement.",
      "Deezer said there's not only been a surge in AI-generated content being uploaded to its platform, but it's attracting listeners as well.",
      "In January, one in 10 of the tracks streamed each day were completely AI-generated. Ten months later, that percentage has climbed to over one in three, or nearly 40,000 per day.",
      "Eighty percent of survey respondents wanted fully AI-generated music clearly labelled for listeners.",
      "Deezer is the only major music-streaming platform that systematically labels completely AI-generated content for users.",

      "\"These scammers ended up compromising anywhere from 15 [million] to 100 million potential credit cards within the U.S. and impacted, at our current estimates, over a million victims,\" Google's general counsel,   Halimah DeLaine Prado, told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "The parents of at least two babies sickened in an infantile botulism outbreak are suing the makers of the ByHeart baby formula at the heart of a nationwide recall.",
      "Stephen and Yurany Dexter, of Flagstaff, Arizona, said their 4-month-old daughter, Rose, had to be flown by air ambulance to a children's hospital two hours from home and treated for several weeks this summer.",
      "Michael and Hanna Everett, of Richmond, Kentucky, said their daughter, Piper, also 4 months, was rushed to a hospital Nov. 8 with worsening symptoms of the rare and potentially deadly disease.",
      "\"It was just absolutely terrifying,\" Hanna Everett told CBS News in an interview Thursday. \"You know, we just kind of felt like we failed as a parent in some ways.\"",
      "Everett said they were unaware of the recall prior to her daughter consuming the ByHeart formula.",
      "\"She had finished that entire can, literally, the day before the recall,\" Everett said.",
      "The lawsuits, filed in federal courts in two states, allege that the ByHeart formula the babies consumed was defective and that the company was negligent in selling it. They seek financial payment for medical bills, emotional distress and other harm.",
      "\"My hopes right now is that they're able to catch it before their children get too sick, before they have to be on ventilators,\" Everett said.",
      "Both families said they bought the organic formula to provide what they viewed as a natural, healthier alternative to traditional baby formulas, and that they were shocked and angered by the suffering their children endured.",
      "\"I wouldn't guess that a product designed for a helpless, developing human in the United States could cause something this severe,\" said Stephen Dexter, 44.",
      "\"She's so little and you're just helplessly watching this,\" Hanna previously told the Associated Press. \"It was awful.\"",
      "Rose Dexter and Piper Everett are among at least 15 infants in a dozen states who have been sickened in the outbreak that began in August, according to federal and state health officials. No deaths have been reported.",
      "Both received the sole treatment available for botulism in children less than a year old: an IV medication called BabyBIG, made from the blood plasma of people immunized against the neurotoxins that cause the illness.",
      "Investigations into more potential botulism cases are pending after ByHeart, the New York-based formula manufacturer, recalled all of its formula nationwide on Tuesday. At least 84 U.S. babies have been treated for infantile botulism since August, including those in the outbreak, California officials said.",
      "It can take up to 30 days for signs of infantile botulism infection to appear, medical experts said. The symptoms can include drooping eyelids, diminished suck and gag reflexes, and a weak and altered cry, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Children suspected of being sick with infant botulism should get medical attention as soon as possible, the CDC says.",
      "ByHeart sells about 200,000 cans of formula per month. FDA commissioner Marty Makary told CBS News that the company sells about 1% of the baby formula purchased in the U.S., and that there is no risk of a formula shortage due to the recall.",
      "California officials confirmed that a sample from an open can of ByHeart formula fed to an infant who fell ill contained the type of bacteria that can lead to illness.",
      "The lawsuits filed Wednesday could be the first of many legal actions against ByHeart, said Bill Marler, a Seattle food safety lawyer who represents Dexter.",
      "\"This company potentially faces an existential crisis,\" he said.",
      "ByHeart officials didn't respond to questions about the new lawsuits but said they would \"address any legal claims in due course.\"",
      "\"We remain focused on ensuring that families using ByHeart products are aware of the recall and have factual information about steps they should take,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "In a separate statement provided to CBS News Thursday, the company said, \"We express our deepest sympathy to the families currently impacted by the cases of infant botulism.\"",
      "In Rose Dexter's case, she received ByHeart formula within days of her birth in July after breast milk was insufficient, her father said. Stephen Dexter said he went to Whole Foods to find a \"natural option.\"",
      "\"I'm a little concerned with things that are in food that may cause problems,\" he said. \"We do our best to buy something that says it's organic.\"",
      "But Rose, who was healthy at birth, didn't thrive on the formula. She had trouble feeding and was fussy and fretful as she got sicker. On Aug. 31, when she was 8 weeks old, her parents couldn't wake her.",
      "Rose was flown by air ambulance to Phoenix Children's Hospital, where she stayed for nearly two weeks.",
      "Hanna Everett told the AP she used ByHeart to supplement breastfeeding starting when Piper was 6 weeks old.",
      "\"It's supposed to be similar to breast milk,\" she said.",
      "Last weekend, Piper started showing signs of illness. Everett said she became more worried when a friend told her ByHeart had recalled two lots of its Whole Nutrition Infant Formula. When a family member checked the empty cans, they matched the recalled lots.",
      "\"I was like, 'Oh my god, we need to go to the ER,\" Everett recalled to the AP.",
      "At Kentucky Children's Hospital, Piper's condition worsened rapidly. Her pupils stopped dilating correctly and she lost her gag reflex. Her head and arms became limp and floppy.",
      "Doctors immediately ordered doses of the BabyBIG medication, which had to be shipped from California, Hanna said. In the meantime, Piper had to have a feeding tube and IV lines inserted.",
      "In both cases, the babies improved after receiving treatment. Rose went home in September and she no longer requires a feeding tube. Piper went home this week.",

      "House Democrats said the emails were turned over by Epstein's estate, which they said released more than 23,000 documents that lawmakers are now reviewing. The full Oversight Committee also released more than 20,000 pages of records from Epstein's estate Wednesday and claimed Democrats \"cherry-pick\" from the material \"to generate clickbait.\" The latest batch includes emails, records from court proceedings, transcripts from depositions, press clippings and other material.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously said he cut ties with Epstein years ago, and he has not been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Democrats of selectively leaking emails to \"create a fake narrative\" to harm Mr. Trump. She said the unnamed victim in the emails is the late Virginia Giuffre, who met Epstein in the summer of 2000, just before she turned 17,\u00a0while working at the spa\u00a0at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's South Florida club. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April,\u00a0had not accused the president of any wrongdoing. She said in her memoir that Mr. Trump \"couldn't have been friendlier,\" when she met him in his office.",
      "\"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,\" Leavitt said in a statement. \"These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump's historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again.\"",
      "CBS has not independently verified the emails.",
      "In one of the messages from Epstein to Maxwell, dated April 2, 2011, the late financier wrote, \"i want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump. [Victim 1] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.\"",
      "Maxwell then replies, \"I have been thinking about that\u2026\"",
      "In a second email that appears to be from Epstein to Wolff, dated Jan. 31, 2019, Epstein references a victim, whose name is redacted, and mentions Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's South Florida resort.",
      "\"Trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever. of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" the message from Epstein reads.",
      "In the third exchange released by House Democrats, which appears to be between Epstein and Wolff, Wolff writes on Dec. 15, 2015, \"I hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you\u2013either on air or in scrum afterwards.\"",
      "According to the email exchange, Epstein then replies, \"if we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\" Wolff responds, \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt. Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his first run for the White House in June 2015 and would have been on the campaign trail when the emails between Wolff and Epstein were exchanged.",
      "Wolff authored a book about the first few months of Mr. Trump's first term in office, titled \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\" that was released in 2018.",
      "In an Instagram post on Wednesday, Wolff acknowledged there were email exchanges between him and Epstein, and said \"perhaps we're getting close to the smoking gun\" between Epstein and Mr. Trump.",
      "Wolff also spoke on the Daily Beast podcast about his correspondence with Epstein, saying there were recorded conversations between them. \"I've discussed many, many places, there are hours and hours, upwards of 100 hours of Jeffrey Epstein talking about many things, but many hours of him talking about Donald Trump and his relationship to Donald Trump,\" Wolff said.",
      "White House spokesperson Steven Cheung on Thursday said Wolff \"routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Epstein were friends for years and ran in the same social circles in New York and Florida from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. But the president said they had a falling out around 2004, more than a decade before Epstein was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019.",
      "Epstein had separately reached a deal with federal prosecutors in Florida in 2008, in which he agreed to plead guilty to two state prostitution charges and serve an 18-month prison sentence.",
      "Epstein died by suicide at a Manhattan correctional facility while awaiting trial.",
      "Congress to vote on release of more Epstein files",
      "The new release comes amid a push for more transparency on the Epstein files in Congress.",
      "The newest House member, Democrat Adelita Grijalva, was sworn in Wednesday after a 7-week delay, becoming the final signature needed on a discharge petition to circumvent House GOP leaders and force a vote on a measure to compel the Justice Department to release all of the files from its investigation into Epstein. Speaker Mike Johnson said it would be brought to a vote on the House floor next week.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0claimed\u00a0on social media Wednesday that the \"Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects. Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap.\"",
      "\"There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our Country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!\" the president wrote.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, urged the Justice Department in a statement Wednesday to make the Epstein files public \"immediately,\" pledging that the panel \"will continue pushing for answers and will not stop until we get justice for the victims.\"",
      "\"The more Donald Trump tries to cover up the Epstein files, the more we uncover,\" Garcia said. \"These latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the President.\"",
      "Several tranches of records have been turned over to congressional investigators, including from Epstein's estate. The House Oversight Committee has also sought information from a slew of former attorneys general and FBI directors, as well as former President Bill Clinton.",
      "Lawmakers have also questioned Alex Acosta, who was the U.S. attorney in South Florida when prosecutors investigated Epstein in the 2000s and reached the nonprosecution agreement with him.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Most of the Republican senators whose phone records were obtained by investigators as part of special counsel Jack Smith's 2020 election probe said they won't seek damages under a new law that allows senators to sue for $500,000 if their data is unknowingly seized.",
      "The provision was tucked into an appropriations bill that passed as part of the legislative package to end the government shutdown. It allows senators to seek monetary damages if federal law enforcement obtains their data without meeting strict notification requirements, and applies retroactively to 2022.",
      "The new law came in response to GOP senators' release of an FBI document in October that showed investigators obtained records in 2023 about phone calls that eight senators and one House member made in the days surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. The revelation infuriated Republican senators, who said the Justice Department under the Biden administration was targeting GOP lawmakers for political purposes with the investigation, dubbed Arctic Frost.",
      "According to the FBI document, the agency collected \"limited toll records.\" Toll records include information like which numbers participated in a call and how long it lasted, but not the actual contents of the conversation.",
      "In an Oct. 21\u00a0letter to lawmakers, attorneys for Smith defended his actions as \"entirely lawful, proper and consistent with established Department of Justice policy.\" Smith's lawyers have also previously said he would like to testify publicly about the two Trump investigations he oversaw.",
      "The provision in the shutdown deal requires service providers to notify Senate offices and the Senate sergeant at arms if federal law enforcement requests data from the lawmakers' offices, with some exceptions if the senators are targets of criminal investigations. Senators can pursue damages of $500,000 if law enforcement seeks an order blocking notification or if the data is obtained without notice.",
      "Proponents of the legislation have argued that the steep penalty is necessary to deter future abuses by the executive branch, framing the law as a way to protect the Senate as an institution.",
      "But the prospect of senators reaping a windfall of taxpayer money under legislative language they inserted at the last minute angered many House Republicans, who said they felt blindsided. House Speaker Mike Johnson said the lower chamber would fast-track a bill to repeal the lawsuit provision, calling it \"way out of line.\" GOP Rep. Greg Steube of Florida cited the law as his reason for voting against the funding bill, saying it was a \"self-indulgent legal provision for certain senators to enrich themselves.\"",
      "But most of the senators whose phone records were searched are saying they will not be seeking damages under the law.",
      "The eight senators whose records were seized in 2023 are Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama.",
      "Five of them \u2014 Hagerty, Blackburn, Johnson, Hawley and Sullivan \u2014 indicated on Thursday that they have no plans to pursue compensation.",
      "\"I am for accountability for Jack Smith and everyone complicit in this abuse of power. I do not want and I am not seeking damages for myself paid for with taxpayer dollars,\" Hagerty wrote in a post on X, adding that he believes Smith \"should be in jail.\"",
      "Blackburn said in a statement to CBS News that she would \"support the effort to reverse\" the language in the bill if it comes before the Senate.",
      "\"This fight is not about the money; it is about holding the left accountable for the worst weaponization of government in our nation's history,\" Blackburn said. \"If leftist politicians can go after President Trump and sitting members of Congress, they will not hesitate to go after American citizens.\"",
      "Blackburn\u00a0said in late October that she would be taking legal action against the Justice Department over the phone records. But a spokesperson said Thursday that her plan \"has always been to seek a declaratory judgment \u2014 not monetary damages \u2014 to prevent leftists from violating the constitutional rights of conservatives.\"",
      "Asked if he would seek damages for the phone records search, Johnson said in a statement to CBS News: \"I have no plans at this time. If I did sue, it would only be for the purpose of using the courts to expose the corrupt weaponization of federal law enforcement by the Biden and Obama administrations. With the full cooperation in our congressional investigations from the Trump DOJ and FBI, that shouldn't be necessary.\"",
      "Hawley called the revelations over the phone records \"outrageous\" but said that he prefers other avenues of accountability.",
      "\"I think the Senate provision is a bad idea,\" he said in a statement. \"There needs to be accountability for the Biden DOJ's outrageous abuse of the separation of powers, but the right way to do that is through public hearings, tough oversight, including of the complicit telecomm companies, and prosecution where warranted.\"",
      "Sullivan's office said the Alaska Republican \"first learned about this provision when he and his staff were reading the bill to reopen the government.\"",
      "\"He does not plan on suing and is supportive of the House bill to repeal the provision,\" the statement from Sullivan's office said.",
      "At least one senator whose records were seized indicated that he plans to seek monetary damages under the law. Graham told reporters in South Carolina on Wednesday that he is \"going to pursue, through the court system, remedies.\"",
      "\"I'm very much for the idea [that] if you've been wronged there should be a remedy,\" Graham said.",
      "\"Will you be filing a lawsuit?\" a reporter asked.",

      "\"Judge Boasburg who granted the Biden DOJ the authority to spy on the phones of Senators should be IMPEACHED.

    "published": "Thu, 13 Nov 2025 18:40:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton of Arkansas told CBS News the threat is \"severe and growing.\"",
    "story": [
      "Unauthorized drone flights over U.S. military installations, border facilities and mass public events are climbing to unprecedented levels, prompting warnings from top lawmakers that the country faces an escalating aerial security risk while it remains hamstrung by a patchwork of airspace protection capabilities.",
      "Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, said in an interview with CBS News this week that the threat to military sites and large civilian gatherings \"is severe and growing.\" He cited evidence of persistent drone incursions and gaps in law enforcement authorities, many of which lapsed for weeks during the record-long government shutdown.",
      "There were more than 350 unauthorized drone flights over about 100 military installations in 2024, according to the Defense Department, and government data shows there were more than 27,000 drones detected within 500 meters of the U.S. southern border in the last half of that year.",
      "And while the number of stadium incursions waned slightly last year, the overall trend is continuing to move upward, according to NFL data, with drone incursions almost doubling, from 1,300 to 2,300, between 2021 and 2024.",
      "Some of the incursions may be the fault of hobbyists or unwitting individuals, Cotton said, but inexpensive drone technologies have also proliferated across criminal organizations and non-state actors, raising the risks of mass-casualty attacks.",
      "\"It could be\u2026unwittingly probing to see what the responses are \u2013 and responses have not been particularly strong, given these legal limitations,\" he said of some drone overflights of sensitive U.S. military installations. Citing classification concerns, Cotton, who also sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, declined to comment on how many overflights may have a connection to a foreign government, or which foreign governments may be involved.",
      "U.S. security officials have previously issued public warnings that drone incursions near military bases, energy facilities and other critical infrastructure pose surveillance risks. Many of them may be traced to foreign-made or unidentified systems capable of collecting imagery or signals intelligence. The threat underscores legal holes in detection and authority as drone activity increasingly probes sensitive American airspace \u2013 potentially, some officials have warned, in preparation for kinetic attacks.",
      "The coordinated drone strikes by Ukraine deep inside Russian territory on June 1 - known as Operation Spider's Web \u2014 showed in dramatic fashion how relatively inexpensive unmanned systems can reach far-flung military targets. The operation reportedly deployed 117 drones to strike more than 40 Russian aircraft and caused approximately $7 billion in damage.",
      "This example has been widely cited in U.S. security policy circles as a harbinger of how drone overflights or strikes might one day be carried out against U.S. or allied installations if defenses are not modernized, and authorities are not made more coherent.",
      "Defense officials say many U.S. military bases, for example, aren't authorized under current law to deploy defensive counter-drone systems. In February, at a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, commander of both U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, testified that only about half of U.S. military installations qualify as \"covered\" sites, which are authorized to intercept drones that pose security threats.",
      "And while a handful of federal entities \u2014 including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Energy and Justice \u2014 are currently authorized to detect, track, or disable drones, state and local agencies remain largely powerless even when drones threaten civilian sites, including airports or stadiums.",
      "Cotton pointed to the rise in drone activity over major sporting venues as evidence of the broader vulnerability of civilian targets, with heightened risks expected around the Olympics and World Cup \u2013 both set to be hosted by the U.S. next year.",
      "A sports industry security official confirmed in a phone interview with CBS News that the threat to civilian targets at mass gatherings from drone overflights is \"real and it's increasing.\"",
      "\"The vast majority are the clueless or the careless,\" the official said, referring to drone operators who ignore or misunderstand temporary flight restrictions over stadiums and arenas. \"But there are also cases where the drone operator has acted very aggressively and evaded detection,\" the official said, estimating there are about \"a dozen\" such cases each year.",
      "\"Thankfully, just by luck, we haven't had something bad happen \u2014 whether an accident where somebody crashes their drone into fans, or whether they weaponize a drone and drop something dangerous into a stadium,\" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive security considerations.",
      "While no mass-casualty or payload-delivery plot targeting a U.S. sporting event has ever been publicly confirmed, security officials say that the volume and frequency of incursions make it more plausible.",
      "Cotton, along with bipartisan co-sponsors, is backing two measures aimed at closing enforcement gaps. The first, co-sponsored by Democratic Senator Jacky Rosen of Nevada, is the DEFENSE Act, which would allow trained state and local law enforcement officers to detect, track and disable hostile drones at large public gatherings. The second measure, the COUNTER Act, is co-sponsored by New York Democratic senator Kirsten Gillibrand and expands the definition of a covered site to allow more American bases to track and neutralize drones.",
      "If Congress does not act urgently to match its laws to the evolving threat, Cotton warned, the U.S. may find it's reacting after a catastrophic event, rather than being prepared before one occurs. And while the federal government is now funded through January 30, the next major funding showdown is already looming.",
      "That means critical airspace protection authorities \"remain in place until the end of January \u2013 a week before the Super Bowl is going to be played,\" Cotton said.\u00a0 \"I think we should try to make those authorities permanent, not just so it's not hostage to government funding anymore, but so DHS, working with other federal agencies, can be more certain in what it can plan for and train for.\"",

Responding crews stopped the leak, he said, and the airborne chemical had dissipated to a level deemed safe for people to return.",
      "The leaking truck was parked in the lot outside of a Holiday Inn Express hotel, said Weatherford Emergency Manager Mike Karlin at a news conference streamed by CBS affiliate KWTV. When first responders arrived at the scene, they found people in respiratory distress and exiting the hotel, according to the emergency manager.",
      "\"As the event unfolded, we had a large plume of anhydrous ammonia gas spread over a pretty large area,\" Karlin said, estimating that between 500 or 600 people were displaced and staying in makeshift shelters, after being evacuated from the hotel as well as their personal residences. Orefice said the number of evacuees was slightly lower, between 300 and 500, although he acknowledged that the situation at that time remained in flux.",
      "Weatherford Regional Hospital treated approximately 34 people, and five others were airlifted to hospitals in the Oklahoma City area, officials said in a statement Thursday evening. Dozens more were treated at three separate casualty collection points.",
      "Approximately 14 officers were exposed to anhydrous ammonia, with five sustaining chemical burns to their airways, officials said. Many first responders were treated and released at the scene. As of Thursday evening, no fatalities had been reported. Several victims remained in intensive care, while the majority are in stable condition.",
      "Southwest Oklahoma State University, where some evacuees were staying, announced\u00a0that in-person classes would be canceled Thursday because of the ammonia leak.",
      "\"First responders on scene have recommended that all students in SWOSU on-campus housing shelter in place due to the fumes. Students in residence halls should remain indoors, keep windows and doors closed,\" the university said in a statement.\u00a0\u00a0Weatherford Public Schools\u00a0announced\u00a0closures throughout the district as well.",
      "A\u00a0public safety notice issued by the Weatherford Police Department on Thursday morning asked businesses to remain closed and residents of certain neighborhoods to shelter in place until further notice.",
      "Ammonia is a clear, foul-smelling gas or liquid that occurs naturally but is also commonly used in fertilizers and pharmaceutical products, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exposure to normal amounts of ammonia do not harm humans, although higher levels can hurt the eyes, skin, throat and lungs, potentially causing coughing and burns, the health agency says.",

    "story": [
      "The share of Americans reporting trouble affording food is rising this year amid persistently high grocery costs, according to a recent report from Purdue University.",
      "Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to the latest data from Purdue's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "While the prevalence of food insecurity around the U.S. fluctuates month to month, the overall rate had been declining since 2022, when an average of 15.4% of households were food insecure as inflation hit 40-year highs following the pandemic.",
      "Although the pace of inflation has declined since 2022, food insecurity is likely rising because food prices remain far above pre-pandemic levels, according to Poonam Gupta, a research associate at the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"Even though inflation slowed a lot this year, we're nowhere near the amount that we were spending on food even just a couple of years ago,\" she said.",
      "Gupta also said more Americans could struggle to put food on the table in 2026, with an estimated 2.4 million SNAP recipients potentially losing benefits due to new work requirements in the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill signed into law in July by President Trump.",
      "The Purdue researchers define food insecurity as some members of a household at times not being able to afford a balanced meal, as well as occasionally having to skip a meal or eating less for financial reasons.",
      "Purdue's survey has become one of the few remaining national measures of food insecurity, since the U.S. Department of Agriculture canceled its annual Household Food Security survey in September, which had been conducted since 2001.",
      "In scrapping the USDA assessment of food insecurity, the Trump administration said\u00a0in September that the survey was \"redundant, costly, politicized and extraneous.\"",
      "But researchers told CBS News that the government data was widely respected. Craig Gundersen, a Baylor University economics professor who has studied food insecurity for 30 years, called the USDA survey the \"gold standard measure.\"",
      "Joseph Balagtas, director of Purdue's Center for Food Demand Analysis, said the school surveys about 1,200 adults a month, compared to 30,000 people surveyed yearly by the USDA.",
      "Even so, he said, Purdue's findings have generally mirrored federal food security data because participants are asked identical questions and because they use statistical methods to ensure their data is representative of the general population.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration has reached frameworks for reciprocal trade agreements with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador, the White House announced Thursday, although details of the frameworks are still emerging.",
      "The tariff rate for most goods from Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina will continue to be 10%, while Ecuador will remain at 15%, senior administration officials told reporters on a briefing call. But there will be tariff relief on a number of items, particularly those that can't be grown in the U.S. Senior administration officials didn't list those items, nor do the joint statements about the frameworks released by the White House, but one senior administration official anticipated that coffee and bananas from Ecuador, for instance, would see tariff relief.",
      "\"The United States commits to remove its reciprocal tariffs on certain qualifying exports from Ecuador that cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States in sufficient quantities,\" the framework joint statement for Ecuador released by the White House says.",
      "Senior administration officials couldn't provide details on how the trade agreements would affect the cost of goods like coffee, cocoa or bananas, which the U.S. imports from Central and South American nations, although one senior administration official said it would likely have \"positive\" effects.",

    "summary": "Blue Origin, owned by Jeff Bezos, plans to challenge SpaceX with the powerful, partially reusable New Glenn rocket.",
    "story": [
      "Blue Origin launched its second heavy-lift New Glenn rocket Thursday, putting two small NASA satellites onto a long, looping course to Mars to learn more about how the sun has slowly blown away the red planet's once-thick atmosphere.",
      "The centerpiece of Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos' space ambitions, the towering 321-foot-tall New Glenn rocket's seven methane-burning main engines ignited at 3:55 p.m. ET, majestically pushing the booster skyward atop 3.8 million pounds of thrust.",
      "The launch came three days late due to stormy weather on Earth and in space, where a powerful solar storm buffeted Earth's atmosphere with a torrent of high-energy radiation that could have caused electrical problems with the rocket or its payloads.",
      "The storm had abated by launch time Wednesday, and Blue Origin employees, looking on from viewing sites several miles from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station launch pad, cheered and applauded as the booster climbed skyward, followed moments later by the booming roar of its engines sweeping across the Space Coast.",
      "The New Glenn's maiden flight last January successfully boosted a  Blue Origin payload into orbit, but the reusable first stage failed in  its attempt to reach an offshore landing ship, named after Bezos'  mother Jacklyn.",
      "The 188-foot-tall first stage launched Wednesday,  nicknamed \"Never Tell Me The Odds,\" featured a variety of upgrades to  improve performance. This time around, the big rocket flew itself to an  on-target touchdown, prompting more cheers and applause from Blue Origin  workers.",
      "Much like returning SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets, the larger New Glenn booster will be hauled back to Port Canaveral and, depending on its condition, be refurbished and readied for use on an upcoming New Glenn flight.",
      "The second stage, meanwhile, pressed ahead, carrying out two firings of its twin engines to reach the planned Earth-escape trajectory. Thirty-three minutes after liftoff, the ESCAPADE satellites were released to fly on their own.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley, Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission. The acronym stands for Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers.",
      "The probes were built for UC Berkeley by Rocketlab under a NASA program intended to develop lower-cost, fast-track planetary missions.",
      "ESCAPADE cost $107.4 million, a bargain compared to the cost of more traditional, more sophisticated planetary spacecraft that can cost hundreds of millions to well over a billion dollars each.",
      "The ESCAPADE probes were originally expected to hitch a ride to Mars a few years ago with NASA's Psyche asteroid probe. But for a variety of reasons, the Mars satellites mission ultimately ended up on New Glenn's second flight.",
      "Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "To make Wednesday's New Glenn launch work in 2025, mission planners with Advanced Space LLC came up with an innovative flight plan, one that will take Blue and Gold longer to reach Mars but will enable more flexible trajectories for future missions.",
      "The probes were deployed on a trajectory that will carry them a million miles out, well past the moon's orbit, where they will loiter for the next 11 months before heading back toward Earth.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars.",
      "In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "\"We are using a very flexible ... approach where we go into a loiter orbit around Earth in order to sort of wait until Earth and Mars are lined up correctly in November of next year to go to Mars,\" said Robert Lillis, the principal investigator.",
      "\"This is an exciting, flexible way to get to Mars because in the future ... we could potentially queue up spacecraft using the approach that ESCAPADE is pioneering\" without having to wait for a planetary launch window to open, Lillis said.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",
      "Without a protective global field like Earth's, the Martian atmosphere faces a constant barrage of high-speed electrons and protons blown away from the sun and from dense clouds of charged particles erupting from powerful solar storms.",
      "Working in tandem, first in the same orbit at different distances from each other and then from different altitudes, Blue and Gold will measure how the solar wind and energetic electrons and protons from solar storms interact with the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Data from earlier Mars satellites showed the planet's atmosphere is constantly being stripped by those interactions, but exactly how that happens over time is not fully understood.",
      "\"We really, really want to understand the interaction of the solar wind with Mars better than we do now,\" Lillis said. \"We know that atmospheric escape from Mars is a major driver for the evolution of the Martian climate. We know that Mars at least was episodically warm and wet for a couple billion years, but hasn't been so for about 2 billion years or so. And we think atmospheric escape is a major reason for that.\"",
      "Blue and Gold will provide what amounts to a stereo view of those processes.",
      "\"If you only have one spacecraft, you can either measure what the sun is throwing at Mars, the so-called space weather environment upstream of Mars, or you can measure the conditions close to Mars in its upper atmosphere, where the atmosphere is escaping,\" Lillis said.",
      "\"You can't be in two places at once. But we can, because we have two spacecraft to do this. So we can really get that cause-and-effect at the same time. We've never had that before, and that's really exciting,\" Lillis said.",

    "summary": "Clase and his teammate, Luis Ortiz, are both accused of being involved in a \"scheme to rig bets on pitches.\"",
    "story": [
      "Cleveland Guardian's All-Star pitcher Emmanuel Clase was arrested at JFK airport and brought to a Brooklyn courtroom to be arraigned Thursday for his alleged involvement in what prosecutors call a \"scheme to rig bets on pitches thrown during Major League Baseball games.\"",
      "An imposing presence on the mound, Clase showed little emotion in federal court as he entered a not guilty plea, spending much of the proceedings leaning back in his chair with arms folded and at times wiping sweat from his face. When first arriving in court, Clase looked surprised by the size of the crowd in the gallery.",
      "Clase is among the latest athletes implicated in a wide-ranging federal gambling investigation that has spanned across American sports leagues. The arrests highlight a new threat to the integrity of professional sports amid an explosion of legalized betting in the U.S.",
      "The charges against the pitcher were announced Sunday, and include wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery, and money laundering conspiracy. Clase flew to New York on Thursday morning from his native Dominican Republic and was joined in the courtroom by his lawyer, Michael Ferrera, to face the gambling allegations. Clase's wife and young daughter remained out of the country.",
      "U.S. Magistrate Judge Joseph A. Marutollo asked if Clase understood the charges against him, and, after a small sidebar with an interpreter and his attorney, Clase answered in the affirmative.",
      "In a bid to forgo location monitoring, Ferrera noted that Clase agreed to surrender his passport and had returned to the U.S. voluntarily. He was also working to have his wife and daughter join him in the U.S., Ferrera said. But Judge Marutollo remained adamant that Clase's financial status and ties to his home country made location monitoring necessary to curtail the risk of him fleeing. Clase was released on $600,000 bond.",
      "Clase's teammate and co-defendant, fellow pitcher Luis Ortiz, was arraigned in court Wednesday on similar charges. Ortiz appeared solemn and nervous at times, using an interpreter to explain his bail package to him. He was joined in the courtroom by his wife, Susan.",
      "Ortiz, who is also a Dominican national, was released on $500,000 bond and given a location monitoring device to wear until a second party can help secure his bail. The judge also expressed concerns that Ortiz could be considered a flight risk given his wealth and connections to the Dominican Republic.",
      "Ortiz did not respond to questions as he exited the courthouse on Wednesday. Walking arm in arm with his wife, he seemed overwhelmed by the amount of attention the case was gathering.",
      "The two pitchers have been on non-disciplinary leave since July after Major League Baseball opened its investigation into their potential involvement in skewing their pitches to help bettors. That investigation remains ongoing by the league. In a statement earlier this week, MLB announced new restrictions on prop bets wagered on the sport, including wager caps on pitch-level markets at $200.",
      "Chris Georgalis, Ortiz's lawyer, told CBS News that he had \"extensively explained and documented to the government before these charges were brought [that] Luis' payments and other transfers of money between him and individuals in the Dominican Republic were for lawful activities.\"",
      "\"Notably, the indictment completely lacks any alleged evidence connecting Luis to these alleged bettors or demonstrating any purposeful involvement in a scheme,\" Georgalis said.",
      "Seth Zuckerman, a criminal defense attorney and former senior assistant district attorney with the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office, spoke to CBS News about the case and what the defense might do.",
      "\"I think a good defense of these players is, these guys are making millions, and they allegedly got what, $5,000? For pitches like that, that doesn't make sense,\" Zuckerman said.",
      "Zuckerman said that while the government may have evidence from the bank transactions, prosecutors will have the burden of proving the pitchers acted with an intent to deceive.",
      "\"Do they have texts or emails? What evidence is out there that connects them to the gamblers, the people who were making money off of this information?\" he asked.",
      "In statements to CBS News, lawyers for both Guardians pitchers maintained their clients' innocence. Ortiz's lawyer said there are questions regarding the strength of the evidence against his client.",
      "Clase and Ortiz are not the only MLB players to be wrapped up in a sports betting-related scandal. A CBS News analysis found that in the last five years, several players have been suspended or banned for breaking Rule 21, which prohibits players from betting on the sport. In one case, former San Diego Padres shortstop Tucupita Marcano was banned from the league for life, the first player to receive that punishment in nearly a century.",
      "In addition to those cases, there was last year's blockbuster case involving Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani's interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, who pleaded guilty to charges stemming from debts he had accrued betting on professional sports using an illegal bookmaker.",
      "Clase's arrest also comes on the heels of a recent announcement from federal law enforcement officials of a betting scheme allegedly involving NBA player Terry Rozier and coach Chauncey Billups, who were\u00a0arrested a few weeks ago by federal agents.",
      "Clase and Ortiz are due back in court in December for a status conference before District Judge Matsumoto.",

      "\"After a thorough review of the facts and prayerful consideration, I have chosen to accept the Pardon and Parole Board's recommendation to commute Tremane Wood's sentence to life without parole,\" Sitt said in a statement\u00a0Thursday morning. \"This action reflects the same punishment his brother received for their murder of an innocent young man and ensures a severe punishment that keeps a violent offender off the streets forever.\"",
      "Wood was convicted and sentenced to death for the 2001 murder of Ronnie Wipf, a migrant farmworker from Montana, during a botched robbery at an Oklahoma City hotel on New Year's Eve, according to court records. He and his legal representatives maintained Wood's innocence in the murder, saying the inmate was involved in the robbery but not the killing \u2014 which, they say, his brother committed alone.",
      "The brother, Zjaiton Wood, was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for Wipf's murder, court records show, and Tremane Wood's attorneys say he admitted he was responsible. Zjaiton Wood died while incarcerated in 2019,\u00a0The Associated Press\u00a0reported.",
      "\"We are profoundly grateful for the moral courage and leadership Governor Stitt has shown in granting mercy to Tremane,\" said Amanda Bass Castro-Alves, one of Wood's current attorneys, in a statement Thursday. \"This decision honors the wishes of Mr. Wipf's family and the surviving victim, and we hope it allows them a measure of peace.\"",
      "The announcement marked Sitt's second clemency grant since taking office, with the last going to former death row inmate Julius Jones in 2021. Jones' commutation came on the heels of significant public outcry over his case, as people questioned whether or not his conviction for murder was legitimate.",
      "Wood and Jones sought to overturn their death sentences in 2017 with a lawsuit that alleged Oklahoma's capital punishment infrastructure was racist and biased, according to the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Wood's attorneys have argued that he did not receive fair or adequate legal representation at his original trial or subsequent appeals, and has accused the prosecution in that initial case of misconduct, claiming some elements of how they handled it violated Wood's constitutional rights.",
      "The state of Oklahoma has insisted over Wood's last two decades behind bars that he is a dangerous criminal who participated in illegal activities in prison. Wood has admitted to the prison conduct but insisted he did not have a part in Wipf's death.",

      "Air travel disruptions continued Thursday as officials warned that cancellations and delays could persist even after the\u00a0end of the government shutdown. More than 1,000 U.S. flights were canceled as of 5 p.m. ET, according to the tracking site FlightAware.",
      "The Department of Transportation on Wednesday night announced that 6% of scheduled flights at\u00a040 of the nation's busiest airports\u00a0will remain canceled on Thursday, rolling back the initial plan to increase cancellations to 8% on Thursday.",
      "\"I think we'll be back a lot faster than people think,\" Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in an interview Thursday on \"CBS Mornings,\" noting that the last few days have already started getting better.",
      "\"As soon as the Senate deal on Monday got approved, staffing levels almost overnight improved dramatically. So, last couple of days, the only cancellations that Delta had were the government-mandated cancellations ... which is mostly on our smaller planes. And I expect by the weekend we're pretty much going to be full, full steam ahead.\"",
      "Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy also said there has been a decline in air traffic controller callouts since the weekend. He said it's a good sign that airlines may soon be able to resume normal operations.",
      "\"The FAA safety team is encouraged to see our air traffic control staffing surge, and they feel comfortable with pausing the reduction schedule to give us time to review the airspace,\" Duffy said in a statement. \"The data is going to guide what we do because the safety of the American people comes first.\"",
      "Bastian said millions of people planning Thanksgiving travel two weeks from now should have nothing to worry about.",
      "\"Thanksgiving is going to be a great holiday period to travel,\" he said.",
      "Tuesday had\u00a0fewer flight delays and cancellations\u00a0than previous days. Air traffic control towers reported minimal staffing shortages with only 11 staffing triggers, or times when the air traffic controller levels fell below planned minimums, compared to the 81 that occurred on Saturday. On Wednesday, there were four staffing triggers.",
      "But even once the government fully reopens, reversing the flight cuts will not be immediate, Duffy said on Tuesday. The process may happen gradually, as the cuts themselves were phased in, he said. Duffy said he and FAA safety officials would look at relevant data, including pilot complaints, incidents where planes fly too close together, and runway incursions before reversing any of the cuts.",

      "Anthropic said the cybercriminals used its popular chatbot, Claude, to target roughly 30 technology companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government agencies. The hackers used the AI platform to gather usernames and passwords from the companies' databases that they then exploited to steal private data, Anthropic said, while noting that only a \"small number\" of these attacks succeeded.",
      "\"We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention,\" Anthropic said in a statement.",

      "Anthropic said it began detecting suspicious activity in mid-September. A subsequent investigation by the company revealed that the activity stemmed from an espionage campaign that Anthropic said was likely carried out by a state-sponsored group based in China.",
      "According to the investigation, hackers allegedly duped Claude into thinking it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm and that it was being used for defensive testing. Anthropic also said the cybercriminals sought to hide their tracks by breaking down the attack into small tasks.",
      "Unlike conventional cyberattacks, the operation required minimal human intervention, according to the company. \"The AI made thousands of requests per second, an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match,\" Anthropic said.",
      "Anthropic said it expects AI cyberattacks to grow in scale and sophistication as so-called agents become more widely used for a range of services.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 With the government shutdown finally in the rearview mirror, the focus in the Senate is turning to an upcoming fight over health care, with Democrats hoping to regroup after splintering in the final stages of the showdown.",
      "Eight Senate Democrats broke ranks to reach a deal with Republicans to end the shutdown, dashing the party's effort to win an extension of expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits in return for their vote to reopen the government. Now, Democrats face a quick timeline to shift their strategy.",
      "As part of the deal, Democrats secured a promise to hold a vote next month on the tax credits, which help millions of Americans pay for health insurance premiums for plans purchased on state exchanges. And while Democrats have pledged to continue the fight, exactly what that looks like, and whether it could find enough support to pass, remains to be seen.",
      "\"What we have to make sure of now is that the health care fight lives outside of the appropriations process and doesn't depend entirely on the government being shut down,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told reporters earlier this week. \"So now we have a fight in front of us.\"",
      "Reaching consensus on health care",
      "Senate Democrats must now weigh their approach. With the promise of a vote on legislation of their choosing, they have an opportunity to try to chart a bipartisan path forward, with the option of forcing Republicans to take a politically perilous vote if a deal fails to materialize.",
      "In recent days, Democrats have said they see signs of bipartisan interest in addressing health care costs. A handful of moderate Republicans have expressed openness to a tax-credit extension, albeit with some reforms. Any bill would need 60 votes to pass in the Senate.",
      "Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, said on Monday that she's \"talked to so many of my Republican colleagues who want to do something here \u2014 who want to keep health care costs down for their constituents.\" But when Baldwin sought to amend the funding package to include a one-year extension of the ACA tax credits, the vote didn't pick up GOP support. Days earlier, when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would reopen the government if Republicans agreed to a one-year extension of the health insurance tax credits, Republicans likewise rejected the offer.",
      "But with the shutdown behind them, Republicans have expressed willingness to negotiate on the health care issue. And Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters this week that he sees a bipartisan path forward, noting that any extension of the tax credits \"obviously \u2026 can't be without reforms.\"",
      "\"But my expectation is at some point, the president is going to be very inclined to want to do something to make health care more affordable in this country,\" Thune said. \"So if there is a willingness on the part of Democrats to work with Republicans to deal with the unaffordability of Obamacare in its current form, then there might be an opportunity to do something bipartisan.\"",
      "Thune has said that a number of Republicans are already engaged in conversations on the health care issue or have a high level of interest. He pointed to Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas, a physician, as someone with expertise on the issue, along with Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Mike Crapo of Idaho and Rick Scott of Florida, who lead the relevant committees.",
      "\"So there are a number of them that have already started to work on some things, and there are already some discussions going on with folks on the other side of the aisle about what might be a path forward,\" Thune said. \"We'll see where it lands.\"",
      "Similarly, Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, said she supports an extension of the ACA tax credits, \"but they need reform,\" she said, citing specifically a need for caps on the income of those who are eligible for them.",
      "Collins said there are other ideas that have been raised by Republicans on reforming the ACA to make health insurance more affordable, pointing to pledges from Crapo and Cassidy to hold hearings on the issue and Thune's commitment to bring up a vote.",
      "But other parts of the conference seem to be eyeing a different approach.",
      "A Republican split",
      "The efforts to find bipartisan consensus on the tax credits were complicated by President Trump's criticism of the Affordable Care Act in recent days. He urged Republicans to take bolder action by overhauling Obamacare and redirect funds from insurance companies straight to the American people.",
      "Republicans have heavily criticized the Affordable Care Act since it became law in 2010. But last weekend, following a flurry of posts from the president on Truth Social, a number of GOP senators spent hours railing against the Affordable Care Act on the Senate floor, while some expressed support for broader changes to the health insurance industry.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close ally of the president, touted Mr. Trump's call to overhaul Obamacare over the weekend, congratulating the president for getting \"into the game,\" saying \"he's given us a pathway forward. I am going to heed his advice and counsel.\"",
      "Graham said Mr. Trump would \"like to sit down and see if we can come up with a better solution.\"",
      "Democrats pledge to continue the fight",
      "Even if some version of an extension does pass the Senate, House Speaker Mike Johnson has not committed to bringing it up in the House, where a compromise would likely face stronger headwinds.",
      "And some Senate Democrats have appeared less positive about a bipartisan solution, though they pledged to continue the fight to lower health care costs.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray of Washington criticized Republicans for refusing an offer from Democrats for a one-year extension of the ACA tax credits on Monday, saying it's \"truly the most straightforward and common-sense thing we can do for people facing gigantic premium hikes this year.\"",
      "\"Republicans have gone from saying nothing about health care costs all year long to saying 'later, later, later,' even after we are over a week into open enrollment, and wasting every bit of time we had for real negotiations,\" Murray said. \"Then, incredibly, Republicans started saying, let's scrap the Affordable Care Act altogether.\"",
      "Still, she insisted that \"this fight is not over \u2014 far from it \u2014 because I and many of us have no intention of letting Republicans off the hook.\"",
      "\"The reality is, there is a point where it will be too late to make a meaningful difference,\" Murray said. \"But until we reach that point of no return, we do have to fight tooth and nail to force Republicans to actually work with us on that issue.\"",
      "Schumer likewise pledged to keep up the fight on health care, saying it \"will and must continue.\"",
      "\"We will not give up this fight,\" Schumer said. \"We will deliver for the American people.\"",
      "Jaala  Brown\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

However, you'll have to stand out from your job-seeking peers, which these days requires more than simply polishing your resume and sharpening your LinkedIn profile.",

      "She encourages job seekers to spend 70% to 80% of their time networking, versus blasting out resumes and cold applying to posted openings.",
      "Start by making a list of people you know in broad categories, such as through family, high school, college and graduate school, and from past jobs and internships. One way to identify contacts from your past is to go through your own resume or LinkedIn profile.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:39:15 -0500",
    "summary": "Lawyers for James Comey and Letitia James argued their indictments should be dismissed because the appointment of the interim U.S. attorney in Virginia was unlawful.",
    "story": [
      "Alexandria, Va. \u2014 Lawyers for former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James faced off against the Justice Department Thursday before a federal judge, arguing the indictments against them should be dismissed because the appointment of the interim U.S. attorney who brought both cases is unlawful.",
      "Soon after James' arraignment, the court decided to consolidate the arguments for dismissal. Legal teams for both Comey and James argued that Lindsey Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney was invalid and unconstitutional.",
      "The hearing before U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie lasted more than an hour, and the judge said she planned to issue an order before Thanksgiving. Comey was present for the proceeding.",
      "Henry Whitaker, a Justice Department lawyer, told the court that questions about whether Halligan was properly appointed are an effort by Comey and James to \"elevate at best what is a paperwork error,\" and shouldn't doom the indictments against them. He said that under a federal law governing U.S. attorney vacancies, the attorney general has the power to appoint a person to fill that role temporarily for 120 days, and each new appointment triggers its own 120-day clock.",
      "But Ephraim McDowell, who argued on behalf of Comey, said that Halligan's role in the indictment against his client is a \"fundamental defect,\" and he argued that the Senate's advise-and-consent function in approving a president's nominees for U.S. attorney posts around the country \"would be eviscerated\" if Currie sides with the Justice Department. The Trump administration, he said, is attempting an \"end run\" around the Senate's confirmation process.",
      "McDowell noted that Halligan was the sole prosecutor who presented the cases against both Comey and James to grand juries, and only Halligan's signature is on both indictments. He argued that the charges against Comey must be dismissed if Currie finds Halligan's appointment was invalid, and allowing the case to continue poses a threat to the \"fundamental integrity\" of the grand-jury process.",
      "Dismissing the case, and not allowing the Justice Department to file new criminal charges, would \"deter and not reward\" the government for violating the Constitution's Appointments Clause and federal law.",
      "After a review of grand jury proceedings in both cases, Currie said that \"all the evidence\" in her review of the case \"is that Ms. Halligan acted alone\" in securing the indictments.",
      "Currie also questioned the government about what she said was a missing portion of the transcript from the grand jury proceedings and suggested that Attorney General Pam Bondi could not have reviewed the grand-jury proceedings as the attorney general said she had. Currie said that part covers 4:28 p.m. to when the indictment was returned on Sept. 25. It is not clear exactly how long that time period was, but brief proceedings before a U.S. magistrate judge that followed the grand jury's vote to indict Comey began at 6:47 p.m. according to a transcript obtained by CBS News.",
      "The judge said it appears no court reporter was present during that part of Halligan's presentation, so Bondi \"couldn't have\" reviewed all of the material. If a court reporter was in the room, she didn't transcribe that portion, Currie said.",
      "How could the attorney general have ratified Halligan's actions before the grand jury and say she looked at the materials \"when they didn't exist\" in the Justice Department's records, the judge asked.",
      "Whitaker told Currie that Bondi had reviewed the \"material facts.\"",
      "The criminal cases against Comey and James",
      "Halligan was named to the post days after Erik Siebert resigned as acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia amid pressure from President Trump to bring prosecutions against his political foes. Just before Siebert's resignation, sources had told CBS News that prosecutors from the district were concerned he could be removed for not prosecuting James.",
      "Halligan, a former Trump defense lawyer who later joined him in his second administration, was tapped as interim U.S. attorney in September after serving as a senior aide to Mr. Trump in the White House. Halligan, who was previously an insurance lawyer, took the helm of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Alexandria with no prosecutorial experience. Mr. Trump nominated her for U.S. attorney in late September.",
      "Comey was indicted in September on one count of making false statements to Congress and one count of obstruction of justice, related to Senate testimony he gave five years ago. Comey pleaded not guilty to both counts.",
      "James was indicted last month on one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution and pleaded not guilty. The Justice Department alleges James bought a house in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020 with a mortgage that required her to use it as a second home, but instead ultimately rented it to a family and used it as an investment property. The department accuses James of misrepresenting how the house would be used, so she could obtain a lower interest rate.",
      "Sources told CBS News that Halligan presented evidence to the Comey and James grand juries alone, rather than with the line prosecutors who had worked on the cases. She was also the only attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia to sign the indictments. After Halligan became that district's interim U.S. attorney, several prosecutors left the office or were fired.",
      "Since the indictments, lawyers from U.S. Attorneys' Offices in North Carolina and Missouri have joined Halligan in working on the cases involving Comey and James, respectively.",
      "Bondi has used a federal law governing U.S. attorney vacancies to appoint Halligan and several others around the country as the top federal prosecutors in their respective offices. The law limits the term for an interim U.S. attorney to 120 days, after which the district court in that area can either extend that official's term or appoint a new U.S. attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled.",
      "In the case of the Eastern District of Virginia, Bondi tapped Siebert as interim U.S. attorney in January and\u00a0ahead of the 120-day deadline in May, judges of that region voted to keep Siebert in the post. Siebert had also been nominated for the permanent position.",
      "He left the position in September, and though Siebert said he resigned, Mr. Trump wrote on social media, in a Sept. 20 post directed at Bondi, that he had ousted Siebert and praised Halligan as a \"really good lawyer.\" Halligan was sworn in as interim U.S. attorney days later.",
      "Halligan and the 120-day term for interim U.S. attorneys",
      "At the heart of the argument was the 120-day term for interim U.S. attorneys appointed by the attorney general. Comey's lawyers said the clock for a temporary U.S. attorney in Virginia has already wound down, and they assert that the law sets a total 120-day time limit that is tied to the attorney general's initial appointment of an interim U.S. attorney \u2014 which would be Bondi's selection of Siebert in January.",
      "\"The period does not start anew once the 120-day period expires or if a substitute interim U.S. Attorney is appointed before the 120-day period expires,\" they wrote in filings.",
      "Allowing the attorney general to make back-to-back sequential appointments would effectively allow the president to circumvent Senate confirmation and the district court's role, Comey's lawyers wrote in court papers.",
      "Halligan \"was defectively appointed to her office as an interim U.S. Attorney,\" they said. Arguing that \"no properly appointed\" official from the executive branch had obtained the indictment against Comey, his lawyers said \"the indictment is equally a nullity\" and should be dismissed.",
      "Comey's legal team cited in court papers a 2024 decision from a federal judge in South Florida dismissing criminal charges against Mr. Trump that were brought by then-special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was overseeing the case against the president, ruled that the appointment of Smith violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause, and said dismissal of the indictment was the \"only appropriate solution.\"",
      "Mr. Trump faced 40 charges stemming from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents after leaving the White House at the end of his first term. The case ended after he won a second presidential term in November 2024.",
      "In their filing, Comey's lawyers wrote that in the case against Mr. Trump, the court dismissed the indictment \"on Appointments Clause grounds because of a defect in the appointment of the prosecutor who secured the charges.\"",
      "\"Here, the court should dismiss the indictment because of Ms. Halligan's unlawful appointment,\" they wrote. \"When Ms. Halligan secured and signed the indictment in this case, she was exercising power that she 'did not lawfully possess.'\"",
      "James' attorney, Abbe Lowell, is seeking a court order that would block Halligan from supervising the prosecution of James' case and from exercising any other duties as interim U.S. attorney.",
      "Halligan, he wrote, \"had no authority to litigate this case on behalf of the United States.\"",
      "\"[B]ecause this indictment would not have been sought or obtained absent Ms. Halligan's unlawful appointment \u2026 the indictment's flaws cannot be brushed aside as harmless error,\" Lowell wrote. \"This Court must reject the Executive Branch's brazen attempt to sidestep the constitutional and statutory limitations on the appointment of U.S. Attorneys.\"",
      "The Justice Department's arguments",
      "The Justice Department responded to the motions from Comey and James by arguing that Mr. Trump and Bondi have the authority to appoint an interim U.S. attorney after a previous interim pick has already served the 120-day maximum.",
      "The department said that even if the judge overseeing the challenges sides with Comey and James, Bondi has retroactively appointed Halligan as special attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, which would allow her to conduct criminal and civil proceedings in the district.",
      "The Justice Department submitted to the court an order from Bondi, dated Oct. 31, in which she says she is ratifying Halligan's actions before the grand juries and her signature on indictments returned by the grand jury in both cases, and appoints Halligan special attorney for the Justice Department as of Sept. 22.",
      "\"Even were Ms. Halligan's appointment invalid, the motions to dismiss should be denied,\" Justice Department attorneys wrote. \"While Defendants challenge Ms. Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. Attorney, the actions they challenge do not hinge on her validly holding that particular office.\" The Justice Department also argued that \"any government attorney can present a case to a grand jury or sign an indictment.\"",
      "\"At minimum, any dismissal should be without prejudice to permit the government to seek new indictments now that the Attorney General has cured any arguable flaw in Ms. Halligan's authority to prosecute,\" the Justice Department continued.",
      "They also argued that each appointment to interim U.S. attorney triggers its own 120-day term.",
      "But Lowell argued that if Currie accepts the Justice Department's arguments that Bondi is able to retroactively ratify indictments pursued by lawyers named special attorneys after-the-fact, \"even a person like Steve Bannon or Elon Musk could have brought the indictment and then the attorney general could ratify after.\"",
      "How courts have ruled so far on legality of other temporary U.S. attorney appointments in Trump's second term",
      "The Trump administration has run into issues in other courts that have considered the legality of temporary U.S. attorney appointments during Mr. Trump's second term. In cases involving Alina Habba, the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey, and Sigal Chattah, Nevada's acting U.S. attorney, two judges each ruled they are serving unlawfully. A federal judge in California also issued a similar ruling for the acting U.S. attorney in the Central District of California, Bill Essayli.",
      "In the challenge to Habba's appointment, U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann wrote that under federal law, the attorney general can make appointments of different people to serve as interim U.S. attorneys, \"but for an aggregate term of 120 days.\"",
      "The Justice Department has appealed the decisions involving Habba and Chattah.",
      "Federal judge from South Carolina presides over arguments",
      "Currie, from South Carolina, presided over Thursday's arguments. She was brought into the case because all of the federal judges in the Eastern District of Virginia have a conflict of interest in hearing the arguments because of Halligan's role as head of the prosecutor's office in the district.",
      "Currie was appointed to the federal bench by President Bill Clinton in 1994.",
      "Earlier this month, Currie said in an order that a transcript she requested from prosecutors from Halligan's presentation to the grand jury that voted to indict Comey was incomplete, and \"fails to include remarks made by the indictment signer both before and after the testimony of the sole witness, which remarks were referenced by the indictment signer during the witness's testimony.\"",
      "After the grand jury indictment was returned, a federal magistrate judge expressed confusion and surprise after she received two versions of the indictment.",
      "A majority of the grand jury that reviewed the Comey matter voted not to charge him with one of the three counts presented by prosecutors, according to a form that was signed by the grand jury's foreperson and filed in court. He was indicted on two other counts \u2014 making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding \u2014 after 14 of 23 jurors voted in favor of them, the foreperson told the judge.",
      "But two versions of the indictment were published on the case docket: one with the dropped third count, and one without. The transcript reveals why this occurred.",
      "\"So this has never happened before. I've been handed two documents that are in the Mr. Comey case that are inconsistent with one another,\" the magistrate judge said to Halligan. \"There seems to be a discrepancy. They're both signed by the (grand jury) foreperson.\"",

      "Money might not buy you love, but the tab for finding romance online is rising.",
      "The increasing cost of dating apps, matchmaking services and, for those looking for an even bigger edge, love coaching can require singles to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars in pursuit of finding a partner \u2014 and that's before the first date.",
      "Although most apps operate on a so-called \"freemium\" model, upgrades and premium features that dating services claim will your boost success rate can greatly increase expenses. Popular dating apps such as Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, The League and others still offer free versions, but charge users for additional features the companies promise will deliver better experiences \u2014 and more desirable romantic prospects \u2014 as the services look to monetize their platforms.",

      "On Match Group-owned Hinge, for example, upgrading to Hinge+ costs $100 for six months, or $17 a month. That allows users to \"like\" an unlimited number of prospects, see who likes them and be more choosy about prospective matches. Hinge notes that it offers a free membership along with it calls \"cost-effective\" subscriptions.",
      "\"Users are often looking for additional support and efficiency with getting out on dates, and subscriptions empower them with additional tools on their dating journey,\" the company said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "Some dating coaches who help people refine what they're looking for in a partner encourage their clients to upgrade to pricier dating app subscriptions.",

      "Although some might scoff at the concept of paying through the nose in affairs of the heart, Juarez compared shelling out on dating apps to paying for premium service from rideshare companies like Lyft and music streaming services like Spotify.",
      "\"People understand the value of upgrading \u2014 it has infiltrated all areas of life. I am not surprised dating apps have done same thing,\" Juarez said.",
      "Relationship coach Amie Leadingham also acknowledged the paradigm shift that has made more people feel comfortable paying up to make a love connection.",
      "\"I do recommend going to the paid sites over the free sites, because the free sites are full of fake profiles and scammers. When you invest you have more intention, and it shows you're being more serious about online dating,\" Leadingham told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "If you don't pay, \"you're not getting dates\"",
      "For their part, some people who pay for premium dating services say the upgrades are worth it, while also wishing the free offerings were improved.",
      "New York-based entrepreneur Bretton Auerbach, a Harvard University graduate and founder of real estate marketplace Triple.com, has been paying for dating apps for years. When he first started using dating apps, including Tinder, roughly a decade ago, he quickly encountered two challenges: First, it was taking up a lot of his time and second, he was bumping up against limits on how many peoples' profiles he could like.",
      "To save time and meet more people, Auerbach signed up for paid versions of a handful of dating apps and found himself spending around $1,000 per month on paid features. That allowed him to view roughly 100 profiles, which he'd whittle down to a date or two.",
      "\"If you're not paying, you're not getting dates,\" Auerbach said. He compared these features such as \"boosts\" that raise your profile's visibility to \"going into a casino where you buy a bunch of chips, throw them in a slot machine where the wheels spin, and you hope you see someone attractive.",
      "Notably, he also conceded that he's spent \"a lot of money\" on dating apps, and ultimately hasn't found them that useful.",
      "\"The best dating experiences I've had have mostly been through meeting people through my social network,\" Auerbach said.",
      "Bianca Kenworthy, founder and CEO of Pomme Creative, a hospitality consultancy, is a former paid dating app user,who met her husband on Hinge. She upgraded for similar reasons to Auerbach.",
      "\"You need the apps because that's how you meet people now. Our time is precious, and the apps allow you to vet in some ways the person you're meeting up with,\" she said.",
      "Kenworthy thinks the prospects she was shown on Hinge's paid service were better suited for her. \"I understood the potential people were more curated for you, based on an algorithm,\" she explained.",
      "As far as the monthly fee, Kenworthy said it was worth it. \"That's like what a pedicure costs. I was looking for a life partner, and I saw it as a monthly investment that could potentially find me that person.\"",

      "Walt Disney Co. executives on Thursday warned that the company's dispute with YouTube could drag on, leaving subscribers to the Google-owned video platform without access to ABC, ESPN, FX and other programming from the entertainment giant.",
      "Disney channels went dark on YouTube TV on Oct. 30 amid a so-called carriage dispute between the two companies. YouTube\u00a0said in a blog post\u00a0last month that Disney had followed through on a threat to pull its networks \"as a negotiating tactic to force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers.\"",
      "Asked in a Thursday investor call about the ongoing negotiations, Disney Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said that \"these discussions could go for a little while,\" without providing a timeframe or additional details.",
      "\"[W]e care deeply about our consumer,\" Disney CEO Robert Iger said in the call. \"And our priority has always been to remain on their service without interruption to close a deal on a timely basis so that interruption does not occur. The deal that we have proposed is equal to or better than what other large distributors have already agreed to.\"",
      "What are carriage fees?",
      "Providers of pay-TV services like YouTube TV pay carriage fees to network owners, including Disney, for the right to broadcast their channels. Disputes over the fees are common, with content providers often at loggerheads with TV networks over commercial terms when their deals expire.",
      "The conflicts sometimes result in viewers losing access to a company's channels or content if the negotiations extend beyond the end of a contract.",

    "summary": "This year is expected to see capital punishment carried out more often than any other year since 2009. Experts weigh in on the increase.",
    "story": [
      "Executions are on the rise in the United States. After creeping upward since the coronavirus pandemic, when the country's use of the death penalty reached a historic low, the numbers have skyrocketed this year.",
      "Forty-one executions have been carried out so far in 2025, and, without intervention from government officials or the courts, another five will take place before January. Three were scheduled for this week: one each in Florida and\u00a0Oklahoma\u00a0on Thursday, and another in\u00a0South Carolina on Friday. But only two seemed poised to move forward after Oklahoma's governor commuted the sentence of the inmate condemned in his state.",
      "Identifying a previous year in which the prevalence of executions in the U.S. rivaled the current one requires looking back at least decade. Whether or not the remaining five proceed as planned, the death penalty has already had its busiest year since 2012, when 43 people were executed. The last time 46 executions took place over a single 12-month period was 2010.",
      "Criminal justice experts say the factors driving this year's increase are multifaceted, although they cite partisan pressure and the ripple effects of expired moratoriums as key contributors. There also is a lack of evidence suggesting citizen support for capital punishment has anything to do with it.",
      "\"A political effort\"",
      "Robin Maher, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, attributes the growing sum of executions to \"largely, a political effort.\" Her nonprofit organization is recognized among the nation's leading sources of data and analyses on how capital punishment is applied, but it doesn't take a position on the issue.",
      "\"The number of executions is certainly garnering some headlines right now because it does represent an increase from where we were in years' past, but there's absolutely no evidence it represents a change in public support for the death penalty by Americans,\" Maher said.",
      "Polling data suggests cultural attitudes nationwide have shifted away from backing the death penalty over the last half-century, with the October results of a Gallup survey showing just 52% of respondents favored the practice. Those results followed a steady decline in Americans' support for capital punishment since the early 1990s, according to Gallup's earlier polls, and they also marked a slight drop in support from 2024.",
      "At the same time, both the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Death Penalty Information Center have tracked a dramatic decrease in new death sentences imposed by American juries since an annual peak in 1996, when 316 death sentences were imposed. Three years later, the U.S. executed 98 people, a record high in the modern history of the death penalty.",
      "Juries have sentence far fewer people to death each year \u2014 as of August, only 10 people have received death sentences in 2025,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Death Penalty Information Center \u2014 and the execution rate has generally mirrored that decline since the late 90s. After hitting a trough during the pandemic, executions did start taking place more often year to year, with 11 in 2021, 18 in 2022, 24 in 2023, and 25 in 2024.",

      "President Trump issued an executive order upon retaking office that encouraged attorneys general and district attorneys in states across the country to pursue the death penalty more aggressively, especially if an undocumented person is charged with a capital offense or a law enforcement officer has been killed.",
      "The order described capital punishment as \"an essential tool for deterring and punishing those who would commit the most heinous crimes,\" and claimed its application \"continues to enjoy broad popular support.\" A number of studies have refuted or at least cast doubt on the theory that the threat of capital punishment meaningfully deters violence. Others have found the overall body of research on the topic to be inconclusive either way.",
      "Mr. Trump's order also said politicians and judges who oppose capital punishment \"have defied and subverted the laws of our country,\" using former President Joe Biden's decision to commute the sentences of most inmates on federal death row as an example of actions that the administration \"will not tolerate.\"",
      "The executive order came amid a broader backdrop of advocacy for the use of capital punishment under the Trump administration. After ending a 17-year hiatus on federal executions during the last six months of his first term, when he oversaw 13 of them, Mr. Trump more recently pledged to refill federal death row and seek the death penalty for murder cases\u00a0in Washington, D.C. Pam Bondi, his attorney general, has also prioritized reviving the federal death penalty.",
      "\"This administration has talked a lot about the death penalty and has not made any secret about their enthusiasm over the death penalty,\" Maher said. \"So, for some officials, that environment has made it easier for them to schedule executions to curry favor with this administration.\"",
      "Executions this year have taken place in 11 states: Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. All but Arizona are led by Republican governors.",
      "Florida has carried out 15 executions in 2025 \u2014 the largest share of any state \u2014 with three still to go. Alabama and Texas have carried out the second-highest number, with five executions each, a threshold that South Carolina is also expected to reach on Friday. Other than South Carolina, which had its first execution in 13 years in September 2024, those states are typically responsible for most executions that take place in the U.S. annually, but Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been signing death warrants at an unprecedented pace since January.",
      "\"Many of these states that are actively executing people are states that have governors who are politically aligned with the president on this,\" said John Blume, director of the Death Penalty Project at Cornell University, referencing DeSantis, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. \"They're very conservative and believe in this, and their attorneys general are too. They believe that in those jurisdictions that, you know, it's politically expedient for them to appear to be tough on the death penalty.\"",
      "Backlogs on death row",
      "Political pressures aren't the only forces motivating the increase. Multiple states that have executed inmates this year or plan to do so by the year's end recently resumed executions after lengthy hiatuses, some of which were legally binding.",
      "States like Arizona have restarted executions after being ordered to pause them for various stretches of time, while authorities reviewed capital punishment protocols that had drawn criticism and, in several cases, accusations of unconstitutional cruelty. Over the last decade or so, many correctional departments struggled to obtain viable drugs for lethal injections and came under intense public scrutiny as horror stories emerged of repeatedly botched procedures.",
      "As moratoriums lifted in one jurisdiction after another, states started \"clearing out the backlog\" of death row inmates who could not be executed while they were in place, Blume said. Some had new or renewed ways to do it: Alabama and Louisiana have now authorized the use of nitrogen gas to execute inmates, while South Carolina reintroduced firing squads and in March carried out the nation's first execution by that method in 15 years. If Friday's execution proceeds, South Carolina will have used a firing squad to put to death three of five inmates this year.",
      "Lethal injection remains the most common method for putting inmates to death. That could be partly due to Mr. Trump's executive order, which included a promise to supply \"a sufficient supply of drugs needed to carry out lethal injection\" to each state that allows executions.",
      "\"The death penalty is the only proper punishment for some of the vilest crimes,\" said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, in a statement to CBS News that also contained some of the language from Mr. Trump's executive order. \"President Trump knows this, that's why he signed an Executive Order on day one of his second term to restore the death penalty and protect public safety.\"",

      "The U.S. State Department is warning Americans in Japan to be alert as bear attacks and sightings rise in parts of the country.",
      "Americans should avoid areas where bears are sighted, especially if walking alone, and be aware of their surroundings, the State Department said in a \"wildlife alert\" Wednesday. Anyone who spots a bear should report it to local authorities.",
      "Bears have killed at least 13 people in Japan since April, more than double the five people killed in the 2023-2024 fiscal year, AFP reported. It's the largest number of people killed by bears in Japan since the country began keeping such records in 2006. More than 100 other people have sustained injuries since April, according to Environment Ministry statistics from the end of October.",
      "Most of the attacks have occurred in northern Japan. In its alert, the State Department called out the Hokkaido and Akita Prefectures, as well as Sapporo City, where officials closed a park next to the U.S. Consulate General after a bear was sighted there.",
      "Troops were recently deployed to Akita to contain the animals there. Some police have been authorized to shoot the animals, AFP reported.",
      "U.S. citizens should register for the Smart-Traveler Enrollment Program, which makes it easier to receive security messages from the State Department and allows Americans to be located more easily in case of an emergency, the State Department said.",
      "The State Department regularly issues warnings, and every country in the world has been given a designated travel advisory. Japan's\u00a0travel advisory level remains at 1, meaning travelers should \"exercise normal precautions.\" But it's rare for U.S. officials to warn about wildlife in a foreign country. The State Department did not immediately respond to a query asking how many such warnings have been issued.",
      "Bears have been spotted near schools, in supermarkets and even near Iwate Hanamaki Airport. Experts say the country's\u00a0aging and declining rural population\u00a0has contributed to the problem. As Japan's population shrinks, humans leave rural areas and bears move in.",
      "\"Then that area recovered to the forest, so bears have a chance to expand their range,\" biologist Koji Yamazaki, from Tokyo University of Agriculture,\u00a0told CBS News' Elizabeth Palmer in 2023.",
      "Older local hunters are also not used to bear hunting, and few preventative measures have been taken in recent years. Climate change has also\u00a0affected the bears' hibernation schedules and impacted foods the animals depend on.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Nov 2025 08:20:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Researchers behind the \"Hitler's DNA\" documentary say the Nazi dictator likely had Kallmann Syndrome, a rare genetic condition which can cause undescended testicles and a micropenis.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014 Adolf Hitler most likely suffered from a rare genetic condition called Kallmann Syndrome, researchers and documentary makers said Thursday, following DNA testing of the Nazi dictator's blood. According to the Cleveland Clinic, the syndrome can \"disrupt the process that drives puberty\" and manifest in symptoms that include undescended testicles and a micropenis.",
      "The research also quashes the suggestion that Hitler had Jewish ancestry, the researcher say.",
      "Popular World War II songs often mocked Hitler's anatomy but lacked any scientific basis. The findings by an international team of scientists and historians now appear to confirm longstanding suspicions around his sexual development.",
      "\"No one has ever really been able to explain why Hitler was so uncomfortable around women throughout his life, or why he probably never entered into intimate relations with women,\" said Alex Kay of the University of Potsdam. \"But now we know that he had Kallmann Syndrome, this could be the answer we've been looking for.\"",
      "The research findings are featured in a new documentary, \"Hitler's DNA: Blueprint of a Dictator,\" due to be broadcast on Saturday.",
      "The testing was made possible after researchers obtained a sample of Hitler's blood from a piece of material taken from the sofa on which he shot himself.",
      "The testing found a \"high likelihood\" that Hitler had Kallmann Syndrome, though Britain's Guardian newspaper said in a Thursday article critical of the upcoming documentary that, \"in their attempt to authenticate the blood,\" the research team \"failed to get a fresh DNA sample from any of Hitler's surviving relatives in Austria and the U.S., who are all understandably reluctant about media exposure.\"",
      "The testing of Hitler's DNA showed \"very high\" scores \u2014   in the top one percent \u2014   for a predisposition to autism, schizophrenia and biopolar disorder, program makers Blink Films said.",
      "The Guardian article, however, said that many scientists aren't comfortable using the kind of genetic testing cited by the researchers, known as \"polygenic risk scores,\" to indicate an individual's likelihood of developing such disorders.",
      "\"Polygenic risk scores tell you something about population at large, not about individuals,\" honorary professor David Curtis, at University College London's Genetics Institute, told the Guardian. \"If a test shows you to be in the upper percentile of polygenic risk, the actual risk of acquiring a condition may still be very low, even for conditions that are strongly influenced by genetic factors.\"",
      "The research team stressed that such conditions, even if Hitler did have them, also could not explain or excuse the Nazi leader's warmongering or racist policies.",
      "Over 50 million people are estimated to have died in World War II, including six million Jews were who were systematically murdered.",
      "Geneticist Turi King, known for identifying the remains of medieval king Richard III and who also worked on the project, said Hitler's genes put him in a category of people who were often sent to the gas chambers by the Nazis.",
      "\"Hitler's policies are completely around eugenics,\" said the expert in ancient and forensic DNA at the University of Bath in western England.",
      "\"If he had been able to look at his own DNA ... he almost certainly would have sent himself,\" she said.",
      "Analysis \"debunks this myth\" that Hitler had a Jewish grandfather",
      "The DNA results additionally rule out the possibility that Hitler had a Jewish grandfather via his grandmother, who was rumored to have gotten pregnant by an employer in whose home she worked.",
      "\"Analysis of the DNA debunks this myth by showing that the Y chromosome data matches the DNA of Hitler's male line relative. If he had Jewish ancestry (through an outside relationship), that match wouldn't be there,\" the production company added.",
      "Russia's top diplomat, long-time Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, cited the unsubstantiated theory of Hitler's Jewish lineage in 2022 as he defended Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which the Kremlin baselessly claimed was intended to \"denazify\" the neighboring country, led by Jewish President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",

    "story": [
      "Jerusalem\u00a0\u2014 Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he received a letter from President Trump on Wednesday asking him to pardon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is on trial in three separate corruption cases.",
      "Netanyahu has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the ongoing court cases, with no ruling yet delivered, and his supporters have dismissed the trials as politically motivated.",
      "In a speech to the Israeli parliament in October, Mr. Trump urged Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, telling the gathered lawmakers: \"By the way, that was not in the speech, as you probably know! But I happen to like this gentleman right over here [Netanyahu], and it just seems to make so much sense.\"",
      "\"This morning, President Isaac Herzog received the attached letter from U.S. President Donald Trump, calling on him to consider granting a pardon to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,\" Herzog's office said in a statement, adding that the president could not initiate a pardon based on the American leader's request alone.",
      "In his letter, Mr. Trump said he was writing to Herzog at a \"historic time, as we have, together, just secured peace that has been sought for at least 3,000 years.\"",
      "\"I hereby call on you to fully pardon Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a formidable and decisive War Time Prime Minister,\" it added. \"While I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli Justice System ... I believe that this 'case' against Bibi ... is political, unjustified prosecution.\"",
      "Netanyahu has long been known by the nickname Bibi.",
      "Mr. Trump also framed his request for Netanyahu's pardon as something his Israeli counterpart deserved for working with the White House to reach the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, saying: \"Now that we have achieved these unprecedented successes, and are keeping Hamas in check, it is time to let Bibi unite Israel by pardoning him, and ending that lawfare once and for all.\"",
      "He and his wife Sara are accused in one case of accepting more than $260,000 worth of luxury goods including cigars, jewelry and champagne from billionaires in exchange for political favors. He is also accused of attempting to negotiate more favorable coverage from two Israeli media outlets in two other cases.",
      "In a statement posted later Wednesday to X, Netanyahu thanked Mr. Trump for his \"incredible support,\" adding: \"As usual, you get right to the point and call it like it is. I look forward to continuing our partnership to bolster security and expand peace.\"",
      "The statement from Herzog's office said the Israeli president holds Mr. Trump \"in the highest regard and continues to express his deep appreciations for President Trump's unwavering support for Israel.\"",
      "\"Alongside and not withstanding this ... anyone seeking a Presidential pardon must submit a formal request in accordance with the established procedures,\" it added.",
      "During his current term, which started in late 2022, Netanyahu proposed far-reaching judicial reforms that critics say sought to weaken the courts. Those prompted massive protests that were only curtailed after the onset of the Gaza war in October 2023.",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused his political opponents of using the Justice Department to target him during his time out of office, and since he returned to the White House, the department, now run by his appointees, has pushed for Biden-era justice officials to be prosecuted over an FBI investigation into the fallout of the 2020 election.",
      "In September, he\u00a0pushed\u00a0Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff. Comey and James have since been indicted on criminal charges.",

    "story": [
      "A diamond brooch that French emperor Napoleon lost while fleeing from the Battle of Waterloo in the early 19th century sold for more than 3.5 million Swiss francs \u2014 about $4.4 million \u2014 at a Geneva auction on Wednesday, Sotheby's said.",
      "The brooch, which can also be worn as a pendant, features an oval diamond weighing over 13 carats, surrounded by smaller cut diamonds.",
      "\"This historical and highly important diamond jewel was part of other personal belongings the Emperor had taken with him to Waterloo, including medals, weapons, silverware, a hat and a jewellery box containing dozens of loose diamonds as well as jewellery,\" Sotheby's said in a news release.",
      "\"In his haste to flee Waterloo, where his armies had been overwhelmed by the combined forces of the British and Prussian armies, Napoleon had to abandon some of his carriages when they got stuck in a muddy road a few miles away from the battlefield \u2014 including the carriage containing those precious belongings,\" it said.",
      "The sale price vastly outstripped the high end of the pre-sale estimate of 200,000 francs. The hammer price was 2.85 million francs, excluding fees and other charges that were included in the final aggregate price.",
      "Sotheby's did not disclose the identity of the seller, and said that the buyer was a \"private collector.\"",
      "The brooch and a few other items were offered to the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm III as battle trophies in 1815 three days after the Battle of Waterloo, according to Sotheby's. It remained among heirlooms of the Prussian Royal House of Hohenzollern for centuries and over the last few years was part of a different private collection.",
      "Among dozens of lots on the auction block was a green beryl weighing over 132 carats, which Napoleon was said to have worn at his 1804 coronation. The jewel sold for a hammer price of 838,000 francs, or more than 17 times the high-end pre-sale estimate.",
      "One diamond expert said the sale took on added allure in the wake of the robbery of Napoleonic jewels from the Louvre museum in Paris last month. The thieves made off with eight pieces in broad daylight  and dropped one as they made their escape.",
      "\"Given the recent Louvre heist and the provenance of arguably the most famous French figure in history, I'm not surprised the jewel achieved a majestic 3.5 million francs,\" said Tobias Kormind, managing director of online jeweler 77 Diamonds. \"The brooch arrives at a moment of renewed global fascination with Napoleonic jewels, and its story is irresistible.\"",

    "summary": "A report released by human rights groups found that the treatment of Venezuelan migrants imprisoned in El Salvador's CECOT prison amounted to arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance.",
    "story": [
      "A report released Wednesday by human rights groups determined that the deportation and treatment of more than 200 Venezuelan migrants imprisoned in El Salvador for months at the request of the U.S. amounted to arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance under international law.",
      "The investigation, by the groups Human Rights Watch and Cristosal, found the detainees were victims of \"constant beatings\" by Salvadoran guards at the notorious CECOT maximum security prison, as well as other forms of mistreatment, including cases of sexual abuse. Investigators argued some of these alleged abuses constitute torture under international law.",
      "\"The human rights violations documented in this report violate El Salvador's obligations under international law, including the prohibitions on arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, and torture and other ill-treatment,\" the report said.",
      "Citing dozens of interviews, including with 40 of the Venezuelan men held at the mega prison, Human Rights Watch and Cristosal said the detainees also faced \"inhumane\" conditions, incommunicado detention, inadequate access to food, limited medical care and the denial of basic hygiene, inconsistent with United Nations rules governing the treatment of prisoners.",
      "\"These beatings and other abuses appear to be part of a practice designed to subjugate, humiliate, and discipline detainees through the imposition of grave physical and physiological suffering,\" the report says. \"Officers also appear to have acted on the belief that their superiors either supported or tolerated their abusive acts.\"",
      "The human rights groups argued the U.S. government was \"complicit\" in the mistreatment they found, noting the Trump administration gave El Salvador $4.7 million in March, including to imprison deportees accused of having ties to Tren de Aragua, a gang that originated in Venezuela.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not address the allegations in Wednesday's report, but said, \"President Trump is committed to keeping his promises to the American people by removing dangerous criminal and terrorist illegal aliens who pose a threat to the American public.\"",
      "\"CBS should spend their time and energy amplifying the stories of Angel Parents, whose innocent American children have tragically been murdered by vicious illegal aliens that President Trump is removing from the country,\" Jackson added in a statement.",
      "The Venezuelan men at the center of the investigation were released from CECOT this summer and returned to Venezuela as part of a U.S.-brokered prisoner swap. Most of them were deported to El Salvador in mid-March by the U.S. government after the Trump administration accused them of being dangerous criminals and members of Tren de Aragua. Many were deported from the U.S. with little to no due process under the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "CBS News was first to obtain and publish the list of the Venezuelan men sent to CECOT in March. Using that list, \"60 Minutes\" and CBS News found that many of the deportees did not have any apparent criminal record, in the U.S. or abroad, despite the administration's allegations.",
      "The human rights groups made similar findings in their report, saying their \"review of criminal record background documents indicates that many of them had not been convicted of any crimes by federal or state authorities in the United States, nor in Venezuela or other Latin American countries where they had lived.\"",

      "Australian windsurfer Andy McDonald had a lucky escape this week after coming face-to-face with a shark off the country's west coast.",
      "A camera for the surf media website swellnet.com captured the moment that the shark seemingly came out of nowhere and knocked the 61-year-old McDonald off his board.",
      "\"Everything was really nice, and then just out of the blue, bang, something so hard and strong hit me like a freight train,\" McDonald told the Australian network ABC. \"It just pushed me up into the air and I fell into the, I fell into the water. I knew it was a shark.\"",
      "The swellnet video shows McDonald and a couple other windsurfers cruising through waters off the coast near the town of Margaret River when both he and his sail suddenly plunge into the water and out of view.",
      "\"The shark must've dived because everything went underwater, myself and all my gear and at that point I was like punching it and wrestling with it, pretty much just trying to get away from it, kicking it and just trying to hope that my, none of my limbs were near its mouth, which I had no idea where it was,\" he told ABC.",
      "\"I thought I was gone for. I just thought, 'This is it, this is the moment that is the end of my life.'\"",
      "About 10 seconds after he was pulled under, with some splashing at the spot, McDonald can be seen resurfacing in the swellnet video. As he spoke with ABC, he sat behind his surfboard, which had a roughly one-foot-wide distinctive bite-shaped gap in its side.",
      "Asked if his tussle with the shark had put him off surfing for a while, McDonald said he'd already got a replacement, and would likely hit the water again in a matter of hours.",
      "\"I ordered a new board this afternoon,\" he said. \"I'll go back in the water. I'll go back out tomorrow.\"",

    "story": [
      "Islamabad, Pakistan\u00a0\u2014 A suicide bombing outside district court buildings in a residential area of the Pakistani capital killed at least a dozen people on Tuesday, Pakistan's interior minister said.",
      "\"At 12:39 p.m. (0239 Eastern), a suicide attack was carried out at the Kachehri (district courts) ... so far 12 people have been martyred and around 27 are wounded,\" Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi told reporters at the scene of the incident.",
      "\"As I entered the court building, a huge blast occurred. I thought the entire judiciary building would collapse on me,\" Zahid Khan, who works as an assistant to a lawyer at the court, told CBS News' Sami Yousafzai. \"When I went upstairs, I saw people lying on the ground around the fire \u2026 Just three minutes earlier, I had been at that exact spot while parking my bike.\"",
      "\"I saw many people lying injured, with blood on the road,\" he said.",
      "He noted the timing of the attack, coming a week after the Pakistani Taliban, or TTP, along with some elements of the Afghan Taliban issued threats against Pakistani cities.",
      "Pakistani later issued a statement, saying te government \"strongly condemns the cowardly suicide attack in Islamabad that claimed 12 innocent lives, including members of the judiciary.\"",
      "\"The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has claimed responsibility for this reprehensible act, aimed at spreading fear and undermining Pakistan's justice system,\" the statement said.",
      "The alleged suicide attack in Islamabad also came a day after militants stormed a military college in Wana, in Pakistan's South Waziristan region. Two militants were killed in the assault, officials said.",
      "The TTP, in statements shared with CBS News, denied involvement in both the Islamabad and Wana attacks, but Pakistani security officials and analysts said the group was likely responsible for both.",
      "Last week, a TTP source told CBS News the group considers its campaign against Pakistan's government a \"holy struggle,\" and they warned that it has \"human and technical resources in all major cities\" \u2014 and plans to stage new, large-scale attacks.",
      "The attacker tried on Tuesday to \"enter the court premises but, failing to do so, targeted a police vehicle,\" Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi told journalists. He alleged that the attack was \"carried out by Indian-backed elements and Afghan Taliban proxies\" linked to the TTP, but he said authorities were \"looking into all aspects\" of the explosion.",
      "In a statement issued later Tuesday, Indian government spokesperson Shri Randhir Jaiswal said the country \"unequivocally rejects the baseless and unfounded allegations\" by Pakistan, calling it \"a predictable tactic by Pakistan to concoct false narratives against India.\"",
      "Pakistan's Minister of Defense Khawaja Asif blamed Afghanistan's Taliban rulers for allowing the attack to take place on Tuesday. The neighbors have long had tense relations, with Islamabad accusing Afghan authorities of allowing the TTP to operate within Afghanistan's borders.",
      "\"Kabul's rulers can stop terrorism in Pakistan, but today's suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts proves this is a nationwide war,\" Asif said in a statement Tuesday. \"Anyone who believes the Pakistan Army is only fighting on the Afghan-Pakistan border and in remote Balochistan should take this attack as a wake-up call. This is a war for all of Pakistan.\"",
      "Pakistan and Afghanistan held two rounds of talks aimed at addressing mutual security concerns in October and earlier this month, but both ended without any solid agreement between the neighbors, and Asif said in his statement after the Tuesday explosion in Islamabad that, \"in this environment, it would be futile to place greater hope in successful negotiations with the rulers in Kabul.\"",
      "One member of the Afghan Taliban's negotiating team told CBS News on Tuesday that the talks had failed due to Pakistan's unrealistic demands for the Taliban to restrain the TTP.",
      "\"It was far beyond our control and capacity,\" the Afghan Taliban official said, accusing Pakistan of failing to effectively counter the TTP itself.",
      "The Islamabad explosion also came a day after a large blast rocked the Red Fort, a major tourist destination in neighboring India's capital city New Delhi.",
      "That explosion killed eight people, and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Tuesday that the \"conspirators\" behind the blast \"will not be spared,\" vowing that \"all those responsible will be brought to justice.\"",
      "Pakistan and India are nuclear armed neighbors that have clashed often, usually over the disputed Kashmir border region.\u00a0Dozens of people were killed in May\u00a0when India launched military strikes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and deep inside Pakistan, saying it was targeting militants in the country that had carried out multiple attacks on India.",

    "story": [
      "Saint Petersburg \u2013 A Russian court on Tuesday sent an 18-year-old street musician who performed anti-war songs to jail for a third time as the Kremlin mounts a no-limits crackdown on any signs of dissent or opposition.",
      "All public criticism of Moscow's ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin or the army is outlawed under sweeping censorship laws that rights groups have compared to those of the Soviet Union.",
      "Diana Loginova, a music student known by the stage name Naoko, was arrested last month after staging pop-up street concerts reciting songs by exiled Russian artists Monetochka and Noize MC in Saint Petersburg.",
      "The performances went viral, capturing attention at a time when public opposition to the Kremlin and the war in Ukraine is virtually non-existent.",
      "She has already served two 13-day sentences, being re-arrested and re-charged with new offenses immediately after both releases.",
      "Rights lawyers have said the singer is now caught up in a jail \"carousel,\" a practice whereby prosecutors lob a string of minor charges against defendants to keep them in constant custody.",
      "In the latest case, she was found guilty of organizing the mass gathering of people and sentenced to another 13 days in prison, an AFP correspondent reported from the Saint Petersburg court.",
      "Since Loginova's arrest, a flurry of videos in support of her and her band Stoptime have flooded TikTok, while other young street performers have expressed solidarity with her in public, risking fines or jail sentences themselves.",
      "The band's guitarist, Alexander Orlov, was also jailed for another 13 days. In court, he sat between his lawyer and a masked police officer.",
      "Street singers in other Russian cities who performed in support of Loginova have also faced arrests.",
      "A day earlier, independent media reported that a court in the city of Perm, more than 900 miles east of Saint Petersburg, handed 20-year-old performer Yekaterina Romanova 15 days in jail.",
      "Romanova, also known as Yekaterina Ostasheva, had performed in support of Loginova in Perm and had already been given seven days in jail earlier this month.",

    "story": [
      "New Delhi - Authorities in India's capital have urged elementary schools to hold classes online, banned construction and urged people to work from home as the annual plague of air pollution hit the \"severe\" category in a health warning system for the first time this season. For the first time, the toxic air has drawn protests against the government, and a warning for people with health issues to simply leave Delhi if they can.",
      "The severe designation indicates potentially serious health impacts for people with impaired immune systems, and negative affects even for healthy people, according to India's Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).",
      "The emergency measures were announced after Delhi's average Air Quality Index (AQI) sharply rose to 425. An AQI between 400 and 450 is categorized as \"severe\" and, as a norm, requires authorities to implement emergency measures under the government's graded pollution response plan.",
      "Air quality in India's capital deteriorates sharply every year around this time due to a number of factors, including farm waste being burned off and seasonal climatic conditions \u2013 but activists say authorities have not done enough to contain the air pollution.",
      "In a first, hundreds of people protested against the bad air quality at Delhi's India Gate over the weekend.",
      "Several protesters wore gas masks as a symbolic act of protest and held up banners, including one that read: \"I miss breathing.\"",
      "Earlier this month, one of the city's top pulmonologists, Dr. Gopi Chand Khilnani, urged people with health problems who can afford to temporarily leave Delhi to do so.",
      "\"Everybody cannot afford to leave Delhi, because it is not simple, Khilnani told The Indian Express. \"But those who have chronic lung disease or chronic heart disease, those who are on oxygen, and those who have the opportunity and ability to go abroad or to less polluted places, I very safely advise them to leave Delhi for 6-8 weeks from now, so as to protect themselves from the distress of breathlessness, the requirement of oxygen, and so on and so forth.\"",
      "The toxic air is affecting the health of people of the city regardless of underlying health problems, with many Delhi residents complaining of breathing problems and eye irritation this week.",
      "\"Every breath in Delhi NCR [National Capital Region] today comes with a major health cost \u2014 we're seeing more patients struggling with breathlessness, asthma, and heart problems, especially among children, the elderly, and those with chronic diseases,\" Dr. Harshal Ramesh Salve, at the Centre for Community Medicine at the prestigious All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), told a group of journalists on Monday.",
      "A recent report by the Lancet medical journal - Countdown on Health and Climate Change 2025 \u2013 carried a grim warning for India: The country recorded around 1.72 million deaths from outdoor air pollution in 2022, a staggering 38 percent rise since 2010.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration sent nobody to the U.N. global climate summit, leaving California Governor Gavin Newsom to ask, \"What the hell is going on here?\"",
    "story": [
      "In Bel\u00e9m, the bustling Brazilian gateway to the Amazon rainforest, leaders from nearly 200 nations have gathered for the United Nations' 30th Climate Change Conference, known as COP30, to chart difficult next steps in the global fight against climate change. But the absence of the leaders from the world's three largest greenhouse gas emitters \u2014 China, the United States and India \u2014 cast a shadow over the summit as it kicked off.",
      "Beijing and New Delhi did dispatch senior-level delegations for the two-week summit. The White House, however, said no high-level U.S. officials would attend this year's COP. President Trump has repeatedly dismissed human-caused climate change as \"a hoax.\"",
      "Two Democratic governors, California's Gavin Newsom and New Mexico's Michelle Lujan Grisham, were in Brazil to attend the summit, representing state-level U.S. efforts to curb emissions.",
      "\"What the hell is going on here?\" Newsom asked at a global investors' summit in S\u00e3o Paulo on Monday, where he fired off a characteristic criticism of the Trump administration. \"We're in Brazil \u2014 one of our great trading partners, one of the world's great democracies. Home to all the rare earth metals we need. This is the country we should be engaging with, not slapping with 50% tariffs.\"",
      "Ten years ago, 195 nations taking part in the COP21 summit signed onto the landmark Paris Agreement, intended to commit individual nations to take measures that, collectively, would limit the rise in average global temperatures to \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The objective in the agreement, which the Obama administration signed, was to pursue efforts to cap the global temperature increase at 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F) above pre-industrial levels.",
      "That target now appears out of reach.",
      "Based on national plans submitted this year, the planet is on course to warm by roughly 2.5\u00b0C (4.5\u00b0F) during this century. The Earth's average surface temperature in 2024 was the hottest since record keeping began in 1880 \u2014 and the last 10 years have all ranked among the warmest ever observed.",
      "Still, U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told delegates in Brazil this week that after three decades of dedicated talks, \"we are now bending the curve of planet heating emissions downwards \u2014 for the very first time.\"",
      "\"I am not sugarcoating it,\" Stiell hastened to add. \"We have so much more work to do.\"",
      "A new U.N. analysis released this week shows that, if current national commitments are met, global emissions should fall by about 12% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels. That's an improvement from last month's projection of 10%, but still far short of the 60% reduction scientists say would be needed to keep warming within the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C goal.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has been pressing for stronger action, warning that surpassing the 1.5\u00b0C limit now looks almost inevitable and slamming it as both a \"moral failure\" and \"deadly negligence\" putting the lives of billions of people at risk.",
      "Despite low expectations for any sweeping breakthroughs, the delegations at COP30 are broadly expected to update national commitments to curb emissions in the next decade.",
      "A Brazil-led initiative to raise $125 billion for rainforest protection, coupled with renewed scrutiny of fossil fuel companies \u2014 which Guterres accused of \"holding back change\" while collecting record profits and government subsidies \u2014 were also expected to come out of the two-week gathering.",
      "There is also likely to be more pressure applied on the governments of wealthy nations to help finance climate adaptations around the world, to help developing countries mitigate the impacts of a warming planet.",
      "At last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries agreed on an aspirational goal of mobilizing $1.3 trillion annually by 2035, with at least $300 billion expected to come from developing economies.",
      "Publicly available data on how much climate finance has actually been delivered since then, however, remains scarce, and that could be a key point of contention for the negotiators gathered in Bel\u00e9m to discuss.",

      "U.N. climate negotiations get underway Monday at a meeting on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon, with leaders pushing for urgency, cooperation and acceleration after more than 30 years fighting to curb global warming by drastically reducing the carbon pollution that causes it.",
      "Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, president of this year's conference, known as COP30, emphasized that negotiators engage in \"mutir\u00e3o,\" a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.",
      "\"Either we decide to change by choice, together, or we will be imposed change by tragedy,\" do Lago wrote in his letter to negotiators Sunday. \"We can change. But we must do it together.\"",
      "Complicating the calls for togetherness is the United States. The Trump administration did not send high-level negotiators to the talks and is withdrawing for the second time from the 10-year-old Paris Agreement, which is being celebrated as a partial achievement here in Belem.",
      "The United States has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. China is the No. 1 carbon polluter now, but because carbon dioxide stays in the air for at least a century, more of it was made in the U.S.",
      "\"I think the environment we are in, the geopolitical landscape, is particularly challenging,\" said Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chairs the Alliance of Small Island States. Small island nations suffer some of the worst effects of climate change because rising seas swallow land. \"The United States withdrawing from the Paris Agreement has really shifted the gravity'' of the whole negotiating system.",
      "President Trump's actions damage the fight against climate change, former U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern said.",
      "\"It's a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn't going to be constructive if they did,\" he said.",
      "A report out earlier this year from the World Meteorological Organization warned that climate change is accelerating, with some impacts now irreversible for centuries. The\u00a0State of the Global Climate report\u00a0confirmed global temperatures, greenhouse gas emissions and sea levels all reached record highs in 2024.",
      "In a mission statement published ahead of COP30, organizers wrote, \"We have made progress, but not enough. Climate change is no longer a threat of the future. It is a tragedy of the present.\"",
      "\"We need to accelerate the fight against global warming and strengthen multilateralism in combating climate change,\" they said, noting that \"climate change has increased the exposure of the poorest to natural disasters.\"",
      "In a letter to negotiators released late Sunday, Simon Stiell, the U.N. climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree, \"but we must accelerate in the Amazon. Devastating climate damages are happening already, from Hurricane Melissa hitting the Caribbean, Super Typhoons smashing Vietnam and the Philippines, to a tornado ripping through Southern Brazil.\"",
      "Not only must nations do more faster but they \"must connect climate action to people's real lives,\" Stiell wrote.",
      "The Nature Conservancy chief scientist Katharine Hayhoe compared the multinational negotiations to a potluck dinner.",
      "\"Everybody brings the contributions that they are making,\" which in this instance are new and strengthened plans to cut carbon pollution, Hayhoe said. \"And it's obvious who took the time to bake the fresh pie with fruit that they picked and who fished out that year old chicken frozen chicken nuggets from the back of their freezer.\"",
      "\"The United States as a country will not be showing up with a dish,\" Hayhoe said. However, she and several others including former lead American negotiators are pointing to U.S. cities, states and businesses that they said will take up the slack.",

      "\"Many men skip meals, eat too quickly and rely on convenience foods stripped of minerals and fiber,\" Gioffre said.",

      "Biggest food culprits",
      "When it comes to ultraprocessed foods, Gioffre called out three specific components that worsen acid reflux: refined salt, sugar and seed oils.",
      "\"Together, they inflame the gut and weaken both digestion and the lower esophageal sphincter, the valve that keeps acid in the stomach where it belongs,\" he said.",
      "\"Men need to slow down, eat foods that support digestion and strengthen the gut, and stop relying on quick fixes.\"",
      "Men also tend to drink more coffee than women, often two to three cups a day, usually on an empty stomach, Gioffre pointed out.",

      "Biological differences",
      "There are some biological differences between the genders that contribute to men\u2019s higher risk of severe gastrointestinal conditions, according to Gioffre.",
      "\"Men produce less protective mucus and saliva \u2014 the body\u2019s natural defense system that buffers acid when it backflows into the esophagus. So when acid reflux strikes, it hits harder,\" he said.",
      "Some examples of alkaline-rich foods include leafy greens, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, and mineral water or spring water. (iStock)",
      "\"That acid burns and erodes tissue that was never designed to handle acid in the first place, setting the stage for inflammation, damage and long-term complications.\"",
      "Younger men also tend to carry more visceral (abdominal) fat, Gioffre noted, which increases pressure in the stomach and forces acid up into the esophagus.",
      "SCIENTISTS REVEAL HOW YOUR FAVORITE SODA COULD QUIETLY MESS WITH YOUR MOOD",
      "Hormones also play a role.",
      "\"Estrogen in women appears to protect the esophagus by improving blood flow and mucosal repair, protection men have much less of,\" the doctor said. \"Without lower levels than women, their tissue where reflux hits doesn\u2019t recover as quickly from repeated acid exposure.\"",

      "Gioffre recommends that men take the following simple steps to immediately begin lowering their risk.",
      "\"One of the biggest and most overlooked causes of acid reflux is eating too close to bedtime,\" Gioffre said. \"When you lie down after a meal, gravity is no longer helping to keep acid in your stomach where it belongs, so it\u2019s much easier for it to travel up the wrong way into your esophagus.\"",
      "Reflux symptoms often get worse at night, the doctor noted \u2014 \"and it\u2019s why so many men wake up coughing, choking or with a burning throat, hoarse voice or sour taste in their mouth.\" (iStock)",
      "This is why reflux symptoms often get worse at night, he noted \u2014 \"and it\u2019s why so many men wake up coughing, choking or with a burning throat, hoarse voice or sour taste in their mouth.\"",
      "Gioffre said it\u2019s best to stop eating three hours before bed, which gives the body time to fully digest, empty the stomach and drop acid levels before lying down.",
      "Common triggers include garlic, onions, spicy foods, alcohol, chocolate, caffeine, citrus fruits and carbonated water, according to Gioffre.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"All of these weaken the lower esophageal sphincter, the valve that keeps stomach acid where it belongs,\" he said. \"Once that muscle relaxes, acid flows upward, causing heartburn by inflaming and irritating the esophageal and throat lining.\"",
      "\"If you want to heal reflux naturally, you can\u2019t just change what you eat \u2014 you have to change how you live.\"",
      "The doctor also recommends adding back alkaline minerals, digestive enzymes and a high-quality probiotic. Some examples of alkaline-rich foods include leafy greens, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, and mineral water or spring water.",

      "Esophageal cancer is up to nine times more common in men, making them far more likely to progress from chronic reflux to serious outcomes. (iStock)",
      "\"These activate your parasympathetic \u2018rest-and-digest\u2019 system, calm your gut and keep acid levels in check naturally,\" Gioffre said. \"Get outside and move after meals, and swap your late-night snack for deep breathing or stretching.\"",
      "When men don\u2019t sleep well, the body produces more cortisol, which is the main stress hormone.",
      "\"High cortisol keeps you locked in a constant state of fight-or-flight, and when you\u2019re in that mode, your body isn\u2019t focused on rest, digest or repair \u2014 it\u2019s focused on survival,\" Gioffre said.",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "In this state, blood flow is pulled away from the gut and sent to the muscles and brain, he noted, which means digestion slows down, stomach acid production drops and food sits in the stomach for too long, which leads to bloating, gas and more reflux.",

      "\"This is a significant result, as even a 0.01 millimeter reduction corresponds to a 10% decrease in cardiovascular disease risk, suggesting participants reduced their risk by around 10% each year,\" Orlandi said.",
      "Doctors track the thickness of the carotid artery wall as an early warning sign for clogged arteries that can lead to heart attacks and strokes. This study didn\u2019t count actual heart events, but the artery changes, along with lower gum inflammation, suggest that improved oral health could help fight cardiovascular disease.",

Given recent history, we\u2019re not surprised by the lack of communication or their lack of thought into how their actions will impact Americans.

    "summary": "Discover how Apple&apos;s passkeys revolutionize Mac security by replacing vulnerable passwords with biometric authentication and encryption for ultimate protection.",
    "story": [
      "CyberGuy explains how to make safe and secure passwords on your iPhone.",
      "Your Mac holds a lot more than just files. It carries your personal information, payment data, messages and every online account you access. Keeping that information safe starts with how you sign in. For years, passwords have been the standard way to protect accounts, but they are also one of the weakest links in digital security. They can be guessed, stolen or reused across multiple sites.",
      "Apple's introduction of passkeys marks a major step forward. Instead of relying on something you need to remember, passkeys rely on something you have (your trusted Apple device) and something you are, like your fingerprint or face. Together with iCloud Keychain and two-factor authentication, passkeys create a seamless and much safer way to secure your Mac and your digital life.",
      "What are passkeys?",
      "Passkeys are a modern alternative to passwords. They use public key cryptography to let you sign in without ever creating or typing a password. When you register for an account using a passkey, your Mac creates two unique keys. One is public and stored by the website or app, and the other is private and stays securely on your device.",
      "The public key is not sensitive information. The private key, on the other hand, never leaves your Mac and is protected behind your device's security features. When you sign in, Touch ID or Face ID confirms your identity before your Mac uses the private key to authenticate you. This process prevents phishing and password leaks because no shared secret is ever transmitted to the website.",

      "HOW TO USE PASSKEYS TO KEEP YOUR COMPUTER SAFE",
      "A passkey on your Mac replaces passwords with a faster, more secure way to sign in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Apple keeps passkeys secure",
      "Passkeys are stored and synced across your devices through iCloud Keychain, which is protected by end-to-end encryption. This means that not even Apple can access your passkeys or passwords. iCloud Keychain also has built-in protection against brute force attacks, even if someone were to gain unauthorized access to Apple's servers.",
      "If you lose your devices, you can still recover your passkeys through iCloud Keychain recovery. To do this, you must sign in with your Apple ID and password, verify your identity with a code sent to your trusted number and confirm using your device passcode. The system limits the number of attempts, and if too many failed attempts occur, the recovery record is locked or destroyed to prevent misuse.",
      "You can also set an account recovery contact to make sure you never lose access, even if you forget your Apple ID password or device passcode. This multi-layered design ensures that your data remains secure even in extreme scenarios, such as a compromised Apple account or cloud breach.",
      "How to set up passkeys on your Mac",
      "Setting up passkeys is simple and requires iCloud Keychain to be enabled.",

      "Phishing remains one of the most common ways attackers try to steal personal information. They may send fake emails or messages pretending to be from Apple or other trusted companies, urging you to click links or provide login details. Always double-check the sender's address and avoid clicking on links that seem suspicious. Instead, visit the website directly by typing the address into your browser.",
      "While macOS has strong built-in defenses such as Gatekeeper and XProtect, installing strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection against malware, adware and potentially unwanted programs. Strong antivirus software continuously monitors your system for suspicious behavior and can alert you to threats before they cause damage. It is especially useful if you download files from outside the App Store or connect external drives frequently.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Apple regularly releases software updates that include important security patches. Cybercriminals often target outdated systems because they contain known vulnerabilities.

      "Kids are spending more time online than ever, and that early exposure is opening the door to a new kind of danger.",
      "Artificial intelligence has supercharged online scams, creating personalized and convincing traps that even adults can fall for. The latest Bitwarden \"Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2025\" poll shows that while parents know these risks exist, most still haven't had a serious talk with their children about them.",
      "This growing communication gap is leaving the youngest internet users vulnerable at a time when online safety depends more than ever on education and oversight.",
      "Young children face real risks online",
      "Children as young as preschool age are now part of the connected world, yet few truly understand how to stay safe. The Bitwarden survey found that 42% of parents with children between 3 and 5 years old said their child had accidentally shared personal information online.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "5 PHONE SAFETY TIPS EVERY PARENT SHOULD KNOW",
      "AI-powered scams are finding new ways to reach kids who go online earlier than ever. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Nearly 80% of kids between the ages of 3 and 12 already have their own tablet or another connected device. Many parents assume supervision software or family settings are enough, but that assumption breaks down when kids explore apps, games and chat spaces designed to hold their attention. Device access has become nearly universal by early elementary school, but meaningful supervision and honest safety conversations are lagging behind.",
      "The AI threat and the parental disconnect",
      "Artificial intelligence has changed the nature of online scams by making them sound familiar, personal and hard to recognize. Bitwarden's data shows that 78% of parents worry their child could fall for an AI-enhanced threat, such as a voice-cloned message or a fake chat with a friend. Despite that fear, almost half of those same parents haven't talked with their kids about what an AI-powered scam might look like. The disconnect is even stronger among Gen Z parents.",
      "About 80% of them say they are afraid their child will fall victim to an AI-based scheme, yet 37% allow their kids full or nearly full autonomy online. In those households, problems are more common. Malware infections, unauthorized in-app purchases and phishing attempts appear at the highest rates among families who worry the most but monitor the least. The paradox is clear. Parents recognize the threat but fail to translate awareness into consistent action.",
      "Why parents haven't had the talk",
      "There are many reasons this important talk keeps getting delayed. Some parents simply feel unprepared to explain AI, while others assume their existing safety tools will protect their children. Only 17% of parents in the United States actively seek information about AI technologies, according to related research by Barna Group. That leaves a large majority relying on partial knowledge or outdated advice.",
      "Many parents also juggle multiple devices at home, making it difficult to track every app or game their child uses. Some overestimate how safe their own habits are, even though they admit to reusing passwords or skipping security updates. Without firsthand understanding or personal discipline, it becomes even harder to teach those lessons to children. As a result, many kids face the internet with curiosity but without proper guidance.",
      "Smart ways to protect your child online",
      "The Bitwarden findings make one thing clear: kids are getting connected younger, and scams powered by artificial intelligence are already targeting them. The good news is that parents can take practical steps right now to reduce those risks and build lasting online safety habits.",
      "Set up tablets, laptops and gaming consoles in shared family areas rather than bedrooms. When screens stay visible, you naturally become part of your child's online world. This not only encourages open conversation but also helps spot suspicious messages, fake friend requests or scam links before they cause trouble.",
      "Staying involved in your child\u2019s digital life is the best defense against today\u2019s AI threats. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Most devices have strong tools you can activate in minutes. Apple's Screen Time and Google Family Link let you limit screen time, approve new app installs and monitor how long your child spends on specific apps. These controls are especially useful for younger kids who, according to the Bitwarden poll, often have little supervision despite heavy device use.",
      "TEENS TURNING TO AI FOR LOVE AND COMFORT",
      "Before your child installs a new game or app, take a moment to check it together. Read the reviews, look at what data it collects and confirm the developer's name. Explain why some games or \"free\" apps might ask for camera or contact access they don't need. This kind of shared review teaches healthy skepticism and helps children recognize red flags later on.",
      "AI scams thrive on weak or reused passwords. Use a password manager to create and store strong, unique logins for each account.\u00a0Turn on\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible so that even if a password is stolen, the account stays protected.\u00a0Let your kids see how you use these tools so they learn that security isn't complicated, it's just a habit.",
      "Many parents delay important online safety talks because they feel unprepared to explain AI, leaving kids curious but without the guidance they need to stay safe. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "One of the best defenses is simple: encourage your child to pause and talk before reacting to anything unusual online. Whether it's a pop-up claiming a prize, a strange link in a chat or a voice message that sounds familiar, remind them it's always okay to ask you first.

      "What this means for you",
      "If you are a parent, guardian or anyone helping a child use technology, this issue deserves your attention. Start talking early, even before your child begins exploring the web on their own. Teach them simple concepts like asking before clicking or sharing. Instead of relying only on parental controls, have ongoing conversations that help them recognize suspicious links, messages or pop-ups. Show them that cybersecurity isn't about fear but about awareness. Model strong digital habits at home by using unique passwords and turning on\u00a0two-factor authentication. Explain why those steps matter. When your child understands the reasoning behind the rules, they are more likely to follow them. Make technology part of your family routine rather than a private space your child navigates alone. Regularly check the apps they use and the people they interact with. Set clear expectations and age-appropriate boundaries that can grow with your child's experience. Staying engaged is the most powerful protection you can offer.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The numbers from Bitwarden show a clear warning sign. Concern among parents is high, yet actual conversations about AI-powered scams remain rare. That silence gives scammers the upper hand. Children who learn about online safety early are more confident, more cautious and better equipped to handle unexpected messages or fake alerts. It only takes a few minutes of honest conversation to create awareness that lasts for years. By taking action now, you can close the gap between fear and understanding, protecting your family in a digital world that changes every day.",

      "That might sound technical, but it's actually simple. \"eVTOL\" stands for electric vertical takeoff and landing. Think of a small, quiet aircraft that lifts off like a helicopter but flies forward like a plane, all powered by electric or hybrid engines instead of noisy fuel-burning ones.",
      "And a configurator? It's a tool that lets you design your own version online, choosing colors, materials and other personal details. Put the two together, and you've got something quite remarkable: the ability to design your own flying vehicle from your laptop.",

      "A new kind of personal aircraft",
      "AltoVolo's aircraft is called the Sigma, and it's unlike anything on the market. It's a three-seater hybrid-electric vehicle that combines quiet operation with long range. The Sigma can fly about 500 miles, reach speeds over 220 mph and is more than 80% quieter than a helicopter.",
      "That quietness isn't just about comfort; it's what makes urban air travel possible. Imagine small aircraft quietly taking off from rooftops or open fields, connecting cities and towns without the noise pollution we associate with helicopters today.",
      "Safety is built in, too. The Sigma can keep flying even if one of its small electric jet engines fails, and it carries a ballistic parachute for emergencies. It's compact and light, just under 16 feet wide and weighing a little over 2,100 pounds, making it easier to operate and store than you might expect.",
      "The Sigma is over 80% quieter than a helicopter combining sleek hybrid-electric power with quiet performance. (AltoVolo)",
      "From concept to customization",
      "The idea of customizing your own aircraft might sound futuristic, but AltoVolo's online configurator makes it surprisingly accessible.",
      "Like building your own car online, you can choose colors, seat materials, interior details and even the stitching on your seatbelts. Founder and CEO Will\u00a0Wood says the company's goal isn't to compete on price but on experience and technology.",
      "\"Much like you'd expect from a supercar brand, we're focused on performance and refinement,\" he explained.",
      "The first 100 Sigma models will be limited editions, offering special finishes and materials that won't appear on later production units.",
      "NASA'S 'QUIET' SUPERSONIC JET COMPLETES FIRST FLIGHT IN POTENTIAL BREAKTHROUGH FOR COMMERCIAL AIR TRAVEL",
      "Taking flight before you take off",
      "AltoVolo isn't stopping at online design. They've built a high-fidelity flight simulator that mirrors the Sigma's cockpit exactly, right down to its carbon fiber and soft leather interior.",
      "Customers can train in the simulator and even use those hours toward a pilot's license. The simulator gives them a chance to \"fly\" their customized Sigma before ever leaving the ground.",
      "And for everyone else? The company is sharing flight footage from its simulator on YouTube, so people can see how the Sigma handles in the air.",
      "\"For AltoVolo, opening our order book is a major milestone in bringing the Sigma to life,\" Wood tells CyberGuy. \"Having early customers make an initial financial commitment shows us real demand. In turn, we are able to raise capital to finalise the product, progress certification and prepare for production. Presenting the flight simulator has been a useful catalyst. Allowing customers to fly in a simulated environment really helps them realise how easy this type of aircraft will be to fly.\"",
      "An exclusive community for early Sigma owners shapes the future of personal air travel and sustainable innovation. (AltoVolo)",
      "Innovation you can feel",
      "One of the most interesting details about the Sigma is something you can't see: the sound inside the cabin. AltoVolo's engineers are working to reduce vibration and interior noise, creating a calm, smooth flight experience.",
      "At the same time, they're experimenting with a synthesized soundscape, a gentle background tone that changes with the aircraft's power use. It helps pilots sense how the vehicle is performing and adds a cinematic touch to the flying experience.",
      "It's part science, part art and a hint at how human-centered this design really is.",
      "Future pilots can train in a realistic Sigma cockpit simulator and even log hours toward a license. (AltoVolo)",
      "The path to certification",
      "The Sigma will benefit from new U.S. aviation rules called MOSAIC, which simplify the process for certifying small, advanced aircraft. This means the Sigma can be sold as a light sport aircraft, lowering costs for both the company and future pilots.

      "Building a community around flight",
      "Buying a Sigma isn't just about owning an aircraft; it's about joining a new kind of community. AltoVolo wants Sigma owners to become collaborators, helping to shape the product and the future of urban flight. The company is also planning a global service and support network, including maintenance and training centers, to make ownership practical for people beyond traditional aviation circles.",
      "What this means to you",
      "For most of us, flying still means boarding a big plane at a crowded airport. But companies like AltoVolo are trying to change that. The Sigma represents a future where small, efficient aircraft could handle regional travel, connecting towns, suburbs and cities in new ways. It's the kind of innovation that could one day make air travel as personal as driving. And while it's still very early, AltoVolo's new configurator makes the dream of personal air travel feel a bit more real.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 07:36:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Electric vehicles overtake gas cars in total CO2 savings after just two years of driving, with emissions benefits growing over time as power grids get cleaner.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News host Jesse Watters discusses how President Donald Trump bought a red Tesla at the White House and Democrats' reaction to it on \u2018Jesse Watters Primetime.\u2019",
      "Electric vehicles are proving their worth when it comes to long-term emissions. While building an EV creates more pollution upfront because battery production demands more energy, the balance changes fast once the car is on the road. After about two years of normal driving, an electric car overtakes a gas-powered one in total CO2 savings and keeps widening the gap over time.",
      "A peer-reviewed study published in\u00a0PLOS Climate supports this finding. Researchers Pankaj Sadavarte, Drew Shindell, and Daniel Loughlin conducted the analysis titled,\u00a0\"Comparing the climate and air pollution footprints of Lithium-ion BEVs and ICEs in the U.S. incorporating systemic energy system responses.\" Their work examined how manufacturing, fuel production and vehicle operation affect both climate and air quality over a vehicle's lifetime.",

      "New research from PLOS Climate shows electric cars surpass gas vehicles in total CO2 savings after just two years on the road. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the study shows EVs overtake gas cars in emissions",
      "Using the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM), the study simulated how U.S. transportation and energy systems interact through 2050 under different rates of EV adoption. The results show that while manufacturing EVs releases about 30% more CO2 than producing gas cars, that gap closes quickly once you drive. By the end of year two, EVs emit less carbon overall, and the advantage widens over time as the power grid shifts toward cleaner energy sources.",
      "Each additional kilowatt-hour of battery capacity is projected to eliminate roughly 485 pounds of CO2 by 2030 and about 280 pounds by 2050. That reflects continued progress in electricity generation and efficiency gains across the EV industry. Over an estimated 18-year lifespan, gas-powered vehicles produce two to three and a half times more pollution-related damage than electric ones. Those damages include the social and economic costs of climate change and health issues linked to air pollution.",
      "While building EV batteries creates more emissions upfront, cleaner power grids and zero tailpipe output help electric vehicles pull ahead over time. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the GCAM model works",
      "The GCAM model links global energy use, economic activity, and emissions across multiple sectors. In this analysis, researchers measured not only tailpipe emissions but also the upstream effects from mining, refining, and fuel processing. They also factored in how growing EV adoption changes the energy mix. As electricity demand rises, cleaner energy sources like wind, solar and nuclear expand their share, while coal steadily declines.",
      "By 2050, electricity generation from gas, wind and solar grows while coal falls below 6% of the total mix. This cleaner grid makes charging electric cars progressively less carbon-intensive, strengthening the case for a large-scale EV transition.",
      "The study found lifetime health and climate damages from gas cars can be up to 3.5 times higher than from EVs, underscoring the long-term benefits of going electric. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How EVs impact you and the environment",
      "If you keep a car for more than two years, switching to an EV can meaningfully reduce your carbon footprint. The study found that EVs start paying back their manufacturing emissions faster in regions with renewable-heavy grids. In states still dependent on coal, the break-even point arrives later but still occurs well before a car's third birthday. The cleaner your local power mix, the faster your EV moves into net-positive territory.",
      "INHALERS PRODUCE CARBON EMISSIONS EQUAL TO 530,000 CARS ON ROAD ANNUALLY, STUDY FINDS",
      "The findings also highlight public health benefits. Gas vehicles emit more nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide, both of which contribute to respiratory illnesses and smog. As EVs replace traditional engines, these pollutants drop, improving air quality and reducing healthcare costs.",
      "Context and limitations",
      "The authors acknowledge that their analysis does not include emissions from recycling or disposing of vehicle parts at the end of life. Nor does it count emissions from building charging networks or new power infrastructure. Despite those exclusions, the study provides one of the most comprehensive long-term looks at how EV adoption affects both the economy and the environment.",
      "Because the study uses projections through 2050, results depend on future technology and energy trends. Even so, the consistent pattern across all scenarios is that EVs deliver large reductions in CO2 and air pollutants once on the road.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you drive often and plan to own your car for several years, the data shows an EV can save both emissions and money over time. Charging on a renewable or low-carbon plan speeds the payoff even more. Choosing a vehicle that matches your driving needs helps minimize unnecessary battery production and further reduces your footprint.",
      "For communities, broader EV adoption means cleaner local air, fewer health-related costs and lower long-term damage from climate change.",

      "Their shared goal is simple. The AI-Related Job Impacts Clarity Act would make AI's workforce impact visible and accountable. It gives you and policymakers the hard data needed to guide smarter decisions about automation and employment.",
      "Challenges in tracking AI-related job impacts",
      "While the bill sounds promising, several hurdles remain. The biggest challenge is consistency. Each company decides what counts as an AI-related job impact, which could lead to uneven or incomplete reporting.",
      "Smaller businesses might also escape the rules altogether if they fall outside the reporting thresholds. That could leave big gaps in understanding how automation affects local or niche industries.",
      "Data quality is another concern. Even with reporting requirements, the system relies on companies to share accurate information. The Department of Labor will need strong verification to make sure the reports reflect reality.",
      "LIZ PEEK: AI LAYOFFS COULD SPARK A SOCIALIST SURGE IF AMERICA IGNORES THE WARNING SIGNS",
      "And while transparency is valuable, it doesn't automatically protect jobs. The law can expose the problem, but real progress will depend on what policymakers and employers do with that data.",
      "The AI-Related Job Impacts Clarity Act would make companies report when automation replaces, adds or reshapes jobs. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you work in an industry where AI tools are becoming common, this bill could directly affect you. It would make it easier to see how automation changes jobs across the country. You'll be able to find out which roles are being replaced and which ones are being created.",
      "This new level of visibility could also pressure employers to be more transparent about layoffs. Companies may start explaining whether job cuts are truly due to AI or part of broader business shifts. That accountability could help workers plan smarter for the future.",
      "With clearer data, policymakers and training programs can step in faster. If large numbers of people in a certain field lose work because of automation, the government could push for retraining or job placement efforts. It may even help workers prepare earlier by learning new digital or technical skills before AI impacts their roles.",
      "SEN SANDERS: AI MUST BENEFIT EVERYONE, NOT JUST A HANDFUL OF BILLIONAIRES",
      "Overall, this bill puts information in the public's hands so workers can understand what's happening to their jobs instead of being left in the dark.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The AI-Related Job Impacts Clarity Act marks a major step toward tracking how automation changes the American workforce. It doesn't stop AI from transforming industries, but it gives workers and policymakers the facts they need to respond. Transparency can't stop every job loss, but it can help guide smarter policies, retraining programs and career planning.",

      "How the online investment scam began",
      "In August, Joe got a message from a company calling itself\u00a0\"ZAP Solutions.\" It promised that if he invested $30,000, he'd soon have $368,000 in returns. It sounded like a smart move. Like many victims, Joe believed the pitch because it seemed professional and legitimate.",
      "But soon he was led deeper into a trap. Each \"short-term investment\" required another wire transfer. Before he knew it, Joe had sent every penny, his 401K, IRA and other investments.",
      "When the investment scam fell apart",
      "The moment Joe was locked out of his account, panic set in. The scammers demanded more money to \"reactivate\" it. By the end, Joe had lost $228,000.",
      "His mother, Carol, was devastated when she found out.",

      "Staying safe starts with awareness and consistent action. Cybercriminals are getting more creative, so protecting your finances means staying alert every step of the way. Follow these proven steps to safeguard your accounts and identity.",
      "Always verify any investment opportunity before sending money. Look up the company through official government or financial websites, such as the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure database or FINRA's BrokerCheck. Read reviews, confirm licenses and search for scam alerts online.",
      "If a text, email or social media message promises high returns, stop and think. Legitimate firms never cold-contact people about investment offers. Delete suspicious messages immediately and never click on links from unknown sources. Install and regularly update strong antivirus software on all your devices. This can block phishing attempts, malicious downloads, and fake investment platforms designed to steal your data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Before you invest large sums, get a second opinion from a licensed financial advisor. A professional can spot red flags and unrealistic promises that you might overlook.",
      "Protect your personal information by using a data removal or privacy service that scrubs your phone number, address and other details from people search sites. This reduces the chance of scammers finding and targeting you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the Internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "How this AI-powered autonomous truck was built for scale",
      "In early 2025, Waabi and Volvo Autonomous Solutions announced a long-term partnership to develop and deploy autonomous trucks.",
      "Volvo's New River Valley plant in Virginia is producing the VNL Autonomous with six critical redundant or back-up systems \u2014 including dual braking, steering, communication, computing, power, energy storage and motion control \u2014 which are key to safe operations without a driver in the seat.",
      "Waabi provides the Waabi Driver, an end-to-end AI model that learns from experience and adapts to new conditions. The company also uses its advanced simulator, Waabi World, to expose the AI to millions of realistic driving situations before it reaches the road. Waabi calls this approach \"physical AI,\" which allows it to generalize across different environments safely.",
      "\"The future of autonomous trucking depends on technology that is safe, scalable, and built for customer needs,\" said Raquel Urtasun, Founder and CEO of Waabi.\u00a0\"Together with Volvo and NVIDIA, we're leading autonomous freight into a safer and more efficient era.\"",
      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "Volvo\u2019s New River Valley plant builds the VNL Autonomous with six redundant systems to enable driverless operations. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",
      "Why the AI-powered autonomous truck matters for freight",
      "The U.S. freight market continues to face growing demand and a shortage of qualified drivers. AI-powered autonomous trucks offer one of the most promising solutions to keep goods moving. By integrating the self-driving technologies of partners like Aurora Innovation and Waabi into the Volvo VNL Autonomous on the pilot line at its New River Facility in Virginia, Volvo Autonomous Solutions is able to deliver autonomous trucks with OEM-grade quality and consistency.",

Level 4 autonomy in trucking is happening now.\"",
      "Concerns and challenges facing AI-powered trucks",
      "Despite the excitement, driverless freight faces real challenges. Safety remains the top concern as trucks encounter unpredictable weather, road debris and human drivers. While simulation can prepare AI for millions of events, regulators are still defining how to certify systems for nationwide deployment.",
      "The shift toward automation also raises economic questions. Trucking employs millions of drivers across the United States, and experts predict that job roles will evolve as fleets adopt autonomous systems. Labor groups and state officials are calling for retraining programs to help workers transition into new positions that support automation.",
      "Data privacy and cybersecurity are growing priorities, too. These trucks depend on constant cloud connectivity, which makes them potential targets for hackers.",
      "Public perception could also influence how fast adoption moves. Many people like the idea of innovation but hesitate to share the road with fully autonomous vehicles. Building trust will require transparency, safety trials and a strong performance record on open highways.",

      "What comes next for the AI-powered autonomous truck",
      "Volvo and Waabi have already completed the integration of the Waabi Driver with the Volvo VNL Autonomous. The companies describe this milestone as a key step toward Level 4 autonomous operation, meaning the truck will be able to drive itself without human intervention under defined conditions.",
      "This collaboration builds on Volvo Group Venture Capital's early investment in Waabi in 2023 and its later participation in Waabi's $200 million Series B funding round in 2024. That support helped set the stage for this integration and for future broad commercial deployment.",
      "Shahrukh Kazmi, Chief Product Officer at Volvo Autonomous Solutions, said Waabi's technology fits perfectly into Volvo's platform.",
      "\"We are excited to integrate Waabi's cutting-edge system into our autonomous truck and jointly develop a safe, efficient, and scalable transport solution,\" he said.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you depend on deliveries or shop online, driverless freight could soon shape how products reach your home. These AI-powered trucks can operate longer hours than human drivers, reducing shipping delays and potentially lowering transportation costs.",
      "Automation could also make highways safer by cutting down on fatigue-related crashes. With fewer disruptions from freight incidents, travel may become smoother for everyone sharing the road.",
      "This collaboration highlights how artificial intelligence is moving from theory to production lines and changing the way goods move across America.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The road ahead for self-driving freight looks both exciting and uncertain. The progress made by AI-powered trucks shows how far automation has come in solving real challenges like driver shortages and delivery delays. At the same time, it sparks debate about safety, employment and trust in technology.

      "The original batch of documents released online is divided into seven large files roughly centered around the main Nazi criminals covered in them. There are multiple documents related to Adolf Eichmann, the engineer of the \"Final Solution,\" the plan for the extermination of European Jewry.

      "\"On the one hand, it is shameful that Argentina kept these documents a secret for so long, but on the other hand, we also need to acknowledge the enormous efforts being made by this government to make these documents public.

      "\"Jews after World War II lived a golden age of about 80 years where antisemitism had subsided, at least apparently, and they could be productive and contributing members of society. This has now ended \u2014 partially because of the genocide committed against Israelis by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, with world opinion projecting on Israelis and Jews the false role of perpetrators of genocide in the war in Gaza, but also by bringing back the same old antisemitic views that had been alive in Germany and before then,\" Lippman says.",

    "summary": "Trump&apos;s America First policy strengthens Israel alliance for strategic deterrence against Iran, experts say. How supporting Israel protects U.S. interests abroad.",
    "story": [
      "Fred Fleitz, vice chairman of the America First Policy Institute\u2019s Center for American Security, says \"standing with Israel is in our strategic interest.\"",
      "Critics once called it isolationist. But national security experts now say Donald Trump\u2019s \"America First\" strategy is proving to be something else entirely \u2014 a hard-nosed policy of deterrence built on strong alliances, especially with Israel.",
      "Fred Fleitz, vice chair of the America First Policy Institute\u2019s Center for American Security and former chief of staff at the National Security Council, told Fox News Digital that \"The America First approach to U.S. national security means a strong national security policy, a decisive president, keeping our nation out of unnecessary wars, having members of alliances carry their own weight, but it also means standing strongly with Israel and fighting antisemitism.\"",
      "He said supporting Israel is not about sentiment. \"Standing with Israel is in our strategic interest,\" he said. \"Israel is dealing with enemies in the region that the U.S. would have to deal with if it were not there. So it\u2019s in our strategic interest.\"",
      "STATE DEPARTMENT UNVEILS PATRIOTIC 'AMERICA FIRST' REBRAND AS PART OF SWEEPING MAKEOVER",
      "President Donald Trump delivers remarks to the Knesset, Israel's parliament, on Oct. 13, 2025 in Jerusalem. (Evelyn Hockstein/Pool/Getty Images)",
      "Mike Makovsky, CEO of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), said Israel effectively absorbs threats that would otherwise demand U.S. military action. \"Historically, there are about three reasons why we have interests in the region,\" he said. \"One is Israel. Two is oil. And three is Islamic extremism \u2014 terrorism, Shia and Sunni.\"",
      "Makovsky said it is ironic that the America First debate has resurfaced \"only a few months after Israel smoked America\u2019s Mideast enemies.\" He pointed to Iran\u2019s nuclear advances and the role of its proxies. \"They\u2019re building ballistic missiles\u2026 They could reach the eastern seaboard of the United States,\" he said. \"You marry missiles with nukes that could hit the U.S. \u2014 you\u2019ve got the North Koreans on the West Coast; do you really want Iran that could hit the East Coast?\"",
      "According to Makovsky, Israel\u2019s campaign against those threats shows the alliance\u2019s strategic value. \"What did the Israelis just do? They took care of it. The United States came in with the B-2 at the very end\u2026 but it was Israel that did all that work,\" he said.",
      "He added that Israel \"pretty much finished off Hamas,\" weakened Hezbollah \u2014 \"which has hundreds of American soldiers\u2019 blood on their hands\" \u2014 and continues to confront the Houthis to \"ensure freedom of navigation.\" That, he argued, is deterrence in action: \"As long as we support Israel, we give them some help, we give them the weapons they need, they\u2019re really doing our work.\"",
      "Fleitz called Iran \"the biggest threat,\" encompassing \"Iran and Iran\u2019s proxies in the region. This includes Hamas, Hezbollah in Syria, Iran-backed militias in Iraq, and then Iran itself, with its nuclear weapons program and its sponsorship of terror.\"",
      "He said Israel\u2019s actions have \"destroyed Hamas proxies and significantly weakened Iran,\" adding that \"we joined Israel in June in taking on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which was a threat to global security.\"",
      "Both analysts framed Iran as part of a wider axis of power alongside Russia and China, each exploiting Middle East instability to undermine U.S. influence \u2014 by fueling proxy wars, spiking energy prices, and threatening trade routes through the Gulf and the Red Sea. Fleitz said Trump\u2019s willingness to act decisively \"to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear program\" exemplified using strength to prevent costlier wars later.",

The attacks targeted multiple military, scientific and residential locations, as well as senior government officials. (Stringer/Getty Images)",
      "Both agree that energy policy is where America First becomes measurable. Fleitz said that \"energy independence is a very important part of President Trump\u2019s America First policy to free Americans from high energy bills.\" At the same time, he noted, energy diplomacy abroad reinforces economic security at home. \"By pushing the Saudis \u2014 and the Saudis, I think, are happy to help us with this \u2014 to produce more oil, it may actually help us end the war in Ukraine,\" he said.",
      "Makovsky made a similar case for regional stability: \"The biggest threat to the Gulf Arab oil exporters \u2026 is Iran,\" he said. Without Israel\u2019s containment of Tehran, \"Iran would have taken over the Middle East, most likely. And if you care about oil prices, that\u2019s not too good.\"",
      "Both experts said that when Israel shoulders the burden of defending energy corridors and trade routes, Americans save in both dollars and deployments.",

      "Fleitz said Trump\u2019s doctrine is about selective force, not retreat. \"He wants to keep our country out of new and unnecessary wars, but he will use military force prudently to defend our national security,\" he said. \"He is going to avoid sending American troops into certain situations and using military force. But that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t do these things when it is in U.S. strategic interests.\"",
      "He pointed out U.S. personnel who are currently stationed in Israel but \"they\u2019re not going to Gaza\" and \"will not be engaging in combat operations against Hamas.\" Their mission, he said, fits the model of minimal footprint, maximum leverage.",
      "Makovsky warned that abandoning Israel would erode America\u2019s credibility worldwide. He recalled what a senior Arab leader once told him: \"If America doesn\u2019t help Israel attack the nuclear facilities of Iran, it will be one of the great catastrophes.\"",
      "\"That\u2019s because everybody in the Mideast, everyone in Asia, knows that the U.S.\u2013Israel relationship is one of the closest in the world,\" Makovsky said. \"If we don\u2019t help Israel, it undercuts our credibility. The Chinese and the Russians and the North Koreans know that if we\u2019re not going to support Israel, we\u2019re not going to help other allies \u2026 and it would make us more vulnerable to the Chinese without a doubt.\"",

(Photo by Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Fleitz said Trump\u2019s \"20-point peace plan\" for Gaza exemplifies the America First balance between toughness and diplomacy. \"It achieved its two primary objectives, getting all the living hostages out of Israel and enacting a ceasefire,\" he said, acknowledging that \"the ceasefire is fairly shaky.\" The next step, he added, is \"an international stabilization force\" \u2014 a complex process still under negotiation.",

      "Multiple federal agencies have told their employees to report to work Thursday, according to three administration officials. The directive came before President Donald Trump signed a short-term funding bill Wednesday night.",
      "Government workers at the Health and Human Services, Justice, Interior, and Housing and Urban Development departments were all advised to come in Thursday, regardless of when the measure was signed.",
      "One of the emails referred to the funding lapse as the \u201cDemocratic shutdown,\u201d continuing a trend of partisan language on display from various agencies leading up to and during the government\u2019s closure.",
      "State Department employees also were told to return to work Thursday in an email Wednesday night that referred to passage of the short-term government funding bill, known on Capitol Hill as a continuing resolution, or CR, earlier in the evening.",
      "\u201cNow that a CR has been enacted, we can all continue the critical work of advancing our national interests on behalf of the American people,\u201d an undersecretary for management at the department, Jason S. Evans, wrote in email obtained by NBC News. \u201cWe look forward to all our people returning to work expeditiously on your next scheduled workday.\u201d",
      "The Republican-controlled House on Wednesday night approved legislation in a 222 to 209 vote to reopen the government after 43 days, the longest shutdown in American history. Six Democrats joined nearly all Republicans in favor of the measure, while two Republicans joined a vast majority of Democrats in opposing it.",
      "The bill reinstates thousands of government employees who were laid off during the shutdown which began Oct. 1, secures back pay, and protects against additional reductions-in-force through the end of January.",

      "But it remains unclear when full flight schedules and paychecks will be restored after the Federal Aviation Administration was forced to mandate flight restrictions at 40 high-traffic airports last week. On Wednesday night, the FAA ordered that cancellations would remain at 6% on Thursday, after two days at that rate and an initial plan to ramp up to 10% by Friday.",
      "As of Thursday afternoon, more than 1,000 flights within the U.S. had already been canceled for the day, and more than 2,000 were delayed, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. On Wednesday, only 900 flights were canceled \u2014 the lowest number since the FAA flight reductions began.",
      "It is not immediately clear if the flight disruptions were all connected to staffing issues.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced at a Thursday afternoon news conference that some Transportation Security Officers who showed \"exemplary service\" during the shutdown will receive $10,000 bonus checks.",
      "It's not clear how many officers will receive the bonuses, but Noem highlighted a few TSA employees during the news conference who would be receiving the extra pay. She held a stack of white envelopes in her hand before passing them out to many TSA officers at the news conference.",
      "She said those who are receiving bonuses took \"seriously security concerns and measures\" during the shutdown, but also, \"they went above and beyond\" by helping others, serving extra shifts and transporting others back and forth to work.",
      "Airlines have said they are ready to ramp up as soon as they receive government clearance, which includes the FAA lifting the mandate on flight restrictions. And as soon as enough air traffic controllers return to work, ensuring that the increased number of planes can fly safely.",
      "\u201cAs the federal government reopens and controllers receive their backpay, the FAA will continue to monitor staffing levels and review key trend lines,\u201d Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a Wednesday statement.",
      "In a statement, American Airlines said it is ready to return to the regular schedule as soon as the FAA gives the green light, but acknowledged that it may take a few days for controller operations to return to normal levels before the schedule can be restored.",

According to a list of projected pay dates, those in the transportation sector should receive a \"supercheck\" covering pay from Oct. 1 to Nov. 1 on Monday.",
      "Airlines cannot cancel and then un-cancel flights, so they need every puzzle piece to fall into place before the schedule returns to normalcy.",
      "Delta CEO Ed Bastian said on CNBC on Wednesday that he thinks flights will return to normal by the weekend. Southwest said in its statement, \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic that the FAA will allow airlines to resume normal operations within a few days.\u201d",
      "Fortunately, fears of an especially messy Thanksgiving travel week \u2014 when 31 million Americans are set to fly \u2014 have been thwarted, as airlines are ready to go more quickly than previously thought.",
      "Even when flights are operating at 100% again, however, the issue of understaffing at air traffic control locations nationwide remains.",
      "The industry still needs more than 3,000 air traffic controllers to fill staffing gaps and ensure that employees \u2014 many of whom were already working six-day workweeks before the government shutdown \u2014 can return to business as usual.",
      "\u201cWhen the government is funded again nothing will change at BNA,\u201d said Garld Graves, a retired air traffic controller with 28 years of experience, referring to Nashville International Airport",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s once unquestioned grip on his MAGA political base is showing signs of strain as some of his supporters have started pushing back on White House policy proposals they see as contrary to his long-held promises on immigration and the economy.",
      "As Trump takes heat from even the most loyal segments of his political base, he has remained defiant.",
      "\u201cMAGA was my idea. MAGA was nobody else\u2019s idea,\u201d Trump told Fox News host Laura Ingraham in an interview that aired Monday. \u201cI know what MAGA wants better than anybody else, and MAGA wants to see our country thrive.\u201d",
      "Trump remains popular with Republicans, and he\u2019s still able to make or break candidates in Republican primaries \u2014 88% of Republican registered voters approved of Trump in the latest NBC News poll, conducted in late October, before the latest elections. Among voters who consider themselves part of the MAGA movement, it\u2019s even higher \u2014 96% \u2014 highlighting the loyalty he commands from core supporters.",
      "But there\u2019s a belief among some of Trump\u2019s MAGA supporters that is spilling out online that the president is increasingly swayed by wealthy donors who have access to him at private White House events, his exclusive Mar-a-Lago club and the luxury boxes he sits in when he attends sporting events, including a Washington Commanders football game on Sunday.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is instinctually America First, but things are seriously askew,\u201d said Paul Dans, the architect of Project 2025 who is running against Trump-endorsed Sen. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina\u2019s GOP primary. \u201cAmerica First is experiencing a hijacking right now. He\u2019s [Trump\u2019s] getting bad advice and is being kept in a bubble.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a shift in focus that some on the right say can be traced back to the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the influential conservative leader of Turning Point USA who was gunned down in September.",
      "\u201cCharlie Kirk was the last person who could walk into the Oval Office and speak on behalf of the base,\u201d Mike Cernovich, a prominent MAGA social media personality, posted on X. \u201cNow it\u2019s all donors.\u201d",
      "The White House pushed back on the idea that Trump is distancing himself from the ethos of his MAGA agenda on key policy planks, such as on H-1B visas.",
      "\u201cIn record time, President Trump has done more than any president in modern history to tighten our immigration laws and put American workers first,\u201d White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said.",
      "On Wednesday, the Trump administration had to contend with another issue that has divided and frustrated his base: the case of Jeffrey Epstein. The House Oversight Committee released more than 20,000 pages of Epstein emails \u2014 some of which discussed Trump. A bipartisan pair of House lawmakers also secured enough signatures \u2014 including from some Trump allies \u2014 to force a vote in the coming days compelling the Justice Department to release all of its documents in the Epstein case against Trump\u2019s wishes.",
      "A Trump ally said that if the issues prompting loud online pushback continue, there could be broader political problems electorally for Trump and Republicans. But, they said, they are not convinced that point has been reached yet, because past base concern has often been overblown.",
      "\u201cSure, could this all end up adding up and become a real problem? Yes, it could,\u201d said the person, who, like others in this article, was granted anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cBut that, I do not think, is the point we are at yet. Worth watching, sure, but I think much of this will pass.\u201d",
      "'What an atrocious thing to say'",
      "The right-wing backlash intensified this week following Trump\u2019s interview with Ingraham, which aired Monday and Tuesday. Trump batted away concerns about affordability as a Democratic \u201ccon job,\u201d and he said a controversial new proposal for 50-year mortgages was \u201cnot even a big deal.\u201d He also talked up having 600,000 Chinese students study at U.S. universities and said the U.S. needed to bring in more workers from overseas through the H-1B visa program because native-born Americans lack \u201ccertain talents.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat an atrocious thing to say,\u201d actor and Trump supporter Kevin Sorbo posted on X of Trump\u2019s comments on American workers. \u201cThis will cost republicans the midterms.\u201d",
      "The H-1B visa issue has split two segments of the new GOP base. The right-wing MAGA supporters who have long backed Trump oppose the program because they believe it hands over jobs to foreigners that could be filled by Americans, while the tech industry, a newly powerful political force on the right, has long supported the program as a way to recruit high-skill labor.",
      "On his \u201cHuman Events\u201d program Wednesday, right-wing influencer Jack Posobiec scrutinized Trump\u2019s visa policy following his interview with Ingraham and asked Tom Sauer, another influencer on the right, \u201cwhat message\u201d the administration\u2019s posture sends to MAGA supporters.",
      "\u201cI think it really says we don\u2019t value you as much,\u201d Sauer said. \u201cWe worship GDP, and we worship profits more than we do the health of the American worker and the health of the American nation.\u201d",
      "The White House pushed back on the idea that Trump\u2019s recent comments were not aligned with the MAGA political base, noting an executive order he signed increasing the cost it takes to obtain an H-1B visa.",
      "\u201cThe $100,000 payment required to supplement new H1-B visa applications is a significant first step to stop abuses of the system and ensure American workers are no longer replaced by lower-paid foreign labor,\u201d Rogers, the White House spokesperson, said.",
      "The idea for a 50-year mortgage \u2014 which was not something Trump previously touted \u2014 also faced withering criticisms. Commentators said the proposal would lead to homeowners paying significantly more in interest over the life of their mortgage, something that would benefit banks that hold those mortgages.",
      "\u201cThe idea behind the 15- and 30-year mortgage is that you eventually own the home you live in, whereas the 50-year mortgage abandons this pretense altogether and fully embraces the idea of housing as a speculative asset,\u201d right-wing activist Christopher Rufo posted on X. \u201cNot good, unless you\u2019re a bank.\u201d",
      "Others defended the president, saying critics had their facts wrong while acknowledging that the White House may need to work on its messaging. Trump said during his interview with Ingraham that he is comfortable with 600,000 Chinese students studying in American universities on visas \u2014 which is roughly current levels \u2014 but angered many in his MAGA base who believe Trump promised to decrease those numbers.",
      "\u201cThis is about one interview, not any policy changes,\u201d a former Trump campaign official said of the Ingraham interview. \u201cOn the Chinese visas, he\u2019s not pushing for more; it\u2019s just the status quo. On H-1Bs, he signed an executive order making them more expensive, and the Labor Department has announced probes into H-1B abuse.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo, it\u2019s not like he did a 180 on anything,\u201d the former official added. \u201cIt\u2019s just bad clips from an interview.\u201d",
      "'Get out and meet with the people'",
      "Trump has run all three of his presidential campaigns as a populist, but throughout this term, he has been surrounded by billionaires. At his inauguration, some of the richest men in the world \u2014 Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and tech titan Elon Musk \u2014 had VIP seats. Musk then became one of Trump\u2019s top advisers, wreaking havoc on the federal government by trying to get rid of large numbers of civil servants.",
      "Trump frequently spends his weekends at Mar-a-Lago. He received criticism for hosting a lavish \u201cGreat Gatsby\u201d-inspired Halloween party \u2014 with the theme \u201cA Little Party Never Killed Nobody\u201d \u2014 as federal workers went without pay and low-income food benefits were set to expire for millions of people during the government shutdown.",
      "Trump has also traveled across the country less in his second administration. At this point in his first term, he had gone to 27 states; this year, he\u2019s done just 15. He hasn\u2019t held a rally-style event since July 3. Trump has, however, done a significant amount of international travel, going to 14 countries.",
      "Dans said that as Americans are struggling with rising electric and utility bills, property taxes and health care premiums, the president needed to go around the country and hear from more than just the \u201cMar-a-Lago dining set.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would encourage the president to get out and meet with the people and actually hear from voices who are being shut out by the inner circle,\u201d he said.",
      "Seeming to respond to right-wing criticism that the president\u2019s attention has drifted from key domestic issues, Vice President JD Vance posted on X after last week\u2019s Democratic electoral romps: \u201cWe need to focus on the home front.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe president has done a lot that has already paid off in lower interest rates and lower inflation, but we inherited a disaster from Joe Biden and Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day,\u201d he added.",
      "This is not the first time this year Trump has faced pointed criticism from supporters. A number of prominent voices on the right raised objections to his decision to strike Iran over the summer amid its conflict with Israel. Many too blasted the administration for pledging to release a trove of information on Epstein before suddenly pulling back.",
      "That blowback subsided. But last week\u2019s elections reignited some concerns, after Democrats performed better than expected in key races. NBC News polling released earlier this month showed that just 34% of registered voters believe Trump has \u201clived up\u201d to expectations on the economy.",
      "The president \u201cneeds to recalibrate and address the big stuff,\u201d one Trump ally said, pointing to inflation, jobs and the overall economy. This person also said the president needs to talk up policies from his so-called big, beautiful bill, which polling has found to be unpopular as a whole.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve watched the right wing implode over the last two weeks and the reason we are is because many are afraid to legitimately criticize the admin,\u201d Savanah Hernandez, a conservative political commentator, posted on X on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to openly put the pressure on when we don\u2019t feel the country is headed in the right direction.\u201d",
      "But the former campaign official said on one of Trump\u2019s core promises, immigration, he has been consistent. They noted that those who have been let into the country of late have mostly been white South Africans, a move largely backed by Trump supporters.",
      "\u201cObviously, refugee admissions are hilariously low and mostly white South Africans,\u201d the person said, adding that \u201ca lot of the loudest voices on the right online\u201d tend to \u201cspiral over everything.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is one thing hard to deal with,\u201d they said.",

      "Oscar voters are getting some extra homework this awards season.",
      "An email obtained by NBC News shows how Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences members must confirm that they have watched all the movies nominated in each category in order to be allowed to vote.",
      "The email, which has not previously been made public, provided guidance on what steps the more than 10,000 voting academy members need to take ahead of the final Oscar ballot deadline March 5.",
      "The academy has long required members who vote in certain preliminary rounds, such as those who determine the short list for international films, to confirm that they have watched a group of assigned movies. In April, it revised that policy to note that academy members must watch every Oscar-nominated film in order to vote.",
      "The email appears to be the first time the organization is offering detailed information on how the new rule will be enforced. To be eligible to vote, members must watch all five films in each Oscar category and all 10 in the best picture category, the academy said.",
      "\u201cYou do not need to save movie stubs, tickets or receipts,\u201d the academy wrote in its Oct. 30 email to its voting members. \u201cThis is an honor system.\u201d",
      "With the new policy, films that members watch on the Academy Screening Room (ASR), a streaming service run by the academy, will be automatically verified. For films that members watch elsewhere, such as at film festivals, private for-your-consideration events or a local multiplex, they must manually mark it \u201cwatched\u201d on the streaming service, member website or academy app.",
      "\u201cKeep an eye out for eligibility notifications prior to finals voting,\u201d the academy said in its email. \u201cMembers will be notified of the categories in which they still need to watch films to be eligible to vote.\u201d",
      "While largely applauding the intent of the new policy, three academy members, who declined to speak on the record to maintain professional relationships within the organization, pointed out that it will be difficult to police. Members can start a movie on the streaming service, for instance, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re actually watching it.",
      "The academy declined to comment.",
      "Partly the new rule\u2019s timing reflects an evolution in how Oscar voters watch the nominated films. In 2019, the academy made its best picture nominees available on Academy Screening Room, and now the organization has its own data about who is \u2014 and isn\u2019t \u2014 watching the nominees there.",
      "The idea behind the new rule is to curtail a phenomenon in which academy members who are fans of certain films vote for it in every category on the ballot, regardless of whether they have seen all the other films in those categories.",
      "For example, Neon\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d swept the award show this year, taking home wins in five categories including best picture, best director for Sean Baker and best actress for Mikey Madison. But it\u2019s unclear whether the people who voted for \u201cAnora\u201d multiple times watched other, less buzzy contenders, such as Amazon MGM\u2019s \u201cNickel Boys,\u201d which was nominated in the best picture and adapted screenplay categories, or Sony Pictures Classics\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d which won international feature and was nominated in best actress for Brazil\u2019s Fernanda Torres.",
      "The academy also made several other changes around the Oscars, including the introduction of a new award for achievement in casting, which will be given out in 2026, and an award for achievement in stunt design, which will be handed out for the first time in 2028.",
      "The Oscar nominations will be announced Jan. 26, and the 98th annual Academy Awards will take place March 15. Conan O\u2019Brien, who hosted 2025\u2019s ceremony, will return to the Oscars stage next year."

      "FORT HOOD, Texas \u2014 The commander of the Army medical center where a gynecologist who saw hundreds of service members and their spouses is accused of sexual misconduct said investigators continue to receive new allegations from patients.",
      "Col. Mark Jacques, the commander of Darnall Army Medical Center at Fort Hood military base, said in an interview with NBC News that he sent a letter to more than 1,400 of the gynecologist\u2019s patients to inform them of the probe and created a hotline for them to call to report complaints. As many as 85 patients have reached out to the Army Criminal Investigation Division, or CID, he said, although it\u2019s not clear if all of them were victims of misconduct.",
      "At least 30 women have been identified by Army investigators as having been photographed or videotaped by the gynecologist, according to a patient who was told of that number by investigators and two Army officials.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m devastated that these patients and their families have to endure this and have to go through this,\u201d Jacques said.",
      "The gynecologist, Dr. Blaine McGraw, is named in a lawsuit filed on Monday by one of his former patients under the name Jane Doe to protect her identity, NBC News reported. The lawsuit accuses McGraw of recording intimate videos of a patient without her knowledge and alleges there are scores of other women who are victims of his misconduct. It also says Army leadership received complaints about sexual misconduct by McGraw dating back years and allowed him to continue practicing.",
      "Jacques said he was not aware of any such complaints or concerns since he took command of the medical center in June.",
      "Daniel Conway, an attorney for McGraw, said in a statement, \u201cDr. McGraw is fully cooperative with the investigation. We have reason to believe, however, that Army special agents are providing members of the public with inaccurate and exaggerated information. We can think of no other reason for inaccurate leaks than to influence the outcome of the case. We, nonetheless, remain cooperative.\u201d",
      "Two women, whose names NBC News is withholding at their request, said they were both patients of McGraw\u2019s and had not been interviewed by Army CID. One of them, who said she did not receive the letter from Jacques, said she fears her privacy may have been violated. \u201cHe might have pictures of me, and I don\u2019t even know,\u201d she said. The other woman said she received Jacques\u2019 letter.",
      "NBC News has verified that McGraw was their doctor.",
      "Another one of McGraw\u2019s patients, whom NBC News is calling \u201cErin\u201d because she asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case, said she received a call from Army criminal investigators on Oct. 28. Erin said she started seeing McGraw earlier this year for a high-risk pregnancy. She said Army investigators sent her a still image they had found on McGraw\u2019s phone that they thought might be of her.",
      "She said when she looked at the image, she recognized herself instantly. It was a snapshot of her during one of the most trying times of her life \u2014 she was in the intensive care unit at the Army hospital dealing with complications from her delivery, she said.",
      "\u201cI was in the room by myself for that treatment, and he came in around 11 at night and was basically conversational \u2014 and he said, \u2018I\u2019ve got great news. We are sending you home early,\u2019\u201d the woman recounted. She said she was groggy from the medication she\u2019d needed for the procedure when he asked how things were going. She told him breastfeeding was not going very well for her, at which point he asked to take a look, she said.",
      "What she didn\u2019t know at the time, but realized as soon as she saw the image from Army investigators, was that McGraw had recorded his examination of her breasts, she said.",
      "During her interview with Army investigators, she said they told her that the images of patients on McGraw\u2019s phone went back to February 2025.",
      "Jacques said he learned on Oct. 17 that a patient had made allegations. The gynecologist was immediately suspended and stripped of his access to any patient treatment areas and electronic medical records, and the Army opened a criminal investigation that same day, he said.",
      "\u201cEverything we do in this organization, the reason people come to work every day, is to take care of patients, to take care of Army soldiers, their families and the community,\u201d Jacques said. \u201cThose allegations were not in line with that. They were opposed to the safe treatment of patients, how we take care of patients with respect. And as a result, the investigation is ongoing.\u201d",
      "The letter Jacques sent to 1,400 patients, which was obtained by NBC News, includes a QR code to access a questionnaire from Army CID.",
      "\u201cWe are writing to inform you of an investigation involving a healthcare provider who has previously provided Gynecological and Obstetric care at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center,\u201d the letter states. \u201cWhile your name appears on the list of patients seen by this provider, there are currently no indications you were affected by the alleged misconduct currently under review.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit filed on Monday said the plaintiff learned from Army investigators that McGraw had secretly recorded her during breast and pelvic examinations.",
      "The lawsuit also accuses McGraw of inappropriate touching, crude remarks and performing unnecessary medical procedures on multiple patients. It also alleges he would call his patients at home to discuss matters unrelated to medical care and dismiss female chaperones in examination rooms, raising questions about whether he had informed his patients they have a right to have a chaperone present during an appointment.",
      "\u201cThese allegations that were raised are not in line with me as a physician or with me as a soldier who lives by the Army values,\u201d Jacques said. \u201cThis is not acceptable, and that\u2019s why, as the commander, I take responsibility to ensure that, moving forward, we cover every area and every basis to ensure that this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d"

The president nominated her in July to serve in the role permanently after her term expired but a federal judge ruled in August that the appointment was unlawful. The judge paused his decision while the appeals process plays out, so she has remained in the role."

      "A former prosecutor, Swalwell was one of the earliest Democrats to call for investigation into allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and played a role in both of Trump\u2019s impeachment proceedings. He has said that he \u201cfully\u201d expects to be prosecuted by the Trump administration, telling CNN in September that he is \u201cready for it.\u201d",

      "\u201cIs it mortgage fraud to say that you live in one area and not another area? Yes, it is mortgage fraud,\u201d Pulte said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be intimidated.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Eating more ultra-processed foods is tied to an increased risk of precancerous colorectal growths in women under 50, according to a study published Thursday in JAMA Oncology.",
      "These growths, called adenomas or polyps, can later turn into cancer and are a good indicator of a person\u2019s cancer risk, experts say.",
      "Rates of colorectal cancer in people under 50 have risen sharply in recent decades. The findings could offer new insights into what\u2019s driving this increase.",
      "\u201cOne approach we\u2019ve been taking is trying to understand what has changed in our environment that could be driving this. What are some trends that mirror this acceleration in cancer rates?\u201d said study leader Dr. Andrew Chan, a gastroenterologist and the chief of the clinical and translational epidemiology unit at Massachusetts General Brigham in Boston.",
      "Ultra-processed foods now make up the bulk of the average American\u2019s diet, especially among kids. The foods, which tend to be high in calories, have been linked to depression, Type 2 diabetes and early death. Some experts have also suspected eating these foods could be driving the increase in colorectal cancer rates among young people.",
      "To test this hypothesis, Chan and his team used data from more than 29,000 women who participated in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II, an ongoing study of female registered nurses established in 1989. The women, who were between 24 and 42 when they enrolled in the study, were followed for 24 years, from 1991 through 2015. Every four years, everyone filled out a questionnaire about their diets, and everyone had at least one colonoscopy before 50.",
      "The researchers looked at whether the women were diagnosed with precancerous polyps: either adenomas, which are more likely to turn into cancer, or serrated lesions. While only about 5% of adenomas are cancerous, about 75% of colorectal cancers start as adenomas, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Serrated lesions are still considered precancerous but are linked to fewer cases of colorectal cancer, Chan said.",
      "The study found a connection between eating more ultra-processed foods and developing an adenoma before 50. It didn\u2019t see any links between the foods and serrated lesions.",
      "Because the majority of colon cancers arise from adenomas, the study showing  a link between eating more ultra-processed foods and an increased risk of developing adenomas specifically gave Chan and his team more confidence that these foods could increase colorectal cancer risk, he said.",
      "\u201cThe strength was that we looked at two major types of polyps \u2014 it\u2019s the adenoma type that seems to underlie cancer, and we saw the link between that,\u201d he said. \u201c",
      "About 1,200 women in the study developed adenomas. Compared to those who ate the fewest ultra-processed foods, those who ate the most \u2014 accounting for one-third of their daily calories \u2014 were about 1.5 times more likely to develop adenomas. Specific foods also appeared to increase risk. Diets higher in sugar and artificial sweeteners were most linked to higher rates of adenomas, followed by diets high in sauces, spreads and condiments.",
      "Although the study included only women, the majority of whom were white, other studies have also found a link between men eating more ultra-processed foods and developing cancer.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have any reason to believe there would be a difference in men compared to women,\u201d Chan said, adding that additional research should include men to be sure.",
      "Most colorectal polyps do not turn into cancer, but nearly all colorectal cancer does start as a polyp, said Dr. Folasade May, a gastroenterologist and an associate professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, who wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",
      "This is why doctors remove any polyps they find during a colonoscopy, and why people who have polyps are considered to be at higher risk for developing colorectal cancer.",
      "\u201cThey are looking at the first step, who is more likely to get these polyps that can turn into cancer,\u201d May said of the study.",
      "The problem is that routine screening for colorectal cancer does not happen until age 45, said Dr. Christopher Lieu, the co-director of gastrointestinal medical oncology at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine in Aurora.",
      "\u201cThe concern is that whenever you have a polyp in a young person, that polyp is allowed to grow unnoticed, and because you are not screening those young patients,\u201d Lieu said. This makes it even more important to identify the modifiable lifestyle factors that are driving increased rates of colorectal cancer in young people, added Lieu, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new research.",
      "Although scientists have yet to determine a clear cause, the rise in rates is unlikely to be driven by genetics, May said.",
      "\u201cThis has happened very fast, so it is likely unfortunately something we have done to ourselves as humans, in the way we live our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s jarring, hearing stories every week about people in their 20s, 30s, 40s getting cancers that, when I was in medical school, we were taught happen in people in their 80s.\u201d",
      "Ultra-processed foods cause inflammation in the gut \u2014 which includes the colon \u2014 that impairs the gut\u2019s ability to repair itself when damaged and keep tumors at bay. High levels of inflammation are also linked to cancer in general, May said. Another hypothesis is that people who eat more ultra-processed foods are more likely to have obesity and Type 2 diabetes, both which are linked to a higher risk for colorectal cancer.",
      "\u201cMore likely, it\u2019s the direct toxic effects of these ultra-processed foods,\u201d May said.",
      "Chan, the study author, said ultra-processed foods are known to alter the gut microbiome, which, in theory, could make cells in the gut more likely to turn cancerous.",
      "The next step in the research is determining whether any of these hypotheses appear to have a causal effect on who develops colorectal cancer at a young age. It\u2019s likely part of the puzzle, Chan said.",
      "\u201cOne thing that has been clear is that the U.S. intake of ultra-processed food has really risen in the past few decades in a way that mirrors the staggering increase in colorectal cancer cases,\u201d he said."

      "\"The thing that shocked me most was a win \u2014\u00a0Bobby Bones,\" he responded. \"That was when I went, 'Uhh.' .... Bobby Bones was the first time ... it was like, 'Ouch.' No disrespect to Bobby. He would probably say the same thing.\"",
      "Bones clapped back at Bergeron's snub in his video.",
      "\"This was hurtful and not because of what was said, but really who said it ... Am I supposed to not show up and work hard? Am I supposed to not give it freaking everything that I have? Am I supposed to throw it and not win?\u201d he said.",
      "\"It\u2019s crazy the amount of hate I get even from people that I respect like Tom Bergeron there and Julianne Hough ...I feel like a sixth-grader and all the 9th grade dancing kids are shoving me in lockers,\" Bones continued. (Hough appeared on \"Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen\" in August 2024 and agreed with fellow guest Mickey Guyton that Bones was the winner they \"strongly disagreed with,\" E! News reported at the time. Hough also said Bones \"was not the best dancer.\")",
      "The radio host said the many \"random shots\" he's received from DWTS personalities have \"taken all the joy\" out of his win.",
      "\u201cI had a great attitude, I worked hard and here we are six years later, I\u2019m still catching strays out of nowhere,\" he said. \"So I sent the trophy back. They don't want me to be a part of the show, obviously.\"",
      "Bones did not clarify in the clip when he decided to return his Mirrorball trophy.",
      "Following Bones' video, Bergeron apologized in a direct message, sharing a screenshot of it on his Instagram story.",
      "\u201cBobby, it wasn\u2019t my intention to hurt your feelings. My \u2018ouch\u2019 was based on my honest feeling that your win spoke to a need to address the balance between judge and viewer voting,\" Bergeron wrote.",
      "He further explained, \"I always felt bad that both you & Sharna had to deal with the aftermath of that win & I certainly regret pouring any salt into that old wound.\"",
      "At the top of his screenshot, Bergeron wrote, \"I was doing so many interviews leading up to the 20th, I was bound to say something inelegantly,\" and added a facepalming emoji.",
      "Bones and Burgess won Season 27 in 2018, besting runners-up Milo Manheim and pro Witney Carson. When the competition show returned for Season 28, a new element was added that allowed the judges to save one of the bottom two couples every week.",
      "Currently, the judges' scores are combined with the viewers' votes every week to determine who goes home."

    "story": [
      "Kim Kardashian said she had no room for error when it came to the California bar exam.",
      "In the latest episode of \"The Kardashians,\" which was filmed three months before Kardashian took the bar exam and failed, she explained why she needed to pass the test on the first try.",
      "The reality TV star said she spent about \"nine hours a day\" studying and was happy to wrap her Hulu show \"All's Fair\" so she could focus more on her studies.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really just excited to have \u2018All\u2019s Fair\u2019 wrapped and behind me so that I can just dive right on into studying and make that my No. 1 focus,\" she said on Season 7, Episode 4, of the series.",
      "In a confessional, Kardashian admitted that she was feeling \"exhausted.\"",
      "When a producer asked her if she was \"nervous\" about taking the bar, she responded, yes.",
      "\u201cYeah! Absolutely. I\u2019m not ready yet,\" she said. \"You know, you feel like you don\u2019t know anything and then it all clicks and then you feel like you don\u2019t know it. It\u2019s just the craziest, most emotional roller coaster.\"",
      "\"I really do need to pass on the first try,\" Kardashian added. \"I don\u2019t have another few months I can give up.\"",
      "The State Bar of California released the results of its July 2025 exam on Nov. 7, announcing that 54.8% of exam takers passed. Just over 7,300 people took the test, 73.9% of which were first-time test takers. The pass rate for first-time takers was 69.7%, per the state bar.",
      "Kardashian\u2019s name was not included in the publicly available pass list.",
      "She spoke about failing the bar in a TikTok video that she filmed while getting ready for her mother's 70th birthday party. Kardashian told someone on the phone that fortune tellers had inaccurately predicted her future.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just letting you guys know that all of the f--king psychics that we have met with and that we\u2019re obsessed with are all f--king full of s--t,\" she said angrily. \u201cThey all collectively \u2014 maybe four of them have told me that I was going to pass the bar, so they\u2019re all full pathological liars. Don't believe anything they say.\"",
      "Last May, Kardashian completed her law program after six years of studying. Now that she's failed the bar, she'll have to re-take the test. The bar is given twice a year, in July and February."

    "story": [
      "Small business owners Jaclyn and Kevin Elbaum are always tickled pink when someone wears one of their beautiful pieces of jewelry. But they were enchanted to see one of the world's biggest stars sporting not one, but two special items from their collection last week.",
      "On Nov. 5, Taylor Swift was spotted wearing a stunning yellow gold diamond lock necklace and a diamond chain lariat during a date night with fianc\u00e9 Travis Kelce in New York City.",
      "Word quickly spread that the items came from the Elbaums\u2019 brand, Audry Rose, which the couple founded in 2015.",
      "\u201cIt felt like a top 10 life moment kind of thing,\u201d Kevin Elbaum tells TODAY.com in a joint interview with his wife, calling the experience \u201csurreal.\u201d",
      "The married couple first learned that Swift was a fan of their jewelry while they were sitting down to dinner with their family.",
      "\u201cOne of my friends, she just saw it and she calls me and was like, \u2018I think this is your necklace.\u2019 And so I open up Instagram and I zoom in and I was like, \u2018Oh my God, that is my necklace,\u2019\u201d Jaclyn Elbaum recalls.",
      "The mother of two's animated reaction initially concerned her husband.",
      "\"I wasn\u2019t sure if someone had died. I couldn\u2019t figure it out because her reaction was so insane that my heart sank,\" Kevin Elbaum says.",
      "He decided to film his wife's reaction and post it on Instagram. In the video, Jaclyn Elbaum holds back tears as she looks at the photo of Swift wearing the two necklaces.",
      "The couple was especially touched by Swift's selections. The \"Life of a Showgirl\" singer wore two pieces from their collection that hold special meaning to their family.",
      "Jaclyn Elbaum designed the Pave Diamond Lock Necklace around five years ago and says the piece is \u201creally close to my heart.\u201d",
      "Every part of the necklace is handmade, including the chain, which is named after the couple\u2019s daughter Sloan.",
      "\u201cShe couldn\u2019t have picked a more important piece to us,\u201d Kevin Elbaum adds.",
      "The lariat that Swift paired with the lock necklace also holds sentimental value: Jaclyn Elbaum designed it for her mother\u2019s 70th birthday.",
      "A Life-Changing Moment for a Small Business",
      "The Elbaums are the latest small business owners to experience the \"Taylor Swift effect,\" referring to the singer's cultural and economic influence. Other examples include the NFL's increase in female viewership after Swift started dating Kelce and jewelry designer Kindred Lubeck's explosion in social media followers after Kelce proposed with one of her rings.",
      "Even in their wildest dreams, the Elbaums had never imagined something like this could happen to their small business.",
      "\"We don\u2019t have a publicist or anything. We hadn\u2019t tried to get it to her, so we really were completely blindsided that this could even happen. We assumed the only way it could happen was if you got it to her stylist or something,\u201d Kevin Elbaum says.",
      "Ever since the photo of Swift wearing their jewelry went viral, the Elbaums have noticed an uptick in traffic to their brand\u2019s website and more people purchasing the $7,800 lock necklace.",
      "They\u2019ve since added a sterling silver version of the lock necklace that retails for $890.",
      "The Elbaums say they're incredibly grateful for Swift's support of small businesses.",
      "\"We would have paid her to have the necklace. This is clearly a passion project for her to just sprinkle the Taylor aura around to businesses she likes, so it\u2019s really special,\" Kevin Elbaum says.",
      "Jaclyn Elbaum adds that Swift \"clearly cares about the craft and how things are made.\"",
      "After seeing the photo of Swift wearing items from their brand, the Elbaums emailed the singer's team to express their gratitude.",
      "\"I appreciate what she does to all small businesses, not just ours. It's really a special thing to see,\" Jaclyn Elbaum says.",
      "A Launchpad for a 'New Phase'",
      "The Elbaums started Audry Rose in 2015 shortly after Jaclyn Elbaum's grandmother, the brand's namesake, passed away.",
      "\"She started in the clothing industry and was entrepreneurial before that was really a thing for women. She was really ahead of her time and I always looked up to her. She was always a role model for me. Quality of things was always very important to her, so we wanted that to be infused into the brand,\" Jaclyn Elbaum says.",
      "Before the launch of their brand, Kevin Elbaum specialized in customer acquisition while Jaclyn Elbaum worked in the fashion industry.",
      "\u201cI always really wanted to do something with her, and it was just getting her over her fear to jump with me,\u201d Kevin Elbaum says.",
      "The Elbaums say it'll be a long time before they're able to shake off the feeling of seeing Swift wearing one of their designs.",
      "Looking ahead, the couple hopes this is simply the beginning of a new phase for their brand.",
      "\"I want everyone to know quality for us is really important and I hope other people trust our brand like she did,\" Jaclyn Elbaum says. \"We\u2019re just really excited to keep going, keep designing, keep growing.\"",
      "This moment will certainly be hard to beat, but the Elbaums are excited to see what's next.",
      "\"We're just kind of trying to keep moving forward and hoping for some other special moment in the next 10 years,\" Kevin Elbaum says."

    "summary": "Palm Royale is back for Season 2. Find out Robert's fate and what happened after he was shot in the Season 1 finale.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: Spoiler alert for Season 2, Episode 1 of \u201cPalm Royale.\u201d",
      "\u201cPalm Royale\u201d Season 1 ended with a bang and started with one as well.",
      "The finale of the Apple TV+ show ended with Ricky Martin\u2019s character, Robert, accidentally getting shot by Mary (Julia Duffy) after she attempted to assassinate President Nixon. The final scene showed Robert, who was pretending to be Astronaut Grant, bleeding on the floor.",
      "With Season 2 of \u201cPalm Royale\u201d premiering Nov. 12, fans are curious to know: Is Robert dead?",
      "\u201cWell, we\u2019re not saying he (dies),\u201d creator Abe Sylvia previously told TODAY.com following the 2024 finale. \u201cThis is a classic soap opera cliffhanger.\u201d",
      "The showrunner also noted that if people looked closer, he was still breathing. But did Robert survive?",
      "Season 2 begins with a major musical production. Maxine Dellacorte (Kristen Wiig) returns to the Palm Royale and orders a drink, but instead of her signature cocktail, a grasshopper, she gets served a martini.",
      "When she asks the waiter where Robert is, he says he's getting ready for \u201chis big number.\u201d Confused, she enters the ballroom and to her surprise Robert, in a snazzy and bedazzled tuxedo, starts singing \u201cComin\u2019 Home Baby,\u201d complete with dancers and backup singers.",
      "It becomes a whole production when Maxine, in a bright yellow two-piece ensemble, gets on the table and starts to perform her own dance routine. The performance, Sylvia tells TODAY, is the \u201cmusical number of my dreams.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe wanted to start with a bang. I\u2019m such a huge fan of movie musicals. I started as a dancer myself, and so I brought a whole book full of inspirations to the designers and brought in the choreographer,\u201d Sylvia says. \u201cIt\u2019s a mash up of a lot of my personal influences, and I was just so grateful that everybody brought their A-game and that we were able to make the musical number of my dreams.\u201d",
      "Shot in one day from beginning to end in a single take, he says, the dancers rehearsed for about three days while the costumes took weeks. They also built the set from scratch.",
      "However, as the performance continues, Robert is shot and begins to bleed. Maxine, still on top of the table, is dragged away from Robert as flashbacks of the Season 1 finale when he was shot appear on screen. The musical number continues and ends with Robert on the floor.",
      "It turns out Maxine was hallucinating and admitted into mental institute Sunny Tides. They have drugged her and she keeps asking for Robert.",
      "Robert is then seen unconscious in a hospital bed with Norma (Carol Burnett) by his side asking how he knew her name. Robert appears to be alive, for now.",
      "As viewers recall, Robert discovered that Norma was really Agnes and stole her identity. This was after Norma asked Robert to marry her so that he could inherit all her wealth.",
      "In the second season's first episode, Norma begins to put the pieces together.",
      "But will Robert survive and be a threat to Norma?",
      "In one scene, Maxine escapes Sunny Tides and visits Robert at the hospital. She hides underneath the hospital bed as Norma walks in and the doctor tells her that Robert is \u201ctouch and go,\u201d leaning on go. If he does wake up, the doctor says, his speech will be their first sign of hope and from there they will assess for any brain damage.",
      "After the doctor leaves, Norma talks to an unconscious Robert and tells him, \u201cI know who told you about Agnes.\u201d",
      "By the end of the episode, Robert opens his eyes and simply says, \u201cAgnes.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so funny because I read the last episode last season and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, am I dying?\u2019 and then Abe told me, \u2018Oh, Ricky, I\u2019m sorry I forgot to tell you, you\u2019re not going to die,\u2019\u201d Martin tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut I am open to anything.\u201d",
      "Kristen Wiig adds that \u201cit\u2019s been hard to keep\u201d Robert\u2019s fate a secret, \u201cbecause people have seen photos. So it\u2019s been really hard for us to be like, \u2018Is he a ghost?\u2019\u201d",
      "But as viewers know, if anyone gets in Norma's way, their future could be up in the air.",
      "Sylvia notes that this season he played with different genres, including the theme of \u201860s \u201cbitty horror movies.\u201d He cites \u201cWhatever Happened to Baby Jane\u201d and \u201cHush\u2026 Hush, Sweet Charlotte\u201c as inspiration.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to bring an element of that to us. Even though the show is ostensibly a comedy, we want people on the edge of their seat and have this element of thriller to it,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd as you make your way through the season, that just keeps building and building and building.\u201d",
      "As for Martin and Wiig, they joke that \u201ca fake death every season\u201d would be \u201cfunny.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou haven\u2019t gotten to 10, so who knows what happens,\u201d quips Wiig, with Martin adding, \u201cYou have to see Episode 10.\u201d",
      "New episodes of \u201cPalm Royale\u201d premiere weekly on Wednesdays on Apple TV+."

      "BOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 Intelligence \u201cis not for killing,\u201d Colombian President Gustavo Petro told NBC News in a wide-ranging interview Wednesday, explaining his decision to stop sharing information with the United States in opposition to lethal strikes on boats allegedly carrying illegal drugs.",
      "Describing President Donald Trump as a \u201cbarbarian\u201d who \u201cwants to frighten us,\u201d Petro, a former Marxist revolutionary and one of the few international leaders willing to openly criticize his American counterpart, called the U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean \u201cundoubtedly an aggression against Latin America.\u201d",
      "Colombia would not \u201cpass on the information because we would be collaborating with a crime against humanity,\u201d he told NBC News at the presidential palace in Bogota, reiterating a decision announced earlier this week.",
      "Acknowledging \u201cthe most key thing is intelligence\u201d in combating the drug trade, he added, \u201cThe more we coordinate intelligence, the better. That is what I have been doing. But intelligence is not for killing.\u201d",
      "Tensions have risen dramatically between Trump and Petro in recent weeks over the issue of American military attacks against boats allegedly carrying illegal narcotics in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, which have killed dozens. At least 19 strikes have been carried out so far, according to Reuters.",
      "Trump has justified them by saying the United States is in \u201carmed conflict\u201d with drug cartels and claiming the boats are operated by foreign terror organizations that are flooding America\u2019s cities with drugs.",
      "But his administration has provided no evidence for these assertions and lawmakers, including Republicans, have pressed for more information on who is being targeted and the legal justification for the strikes.",
      "A White House official said in an email Thursday that it was \u201chardly surprising\u201d that Petro was opposed to Trump\u2019s \u201csuccessful operations to halt the flow of drugs to our country.\u201d They added that Trump had directed the actions \u201cconsistent with his responsibility to protect Americans and United States interests abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests.\u201d",
      "\u201cDespite billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars invested in Colombia\u2019s counterdrug efforts, cartels are thriving under Petro\u2019s failed policies,\u201d they said.",
      "Trump called Petro an \u201cillegal drug leader\u201d on Truth Social last month, accusing him of being directly involved in the drug trade and working with traffickers.",
      "After Petro called a U.S. strike \u201cmurder\u201d in a post on X, Trump said he would cut aid and raise tariffs on Colombia. The Treasury Department subsequently hit his Colombian counterpart and members of his family with sanctions.",
      "Petro then announced this week that he was suspending intelligence sharing with Washington.",
      "The United Kingdom has also stopped sharing intelligence because of concerns about the legality of U.S. strikes, two sources with knowledge of the matter told NBC News.",
      "And French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot also said at the start of a a Group of Seven foreign ministers meeting in Canada on Tuesday that the strikes \u201cviolate international law\u201d and were concerning for France\u2019s territories in the region.",
      "Petro did not say definitively that the boats that have been recently attacked were not carrying drugs. \u201cMaybe or maybe not. We do not know,\u201d he said. \u201cAccording to due process, the civilized treatment of people, they \u200bshould be seized and detained.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are poor boatmen, they know how to drive a boat, they are hired in their poverty by the gangsters. But gangsters don\u2019t sit on the boats,\u201d he said. \u201cThen when one of those missiles arrives [it] kills that boatman. It doesn\u2019t kill the drug trafficker.\u201d",
      "His government, he said, \u201chas seized more cocaine than any other government in world history. Trump\u2019s insult is at odds reality, how can he call the largest destroyer of cocaine a chief trafficker?\u201d",
      "Petro strongly denied Trump\u2019s personal accusations, calling the president \"lost\" and suggesting that he was being misled by other U.S. officials on the issue. \u201cHe is lost on the issue of the real analysis of what is going on with cocaine in Colombia.\u201d",
      "Petro, who considers himself a left-wing revolutionary, added, \u201cHe is a barbarian, but anyone can change.\u201d",
      "The Colombian president is not the only leader in the region feeling pressure. Trump has also singled out the president of neighboring Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, as a target for his ire and leveled accusations of complicity in the drug trade against him, too.",
      "The tense standoff between the U.S. and Venezuela escalated after Trump sent an aircraft carrier strike group to the Caribbean and confirmed he had approved covert CIA operations inside the country, a move that critics say could be a prelude to an attempt to push Maduro from office.",
      "Trump has not confirmed any covert actions against Colombia yet and Petro struck a defiant tone about Trump\u2019s recent regional moves and the potential for war.",
      "\u201cHe wants to frighten us. Fear is not the same as the facts,\u201d Petro said, though he did not throw his support behind Maduro, either.",
      "Asked whether Maduro was a legitimate leader, Petro said, \u201cNo, I believe that there has been no legitimate leadership for some time.\u201d",

      "Used on an almost nightly basis in the war in Ukraine, a spate of mysterious drone incursions above airports and sensitive sites has also highlighted Europe\u2019s vulnerability to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and sparked alarm that NATO nations are unprepared to defend themselves from the cheap but effective weaponry.",
      "As a result, European leaders have backed plans for a \u201cdrone wall,\u201d a network of sensors and weapons to detect, track and neutralize intruding UAVs, and in Riga, the team at a small tech company called Origin is on the forefront of this new, high-tech battleground.",
      "Its solution, a 3-foot-tall interceptor drone named \u201cBlaze.\u201d Powered by an artificial intelligence system, it has been trained to recognize a hostile target and navigate close to it. It will then alert a human operator, who will make a decision on whether to intercept and push a button which explodes a 28-ounce warhead, self-destructing the drone and hopefully bringing down its target too.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t fly these systems. These systems fly themselves,\u201d Origin  CEO Agris Kipurs told NBC News last week in an interview outside the factory, adding that Blaze addressed \u201cthe problem of relatively cheap, low-flying threats that are deployed in volumes.\u201d",

      "Now, bus providers in Denmark and Norway say they are urgently investigating and remedying what they say is a security loophole discovered in their fleets of vehicles made by Yutong, a company based in Zhengzhou, China, that is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of buses by sales volume.",
      "Because these buses can receive updates and diagnostic tests \u201cover the air,\u201d they can be \u201cstopped remotely, either by the manufacturer or by a hacker,\u201d Jeppe Gaard, chief operating officer of the Danish public transport provider Movia, told NBC News in an email Wednesday.",
      "\u201cElectric buses, like electric cars, in principle can be remotely deactivated if their software systems have online access,\u201d he said. This isn\u2019t just a \u201cChinese bus concern; it is a challenge for all types of vehicles and devices with these kinds of electronics built in,\u201d Gaard added.",
      "In Denmark, Movia\u2019s fleet includes 262 Yutong buses, which have been phased in since 2019 across a network that covers the capital, Copenhagen, and the east of the country, Movia said.",
      "The alarm was first raised earlier this month by the Norwegian bus operator Ruter, which runs half of the country\u2019s public transport, including in Oslo, the capital.",
      "Ruter performed underground tests \u201cinside a mountain\u201d on two buses: the Yutong model and one from the Dutch manufacturer VDL.",
      "While the Dutch buses \u201cdo not have the capability for autonomous software updates over the air,\u201d Yutong \u201chas direct digital access to each individual bus for software updates and diagnostics,\u201d it said.",
      "In theory, \u201cthis bus can be stopped or rendered inoperable by the manufacturer,\u201d it said, although Yutong wouldn\u2019t be able to remotely drive these vehicles.",
      "Asked for comment on the Danish and Norwegian moves, Yutong sent an emailed statement saying that it \u201cunderstands and highly values the public\u2019s concerns regarding vehicle safety and data privacy protection,\u201d and \u201cstrictly complies with the applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards.\u201d",
      "It said its vehicle data in the European Union is stored in an Amazon Web Services data center in Frankfurt, Germany, where it is \u201cprotected by storage encryption and access control measures,\u201d and that \u201cwithout customer authorization, no one is allowed to access or operate the system.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "This is just the latest episode in Europe\u2019s complex relationship with China: deeply reliant on Beijing\u2019s trade and increasing know-how, but critical of its alleged cyber-aggression, rampant intellectual property theft and human rights violations.",
      "Even as hope rises for a new trade agreement between China and the E.U., there are grave concerns over plans for a new mega-embassy in London and a lingering scandal over the collapse of an alleged spying case at the heart of Westminster.",
      "Meanwhile, the Dutch government has seized control of the Chinese chipmaker Nexperia, in a saga that has raised fears that car production could come to a halt on the Continent.",
      "Even more so than the United States, European nations have relied on China for critical infrastructure \u2014 only to conclude that it poses a problem if and when relations go south.",
      "A number of European governments have torn out 5G networks made by the Chinese giants Huawei and ZTE \u2014 under pressure from Washington \u2014 because of fears they could be used by Beijing to compromise Western national security.",
      "Today\u2019s hot-button issue is Chinese electric vehicles, which are effectively blocked from sale in the U.S. but whose market share is ballooning in Europe, doubling to 5.1% in the first half of 2025 from last year, according to the auto consultancy JATO Dynamics.",
      "As with other Western concerns, China has roundly rejected that its EVs and other technologies present a security risk.",
      "In January, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry condemned American moves to block Chinese tech from the U.S. auto market, accusing it of \u201coverstretching the concept of national security\u201d and calling for Washington to \u201cstop going after Chinese companies,\u201d spokesman Guo Jiakun said at a daily news briefing.",
      "But plenty of security and intelligence officials are concerned.",
      "Western nations had \u201cthe whole problem with Huawei and 5G, and you\u2019ve now got a similar problem in Chinese electric cars: that they can all be immobilized at a switch from the manufacturer,\u201d the former head of Britain\u2019s MI6 intelligence agency, Richard Dearlove, told NBC News in an interview earlier this year.",

      "In reality, this is also true of any electric vehicle \u2014 including those made by Tesla, for example \u2014 and many other items reliant on internet connectivity, said Ken Munro, founder of the British American cybersecurity consultancy Pen Test Partners.",

      "\u201cDo we believe that China would destroy its entire export industry for vehicles, EVs or not, in order to prove a political and military point? It is within the bounds of plausibility,\u201d but the chances are \u201cincredibly small,\u201d Munro said.",
      "\u201cIt just comes down to trust,\u201d he added."

He was rearrested for being unlawfully at large and on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker in connection with an earlier incident.",
      "As officers bundled him into a van, he offered his own verdict on the system that lost track of him: \u201cLook at the justice of the U.K., they release people by mistake,\u201d he said in a video aired by NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News.",
      "It\u2019s a throwaway line, but it lands with an uncomfortable truth. In a country where little seems to function as it should \u2014 from the courts to the National Health Service to the trains \u2014 even the prisons can\u2019t quite manage to keep the doors locked.",
      "Years of budget cuts are \u201ccatching up\u201d with Britain\u2019s public services, according to Glen O\u2019Hara, a professor of modern and contemporary history at Oxford Brookes University.",
      "\u201cThe whole system of social care, for instance, is completely overwhelmed,\u201d he told NBC News on Saturday, adding that Britain\u2019s prisons had been swamped by a large number of short prison sentences.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just overwhelming the system that can\u2019t cope economically with all these numbers,\u201d he said.",
      "Last summer, the men\u2019s prison system was nearly filled to capacity with only a hundred or so empty places, a crisis that triggered the government\u2019s emergency release scheme, allowing some inmates to leave after serving 40% of their sentence instead of the usual 50%. Introduced to ease overcrowding, the policy has since seen nearly 40,000 prisoners released early, Ministry of Justice figures show.",
      "Staffing issues have also plagued the services. In the year to June, nearly 13% of staff left British prisons, according to data from the Prison and Probation Service.",
      "Prison officers said a clerical error meant there was no warrant from the court to hold Kaddour-Cherif, and he was let go. William Smith, the convicted fraudster, was released as a result of a clerical error at the court level, the BBC reports.",
      "Wandsworth prison, where Smith and Kaddour-Cherif were released, was built in 1851 to house fewer than 1,000 prisoners. An August 2024 report by the prison\u2019s independent monitoring board found inmate numbers had grown to 1,513.",
      "\u201cWings were chaotic and staff across most units were unable to confirm where all prisoners were during the working day,\u201d the report said.",
      "The Victorian-era prison, one of many still in use dating back to the 1800s, has previously been the scene of high-profile escapes. Wandsworth made headlines in 2023 when former British soldier Daniel Khalife escaped by clinging to the underside of a lorry while awaiting trial for espionage and terrorism offenses.",
      "A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that the recent cases \"further expose the scale of the crisis in our prisons we inherited,\" adding: \"This will not be fixed overnight, but we are using every possible lever to bear down on these errors.\"",
      "For all the headlines and investigations, the mistakes continue to pile up in a country struggling to hold itself together, one unlocked gate at a time."

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 All five members of the K-pop girl group NewJeans say they plan to return to their record label after losing a long-running legal battle to leave over what they said was mistreatment and harassment.",
      "The band, one of the top-selling acts in the world, announced its intention to return to the label, Ador, in separate statements on Wednesday, with Haerin and Hyein confirming their decision first, followed by the other three members, Danielle, Minji and Hanni, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap.",
      "Last year, NewJeans unilaterally announced a split from Ador, citing the agency\u2019s alleged failure to protect its members following the dismissal of Min Hee-jin, the former chief executive of Ador and the group\u2019s mentor. Ador denied the allegations.",
      "Last month, a South Korean court rejected NewJeans\u2019 argument, ruling that its exclusive contract with Ador remains valid as Min being CEO is not necessarily part of Ador\u2019s contractual obligations.",
      "Ador, which is based in Seoul, confirmed the return of Haerin and Hyein and said it was checking on the return of the other three members.",
      "\u201cAdor is committed to providing its full support to Haerin and Hyein to ensure the seamless continuation of their artistic endeavors,\u201d the label said in a statement. \u201cWe request the warm support from the fans and respectfully urge you to avoid engaging in unfounded speculation regarding the members.\u201d",
      "Shortly after Ador\u2019s announcement, the remaining three members, Danielle, Minji and Hanni, said they were also returning to the label after \u201cprudent consultations,\u201d Yonhap reported.",
      "\u201cOne member is currently in Antarctica, and thus our stance was delivered late,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cAs Ador is currently not responding, we are notifying it individually.\u201d",
      "In March, NewJeans announced a pause on all independent activities under its new name \u201cNJZ\u201d during a concert in Hong Kong, to the surprise of global fans and supporters. The announcement came after a ruling by a Seoul court in favor of Ador, which had filed an injunction against the group\u2019s independent activities.",
      "The group said it did not regret the choice to break from Ador \u201cat all\u201d and that they had to \u201cspeak up to protect the values\u201d they believe in.",
      "After the court ruling in late October that upheld NewJeans\u2019 exclusive contract with Ador, the members said they planned to appeal \u201cimmediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is impossible to return to Ador and continue normal entertainment activities under the current circumstances, where trust between the parties has completely broken down,\u201d the group said.",
      "NewJeans, which debuted in 2022, is known for songs combining pop and R&B music. Billboard named it \u201cone of the most recognized and most influential groups in pop\u201d in 2023.",
      "It also broke the Guinness World Record for the fastest K-pop act to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify, surpassing K-pop veterans BTS and Blackpink."

      "The new strain, a version of H3N2, is causing outbreaks in Canada and the U.K., where health officials are warning about the early wave that\u2019s sending people to the hospital.",
      "\u201cSince it emerged, it\u2019s rapidly spreading and predominating in some countries so far in the Northern Hemisphere,\u201d Dr. Wenqing Zhang, head of the World Health Organization\u2019s Global Respiratory Threats Unit, said Wednesday during a media briefing.",

That \u201cmeans the virus is quite different to the H3N2 strain included in this year\u2019s vaccine,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.K. is heading \u201cinto what looks set to be a cruel winter, with flu cases being triple what they were this time last year,\u201d the head of the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service, James Mackey, said last week.",
      "It\u2019s picking up in Canada, too, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan. H3N2 is generally thought to cause more illness and be worse for older adults than other strains. Japan is also experiencing an unusually early and harsh flu season that\u2019s \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Rasmussen said.",
      "Japanese news outlet Nippon TV reported that as of Nov. 4, flu cases in Tokyo had surged to nearly six times the level seen at this time last year, according to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. More than 2,300 day cares and schools in the country were at least partially closed because of the outbreak, the outlet reported.",
      "\u201cThese are not good signs,\u201d Rasmussen said.",
      "Is this flu strain already in the U.S.?",
      "H3N2 is an A strain of influenza. While there are plenty of anecdotal reports of people testing positive for flu A across the country, the insights stop there.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn\u2019t provided a detailed, national report on flu activity since Sept. 26 because of the government shutdown.",
      "Even if it reopens in the coming days, Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said that the \u201chollowing out\u201d of the CDC in the form of massive layoffs could further delay flu data collection and analysis. Earlier this year, the Department of Health and Human Services announced it would cut up to 10,000 full-time jobs in the public health sector.",
      "\u201cWe are going to be dependent on state laboratories and academic laboratories for these investigations and report them out,\u201d Schaffner said. \u201cThe information will not be as comprehensive, centralized and as quickly analyzed and communicated from the CDC as we have had in previous years.\u201d",
      "Will this year\u2019s flu shot be helpful?",
      "Global health officials and drugmakers select which viral strain to include in fall flu vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere each year in February, based on which types are circulating in the Southern Hemisphere. This year\u2019s flu shots protect against three strains of influenza, including two types of influenza A and one type of influenza B.",
      "The annual flu shot doesn\u2019t prevent people from getting infected with the flu. It\u2019s mainly used to lessen the severity of the illness. Last year, the vaccine was up to 55% effective in keeping adults with the flu out of the hospital.",
      "On Tuesday, health authorities in the U.K. published preliminary evidence that this year\u2019s vaccine is up to 40% effective in preventing hospitalization among adults.",
      "Schaffner encouraged people to get the shot anyway.",
      "\u201cAll of the data over previous decades shows that even if there is not a close match, use of the vaccine continues to prevent hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions and continues to help keep people out of the cemetery,\u201d he said."

      "German Galushchenko was removed from office one day after anti-corruption authorities said they exposed a scheme that allegedly involves a close associate of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and an ex-deputy prime minister nicknamed \u201cChe Guevara.\u201d",
      "The probe threatened a high-profile confrontation over the long-running issue of graft in Ukraine as it battles to maintain Western support for its fight against Russia, which has battered its neighbor's energy infrastructure with waves of attacks.",
      "Zelenskyy said in a statement on Telegram on Wednesday that those involved \"cannot remain in their positions,\" adding: \"This is a matter of trust in particular. If there are accusations, they must be answered.\"",
      "Five people have been arrested and another seven were placed under suspicion, according to a statement Tuesday from Ukraine\u2019s National Anticorruption Bureau, the NABU, and Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office, SAPO.",
      "The \u201chigh-level criminal organization\u201d saw current and former officials, and businesspeople, allegedly receive benefits and launder money through the country\u2019s state energy company, Energoatom, authorities said.",
      "Among those accused of involvement is Timur Mindich, a businessman with ties to Zelenskyy, SAPO prosecutor Serhiy Savytskyi told a court hearing Tuesday.",
      "Savytskyi said Mindich's \"criminal activity in the energy sector was established by him influencing\" Galushchenko, the justice minister who until July served as energy secretary.",
      "Mindich is co-owner of the television production company Kvartal 95, which was founded by Zelenskyy when he was an actor and comedian before becoming president. In a statement, the studio distanced itself from the allegations, saying that Mindich \u201cdoes not participate in\u201d the company\u2019s \u201cactivities and does not influence the content or decisions of the team.\u201d",
      "Galushchenko, who has not been arrested, said in a statement that he agreed with the government\u2019s decision to suspend him \u201cfor the duration of the investigation\u201d and called it a \u201ccivilized and appropriate scenario.\u201d",
      "\u201cI will defend myself in the legal arena and prove my position,\u201d he added.",
      "His suspension was announced in a statement by Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, who did not provide details of what exactly he had been accused of, or his alleged role in the wider scheme.",
      "In a separate statement, the NABU said this \u201ccriminal organization transferred funds to an unnamed former deputy prime minister of Ukraine, referred to internally as Che Guevara.\u201d",
      "Detectives said they found some $1.2 million transferred to this person, the last $500,000 of which was sent to his wife after he came under investigation, it said.",
      "According to the NABU and SAPO, the corruption scheme involved forcing Energoatom\u2019s contractors to pay an illegal commission of 10%-15% or risk losing their supplier status.",
      "\u201cUsing their official connections in the ministry and the state-owned company,\u201d the suspects \u201censured control over personnel decisions, procurement processes, and financial flows,\u201d the anti-corruption agencies said in a statement.",
      "Zeleneksyy said in an earlier statement Monday that, \"there must be convictions\" for anyone found guilty of corruption, and that government officials \"must work together with\" anti-corruption agencies.",
      "In the summer, Zelenskyy was met with international criticism and rare public protests after raids against a high-profile anti-corruption campaigner and a parliamentary bill, later withdrawn, that would have curbed the powers of anti-corruption agencies.",
      "Energoatom said in a statement Tuesday that the saga had not impacted its financial health or operational safety.",
      "\"Energoatom has been and remains the pillar of Ukraine\u2019s energy system; together with our partners, we ensure the reliable operation of nuclear power facilities and uninterrupted supply of electricity for Ukraine\u2019s needs,\" it said.",
      "Ukraine has made strides on fighting its endemic corruption problem, particularly since Zelenskyy made it a central plank of his 2019 election manifesto. But the country still struggles with the issue at high levels of government and business.",
      "In a report last week, the European Commission praised Ukraine\u2019s attempts to tackle corruption during wartime, but warned that its \u201climited progress\u201d was jeopardizing its long-term hopes to join the European Union.",
      "Reports of growing state pressure on anti-corruption groups \u201ccast doubts on Ukraine\u2019s commitment to its anticorruption agenda,\u201d it said, while cautioning that Ukraine should \u201cprevent any backsliding on its notable reform achievements.\u201d"

    "summary": "President Donald Trump said he has an obligation to proceed with his threatened $1 billion lawsuit against the BBC for editing a speech he made on Jan. 6.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 President Donald Trump has said he has an obligation to proceed with his threatened $1 billion lawsuit against the BBC for editing a speech he made before his supporters' violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the presidential election result.",
      "The BBC's top executive, Director-General Tim Davie, and its news CEO, Deborah Turness, resigned Sunday amid a growing scandal over this and other alleged editorial misjudgments.",
      "Trump celebrated the news, though his legal team also wrote to the corporation on Sunday demanding a \u201cfull and fair retraction\u201d and gave a deadline of 5 p.m. Friday for a response. A BBC spokesperson said: \"We will review the letter and respond directly in due course.\"",
      "The issue has become a major story in the U.K. where Prime Minister Keir Starmer told lawmakers at the weekly Prime Minister's Questions session in parliament on Wednesday: \"I believe in a strong and independent BBC. Some would rather the BBC didn't exist ... I'm not one of them.\"",
      "He added, however, that \"where mistakes are made they do need to get their house in order.\"",
      "Starmer was responding to Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrat party, who asked whether the government would urge the BBC to fight Trump's lawsuit.",
      "Davey said \"a great British institution is under attack from a foreign government ... Trump has underlined press freedom in America and now he's trying to do the same here.\"",
      "Asked Tuesday night whether he would sue, Trump told Fox News: \"Well, I guess I have to you know, why not? Because they defrauded the public, and they've admitted it.\"",
      "\"I think I have an obligation to do it, because you can't get people, you can't allow people to do that,\" he said, before comparing the action to his lawsuit against CBS for a \"60 Minutes\" interview with his then-presidential election rival Kamala Harris. CBS paid $16 million to settle the case.",
      "Trump complained that the BBC's edit of his speech \"made it sound radical\" when it was \"a very calming speech.\"",
      "The saga centers on a \"Panorama\" documentary that aired before last year's election.",
      "In it, two parts of the speech were edited together to give the impression that Trump said:  \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"",
      "In fact Trump initially said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.\"",
      "He said later: \"And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\"",
      "The House Jan. 6 committee said after an 18-month investigation that Trump spent much of the speech at the Washington rally \u201camping up his crowd with lies about the election, attacking his own vice-president and Republican members of Congress, and exhorting the crowd to fight.\u201d",
      "BBC Chairman Samir Shah has apologized for what he called an \"error of judgement\" as the furor intensifies the debate over the embattled broadcaster\u2019s future.",
      "Davie told staff in a 40-minute all-hands meeting Tuesday that despite mistakes the corporation had to \u201cfight for our journalism,\u201d BBC News reported.",
      "Trump also told Fox News he took offense at this coming from \"one of our great allies,\" meaning the United Kingdom.",
      "The BBC is a public corporation funded by a national license fee of 174.50 pound ($228) per household, but it is editorially independent and frequently runs critical and revealing news stories about the government of the day.",
      "The incident and other claims of biased reporting have provided potent fuel for conservative critics of the BBC, including many lawmakers and right-wing newspapers who oppose the license fee and accuse the corporation of being culturally liberal and institutionally biased.",
      "Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy told Parliament Tuesday that the BBC is a \"national institution\" and warned against a sustained attack. The ten-year charter that governs the BBC, including its funding, is due for renewal in 2027."

    "story": [
      "When President Donald Trump hosted Republican senators for lunch at the White House on Oct. 21, Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, came prepared.",
      "Moreno, who was born in Colombia, has become a key voice on policy involving the Latin American nation \u2014 and one that\u2019s deeply critical of the current left-wing president, Gustavo Petro.",
      "Two days before the lunch, Trump, at odds with Petro for months, posted on social media that Petro was \u201can illegal drug leader strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs\u201d in Colombia. Trump said he was stopping all U.S. aid to the country and told reporters he would soon announce new tariffs on Colombia.",
      "Moreno wanted to encourage Trump to take a more targeted approach \u2014 directly aimed at Petro. To do so, the senator brought along a document titled \u201cThe Trump Doctrine For Colombia and the Western Hemisphere.\u201d In addition to five policy ideas, the one-page outline featured large images of Petro and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the president of Venezuela, in orange prison jumpsuits. The images appear to be generated by artificial intelligence. NBC News obtained the memo from a person familiar with the episode.",
      "Now that document is at the center of an even further strain in diplomatic relationships between Colombia and the U.S.",
      "On Sunday, the publication Cambio Colombia first reported on the existence of the document when it discovered that the White House had posted a photo from the Oct. 21 event showing James Blair, a deputy chief of staff, holding Moreno\u2019s memo.",
      "Petro posted on X that he was recalling the Colombian ambassador to the U.S. for the second time in a month and demanding to know why he is being portrayed \u201cas if I were a prisoner,\u201d calling the print-out \u201ca brutal disrespect\u201d to his supporters and nation.",
      "And on Monday, Colombian Foreign Minister Rosa Villavicencio told journalists in Santa Marta that her government had \"sent verbal notes to the United States through our diplomatic representation\" to \"request clarification regarding\" Moreno's memo.",
      "The episode also marks the latest chapter in the use of fake images in politics. The Trump administration has made extensive use of AI-generated images and videos in online political messaging, with the president himself often sharing them on social media.",
      "The White House directed NBC News to Moreno\u2019s office for comment. Moreno\u2019s office declined to comment.",
      "Moreno, who was born in Bogota and immigrated to the U.S. as a child, is among a few lawmakers advocating on Colombia policy to the president. A Treasury Department official told NBC News that both Moreno and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who endorsed Trump\u2019s call to impose new tariffs on the South American nation, have been backchanneling on Colombia to the White House for a while, with their advocacy culminating at the Rose Garden lunch in October. This person, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, added that Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been heavily involved as well.",
      "Tensions between the two nations have risen in recent months with the U.S. building up its military deployment in the Caribbean in an effort to target Venezuela. U.S. forces have killed dozens aboard boats officials say are trafficking drugs into the U.S. as lawmakers in both parties have called for the Trump administration to share evidence to support its claims.",
      "Moreno\u2019s memo called for the president to designate more cartels as foreign terrorist organizations; target Petro, his family and associates for further sanctions; and launch an investigation into Petro\u2019s campaign finances, among other measures. The proposal did not include advocacy for new Colombian tariffs or the cutting off of aid to the country. It also did not call for the U.S. to engage in a regime-change effort.",
      "Moreno's document is below. (NBC News added in the watermarks indicating the images are fake.)",
      "Three days after the lunch with senators, the Treasury Department announced sanctions against Petro, his family and a government official over allegations of involvement in the global drug trade, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying in a statement that Petro \u201chas allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.\u201d Petro has strongly denied involvement with the drug trade and has said he will fight the sanctions in U.S. courts.",
      "Trump has yet to announce new tariffs on Colombia. And CNN reported last week that there has been no interruption yet to U.S. assistance to the country.",
      "Petro, a socialist, accused the U.S. of killing a fisherman last month in one of its attacks on a boat the U.S. claimed was involved in drug smuggling. The U.S. revoked Petro\u2019s visa during the United Nations General Assembly in September after the Colombian leader spoke at a pro-Palestinian rally in New York and called for U.S. soldiers to resist Trump.",
      "Writing for Time magazine, Petro on Sunday countered Trump\u2019s claims, saying that his government had delivered \u201crecord cocaine seizures\u201d and that the U.S. government\u2019s support \u201cwas crucial in this fight.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhatever the attitudes of the current administration, I will continue to pursue a counter-narcotics and broader security policy that is in the interests of Colombians and Americans alike,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Petro himself has called out Moreno as leading the charge against him. After the Trump administration announced the sanctions on him last month, Petro posted on X that Moreno\u2019s \u201cthreat has come true.\u201d",
      "Separately, Moreno pushed back on claims Petro made that he and Trump sought to overthrow him in a coup.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s 100% completely false,\u201d Moreno wrote on social media last month. \u201cThe United States wants the people of Colombia to have a free and fair election, as scheduled, without any influence from outside agitators or narco traffickers.\u201d",
      "Colombian officials who spoke with NBC News said they believed the country avoided new tariffs because of the advocacy of some Colombians in government and in business who are close to both Moreno and Trump-allied lawmakers in South Florida.",
      "Andr\u00e9s Pastrana, who was the president of Colombia from 1998 through 2002 and aligned with the right, said Moreno and Republican Reps. Maria Elvira Salazar, Carlos Gimenez and Mario Diaz-Balart, all of Florida, have had \u201cbig influence\u201d in convincing the Trump administration. He also said the U.S. should not equate all Colombians with Petro and his views, adding that imposing tariffs on the entire country could carry a significant \u201cpolitical risk\u201d and help to \u201cre-elect the left\u201d by giving Petro the ability to tap into nationalistic fervor."

      "\u201cWhat makes this incident so bad is the total shutdown of industrial production. That\u2019s much rarer in cyberattacks than is commonly understood,\u201d Martin told NBC News.",
      "Jaguar Land Rover didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The company first publicly acknowledged the attack on Sept. 2, saying that while the hackers didn\u2019t appear to steal customer data, \u201cour retail and production activities have been severely disrupted.\u201d It then took almost four weeks before the company announced it was even close to resuming manufacturing.",
      "In a report on the hack published last month, the Cyber Monitoring Centre found the attack had cost an estimated 1.9 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), surpassing the WannaCry attack of 2017. WannaCry, which the U.S. and U.K. accused North Korea of creating, spread across computers around the world, with the British National Health Service among the biggest victims. Roughly 1 in 5 of the trusts that administer NHS hospitals were locked down through that attack.",
      "Though the Cyber Monitoring Centre said that the specifics of what happened at Jaguar Land Rover are still unclear, the attack\u2019s fallout has been extremely far-reaching, affecting the company\u2019s global manufacturing operations at at least three U.K. plants, as well as car dealerships and a host of smaller companies that supply automotive parts.",
      "\u201cProduction lines were halted for several weeks, dealer systems were intermittently unavailable, and suppliers faced cancelled or delayed orders, with uncertainty about future order volumes,\u201d the report found.",
      "The known details of the event are consistent with ransomware, where cybercriminals gain access to a company\u2019s or government\u2019s computer systems and encrypt or threaten to delete them, demanding an extortion payment to make them usable again. Even when victims choose to pay their attackers, it can take weeks or months to restore operations.",
      "Ransomware is one of the most destructive and profitable forms of cybercrime. An analysis published in February by the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence found there had been at least 5,289 attacks in 2024, with some netting tens of millions of dollars in ransom payments.",
      "The British government has not publicly accused anyone of masterminding the hack. A group of hackers who had claimed to be behind a string of other hacks against large British and American companies earlier this year told the BBC in September that they were responsible for hacking Jaguar Land Rover. NBC News was unable to confirm with the group, as their channel on Telegram, the app where they had previously made such claims, has been deleted."

    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 16:00:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Canada has lost its measles elimination status, the country\u2019s Public Health Agency announced Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Canada has lost its measles elimination status, the country\u2019s Public Health Agency announced Monday. It\u2019s the first country in the Americas to do so since the pandemic, and it could serve as a warning sign for others.",
      "There are multiple criteria for losing an official measles elimination status, including declines in vaccination rates. The most significant factor is the ongoing spread of the same strain of the virus for a full year.",
      "Canada\u2019s outbreak started in October 2024 in New Brunswick, a province on the country\u2019s eastern seaboard. As of Monday, Canada\u2019s health officials had tallied 5,138 measles cases since the outbreak began. Two babies, infected in utero, were born pre-term and died.",
      "Despite \u201cgreat efforts\u201d made by Canadian health officials, \u201cthe country has lost its measles elimination status and is now considered endemic for the disease,\u201d Jarbas Barbosa, the head of the Pan American Health Organization, said during a media briefing Monday.",
      "\u201cThis loss represents a setback, of course, but it is also reversible,\u201d Barbosa said.",
      "Canadian health officials will now have to come up with a plan to get back on track, including improving vaccination rates and \u201cenabling better overall surveillance efforts,\u201d the country's public health agency said in a statement.",
      "The country eliminated measles in 1998, two years before the U.S.",
      "The spread of measles in the Americas is not limited to Canada. As of last week, PAHO officials reported that there\u2019ve been 12,593 confirmed measles cases across the entire region, which encompasses North, Central and South America \u2014 30 times the number reported last year.",
      "The vast majority of 2025 cases \u2014 95% \u2014 have been in Canada, Mexico and the U.S., and the latter two countries could soon also lose their measles elimination status.",
      "In Mexico, nearly 4,000 cases have been reported since February. Ongoing spread in the state of Chihuahua, in the northwestern part of the country, accounts for 93% of the country\u2019s outbreak. Twenty-three people have died.",
      "In the U.S., an outbreak that began in January continues to spread across the country.",
      "The outbreak started in West Texas and stretched into New Mexico. At least 862 people \u2014 mostly in Texas \u2014 were infected. Three people died, including two little girls who lived in the epicenter of the outbreak, Gaines County, Texas.",
      "Though cases have subsided in West Texas, the virus has continued to spread. Forty-one states have reported cases. As of last week, 1,681 measles cases had been confirmed in the U.S. in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most in more than 30 years.",
      "In Utah and Arizona, an outbreak concentrated in a close-knit community that straddles the border between the states is nearing 200 cases.",
      "In South Carolina, 38 cases have been reported in the northwestern part of the state since July.",
      "The outbreaks have occurred as vaccination rates have declined steadily in the U.S.",
      "A monthslong NBC News investigation revealed that since 2019, 77% of counties and jurisdictions have reported declines in the number of kids getting routine childhood vaccinations like the measles-mumps-rubella shots. Two are recommended.",
      "Vaccination coverage for both MMR doses across countries in the PAHO region averaged 79% last year, according to the group.",
      "Measles is the most contagious virus known on the planet. The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the room. Anyone in that room who hasn\u2019t been vaccinated against measles will likely get sick.",
      "Who determines a nation\u2019s measles elimination status?",
      "The PAHO, part of the World Health Organization, determines whether a country in North, South or Central America has maintained or lost its elimination status.",
      "Elimination means that a virus has stopped spreading in a specific country or region. Only one virus \u2014 smallpox \u2014 has been eradicated, meaning that it\u2019s been wiped out worldwide.",
      "On a technical level, when one country in the Americas loses its status, the region as a whole is deemed to have lost its elimination status. Canada is the only country in the region, however, that\u2019s been specifically called out for its year-plus measles spread.",
      "Measles is nowhere near being eradicated. Even with Canada losing its measles elimination status, the region of the Americas accounts for just 7.5% of cases globally, Daniel Salas, an immunization expert with PAHO, said during a media briefing Monday. Most are in the Middle East and South Asia.",
      "In 2019, PAHO established a panel of independent experts, called the Regional Verification Commission, to do an annual review of how countries are able to control measles spread.",
      "The panel met last week in Mexico City to analyze the latest measles data submitted from countries with active outbreaks through October.",
      "A PAHO spokesman said the group could not confirm whether its independent committee will meet again in January to discuss measles spread in the U.S."

    "story": [
      "Indonesia has a new national hero: its former dictator, the late President Suharto.",
      "The official award Monday drew outrage from rights activists who accuse the country\u2019s current leader, President Prabowo Subianto, of whitewashing his former father-in-law\u2019s legacy.",
      "Suharto, a staunch anti-communist who was a close U.S. ally during the Cold War, ruled for 32 years before he was ousted by deadly mass protests in 1998 amid the Asian financial crisis. His rule was marked by rapid economic growth and political stability as well as accusations of human rights violations, corruption and nepotism.",
      "Suharto was among 10 people who received the national hero title at the presidential palace in Jakarta. The annual award is given to those who have contributed significantly to the development of Indonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago and former Dutch colony that declared independence in 1945.",
      "\u201cA prominent figure from Central Java province, a hero of the struggle for independence, General Suharto stood out since the independence era,\u201d an announcer said as Prabowo gave the award to Suharto\u2019s daughter and son.",
      "Suharto, a military officer, became president in 1967 after seizing power from Indonesia\u2019s first president and independence leader, Sukarno, who was viewed as pro-communist by Western governments.",
      "Minister of Culture Fadli Zon said Suharto had played a key role in Indonesian independence and also led the military operation that helped regain what is now West Papua from the Dutch in the 1960s.",
      "Suharto was a key military officer during a 1965 military-led purge of communists said to be planning a coup. Indonesia has never investigated the purge, during which historians say about 500,000 people were killed in one of the 20th century\u2019s worst massacres, and Suharto was never proved to be involved.",
      "He also oversaw Indonesia\u2019s 1975 invasion of East Timor and the 24-year occupation that followed, which is estimated to have killed 100,000 people or more. East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, gained independence from Indonesia in 2002.",
      "Suharto and his family were also accused of stealing as much as $45 billion in state funds, though it was never proven. Though authorities tried to bring corruption charges starting in 2000, Suharto did not appear in court and the charges were later dropped because of his poor health. He died in 2008 in his late 80s.",
      "He is also credited with driving the rapid economic development of Indonesia, a country of 280 million people that is the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority nation.",
      "\u201cIn the \u201970s and \u201980s, 50 million people were lifted out of the most severe poverty,\u201d David Henley, a professor of contemporary Indonesian studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThat is Suharto\u2019s greatest claim to hero status.\u201d",
      "Despite the atrocities that marked Suharto\u2019s regime, he was \u201cnever completely disgraced,\u201d Henley said.",
      "\u201cThere has for some time been a tendency in official circles to rehabilitate Suharto\u201d and to see his regime \u201cin a progressively more positive light,\u201d he said.",
      "Others have resisted that trend.",
      "Every Thursday there is a silent protest outside the presidential palace in Jakarta over Suharto's alleged abuses, including by people still searching for loved ones.",
      "Protesters also gathered in Jakarta last week to oppose giving Suharto the national hero title.",
      "Prabowo, who was formerly married to Suharto\u2019s daughter Siti Hediati Hariyadi, also has a military background. He has denied accusations of human rights violations in East Timor, where he led a special forces unit in the 1980s, and in Papua.",
      "He was also commander of a special forces unit that was accused of abducting and torturing democracy activists in the 1990s, though Prabowo was never charged.",
      "He was later banned from traveling to the U.S. until 2020, when he became defense minister. He became president last year.",
      "Even after Suharto\u2019s death, his family\u2019s legacy remains deeply entrenched in Indonesian politics. His political party, Golkar, is still a formidable force and backed Prabowo\u2019s presidential bid last year."

    "story": [
      "The Oval Office is a long way from Abu Ghraib.",
      "When he was greeted by President Donald Trump on Monday, Ahmad al-Sharaa completed his journey from jihadist leader to head of state receiving a warm White House welcome.",
      "Since toppling the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, Syria\u2018s interim leader has spent the past year transforming his global image while tackling deep divisions at home.",
      "Now, al-Sharaa, who has thrown off his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, made history as the first Syrian president to visit the White House.",
      "\"It was an Honor to spend time with Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa, the new President of Syria, where we discussed all the intricacies of PEACE in the Middle East, of which he is a major advocate. I look forward to meeting and speaking again,\" Trump posted on Truth Social after his meeting with al-Sharaa, who would not have been able to set foot in the U.S. a year ago thanks to the $10 million bounty on his head. \"Having a stable and successful Syria is very important to all countries in the Region,\" Trump added.",
      "During his Washington visit, Al-Sharaa committed to joining the U.S.-led coalition to defeat the Islamic State militant group, a senior administration official told NBC News, a significant step in Syria's engagement with the West. And diplomats will be allowed to return to the Syrian embassy in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe United States will allow Syria to resume operations at its Embassy in Washington to further counterterrorism, security, and economic coordination,\" the senior administration official said.",
      "The State Department removed al-Sharaa and his interior minister from the Specially Designated Global Terrorist list Friday, while the United Kingdom and Europe removed sanctions on al-Sharaa after the United Nations Security Council voted in favor of a U.S.-drafted resolution to do so.",
      "The Washington trip is \u201ca high-level sign of the trust that the American administration has placed in al-Sharaa \u2014 and the hope that he will succeed in holding Syria together during this incredibly complicated transition period,\u201d said Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "A \u2018turning point\u2019",
      "Al-Sharaa rose to power after leading Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, in toppling Assad\u2019s regime last December.",
      "Since then, he has sought to distance himself from his past as a jihadist who had been jailed by U.S. forces in Iraq, trading military fatigues for smart suits and vowing to rebuild Syria and unify its myriad religious and ethnic groups.",
      "Trump\u2019s approach, a dramatic shift for the U.S., has underscored al-Sharaa\u2019s success in breaking the country\u2019s decadeslong global isolation.",
      "The U.S. removed its terrorist designation for HTS, along with the bounty on al-Sharaa himself, before lifting a string of sanctions following a May meeting between the Syrian leader and Trump in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Al-Sharaa was in New York in September to address the United Nations General Assembly, but Syrian Information Ministry said that being welcomed to the White House marked a \u201cmajor turning point\u201d for the country.",
      "At home, however, al-Sharaa has struggled to unify a deeply divided Syria while grappling with broader threats: a resurgent ISIS, fraught relations with increasingly assertive neighbor Israel, and Russia\u2019s determination to maintain its strategic foothold in Syria while giving safe haven to Assad.",
      "Syria has experienced flashes of violence, including deadly attacks against minority groups allegedly carried out in part by government forces. Growing tensions with Kurdish authorities in northeast Syria have also erupted into violent clashes.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s certainly being (very) smart,\u201d John Jenkins, a former British diplomat who has previously served as head of mission in Syria, said of al-Sharaa in emailed comments.",
      "\u201cA trip to D.C. makes him look respectable,\u201d said Jenkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House and a leader at Cambridge University\u2019s Centre for Geopolitics. But, he added, \u201dthe key issues are domestic.\u201d",
      "And within Syria, opinions have been deeply divided.",
      "\u201cHe does not represent the Syrian people,\u201d said Sami Zain Al-Din, a 72-year-old political activist from Sweida, a southern city that was rocked by deadly clashes involving the Druze community, which has close ties to Israel.",
      "For Dr. Jalnar Hamad, doubts over al-Sharaa were balanced against hopes that his meeting with Trump could open a \u201cnew chapter\u201d that could see Sweida \u201cbenefit from development or reconstruction programs,\u201d she said.",
      "Ilham Ahmed, co-chair of the Syrian Democratic Council, the political arm of the Kurdish-led and U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, said the Trump meeting was \u201can opportunity to redefine the position of the new Syrian state.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also a chance for Trump to address \u201cthe rights of the Kurdish people and the coalition partners who fought terrorism on behalf of the world,\u201d he said, referring to the SDF\u2019s role against ISIS.",
      "Further sanctions lifted?",
      "Al-Sharaa will be hoping to emerge strengthened domestically, and key to that effort is his bid to remove remaining sanctions imposed on Syria during Assad\u2019s rule.",
      "Already, \u201cthe pace with which sanctions have been eased on Syria since May has been absolutely spectacular,\u201d Karam Shaar, a consultant on Syria and the research director at the Operations and Policy Center think tank in Turkey, said in a voice note.",
      "Shaar said he expected that two \u201cmain pieces of sanctions will have been either lifted or just about to be lifted\u201d by the time al-Sharaa and Trump meet, including the removal of Syria from America\u2019s list of \u201cstate sponsors of terrorism\u201d and the repeal of sanctions under the Caesar Act, a 2019 law targeting the Assad regime.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in a statement on Monday that he had given Syria another waiver on the Caesar Act.",
      "But sanctions will not be the only focus, with the effort to quell ISIS\u2019 resurgence and relations with Israel also expected to play a central role.",
      "The U.S. ally has faced growing isolation on the global stage over its deadly assault in Gaza, but Trump has previously expressed hopes Syria would join other Arab nations in normalizing ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords, which were expanded again last week.",
      "It remains unclear whether Trump will push the matter during talks with al-Sharaa on Monday.",
      "Syria, historically a staunch ally of Iran, has never recognized Israel and has been locked in a state of conflict with the country since its establishment in 1948. Iranian proxy Hezbollah has also long been deeply embedded in Syria after joining the Assad regime\u2019s military efforts.",
      "When Assad was in power, Israel routinely carried out airstrikes against what it said were Iranian-linked targets inside Syria, and since his ouster, it has deployed troops to a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone and has repeatedly launched airstrikes and incursions into Syria.",
      "Damascus has so far refused to retaliate, while both countries have kept the lines of communication open."
