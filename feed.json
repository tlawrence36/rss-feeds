      "Country singer Bailey Zimmerman is releasing his sophomore album, \u201cDifferent Night Same Rodeo.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- His is a Cinderella story.",
      "Before the big tours and country music award nominations, Bailey Zimmerman was growing up in the small town of Louisville, Illinois, working at the local meat processing plant and laying gas pipeline. Then, in 2020, he decided to upload videos of himself singing to social media \u2014 Black Stone Cherry's \u201cStay,\u201d and, later, an original.",
      "He quickly garnered a fan base on TikTok. It wasn't overnight, but it was fast. Soon, he inked a deal with Warner Music Nashville and released his debut full-length, 2023's \u201cReligiously. The Album.\u201d It peaked at No. 7 on the all-genre Billboard 200 chart and was certified two-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Now comes Friday, when he follows it up with a sophomore offering, \u201cDifferent Night Same Rodeo.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't know what I'm doing,\u201d Zimmerman, 25, tells The Associated Press through a smile. \u201cI randomly got into music in 2020, 2021, and I\u2019d never sang before. I\u2019d never wrote songs before.\u201d",
      "After \u201cReligiously. The Album.\u201d did well \u2014 something he didn't see coming \u2014 Zimmerman found himself trying to recreate it while writing for his second album. \u201cIt just didn't work,\u201d he says. \u201cI just found myself not really writing that great of songs because I\u2019m trying to write other songs that have already been written.\u201d",
      "So, he took a step back, and asked himself: \u201cWhat am I trying to do with my music? And what is the whole goal of this next album?\u201d The answer was simple: He wanted to tell stories from his life.",
      "\u201cYou didn't know what you were doing the first time. And you don't know what you're doing now,\u201d he told himself. \u201cSo just write songs that you love and try to write songs that you feel like people can relate to, you know, stories from things I\u2019ve been through.\u201d",

      "For his second album, Zimmerman wanted to make sure he worked with artists he had true relationships with.

Then, Combs invited Zimmerman to perform at his Hurricane Helene relief benefit \u201cConcert for Carolina.\u201d They hit it off, and the rest is history.

      "\u201cFirst Steps\u201d is the last major blockbuster of the summer. It added nearly $40 million internationally in its second weekend, bringing thefilm's global total to $369 million. The movie's box office drop off was surprising given its strong reviews, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore.",

      "Here's how \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d became the year's surprising success story.",
      "The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack utilizes some of the best and brightest in the genre. That included a partnership with K-pop company The Black Label, co-founded by super producer Teddy Park, known for his work with YG, Blackpink and 2NE1 \u2014 empowered girl groups used as references for the film\u2019s protagonists, the trio HUNTR/X.",
      "It's one of the many reasons the musical film's soundtrack stands on its own. Filmmakers \u201creally did their homework,\u201d says Jeff Benjamin, a music journalist who specializes in K-pop.",
      "Indeed, they did a lot of research. One of the film\u2019s directors, Maggie Kang, said that her team prioritized \u201crepresenting the fandom and the idols in a very specific way,\u201d as to not disappoint K-pop fans.",
      "They pulled from a treasure trove of influences heard at every corner: The fictional, rival boy band Saja Boys\u2019 hit song \u201cSoda Pop,\u201d for example, references the \u201990s K-pop group H.O.T.",
      "And it has worked. \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is the highest charting soundtrack of 2025, with eight of its songs landing on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked at No. 2 on the all-genre Billboard 200. To put that in perspective: Lorde's \u201cVirgin\u201d and Justin Bieber's \u201cSwag\u201d did the same.",
      "In some ways, it recalls Disney's \u201cEncanto,\u201d which topped the Billboard 200 and produced a No. 1 hit, \u201cWe Don't Talk About Bruno \u201d in 2022. Similarly, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d embraces \u201cthe original soundtrack, which is a lost art form,\u201d adds Benjamin.",
      "Tamar Herman, a music journalist and author of the \u201cNotes on K-pop\u201d newsletter, says the movie succeeds because it embraces animated musical tradition and authentic K-pop music production styles in equal measure. She considers \u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d to be \u201ca musical with songs inspired by K-pop,\u201d not unlike a Jukebox musical, where the songs of ABBA are reimagined for \u201cMamma Mia.\u201d",
      "The novelty of the film, too, seems to be resonating. Where many animated films rely on adapting existing intellectual property, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is original. And it comes from an original perspective. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely Korean, it\u2019s not completely Western and it\u2019s kind of right in that middle,\u201d says Kang. \u201cIt\u2019s like not pulled from one side; it\u2019s kind of flavors of both. So, I think that\u2019s what makes the movie feels a little different.\u201d",
      "And \u201cthe core story is what\u2019s drawing everybody in,\u201d says Kang.",
      "San Francisco-based cosplayer and content creator Nanci Alc\u00e1ntar, who goes by Naanny Lee online agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a K-pop group, but it also tells a story of their journey, of how they transform into powerful warriors,\u201d said Alc\u00e1ntar in Spanish. For her, it goes beyond K-pop \u2014 it\u2019s about the narrative.",
      "Kang\u2019s approach to cultural authenticity, too, may have contributed to the film\u2019s crossover appeal. Rather than explaining Korean elements like HUNTR/X\u2019s visit to a traditional medicine clinic or translating K-pop light stick culture for Western audiences, she opted for full immersion. \u201cWe just wanted everybody to just accept that they were in Korea,\u201d Kang said.",
      "The director said this method of \u201cthrowing people into the deep end of a culture\u201d breaks down barriers better than heavy-handed explanation. \u201cWe just wanted to keep everything feeling normal,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf you don\u2019t shine a light on it, it just becomes more easily accepted.\u201d",

      "Santiago was initially skeptical of the title \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like with big companies they kind of like to use K-pop as a bait. They kind of like to take advantage of K-pop fans\u2019 sincerity,\u201d said Santiago. \u201cBut I felt like with this one, it was such like kind of a love letter to K-pop fans.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- For Buddy Guy \u2014 a stalwart and staunch defender of the blues \u2014 there's nothing more important than keeping his chosen genre at the forefront of conversation. It comes naturally: Guy is one of America's greatest guitar players, a singular artist with a thick roster of A-list super fans \u2014 Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Gary Clark Jr. among them.",
      "The list also includes innovative writer and director Ryan Coogler, who tapped Guy for his critically acclaimed film \u201cSinners\u201d earlier this year, and artists like Peter Frampton and the Eagles' Joe Walsh, who feature on his new album \u201cAin't Done with the Blues.\u201d It releases Wednesday, on Guy's 89th birthday.",
      "For the eight-time Grammy Award-winning musician, those recognitions aren't priority. The longevity of the music that made his life is his primary concern. \u201cLike I promised B.B. King, Muddy Waters and all of them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press over the phone, \u201cI do the best I can to keep the blues alive.\u201d",
      "He's concerned that radio stations no longer play the blues, and that the genre might miss out on connecting with younger listeners. It's one of the reasons \u201cAin't Done with the Blues\u201d is a strong collection of classics that run the risk of being forgotten \u2014 like on the album closer \u201cTalk to Your Daughter,\u201d a rendition of the J.B. Lenoir tune.",
      "In Guy's performance, there's an undeniable universality. \u201cBlues is based on everyday life,\u201d he says. \u201cA good time or a bad time.\u201d",
      "Or, another way Guy explains it: \u201cMusic is like a bowl of real good gumbo. They got all kinds of meat in there. You got chicken in there, you got sausage in there. You got a seafood in it. ... When we play music, we put everything in there.\u201d",
      "It's resonating. In its 2025 midyear report, Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, found that U.S. on-demand audio streams of blues music has climbed this year due to the success of \u201cSinners.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors said they now expect music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs could face a prison sentence \u201csubstantially higher\u201d than the four to five years they once thought he was likely to face after his conviction on two prostitution-related charges.",
      "They made the observation late Thursday in a Manhattan federal court written submission in which they also opposed Combs' request this week to be released on $50 million bail while he awaits an Oct. 3 sentencing.",
      "In early July, Combs, 55, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges carrying potential life prison terms but was convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for arranging for girlfriends and male sex workers to travel to engage in sexual encounters that he filmed.",
      "Each prostitution-related charge carries a potential maximum 10 years in prison.",
      "Prosecutors said after the verdict that they thought federal sentencing guidelines meant to prevent wide disparities in sentencings for the same crimes would likely call for a prison term of four to five years. But they said Thursday they believe the guidelines range \u201cwill be substantially higher,\u201d raising the risk Combs will flee.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian will have wide latitude in determining a sentence and can choose to ignore the guidelines, which are not mandatory. Combs' lawyers have said they believe the guidelines, if properly calculated, will call for 21 to 27 months in prison.",
      "On the day of the verdict, prosecutors won a bail fight after defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo argued Combs should be freed immediately on bail.",
      "Subramanian denied the defense request, saying Combs had not met the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a \u201clack of danger to any person or the community.\u201d But he said Agnifilo could renew the request.",
      "In doing so Tuesday, Agnifilo cited other cases he said were comparable to Combs' conviction in which defendants were granted bail. And he cited severe conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where Combs has been held since his September arrest at a New York hotel.",

      "NEW YORK -- Rene\u00e9 Rapp was clear on her intentions for her sophomore album, \u201cBite Me,\u201d from the start.",
      "\u201cI wanted to love this,\u201d Rapp says. \u201cI wanted to be able to walk away from this and be so proud of myself and impressed, no matter what anybody else thought.\u201d Her first album, 2023's \u201cSnow Angel, \u201d  had been an experiment in figuring out her sound (a mix of pop, R&B and heart-wrenching ballads), and assembling a collection of songs that worked together. This album, out Friday, offered the chance to do it again, with an eye toward the way her life had changed in the intervening years.",
      "\u201cThat intention, and also wanting to prove it to myself, was really grueling,\u201d Rapp told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd also really fun.\u201d",
      "The writing process gave Rapp, 25, an outlet to work through the burnout-inducing whirlwind that was her career in those two years. Uncharacteristically restrained in its vocal styling, the album's lead single, \u201cLeave Me Alone,\u201d is strikingly open \u2014 clever zingers allude to her departure from HBO\u2019s \u201cSex Lives of College Girls,\u201d the media frenzy that surrounded her turn as Regina in the 2024 remake of \u201cMean Girls,\u201d and the external pressure she felt to put out more music after the positive reception of \u201cSnow Angel.\u201d Basically, anything that's been said about her in the last few years? She reframes it, poking fun at her reputation and the industry.",
      "\u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d felt like a proper introduction to the album, Rapp says, and \u201cBite Me\u201d \u2014 both a warning and a tease \u2014 the appropriate title. Paris Hilton and Monica Lewinsky were among the famous faces that teased the album upon its announcement, donning merch emblazoned with the title in bold print. Rapp herself posed in front of a newsstand filled with mock tabloids depicting her as a diva, concealed behind big sunglasses and a fur coat, to promote the second single, \u201cMad.\u201d (\u201cThat's a Rapp!\u201d the headline read.)",
      "\u201cIt really feels just like a time capsule of those two years of my life, a lot having to do with the business and the industry and people\u2019s expectations of me,\u201d Rapp says of the album. \u201cAnd then also me wanting things for myself and being confused where those two roads diverge.\u201d",
      "Rapp's confidence and humor is evident across the album, just as it is on stage \u2014 \u201cI write lyrics in the way that I talk,\u201d she says. Many of the tracks tackle the destabilizing emotions that accompany the beginning and end of relationships, whether platonic or romantic, and how her now-very public career has amplified the challenges of creating, and maintaining, those connections.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so surrounded all the time, but I feel so lonely, and it feels really heavy and isolating. And I think a lot of that is just being an artist. And I also think a lot of that is just like the nature of like the business, for better or for worse,\" she says. The can't-be-bothered attitude heard on \u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d is countered by the ache of \u201cThat's So Funny,\u201d which recounts the end of a deeply affecting, but ultimately toxic friendship in Rapp's signature soaring vocals.",

In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",
      "She kept writing and recording. Nashville was next: She sang on Porter Wagoner's show; she got a deal with Monument Records. Her greatest hit would arrive soon afterward: \u201cDon\u2019t Touch Me,\u201d the crossover ballad written by Hank Cochran. The song earned Seely her first and only Grammy Award, for best country & western vocal performance in the female category.",

      "He was interviewed again in 2008 and 2009 under the same conditions that he would not be prosecuted with his statements, according to the appeal. It was then that he described his \u201calleged involvement in the murder and identified the alleged shooter,\" the appeal said.",
      "Arnold said prosecutors had not presented any evidence connecting Davis to the slaying other than his own statements, which is not enough for a trial.

      "Harrington Street, which is one block long, will also be called \u201cJerry Garcia Street.\" He died in 1995, but the band's popularity has only grown as younger generations discover the Dead's improvisational music, which blended rock, blues, folk and other styles.",

      "The latest iteration of the band, Dead & Company, with original Grateful Dead members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, will play Golden Gate Park\u2019s Polo Field for three days starting Friday. An estimated 60,000 attendees are expected each day.",
      "Formed in 1965, the Grateful Dead played often and for free in their early years while living in a cheap Victorian home in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. The band later became a significant part of 1967\u2019s Summer of Love, and the Grateful Dead has become synonymous with San Francisco and its bohemian counterculture.",

      "\u201cIt felt like the perfect location to kind of share,\u201d she said. \u201cThe timing was perfect from when the show came out.\u201d",

      "U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney. The ad blitz included \u201cclever, even provocative language\u201d and was \u201cdefinitely going to push buttons,\u201d the company\u2019s chief marketing officer told trade media outlets.",
      "It has. The question now is whether some of the public reactions the fall denim campaign produced is what American Eagle intended.",
      "Titled \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign sparked a debate about race, Western beauty standards, and the backlash to \u201cwoke\u201d American politics and culture. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word \u201cgenes\u201d instead of \u201cjeans\u201d when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",
      "Some critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits.",
      "Marcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said the criticism could have been avoided if the ads showed models of various races making the \u201cgenes\u201d pun.",
      "\u201cYou can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional,\u201d Collins said. \u201cEither one of the three aren\u2019t good.\u201d",
      "Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign's message.",
      "\u201cI love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her \u2018good genes,\u2019\" former Fox News host Megyn Kelly wrote Tuesday on X.",
      "American Eagle didn't respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "The ad blitz comes as the teen retailer, like many merchants, wrestles with sluggish consumer spending and higher costs from tariffs. American Eagle reported that total sales were down 5% for its February-April quarter compared to a year earlier.",
      "A day after Sweeney was announced as the company's latest celebrity collaborator, American Eagle's stock closed more than 4% up. Shares were volatile this week and trading nearly 2% down Wednesday.",
      "Like many trendy clothing brands, American Eagle has to differentiate itself from other mid-priced chains with a famous face or by saying something edgy, according to Alan Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce.",
      "Adamson said the Sweeney campaign shares a lineage with Calvin Klein jeans ads from 1980 that featured a 15-year-old Brooke Shields saying, \u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing.\u201d Some TV networks declined to air the spots because of its suggestive double entendre and Shields' age.",

      "Formed in 1965, the Grateful Dead is synonymous with San Francisco and its counterculture. Members lived in a dirt-cheap Victorian in the Haight and later became a significant part of 1967\u2019s Summer of Love.",
      "That summer eventually soured into bad acid trips and police raids, and prompted the band's move to Marin County on the other end of the Golden Gate Bridge.

      "Similarly, her friend Taylor Swope, 47, survived a tough freshman year at a new school with the help of a Grateful Dead mixtape. The owner of the Little Hippie gift shop is driving from Brooklyn, New York, to sell merchandise, reconnect with friends and see the shows.",

      "DETROIT -- The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s plan this week to relax rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions is the latest Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric.",
      "As part of a larger effort to undo climate-based governmental regulations, the EPA on Tuesday said it wants to revoke the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. That would cripple the legal basis for limiting emissions from things like power plants and motor vehicles.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s massive tax and spending law already targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.",
      "The tax law approved in early July also includes another provision that will hit Tesla and other EV makers in the pocketbook \u2014 repealing fines for automakers that don\u2019t meet federal fuel economy standards.",
      "Automakers can buy credits under a trading program if they don\u2019t meet the mileage standards. EV makers like Tesla, which don\u2019t rely on gasoline, earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers. The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.",
      "That is all set to go away under the new law.",
      "Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California\u2019s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales.",
      "It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles. And that's significant because transportation \u2014 which also includes ships, trains and planes \u2014 is the sector that contributes the most to planet-warming emissions in the U.S.",
      "Stringent tailpipe emissions and mileage rules were part of the Biden administration's pledge to clean up the nation\u2019s vehicles and reduce use of fossil fuels by incentivizing growth in EVs. EVs do not use gasoline or emit greenhouse gases.",
      "The Trump administration and the auto industry have said both rules were unreasonable for manufacturers.",
      "Automakers could meet EPA tailpipe limits with about 56% of new vehicle sales being electric by 2032 \u2014 they're currently at about 8% \u2014 along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, and more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon.",
      "The latest mileage targets set under the Biden administration required automakers to get to an average of about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles by model year 2031, and about 35 miles per gallon for pickups and vans by model year 2035.",
      "But Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pressured the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this year to reverse the rules, and has recently said Biden\u2019s inclusion of EVs in calculating them was illegal. NHTSA will likely reset or significantly weaken them.",
      "Then there are the fines that automakers will no longer face for falling short on the fuel economy rules.",
      "\u201cWith the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill, new penalties for automakers not complying with an illegal fuel economy standard designed to push EVs will be zero,\u201d NHTSA spokesman Sean Rushton said in a statement.",
      "Some legacy automakers have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties for not meeting them. Just last year, Jeep-maker Stellantis paid $190.7 million for model years 2019 and 2020, and General Motors paid $128.2 million for the 2016 and 2017 model years.",

      "The agency wrote to carmakers earlier this month informing them the penalties wouldn\u2019t be issued from the model year 2022 onward. Some automakers confirmed receiving the letter but declined to comment further.",
      "Experts say without them, the law \u201cinvites automakers to cheat on government fuel economy rules by setting fines to $0, ensuring consumers will buy more gas guzzlers, pay more at the pump and enrich Big Oil,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former acting NHTSA administrator under Biden, called it a \u201cstunning decision\u201d for NHTSA to essentially forgive the fines from 2022 onward. She said it amounted to a windfall for companies that chose to pay penalties rather than produce more efficient cars.",
      "Carlson said backing away from future fines also \u201cposes a dilemma for auto manufacturers who may feel bound to comply with the law, even if there is not a financial consequence for failing to do so.\u201d",

      "The fraction of kids exempted from vaccine requirements rose to 4.1%, up from 3.7% the year before. It's the third record-breaking year in a row for the exemption rate, and the vast majority are parents withholding shots for nonmedical reasons.",
      "Meanwhile, 92.5% of 2024-25 kindergartners got their required measles-mumps-rubella shots, down slightly from the previous year. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the vaccination rate was 95% \u2014 the level that makes it unlikely that a single infection will spark a disease cluster or outbreak.",
      "The vaccination numbers were posted as the U.S. experiences its worst year for measles spread in more than three decades, with more than 1,300 cases so far.",
      "\u201cThe concern, of course, is that with a further dip in the (vaccination) coverage, we\u2019re going to see even more measles in the coming months,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "It's possible that this year's outbreaks may spur more parents to get their children vaccinated before they go to school, said O'Leary, a University of Colorado pediatric infectious diseases specialist.",
      "But Dr. Philip Huang isn't optimistic. Texas was particularly hard hits by measles this year, with more than half of the cases reported nationally. Despite that, the state passed a law making it easier for parents to get school vaccine exemptions for their kids.",
      "\u201cIt's crazy,\u201d said Huang, Dallas County's health director.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traditionally releases the vaccination coverage data in its flagship publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. CDC officials usually speak to the trends and possible explanations, and stress the importance of vaccinations. This year, the agency quietly posted the data online and \u2014 when asked about it \u2014 emailed a statement.",

      "The wording is more ambivalent about the importance of vaccinations than in the past. That is in keeping with communications from U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before President Donald Trump put him in charge of federal health agencies.",

      "Public health officials focus on vaccination rates for kindergartners because schools can be cauldrons for germs and launching pads for community outbreaks.",
      "For years, those rates were high, thanks largely to school attendance mandates that required key vaccinations. All U.S. states and territories require that children attending child care centers and schools be vaccinated against a number of diseases, including, measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, whooping cough and chickenpox.",
      "All states allow exemptions for children with medical conditions that prevent them from receiving certain vaccines. And most also permit exemptions for religious or other nonmedical reasons.",
      "In the last decade, the percentage of kindergartners with medical exemptions has held steady, at about 0.2%. But the percentage with nonmedical exemptions has risen.",
      "The rates can be influenced by policies that make it harder or easier to obtain exemptions, and by local attitudes among families and doctors about the need to get children vaccinated. Online misinformation and the political divide that emerged around COVID-19 vaccines have led more parents to question routine childhood vaccinations, experts say.",
      "According to the CDC data, 15.4% of kindergartners had an exemption to one or more vaccines in Idaho in the last school year. But fewer than 0.5% did in Connecticut.",
      "It\u2019s good news that the vast majority of parents continue to get their kids vaccinated, O\u2019Leary said. And it\u2019s noteworthy that there is a gap between the percentage vaccinated and the percentage who are exempted \u2014 meaning there likely are unmet access issues, he added.",

      "West Virginia is banning seven artificial dyes from school meals before the start of class",
      "When school starts in West Virginia next month, 240,000 students in districts large and small will notice something missing from their cafeteria trays.",
      "Gone will be red Jell-O fruit cups, yogurt topped with brightly hued sprinkles and Cool Ranch Doritos \u2014 all foods made with synthetic dyes.",
      "In their place will be foods that contain colors made only from natural sources \u2014 such as vegetables, spices and seeds \u2014 after West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a sweeping new law in March banning seven artificial dyes from school meals.",
      "Other states have enacted similar laws that would strip artificial dyes from school meals, but West Virginia\u2019s action is the first to take effect, starting Aug. 1. It triggered a four-month sprint that that left state and local nutrition directors reeling.",
      "\u201cI think the initial reaction was like, \u2018Wow, what are we going to do?\u2019\" said Tony Crago, director of child nutrition for the West Virginia Department of Education. \u201cWhere do we start?\u201d",
      "Across the state, managers of school food programs scoured district grocery lists for dozens of products that contained any trace of petroleum-based synthetic dyes including Red 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2 and Green 3.",
      "\u201cWhen it went into law, it was shocking,\u201d said Diane Miller, who leads child nutrition and food services for Kanawha County Schools in the state\u2019s central region. \u201cWe began to realize that these dyes were in much more than just your cereals.\u201d",
      "West Virginia's ban on synthetic dyes was cheered by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has successfully pressured food makers to agree to remove artificial colors from their products. The law focuses first on dyes in school foods, followed by a second action that will ban the colors plus two preservatives from all foods sold in the state starting in 2028.",
      "The move is aimed at halting potential health effects from the dyes, which have been linked to neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. It's part of a larger focus on limiting artificial ingredients in food, Morrisey said in March.",
      "\u201cBy eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we\u2019re taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges,\u201d he said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of the dyes, citing mixed evidence of potential harm. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said the color additives are safe when \u201cused properly,\u201d in the amounts and products approved by the agency. Most children have no problems when consuming the dyes, the agency adds, \u201cbut some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them.\u201d",
      "More recently, however, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has joined Kennedy in the push to get artificial dyes out of food, despite limited proof of health effects.",
      "\u201cWhen you get rid of petroleum-based dyes, kids aren't gonna all suddenly be healthy,\u201d Makary said on a recent podcast. \u201cWe're not going to address the fact that 30% of our nation's kids have prediabetes by simply removing petroleum-based food dyes. But these are steps in the right direction.\u201d",
      "Nutrition experts agree that removing artificial colors from foods doesn\u2019t address the main drivers of America\u2019s chronic health problems. Those stem largely from ingredients such as added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.",

      "Some suppliers had already removed artificial dyes from some school foods, swapping them for products colored with beet juice or turmeric, said Hollie Best, food service director for Wood County Schools in Parkersburg, which has 11,000 children in 27 schools. Overall, Best said she removed just five foods from her menus.",
      "General Mills said 98% of its products for schools were already made without the banned colors. The company \u201cwill be compliant\u201d with West Virginia's law immediately and plans to remove the dyes from school foods nationwide by next summer, said Mollie Wulff, a company spokesperson.",
      "In Miller\u2019s district, with 23,000 students in 67 schools, the new law affects about 10% of the foods served, she estimated. She expected some foods to contain artificial colors, like strawberry milk and Pop-Tarts. Others were surprising, such as pickles, salad dressing and certain snack chips.",
      "\u201cPeople were like, \u2018Oh my gosh, no more Doritos?'\" Miller said. The popular Cool Ranch flavor contains dyes Red 40, Blue 1 and Yellow 5.",
      "The challenge is finding substitutes that will still appeal to children, Miller said.",
      "\u201cBecause the last thing we need them to do is to choose not to participate in our school lunch program,\u201d she said, adding that schools provide many students their healthiest meals of the day.",
      "Parents of children with sensitivities or allergies to artificial dyes had already raised concerns, according to school food directors. But for others, the presence of synthetic colors in school meals hasn\u2019t been an issue. Chris DeRico, nutrition director of Barbour County Schools, with 2,000 students, said few parents seemed worried about dyes.",
      "\u201cThey'd be in the minority, I believe,\" he said. \u201cIn rural West Virginia, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really on radar screens.\u201d",
      "In Best's district, dyes were already out of the food dished up during the summer session in July. That didn't make much difference to Lilith Wilson, 9, who said her meal of a meatball sub sandwich, sweet potato fries and ice cream was \u201creally good.\u201d",
      "Asked whether she likes school lunches in general, the incoming fourth-grader echoed the sentiments of picky kids everywhere: \u201cSometimes I don't, sometimes I do. It just depends on what it is.\u201d",

      "A bipartisan program in Michigan aims to address the high costs of parenting by giving mothers thousands of dollars in cash with no strings attached",
      "FLINT, Mich. -- A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played.",
      "It was called a \u201cbaby parade.\u201d",
      "The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate.",
      "Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Supporters believe the program could be a model for mitigating the high cost of having children in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of reasons, no matter what your political affiliation or ideology is, to support this,\u201d said state Sen. John Damoose, a Republican and ardent supporter of the program.",
      "To qualify, women need to prove they live in a participating location and that they are pregnant, but don\u2019t have to share details about their income.",
      "It's designed to be simple.",
      "Pregnant women receive $1,500 before delivery and $500 every month for the first six to 12 months of their babies\u2019 lives, depending on the program location.",
      "Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician and the program's founding director, said that window is a time of great economic vulnerability for new parents \u2014 and a critical developmental period for babies.",
      "Most participants need diapers, formula, breast feeding supplies and baby clothes but every family's needs are different. The monthly payment can also help buy food and cover rent, utilities and transportation.",
      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities near Detroit.",
      "Hanna said the main piece of feedback she hears is that the program should be bigger. She\u2019s heard from lawmakers and others hoping to start similar programs in other states.",
      "Hanna said the program's data shows nearly all pregnant women in Flint have signed up since it became available.",
      "The locations were designed to target low-income families, though there is no income requirement. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up.",
      "The founders also want mothers to feel celebrated, hence the parade Friday.",
      "\u201cFor so long moms have been vilified and not supported,\u201d Hanna said.",

      "Sintery had her first daughter 19 years before her second and had to buy all new baby supplies.",
      "She said the cash provided by Rx Kids would have been helpful when she had her first child at age 24, before she went to college.",

      "That was clear, they said, during the new panel's first meeting, in June. It featured a presentation by an anti-vaccine advocate that warned of dangers about a preservative used in a few flu vaccines, but the committee members didn't hear from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staffers about an analysis that concluded there was no link between the preservative and neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "The new panel recommended that the preservative, thimerosal, be removed even as some members acknowledged there was no proof it was causing harm.",

Instead, the alternatives must focus on limiting the damage to vaccination policy in the United States.\u201d",

      "South Korea\u2019s military says it has begun removing loudspeakers along its border with rival North Korea in a move aimed at reducing tensions",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s military said Monday it had begun removing loudspeakers along its border with rival North Korea in a move aimed at reducing tensions.",
      "The speakers had previously been used to blast anti-North Korean propaganda across the border, but the South\u2019s new liberal government halted the broadcasts in June in a conciliatory gesture as it looks to rebuild trust and revive dialogue with Pyongyang, which has largely cut off cooperation with the South in recent years.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry said the physical removal of the loudspeakers from the border was another \u201cpractical measure\u201d aimed at easing tensions between the war-divided Koreas and that it does not affect the South\u2019s military readiness.",
      "Lee Kyung-ho, a spokesperson for the ministry, didn\u2019t share specific details on how the removed loudspeakers will be stored or whether they could be quickly redeployed to the border if tensions flare again between the Koreas. There were no discussions between the two militaries ahead of the South\u2019s decision to remove the speakers, Lee said during a briefing.",
      "North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong Un, didn\u2019t immediately comment on the South Korean step.",
      "The South\u2019s previous conservative government resumed the daily loudspeaker broadcasts in June last year following a yearslong pause in retaliation for North Korea flying trash-laden balloons toward the South in a psychological warfare campaign.",

      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Abdur Rahman Tarif was talking to his sister Meherunnesa over the phone when the voice on the other end of the call suddenly fell silent.",
      "In that moment, Tarif knew something bad had happened. He rushed home, dodging the exchange of fire between security forces and protesters on the streets of Dhaka. When he finally arrived, he discovered his parents tending to his bleeding sister.",
      "A stray bullet had hit Meherunnesa's chest while she was standing beside the window of her room, Tarif said. She was taken to a hospital where doctors declared her dead.",
      "Meherunnesa, 23, was killed on Aug. 5 last year, the same day Bangladesh's former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to flee the country in a massive student-led uprising, which ended her 15-year rule. For much of Bangladesh, Hasina's ouster was a moment of joy. Three days later, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus took over the country as head of an interim government, promising to restore order and hold a new election after necessary reforms.",

But despite the bloodshed and lives lost, many say the prospect for a better Bangladesh with a liberal democracy, political tolerance and religious and communal harmony has remained a challenge.",

      "Bangladesh's anti-government movement exacted a heavy price. Hundreds of people, mostly students, were killed in violent protests. Angry demonstrators torched police stations and government buildings. Political opponents often clashed with each other, sometimes leading to gruesome killings.",
      "Like many Bangladeshis, Tarif and his sister took part in the uprising, hoping for a broader political change, particularly after when one of their cousins was shot and killed by security forces.",
      "\"We could not stay home and wanted Sheikh Hasina to go,\u201d 20-year-old Tarif said. \u201cUltimately we wanted a country without any discrimination and injustice.\u201d",

      "Bickering political parties have failed to reach a consensus on a timetable and process for elections. Mob violence, political attacks on rival parties and groups, and hostility to women\u2019s rights and vulnerable minority groups by religious hardliners have all surged.",
      "Some of the fear and repression that marked Hasina\u2019s rule, and abuses such as widespread enforced disappearances, appear to have ended, rights groups say. However, they accuse the new government of using arbitrary detention to target perceived political opponents, especially Hasina\u2019s supporters, many of whom have been forced to go into hiding.",

      "Human Rights Watch in a statement on July 30 said the interim government \u201cis falling short in implementing its challenging human rights agenda.\u201d It said violations against ethnic and other minority groups in some parts of Bangladesh have continued.",
      "\u201cThe interim government appears stuck, juggling an unreformed security sector, sometimes violent religious hardliners, and political groups that seem more focused on extracting vengeance on Hasina\u2019s supporters than protecting Bangladeshis\u2019 rights,\u201d said Ganguly.",

      "Five years after the Beirut port explosion, families of victims are still seeking justice",
      "BSALIM, Lebanon -- George Bezdjian remembers searching for his daughter, Jessica, after a massive explosion at Beirut's port five years ago. He found her at the St. Georges Hospital where she worked as a nurse.",
      "The hospital was in the path of the blast and was heavily damaged. He found his daughter lying on the floor as her colleagues tried to revive her. They weren't able to save her. She was one of four medical staff killed there.",
      "\u201cI started telling God that living for 60 years is more than enough. If you're going to take someone from the family, take me and leave her alive,\u201d he told The Associated Press from his home in Bsalim, some 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) away from the port. He sat in a corner where he put up portraits of Jessica next to burning incense to honor her.",
      "\u201cI begged him, but he didn\u2019t reply to me.\u201d",
      "The Aug. 4, 2020 blast in Beirut\u2019s port tore through the Lebanese capital after hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate detonated in a warehouse. The gigantic explosion killed at least 218 people, according to an AP count, wounded more than 6,000 others and devastated large swathes of Beirut, causing billions of dollars in damages.",
      "It further angered the nation, already in economic free-fall after decades of corruption and financial crimes. Many family members of the victims pinned their hopes on Judge Tarek Bitar, who was tasked with investigating the explosion. The maverick judge shook the country\u2019s ruling elite, pursuing top officials, who for years obstructed his investigation.",
      "But five years after the blast, no official has been convicted as the probe stalled. And the widespread rage over the explosion and years of apparent negligence from a web of political, security and judicial officials has faded as Lebanon's economy further crumbled and conflict rocked the country.",
      "Judge Bitar had aimed to release the indictment last year but it was stalled by months of war between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group that decimated large swaths of southern and eastern Lebanon, killing some 4,000 people.",
      "In early 2025, Lebanon elected President Joseph Aoun, Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and a Cabinet that came to power on reformist platforms. They vowed that completing the port probe and holding the perpetrators to account would be a priority.",
      "\u201cThere will be no settlement in the port case before there is accountability,\u201d Salam said Sunday.",
      "Bitar, apparently galvanized by these developments, summoned a handful of senior political and security officials in July, as well as three judges in a new push for the case, but was unable to release an indictment over the summer as had been widely expected.",
      "However, the judge has been working on an additional phase of his investigation \u2014 now some 1,200 pages in length \u2014 aiming for the indictment to be out by the end of the year, according to four judicial officials and two security officials. They all spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.",
      "Before completing his own report, he is waiting to receive a fourth and final report from France, which has conducted its own probe into the blast given that several of those killed are citizens of the European country. Bitar since 2021 had received three technical reports, while the fourth will be the French investigation's conclusion, which also looks at the cause of the explosion, the officials added.",

      "Bitar is also looking to hear the testimonies of some 15 witnesses, and is reaching out to European and Arab countries for legal cooperation, the officials said. He hopes that some European suspects can be questioned about the shipment of ammonium nitrate and the vessel carrying them that ended up in the Beirut Port.",
      "Despite the malaise across much of the troubled country, Kayan Tlais, brother of port supervisor Mohammad Tlais who was killed in the blast, is hopeful that the indictment will see the light of day. He says he\u2019s encouraged by Bitar\u2019s tenacity and Lebanon\u2019s new leadership.",
      "\u201cWe do have judges with integrity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president, prime minister, and all those who came and were voted in do give us hope \u2026 they are all the right people in the right place.\u201d",
      "The port and the surrounding Beirut neighborhoods that were leveled in the deadly blast appear functional again, but there are still scars. The most visible are what\u2019s left standing of the mammoth grain silos at the port, which withstood the force of the blast but later partly collapsed in 2022 after a series of fires. Culture Minister Ghassan Salameh Sunday classified them as historical monuments.",
      "There was no centralized effort by the cash-strapped Lebanese government to rebuild the surrounding neighborhoods. An initiative by the World Bank, Europe and United Nations to fund recovery projects was slow to kick off, while larger reconstruction projects were contingent on reforms that never came.",
      "Many family and business owners fixed their damaged property out of pocket or reached out to charities and grassroots initiatives.",
      "A 2022 survey by the Beirut Urban Lab, a research center at the American University of Beirut, found that 60% to 80% of apartments and businesses damaged in the blast had been repaired.",
      "\u201cThis was a reconstruction primarily driven by nonprofits and funded by diaspora streams,\u201d said Mona Harb, a professor of urban studies and politics at AUB and co-founder of the research center.",
      "But regardless of how much of the city is rebuilt and through what means, Aug. 4 will always be a \u201cdark day of sadness,\u201d says Bezdjian. All that matters to him is the indictment and to find who the perpetrators are. He tries to stay calm, but struggles to control how he feels.",
      "\u201cWe will do to them what every mother and father would do if someone killed their child, and if they knew who killed their son or daughter,\u201d he said. \"What do you think they would do?\u201d",

      "As a 3-year-old child, Tamiko Sora was with her parents and two sisters at their home just 1.4 kilometers (0.9 mile) from the hypocenter. The blast destroyed their house and Sora's face was burned, but most of her family survived.",
      "As they made their way to a relatives' home, she met an unattended 5-year-old girl who identified herself as Hiroko and a woman with severe burns desperately asking people to save the baby she carried. Sora still thinks of them often and regrets her family could not help. Her family visited orphanages but could not find the girl.",

      "China has taken a firm stance against U.S. demands.",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. and Chinese officials may be able to settle many of their differences to reach a trade deal and avert punishing tariffs, but they remain far apart on one issue: the U.S. demand that China stop purchasing oil from Iran and Russia.",
      "\u201cChina will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,\u201d China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff.",
      "\u201cCoercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" the ministry said.",
      "The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable \u2014 after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the \"Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,\" Bessent said.",
      "On Thursday, he called the Chinese \u201ctough\u201d negotiators, but said China's pushback hasn't stalled the negotiations. \u201cI believe that we have the makings of a deal,\u201d Bessent told CNBC.",
      "Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Donald Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. \u201cRealizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance\u201d for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said.",
      "In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East.",
      "When Trump unveiled a sweeping plan for tariffs on dozens of countries in April, China was the only country that retaliated. It refused to give in to U.S. pressure.",
      "\u201cIf the U.S. is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China\u2019s consistent official stance,\u201d said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization.",
      "Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.",
      "Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Trump, Kennedy said.",
      "Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as \u201cthe one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington.\" He said Trump has made it clear he wants a \u201cheadline-grabbing deal\u201d with Xi, \u201cso rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal\u2011breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay.\"",
      "Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's \u201cstrategic solidarity\u201d with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said.",
      "\u201cBeijing simply can\u2019t afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,\" he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire\u2011sale prices.\u201d",

      "A new poll finds the vast majority of U.S. adults are feeling some stress about the cost of groceries, as prices continue to rise and concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs remain widespread",
      "NEW YORK -- The vast majority of U.S. adults are at least somewhat stressed about the cost of groceries, a new poll finds, as prices continue to rise and concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs remain widespread.",
      "About half of all Americans say the cost of groceries is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress in their life right now, while 33% say it's a \u201cminor\u201d source of stress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only 14% say it's not a source of stress, underscoring the pervasive anxiety most Americans continue to feel about the cost of everyday essentials.",
      "Other financial stressors \u2014 like the cost of housing or the amount of money in their bank accounts \u2014 are also broadly felt, but they weigh more heavily on younger Americans, who are less likely than older adults to have significant savings or own property.",
      "The survey also found that about 4 in 10 Americans under age 45 say they've used what are known as \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d services when spending on entertainment or restaurant meals or when paying for essentials like groceries or medical care.",
      "Adam Bush, 19, based in Portland, New York, is one of those younger Americans who has used pay-later services for things like groceries or entertainment. Bush works as a welder, fabricating parts for trucks for Toyota, and makes under $50,000 per year.",
      "\u201cI just keep watching the prices go up, so I\u2019m looking for the cheapest possible stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cHot pockets and TV dinners.\u201d",
      "Groceries are one of the most far-reaching financial stressors, affecting the young and old alike, the poll finds. While Americans over age 60 are less likely than younger people to feel major financial anxiety about housing, their savings, child care, or credit card debt, they are just as worried about the cost of groceries.",
      "Esther Bland, 78, who lives in Buckley, Washington, said groceries are a \u201cminor\u201d source of stress \u2014 but only because her local food banks fill the gap. Bland relies on her Social Security and disability payments each month to cover her rent and other expenses \u2014 such as veterinary care for her dogs \u2014 in retirement, after decades working in an office processing product orders.",
      "\u201cI have no savings,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm not sure what's going on politically when it comes to the food banks, but if I lost that, groceries would absolutely be a major source of stress.\u201d",
      "Bland's monthly income mainly goes toward her electric, water and cable bills, she said, as well as care of her dogs and other household needs.",
      "\u201cSoap, paper towels, toilet paper. I buy gas at Costco, but we haven't seen $3 a gallon here in a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cI stay home a lot. I only put about 50 miles on my car a week.\u201d",
      "According to the poll, 64% of the lowest-income Americans \u2014 those who have a household income of less than $30,000 a year \u2014 say the cost of groceries is a \u201cmajor\u201d stressor. That's compared with about 4 in 10 Americans who have a household income of $100,000 or more.",
      "But even within that higher-income group, only about 2 in 10 say grocery costs aren't a worry at all.",
      "Housing is another substantial source of worry for U.S. adults \u2014 along with their savings, their income and the cost of health care. About half of U.S. adults say housing is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress, according to the poll, while about 4 in 10 say that about the amount of money they get paid, the amount of money they have saved and the cost of health care.",
      "About 3 in 10 say credit card debt is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress, while about 2 in 10 say that about the cost of child care and student debt.",
      "But some groups are feeling much more anxiety about their finances than others. Women, for instance, are more likely than men to report high levels of stress about their income, savings, the cost of groceries and the cost of health care. Hispanic adults are also particularly concerned about housing costs and both credit card and student debt. About two-thirds of Hispanic adults say the cost of housing is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress, compared with about half of Black adults and about 4 in 10 white adults.",

      "The Culinary Workers Union representing 60,000 hospitality workers in Nevada has achieved a historic victory on the Las Vegas Strip",
      "LAS VEGAS -- When Susana Pacheco accepted a housekeeping job at a casino on the Las Vegas Strip 16 years ago, she believed it was a step toward stability for her and her 2-year-old daughter.",
      "But the single mom found herself exhausted, falling behind on bills and without access to stable health insurance, caught in a cycle of low pay and little support. For years, she said, there was no safety net in sight \u2014 until now.",
      "For 25 years, her employer, the Venetian, had resisted organizing efforts as one of the last holdouts on the Strip, locked in a prolonged standoff with the Culinary Workers Union. But a recent change in ownership opened the Venetian\u2019s doors to union representation just as the Strip\u2019s newest casino, the Fontainebleau, was also inking its first labor contract.",
      "The historic deals finalized late last year mark a major turning point: For the first time in the Culinary Union's 90-year history, all major casinos on the Strip are unionized. Backed by 60,000 members, most of them in Las Vegas, it is the largest labor union in Nevada. Experts say the Culinary Union\u2019s success is a notable exception in a national landscape where union membership overall is declining.",
      "\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve shown that change can be a positive force, and I\u2019m confident that this partnership will continue to benefit us all in the years to come,\" Patrick Nichols, president and CEO of the Venetian, said shortly after workers approved the deal.",
      "Pacheco says their new contract has already reshaped her day-to-day life. The housekeeper no longer races against the clock to clean an unmanageable number of hotel suites, and she\u2019s spending more quality time with her children because of the better pay and guaranteed days off.",
      "\u201cNow with the union, we have a voice,\u201d Pacheco said.",
      "These gains come at a time when union membership nationally is at an all-time low, and despite Republican-led efforts over the years to curb union power. About 10% of U.S. workers belonged to a union in 2024, down from 20% in 1983, the first year for which data is available, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics.",
      "President Donald Trump in March signed an executive order seeking to end collective bargaining for certain federal employees that led to union leaders suing the administration. Nevada and more than two dozen other states now have so-called \u201cright to work\u201d laws that let workers opt out of union membership and dues. GOP lawmakers have also supported changes to the National Labor Relations Board and other regulatory bodies, seeking to reduce what they view as overly burdensome rules on businesses.",
      "Ruben Garcia, professor and director of the workplace program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas law school, said the Culinary Union's resilience stems from its deep roots in Las Vegas, its ability to adapt to the growth and corporatization of the casino industry, and its long history of navigating complex power dynamics with casino owners and operators.",
      "He said the consolidation of casinos on the Las Vegas Strip mirrors the dominance of the Big Three automakers in Detroit. A few powerful companies \u2014 MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts \u2014 now control most of the dozens of casinos along Las Vegas Boulevard.",
      "\u201cThat consolidation can make things harder for workers in some ways, but it also gives unions one large target,\" Garcia said.",

But a last-minute deal with Caesars narrowly averted the walkout, and it triggered a domino effect across the Strip, with the union quickly finalizing similar deals for workers at MGM Resorts and Wynn properties.",
      "The latest contracts secured a historic 32% bump in pay over the life of the five-year contract. Union casino workers will earn an average $35 hourly, including benefits, by the end of it.",
      "The union's influence also extends far beyond the casino floor. With its ability to mobilize thousands of its members for canvassing and voter outreach, the union's endorsements are highly coveted, particularly among Democrats, and can signal who has the best shot at winning working-class votes.",
      "The union's path hasn't always been smooth though. Michael Green, a history professor at UNLV, noted the Culinary Union has long faced resistance.",
      "\u201cHistorically, there have always been people who are anti-union,\u201d Green said.",
      "Earlier this year, two food service workers in Las Vegas filed federal complaints with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the union of deducting dues despite their objections to union membership. It varies at each casino, but between 95 to 98% of workers opt in to union membership, according to the union.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Culinary Union bosses deserve my support,\u201d said one of the workers, Renee Guerrero, who works at T-Mobile Arena on the Strip. \u201cTheir actions since I attempted to exercise my right to stop dues payments only confirms my decision.\u201d",
      "But longtime union members like Paul Anthony see things differently. Anthony, a food server at the Bellagio and a Culinary member for nearly 40 years, said his union benefits \u2014 free family health insurance, reliable pay raises, job security and a pension \u2014 helped him to build a lasting career in the hospitality industry.",

      "Somalia is seeing quiet agricultural revolution centered around camels",
      "MOGADISHU, Somalia -- Camels have long been the backbone of Somalia 's pastoralist culture, feeding families, transporting goods and standing tall in local folklore. But on the dusty outskirts of the capital, the camel now finds itself at the center of an agricultural revolution that could redefine Somali farming.",
      "On a breezy Wednesday morning in mid-June, The Associated Press visited Beder Camel Farm \u2014 one of a new generation of camel dairies springing up around Mogadishu.",
      "Dozens of camels sauntered around sandy paddocks while others nibbled on fresh fodder under the watchful eyes of herders. In a nearby shed, workers carefully milked the animals and collected the frothy yield in sanitized containers.",
      "Demand for camel milk is growing, buoyed by a wave of local entrepreneurs who see untapped potential in a traditional resource.",
      "Somalia is home to over 7 million camels \u2014 more than any other country on Earth \u2014 but only a fraction of that milk has ever reached urban grocery shelves, according to industry estimates.",
      "At the heart of the shift toward a modern approach to camel milk production is Dr. Abdirisak Mire Hashi, a veterinarian and the farm\u2019s manager. For Hashi, it's not only about profit \u2014 it's about preserving heritage while embracing progress.",
      "\u201cSomalis take pride in their heritage of raising camels. However, the way camels are raised has changed significantly over time,\" Hashi told The Associated Press as he inspected a milking herd.",
      "Each camel at Beder now produces up to 10 liters (2.6 gallons) of milk daily \u2014 double what traditional herders typically yield. The increase is attributed to new investments in veterinary care, better feed, and modern milking practices. The camels are routinely checked by vets, given nutritional supplements, and grazed on scientifically blended fodder, a far cry from the roaming nomadic herds of decades gone by.",
      "\u201cWe were among the first to establish this kind of farm back in 2006, when very few people even knew about commercial camel milk production,\u201d said Jama Omar, CEO of Beder Camel Farm. \u201cOther farms have entered the market since then, but we currently hold around 40% of the market share.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe employ nearly 200 full-time staff,\u201d he added. \u201cIn addition, we bring in seasonal workers during key periods such as planting and harvest.\u201d",
      "The farm\u2019s biggest leap may be its yogurt factory \u2014 the first in Somalia dedicated to processing camel milk into yogurt.",
      "Inside the factory, workers in white coats oversee stainless steel vats as fresh milk is cultured and packed. The final product is sold under the Beder brand which now retails in urban supermarkets across Mogadishu.",
      "Nelson Njoki Githu, a Kenyan-born food engineer overseeing the production line, says camel milk yogurt isn\u2019t just a novelty \u2014 it fills an important nutritional gap for local consumers.",
      "\u201cThe number one benefit compared to cow milk is that camel milk has lower levels of lactose,\u201d Githu explained. \u201cPeople with lactose intolerance can consume this milk without any issue. Again, the vitamin levels are higher, especially vitamin C, iron and zinc, compared to cow milk.\u201d",

      "Such benefits have helped Beder\u2019s yogurt stand out in Mogadishu\u2019s increasingly competitive dairy market.",
      "Hashi said the next step is scaling up the business. He hopes to expand Beder\u2019s network of collection points beyond Mogadishu and plans to train pastoralists in remote areas on modern milking and hygiene practices so that more milk can be safely processed and sold.",
      "\u201cIf we can modernize how we raise camels and handle the milk, we can create jobs, improve nutrition, and build pride in our own local products,\u201d Hashi said.",
      "The Somali government is encouraging more investment in the industry.",
      "\u201cThe benefits of camel milk are countless,\u201d said Dr. Kasim Abdi Moalim, Director of Animal Health at Somalia\u2019s Ministry of Livestock. \u201cIn countries like the UAE, camel milk is also used for cosmetics. Somalia must catch up and develop the full value chain.\u201d",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Warren Buffett's company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in Kraft Heinz, as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathaway helped bankroll.",
      "Berkshire said it earned $12.37 billion, or $8,601 per Class A share, during the quarter. That's down from $30.248 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, a year ago, because it recorded a much smaller paper investment gain this year.",
      "Berkshire's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it has to record the current value of its massive investment portfolio even though it doesn't sell most of the stocks. That's why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings, which exclude those investment gains. Although last year Berkshire did surprise shareholders by selling off a huge chunk of its Apple stake which inflated the investment gains then.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings were only down slightly at $11.16 billion, or $7,759.58 per Class A share. That compares with $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, a year ago. Most of Berkshire's myriad assortment of companies \u2014 major insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, a group of utilities and a collection of manufacturing and retail businesses \u2014 generally performed well despite the uncertainty about the economy and President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expected Berkshire to report earnings per Class A share of $7,508.10, so the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's results were ahead of that.",
      "Berkshire owns more than 27% of Kraft Heinz' stock and, for years, it had representatives on the company's board. Buffett has said previously that he believes the company's iconic brands will do well over time, but in hindsight, he overpaid for the investment and underestimated the challenges branded foods face from retailers and the growth of private label products.",
      "This spring, Berkshire's representatives resigned from the Kraft Heinz board shortly before the company announced it is exploring strategic options that may include spinning off a large part of its portfolio of brands.",
      "Over the years since Berkshire helped Kraft buy Heinz in 2015, the company has been hurt by changing consumer tastes and a shift toward healthier options than Kraft\u2019s core collection of processed foods.",
      "Buffett's is still sitting on a massive pile of $344.1 billion in cash, although the company's reserves dipped slightly from the $347.7 billion cash it was holding at the end of the first quarter. Buffett told shareholders in May he just isn't finding any attractive deals for companies he understands.",

Over the decades, he has built Berkshire by finding strong companies selling for less than they are worth. CSX is trading near its 52-week high at $35.01 amid all the deal speculation.",
      "\u201cHe wants to do it because he found an undervalued franchise -- not because the market says you need to do a deal,\u201d Seifert said. \u201cI think one of the reasons why that cash hasn\u2019t been deployed is that valuations run through the Berkshire M-and-A model tend to be too rich. But if there\u2019s a logical case to be made they\u2019ll accept it.\u201d",

      "Millions of student borrowers could begin having their wages garnished as soon as this summer",
      "NEW YORK -- Millions of student borrowers could begin having their wages garnished as soon as this summer, according to estimates from credit bureau TransUnion.",
      "The company predicts that by August roughly 3 million borrowers could move into default, meaning they're 270 days past due on payments. At that point, loan holders are at risk of having 15% of their pay docked by the government, with the money going toward the outstanding debt. There has been no clear indication of when wage garnishment will start.",
      "After the pandemic-era pause on student loan payments ended in May, borrowers have had to reassess the state of their loans and budgets. According to TransUnion, another 2 million borrowers are on course to default in September.",
      "A Biden-administration grace period, during which late or missed payments were not counted against credit scores, ended in the fall.",
      "Since then, millions of borrowers have seen hits to their credit ratings.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "\u201cThe most important thing borrowers can do before administrative wage garnishment restarts is to log into studentaid.gov to check whether their federal student loans are in default and take steps now to remove them from default,\u201d said Kyra Taylor, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.",
      "Taylor said it's not uncommon for borrowers to be unaware that their loans are in default. If borrowers attended college or graduate school during different periods of time, or if they have different federal loan types, they may also have multiple student loan servicers.",
      "If that's the case, you should act now to get your loans out of default and back into good standing by either entering a rehabilitation agreement, where you must make nine consecutive payments based on their income, or by consolidating your loans into a new federal Direct Loan.",
      "\u201cBecause this hasn\u2019t happened for so long, there are many people who have no idea they\u2019re at risk,\" said Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "Wait times for student borrowers attempting to contact their loan servicers have been long, with many dropped calls, in part due to layoffs at the Education Department. Ba\u00f1ez recommends contacting your congressperson, using a casework tool that can guide you through submitting a constituent request.",
      "\u201cThese offices have entire teams dedicated to constituent casework for when you have an issue with a federal agency, such as the Department of Education,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you can request assistance from your member of congress \u2014 your representative or senator.\u201d",
      "Until past due payments are paid or the loan's default status is resolved, borrowers are at risk of having up to 15% of their wages deducted directly from their paychecks.",

      "The Department of Education has sent notices to borrowers warning that tax refunds and wages could be withheld starting this summer if borrowers don\u2019t take steps to restart payments. The department hasn\u2019t yet provided additional information on timing.",
      "Richelle Brooks, 37, an education administrator based in Los Angeles, said she's received warnings and notices about the resumption of collection of her loans. For several degrees, she still has $239,000 in outstanding debt, and she was informed her monthly payments on those loans will be roughly $3,000.",
      "\u201cI can't afford it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just came out of the moratorium \u2014 not paying for five years. People getting these notices \u2014 they're terrified. I'm uneasy, too.\"",
      "Brooks said she's an informed borrower who stays up to date on each development and who knows her options. She plans to enroll in coding classes, at least half-time, which could place her loans in deferment, so she wouldn't be required to make monthly payments, while she makes a financial plan.",
      "There's still time to take action.",
      "According to Taylor, the Department of Education must provide 30 days notice before it sends a garnishment order to your employer. During that time, you can request a hearing to object by telling the department that the garnishment would cause you financial hardship. You can also request that the department reduce the amount being garnished and submit documentation about your income and expenses.",
      "To do this, you must make your hearing request in writing, postmarked no later than 30 days after the garnishment order. Your loan holder will then arrange the hearing. If you're unsure who your loan holder is, you can contact the Education Department's Default Resolution Group.",
      "If you were laid off from your last job, you can also object to garnishment if you have not been in your current job for 12 consecutive months. You can further request a hearing and object if you submitted an application for certain kinds of statutory discharges and those have not yet been decided. Some common reasons for statutory discharge of student loans include: if the school you attended closed before you could complete your degree, if your school owes you a refund but fails to pay it, if you're experiencing total disability, or if you're experiencing bankruptcy.",
      "\u201cIf the borrower requests a hearing within 30 days after receiving the garnishment notice, the department cannot start garnishment until it issues a decision on the borrower\u2019s objections and financial hardship request,\u201d Taylor said.",
      "You can request a hearing after the 30 day period is up, but in those cases the department will generally not stop garnishing your wages while the hearing request is pending.",

      "\u201cIn many respects, everybody\u2019s a loser here,\u2019\u2019 said Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at the New York Law School.",
      "Barely six months after he returned to the White House, Trump has demolished the old global economic order. Gone is one built on agreed-upon rules. In its place is a system in which Trump himself sets the rules, using America\u2019s enormous economic power to punish countries that won\u2019t agree to one-sided trade deals and extracting huge concessions from the ones that do.",
      "\u201cThe biggest winner is Trump,\u201d said Alan Wolff, a former U.S. trade official and deputy director-general at the World Trade Organization. \u201cHe bet that he could get other countries to the table on the basis of threats, and he succeeded \u2013 dramatically.\u2019\u2019",
      "Everything goes back to what Trump calls \u201cLiberation Day\u2019\u2019 \u2013 April 2 \u2013 when the president announced \u201creciprocal\u2019\u2019 taxes of up to 50% on imports from countries with which the United States ran trade deficits and 10% \u201cbaseline\u2019\u2019 taxes on almost everyone else.",
      "He invoked a 1977 law to declare the trade deficit a national emergency that justified his sweeping import taxes. That allowed him to bypass Congress, which traditionally has had authority over taxes, including tariffs \u2014 all of which is now being challenged in court.",
      "Trump retreated temporarily after his Liberation Day announcement triggered a rout in financial markets and suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries a chance to negotiate.",
      "Eventually, some of them did, caving to Trump\u2019s demands to pay what four months ago would have seemed unthinkably high tariffs for the privilege of continuing to sell into the vast American market.",
      "The United Kingdom agreed to 10% tariffs on its exports to the United States \u2014 up from 1.3% before Trump amped up his trade war with the world. The U.S. demanded concessions even though it had run a trade surplus, not a deficit, with the UK for 19 straight years.",
      "The European Union and Japan accepted U.S. tariffs of 15%. Those are much higher than the low single-digit rates they paid last year \u2014 but lower than the tariffs he was threatening (30% on the EU and 25% on Japan).",
      "Also cutting deals with Trump and agreeing to hefty tariffs were Pakistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "Even countries that saw their tariffs lowered from April without reaching a deal are still paying much higher tariffs than before Trump took office. Angola's tariff, for instance, dropped to 15% from 32% in April, but in 2022 it was less than 1.5%. And while Trump administration cut Taiwan's tariff to 20% from 32% in April, the pain will still be felt.",

And Trump has made the most of the power vacuum, raising the average U.S. tariff to more than 18%, highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.",
      "At issue in the pending court case is Trump\u2019s use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs without seeking congressional approval or conducting investigations first. Instead, he asserted the authority to declare a national emergency that justified his import taxes.",

    "story": [
      "The San Francisco 49ers have brought back Robert Saleh as defensive coordinator to revive their struggling defense",
      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- The San Francisco 49ers went back to a familiar face when coach Kyle Shanahan looked to revive a defensive unit that had gone from dominant to mediocre in recent years.",
      "The Niners brought back Robert Saleh for a second stint as coordinator in hopes that he could once again build back the defense in similar fashion to what he did in 2019 when San Francisco's stingy defense helped carry the team to the Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cHis commanding presence in defensive meetings is what we needed,\u201d star defensive end Nick Bosa said.",
      "The 49ers aren't the only contender that made a change at play-caller on offense or defense headed into 2025. How all of those work out will go a long way to determining which teams are playing deep into January.",
      "Some teams were forced to make changes they didn't want to with Detroit needing to replace both coordinators after Ben Johnson and Aaron Glenn got head coaching jobs and Super Bowl champion Philadelphia needing to replace offensive coordinator Kellen Moore after he became Saints head coach.",
      "Tampa Bay is in a similar boat for a second straight season after losing an offensive coordinator to a head coaching job with Liam Coen leaving for Jacksonville one year after Dave Canales left for Carolina.",
      "Other teams such as Houston, Cincinnati and Seattle made changes in hopes of finding a spark.",
      "Here's a look at some of the key new coordinators around the NFL:",
      "The 49ers ranked 29th in the league in scoring defense last season, allowing 25.6 points per game, and were tied for the seventh-fewest takeaways with 17 as the unit looked nothing like the dominant ones under Saleh and DeMeco Ryans from 2019-22.",
      "That led to Shanahan making another change at coordinator, bringing back Saleh after he was fired as head coach of the New York Jets to replace the fired Nick Sorensen.",
      "During Saleh\u2019s last two full seasons with the Jets in 2022-23, New York ranked first in yards passing allowed per game (178.9) and yards per play allowed (4.7), and second in total defense (301.7 yards per game).",
      "The Niners are hoping similar results will get them back to the postseason after a 6-11 record in 2024.",
      "Detroit became the third team in the past 15 seasons to lose both coordinators to NFL head coaching jobs in the same offseason with it also happening to Philadelphia following the 2022 season and Cincinnati after 2013. Both those teams went back to the playoffs the following season, losing in the wild-card round.",
      "The Lions have their sights set higher after making it to the NFC title game in 2023 and losing in the divisional round as the top seed last season. Whether that happens will depend heavily on if Morton can keep the offense in the top five in scoring for a fourth straight season after Johnson helped make it one of the most dynamic in the league with his trick plays and schemes.",
      "Morton has only one year of play-calling experience in the NFL in 2017 with the Jets, finishing in the bottom 10 in scoring with an offense that lacked the playmakers he has in Detroit.",

      "Coach DeMeco Ryans made a change after last season even though Houston made it back to the divisional round. That came in spite of the offense taking a big step back thanks in large part to shoddy line play that hindered the growth of QB C.J. Stroud.",
      "Caley comes over after spending the past two seasons on Sean McVay's staff with the Rams and is being counted on to bring some of Los Angeles' successful wrinkles to Houston to help make Stroud's job at quarterback easier.

He's hardly the only talented youngster giving A's fans \u2014 wherever they might be \u2014 reason to feel optimistic about the team's on-field direction.",

      "The roster is shaping up to be a dynamic and competitive one when they arrive. Kurtz is the headliner, but teammate Jacob Wilson was the second favorite for top rookie before going on the injured list last week with a broken left forearm. Lawrence Butler, an electric outfield defender with pop and speed, also looks like a centerpiece for the type of team the A's want to take to Las Vegas.",
      "The club added 18-year-old shortstop Leo De Vries on Thursday as part of a multiplayer trade with San Diego that sent out closer Mason Miller and his 101-mph fastball. MLB.com rates De Vries as as baseball's No. 3 prospect.",
      "Also on the roster \u2014 and under contract through at least 2028 \u2014 is All-Star designated hitter Brent Rooker. Kurtz, Wilson and catcher Shea Langeliers are among the starters who could be under team control with the planned moved to Las Vegas. That core isn't translating into wins yet \u2014 the team is 49-65 this season, worst in the AL West \u2014 largely because the team's pitching lags behind.",
      "\u201cWe certainly want to win in present day and \u201826 and \u201927 are important to us, but a lot of our internal conversations are about what the team will look like in 2028 when we get to Las Vegas,\u201d A's general manager David Forst said. \u201cYou can see it some of the contracts we signed, starting obviously with the manager (Mark Kotsay), but also with Rooker and Lawrence, making sure that two of our key guys are locked up into our time in Vegas.\u201d",
      "Whether management keeps the team together is a question. The A's have a history of trading young players on the verge of landing lucrative contracts and keeping their payroll among the lowest in baseball.",
      "Maybe that changes with the anticipated move to Las Vegas, given owner John Fisher might want to bring a competitive team to the market. The A's, in fact, opened up the wallet this year and signed Rooker to a $60 million, five-year contract and a $65.5 million, seven-year deal with Butler.",
      "\u201cI feel like we're headed in the right direction,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe've got a lot of young players. When a team calls up young players, they might not be ready, but I feel like all our guys are ready. They've shown that they can compete at this level.\u201d",
      "Butler, 25, is part of a clubhouse filled with promising 20-somethings.",

      "Seattle's Cal Raleigh, known as \"Big Dumper,\" has been a powerhouse this season, hitting 42 homers",
      "Seattle's Cal Raleigh \u2014 better known by the catchy nickname \u201cBig Dumper\u201d \u2014 has lived up to the moniker, dropping baseball into the outfield seats all over the big leagues this season.",
      "Manager Dan Wilson has been in awe of his talents.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what you get from Cal,\" Wilson said. \u201cNight in, night out, blocking balls, calling the game, leading a pitching staff, throwing runners out \u2014 that\u2019s what Cal does and he does it very well.\u201d",
      "Oh ... wait a second. Wilson obviously wasn't taking about Raleigh's prodigious power \u2014 he's talking about how the 28-year-old handles the most demanding defensive position on the baseball field: Catcher.",
      "Raleigh has smashed 42 homers this season, putting him on pace for 60, with a chance to catch Aaron Judge's American League record of 62. That would be fun to watch under any circumstance. The fact that the All-Star and Home Run Derby champion is also responsible for guiding the Mariners' pitching staff on most nights makes it even more impressive.",
      "Seattle is currently in the thick of the American League playoff race with a 60-53 record, and the Mariners are relying on Raleigh's bat and his brain to try and make the playoffs for just the third time since 2001.",
      "There's the mental side of the job \u2014 meetings, film study, calling pitches \u2014 but there's also the wear and tear of the physical side. The 2024 Gold Glove winner is also squatting, handling the run game, taking painful foul tips off all parts of his body, putting his 6-foot-2, 235-pound frame through the ringer four or five nights a week.",
      "All while hitting those homers.",
      "The fact that it took Raleigh a few years in the big leagues to emerge as a true superstar \u2014 this is his fourth full season with the Mariners \u2014 isn't surprising. The learning curve for young catchers can be severe and the defensive part of the job takes precedence. There's a long list of backstops who couldn't hit a lick yet carved out long MLB careers.",
      "Raleigh is a man of many talents and his power was always evident. He hit 27 homers in 2022, 30 in 2023 and 34 last season. Now he's on pace for 50 long balls and maybe more. There are only five other players in big league history who have hit at least 40 homers while primarily playing catcher: Salvador Perez, Johnny Bench (twice), Roy Campanella, Todd Hundley and Mike Piazza (twice). Bench, Campanella and Piazza are Hall of Famers.",
      "It's evidence of a player at the top of his game \u2014 and one who has come through plenty of experience.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m trying any harder or doing any more than I have in the past,\u201d Raleigh said. \u201cMaybe a little more focused on the right things, and not constantly trying to tweak or change something that I have been in the past. So, I think that\u2019s been the biggest part to the success, and just trying to keep that consistent and steady.\u201d",
      "Wilson was more direct, putting into perspective what Raleigh has accomplished through the first four months of the season.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty staggering,\u201d Wilson said.",
      "Raleigh's big numbers are part of an offensive surge for MLB catchers: Will Smith, Hunter Goodman, Logan O'Hoppe, Shea Langeliers, Alejandro Kirk, Salvador Perez and William Contreras are among roughly a dozen at the position who are more than holding their own at the plate.",
      "Veteran catcher Carson Kelly is on pace to have his best offensive season in the big leagues at 31, batting .272 with 13 homers and 36 RBIs for the Chicago Cubs. He's been in the big leagues for 10 years and said the balance between offense and defense is tough for young players.",

      "WESTFIELD, Ind. -- Indianapolis Colts backup running back Salvon Ahmed was carted off the field near the end of Sunday\u2019s practice with what coach Shane Steichen described as a severe injury to his right leg.",
      "Ahmed screamed when he was dragged down in the end zone by Trey Washington's hip-drop tackle, bringing an immediate hush to a near-capacity training camp crowd. Players dropped to one knee as trainers worked to immobilize Ahmed's lower leg.",
      "The Colts then gathered around Ahmed as he was placed onto a stretcher.",
      "\"Never want to see that happen,\u201d Steichen said. \u201cWe don't encourage hip-drop tackles. I know Trey is down in the dumps. I don't think he's trying to do that.

      "Ahmed was cut by Miami during last year's training camp and wound up on Denver's practice squad. Indy added him to its practice squad in mid-October and he spent the rest of the season with the Colts and was re-signed to a reserve-futures contract in January.",
      "Following the injury, Indy briefly stopped practice to huddle on the field before deciding to finish its final practice of the day.",
      "\u201cI knew him back when he was at UW when I was training in Seattle,\u201d starting linebacker Zaire Franklin said. \u201cIt's a tough situation. He's competing for a job. He's out here trying to compete and trying to get better. We're warriors on the field, we understand what the possibilities are when we step on the field. Obviously, we're a team so we're not trying to hurt each other. Definitely, tough.\u201d",

      "Healthy sea stars have \u201cpuffy arms sticking straight out,\u201d she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \u201cthen their arms actually fall off.\u201d",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \u201csolve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",

He said the detective work by this team was \u201creally smart and significant.\u201d",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",

      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2013 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",

      "Chinese scientists have been developing strategies to counter Elon Musk's Starlink satellites, which they see as a threat",
      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",
      "\u201cWe are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,\u201d said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. \u201cThe risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.\u201d",

In 2021, Beijing established the state-owned China SatNet company and tasked it with launching a megaconstellation with military capabilities, known as Guowang. In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",
      "Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X\u2019s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",

Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,\u201d they concluded.",
      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",
      "Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation\u2019s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk\u2019s equipment.",
      "Some U.S. analysts say Beijing\u2019s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate. One Chinese paper was titled, simply: \u201cWatch out for that Starlink.\u201d",

      "The U.S.-Japanese-Russian crew of four rocketed from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center. They\u2019ll replace colleagues who launched to the space station in March as fill-ins for NASA\u2019s two stuck astronauts.",
      "Their SpaceX capsule should reach the orbiting lab this weekend and stay for at least six months.",
      "Zena Cardman, a biologist and polar explorer who should have launched last year, was yanked along with another NASA crewmate to make room for Starliner\u2019s star-crossed test pilots.",
      "\u201cI have no emotion but joy right now. That was absolutely transcendent. Ride of a lifetime,\u201d Cardman, the flight commander, said after reaching orbit.",
      "The botched Starliner demo forced Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to switch to SpaceX to get back from the space station more than nine months after departing on what should have been a weeklong trip.",
      "\u201cEvery astronaut wants to be in space. None of us want to stay on the ground, but it\u2019s not about me,\u201d Cardman said before her flight.",
      "NASA\u2019s Mike Fincke \u2014 Cardman\u2019s co-pilot \u2014 was the backup for Wilmore and Williams on Starliner, making those three still the only ones certified to fly it. Fincke and Japan\u2019s Kimiya Yui, former military officers with previous spaceflight experience, were training for Starliner\u2019s second astronaut mission. With Starliner grounded until 2026, NASA switched the two to the latest SpaceX flight.",
      "\u201cBoy, it's great to be back in orbit again,\u201d Fincke radioed. He last soared on NASA's next-to-last space shuttle flight in 2011.",
      "Rounding out the crew is Russia\u2019s Oleg Platonov. The former fighter pilot was pulled a few years ago from the Russian Soyuz flight lineup because of an undisclosed health issue that he said has since been resolved.",
      "On hand for the first launch attempt on Thursday, NASA's new acting administrator, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, met with Roscosmos director general Dmitry Bakanov, an invited guest. The two discussed future collaboration, then left town after thick clouds forced a last-minute delay.",
      "\u201cWhat we learn on these missions is what\u2019s going to get us to the moon and then from the moon to Mars, which is I think the direction that NASA has to be,\u201d Duffy said in a NASA interview. \u201cThere's critical real estate on the moon. We want to claim that real estate for ourselves and our partners.\u201d",

      "To save money in light of tight budgets, NASA is looking to increase its space station stays from six months to eight months, a move already adopted by Russia's space agency.

      "The Department of Defense now says it will continue sharing key data collected by three sophisticated weather satellites that help forecasters track hurricanes",
      "The U.S. Department of Defense will now continue sharing key data collected by three weather satellites that help forecasters track hurricanes. Meteorologists and scientists had warned of risks to accurate and timely storm tracking without the information when officials made plans to stop providing it beyond the end of this month.",
      "Defense officials had planned to cut off distribution of microwave data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, jointly run with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, by the end of June. At the time, NOAA said the cutoff was said \u201cto mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk\" while the U.S. Navy said the program didn't meet \"information technology modernization requirements.\u201d The discontinuation was postponed for one month.",
      "In a notice on Wednesday, officials said there would be no interruption at all.",
      "The Navy said in a statement that its Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center \u201chad planned to phase out the data\u201d as part of modernization efforts. \"But after feedback from government partners, officials found a way to meet modernization goals while keeping the data flowing until the sensor fails or the program formally ends in September 2026.\u201d",
      "The data is used by scientists, researchers and forecasters, including meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center. It gives crucial information about storms that can\u2019t be gleaned from conventional visible or infrared satellites.",
      "\u201cThis satellite data enables hurricane forecasters and their computer models to peer inside a hurricane\u2019s structure, offering vital insight,\" said Union of Concerned Scientists science fellow Marc Alessi. \"Make no mistake: this data not only improves hurricane forecasting accuracy, but could make the difference between whether communities evacuate or not ahead of an approaching hurricane.\u201d",
      "Other microwave data would have been available with this cutoff, but only about half as much, experts said \u2014 increasing the chance that forecasters would miss certain aspects of storms.",
      "A spokesperson for NOAA said the agency will continue to have access to the data for the program\u2019s lifespan and noted that it is just one data set \u201cin a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools\" that the National Weather Service has at its disposal to \u201censure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.\u201d",
      "The news had initially raised scientific eyebrows amid hurricane season, which usually peaks from mid-August to mid-October. Climate change, worsened by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal, have driven storms to become more frequent, severe and deadly.",
      "\u201cThe last-minute reprieve has hurricane forecasters breathing a sigh of relief,\u201d said Jeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections. \u201cLoss of the microwave satellite data would have made it far more likely that timely warnings of dangerous and potentially deadly episodes of hurricane rapid intensification events being delayed by up to 12 hours.\u201d",
      "He added the restoration of the data is also good news for scientists tracking Arctic sea ice loss. Images and microwave satellite data can estimate how much of the ocean is covered by ice, according to NOAA.",

      "NEW YORK -- Fireflies are lighting up summer evenings across the U.S. Northeast, putting on dazzling shows in backyards and city parks.",
      "There's no official count, but experts say a particularly wet spring may have created the ideal conditions for young fireflies to grow into adults to set summer nights aglow.",
      "Fireflies light the night everywhere: There are over 2,000 known species across the globe. They use their characteristic flashes to communicate and find the perfect mate.",
      "In New York City, the lightning bugs are out in the five boroughs, sparkling once the sun goes down in places like Central Park and Prospect Park. The summer months are ideal to spot them as they start to dwindle throughout the month of August.",
      "While northeastern nights may seem brighter this summer, the bugs are still on the decline and they're waning at a faster rate than ever before.",
      "\u201cIt would be a mistake to say firefly populations are high this year, therefore there's no decline,\u201d said Matt Schlesinger with the New York Natural Heritage Program, who is part of an effort to count fireflies in state parks.",
      "Some firefly species could be doing well this year, Schlesinger said, while others are still on the decline.",
      "Habitat loss, pesticide use and light pollution are responsible. In cities, blaring lights from billboards, cars and storefronts can drown out the bugs' glow, making it harder for them to find their kin and pass their genes onto the next generation.",
      "Fireflies are part of the story of summer, said entomologist Jessica Ware with the American Museum of Natural History. Her children grew up seeing them flash in her backyard, but the bugs started to disappear once her kids hit their teenage years.",

    "story": [
      "A 16-year-old\u2019s Roblox game, Grow a Garden, has shattered records for the most concurrent players in history",
      "Whether it serves as a chill escape from the onslaught of the real world or simply a way to beat vacation doldrums, a viral Roblox game about gardening has become the surprise hit of the summer.",
      "Grow a Garden, created by a 16-year-old in a few days, has shattered records for the most concurrent players of any game in history, beating out video games that take years and millions of dollars to develop.",
      "And there\u2019s no one to shoot, fight or race. If your last attempt at cultivating vegetables was FarmVille in 2010, don't worry \u2014 your tomatoes will grow even if you never water them.",
      "Grow a Garden is as simple as its name suggests \u2014 players can fill a plot of land with plants and animals, harvest and sell, trade or steal each others' bounty. The game is low stress, with an aesthetic reminiscent of Minecraft and a soundtrack of soothing classical tunes such as Mozart's Rondo Alla Turca playing in the background. Its popularity has further cemented Roblox' place not just in the gaming world but in popular culture \u2014 for better or for worse, it's where the kids hang out.",
      "\u201cThe word I keep hearing used over and over to describe this particular game is that it\u2019s chill, which is just such a nice alternative. I get a lot of sort of that Animal Crossing vibe from it. You know, like you can check in, you can check your gardens, you can get some new seeds, you can plant them,\u201d said Becky Bozdech, editorial director at the nonprofit Common Sense Media. \u201cI have an 11-year-old son who (plays it) and he says to him the big difference is that a lot of games have a big giant objective that you have to do, but in Grow a Garden, you can just kind of hang out and do what you want.\u201d",
      "Coincidence or not, Grow a Garden soared to popularity around the same time that Take-Two Interactive announced it would delay the launch of its wildly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 until next year. In late June, the gardening game logged 21.6 million concurrent players, surpassing Fortnite\u2019s previous record of 15.2 million according to Roblox. Analysts who follow Roblox's stock say Grow a Garden is helping boost the company's revenue and will push the company's quarterly earnings numbers above Wall Street's expectations.",
      "While it's not clear if the GTA audience flocked to this simple gardening game to pass the time until then, the timing reignited the age-old debate about who gamers are and what titles are taken seriously by the video game establishment. It happened with Candy Crush, with puzzle games, with Animal Crossing. Are people who play cozy games true gamers? Or is the title reserved for the folks who shoot enemies in Call of Duty or drive around creating mayhem in GTA?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge percentage of gamers that play Roblox and the actual industry just views it as like this esoterically immature platform of weird gameplay habits,\u201d said Janzen Madsen, the New Zealand-based CEO and founder of Splitting Point studios, which acquired the game from its teenage creator. \u201cWell, I actually think in five years this is what player expectation is gonna be. And because you guys haven\u2019t embraced it, like you\u2019re not gonna know how to make games.\u201d",
      "To start growing your garden, you'll need a Roblox account. The game will start you out with an empty plot and some money \u2014 sheckles \u2014 and a starter seed. From there, you can plant seeds, harvest and sell your crops and buy more seeds, animals or tools for your garden. While it is possible to play the game without spending real-world money, it will take longer. Once you sell enough crops, you earn money to buy more expensive seeds beyond basic carrots and blueberries.",

      "After recording more than 600 audiobooks, Julia Whelan has become a go-to narrator for books by popular authors including Emily Henry and Taylor Jenkins Reid",
      "Chances are, you've heard Julia Whelan's voice. She's the award-winning narrator behind more than 600 audiobooks by a long list of bestselling authors including Taylor Jenkins Reid,Emily Henry, Michael Crichton, V.E. Schwab and Kristin Hannah. She's also narrated long-form articles for The New Yorker, The Atlantic and Vanity Fair.",
      "You may have read her own writing, too. Whelan's first novel, 2018's \u201cMy Oxford Year,\u201d has been adapted to a Netflix film, out Friday, starring Sofia Carson. The story actually began as a screenplay by Allison Burnett and had been gestating in development for years. Whelan was brought in to help with the script because she had studied abroad at Oxford her junior year of college. Producers then asked if she thought it would make a good book.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Nothing has ever wanted to be a book more. Please let me do this,'\u201d she recalls. It ended up an international bestseller. Her second novel, 2022's \u201cThank You For Listening,\u201d was critically praised. (\u201cThank You For Listening\u201d is about a former actor-turned-audiobook narrator who falls in love with another audiobook narrator.)",
      "You may have even seen Whelan on TV \u2014 she began her career as a child actor, with roles in \u201cFifteen and Pregnant\u201d and on the series \u201cOnce and Again.\u201d Despite her various pursuits, though, she has no plans to leave narration behind. \u201cI feel like I was born to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s everything that I love and that I\u2019m good at and everything I want to be doing.\u201d",
      "That's a good thing, because the audiobook industry is growing. Statista projects this year it will reach $9.84 billion because of smartphones, the increased popularity of audio content and people's desire to multitask. Despite the appetite for audiobooks, for narrators, \u201cthe financial aspect makes zero sense,\u201d says Whelan. She's founded her own publishing company, Audiobrary, to help narrators get paid more fairly.",
      "Whelan, who has narrated as many as 70 books in one year, spoke to The Associated Press about the audiobook industry, Audiobrary and her own writing. Answers are edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "WHELAN: The only reason I was doing 70 books a year was because that\u2019s how many books you have to do when you\u2019re first starting out to keep your head above water because the rates are low. It would be OK if there were a kickback for success, but narrators don\u2019t get royalties. As we\u2019ve seen the industry grow and as we\u2019ve seen the cache of certain narrators expand, and we know listeners will seek out audiobooks that their favorite narrators record. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me that we should be cut out of the long-term financial benefit of success. Audiobrary does a profit-share model with writers, who I also feel don\u2019t get enough percentage of the pie, and a royalty share for narrators. We are also a direct-to-consumer retail channel, so when you buy directly from us, you\u2019re not giving 50-75% of that sale to a retailer. You\u2019re giving it directly to the people who made the product.",

You\u2019re messed up for three or four months. Everything just gets delayed, especially when I was doing 70 books a year, there\u2019s no room for error there.",
      "WHELAN: At this point, there\u2019s still enough work to go around and they are doing the books that have the budget frankly to use them. But I think that audiobook fans \u2014 not your casual audiobook user, but fans \u2014 have favorite narrators and they\u2019re going to look for books by those narrators. So, in stunt-casting situations, sometimes someone is incredible at it, and they are perfect for the book. But sometimes it feels like a very craven, just marketing ploy. I don\u2019t feel infringed upon by them, but I do worry about a future situation where most of the work is going to AI. I don\u2019t lie awake at night worried, but everyone\u2019s threatened right now. It\u2019s very, very hard to even begin to predict what the future could look like.",
      "WHELAN: I think the kids would say that it\u2019s ableist to say that if you didn\u2019t read a book with your eyeballs, then you didn't read it, considering many people have many limitations that would prevent them from physically reading a book. So then are you telling them they\u2019ve never read a book before? Actual data and studies show that listening to a book actually triggers the same response in the brain as reading it, and that the interpretation and understanding of that book is on par with having read it.",
      "WHELAN: There\u2019s been about four ideas that are constantly in rotation, but I think I\u2019ve narrowed it down. I think I\u2019m ready to at least start exploring one of them at the beginning of next year.",
      "WHELAN: I very much think we could. I have said no up to this point because, this time around, I want to be very creatively involved. There\u2019s just too many things about audiobooks that someone could get wrong not knowing anything about the industry. I want be involved so I\u2019m willing to hold onto it until the right situation comes along.",

      "Exempt services include online gaming, messaging, education and health apps. They are excluded because they are considered less harmful to children.",

    "story": [
      "Linda and Tim Pierce have welcomed a baby boy using a 30-year-old embryo",
      "A baby boy born last week to an Ohio couple developed from an embryo that had been frozen for more than 30 years in what is believed to be the longest storage time before a birth.",
      "In what's known as embryo adoption, Linda and Tim Pierce used a handful of embryos donated in 1994 in pursuit of having a child after fighting infertility for years. Their son was born Saturday from an embryo that had been in storage for 11,148 days, which the Pierces\u2019 doctor says sets a record.",
      "It\u2019s a concept that has been around since the 1990s but is gaining attraction as some fertility clinics and advocates, often Christian-centered, oppose discarding leftover embryos because of their belief that life begins at or around conception and that all embryos deserve to be treated like children who need a home.",
      "\u201cI felt all along that these three little hopes, these little embryos, deserved to live just like my daughter did,\u201d said Linda Archerd, 62, who donated her embryos to the Pierces.",
      "Just about 2% of births in the U.S. are the result of in vitro fertilization, and an even smaller fraction involve donated embryos.",
      "However, medical experts estimate about 1.5 million frozen embryos are currently being stored throughout the country, with many of those in limbo as parents wrestle with what to do with their leftover embryos created in IVF labs.",
      "Further complicating the topic is a 2024 Alabama Supreme Court decision that said that frozen embryos have the legal status of children. State leaders have since devised a temporary solution shielding clinics from liability stemming from that ruling, though questions linger about remaining embryos.",
      "Archerd says she turned to IVF in 1994. Back then, the ability to freeze, thaw and transfer embryos was making key progress and opening the door for hopeful parents to create more embryos and increase their chances of a successful transfer.",
      "She wound up with four embryos and initially hoped to use them all. But after the birth of her daughter, Archerd and her husband divorced, disrupting her timeline for having more children.",
      "As the years turned into decades, Archerd said she was wracked with guilt about what to do with the embryos as storage fees continued to rise.",
      "Eventually, she found Snowflakes, a division of Nightlight Christian Adoptions, which offers open adoptions to donors that allows people like Archerd. She was also able to set preferences for what families would adopt her embryos.",

      "The process was tricky, requiring Archerd to contact her initial fertility doctor in Oregon and dig through paper records to get the proper documentation for the donation. The embryos then had to be shipped from Oregon to the Pierces\u2019 doctor in Tennessee. The clinic, Rejoice Fertility in Knoxville, refuses to discard frozen embryos and has become known for handling embryos stored in outdated and older containers.",
      "Of the three donated embryos the Pierces received from Archerd, one didn\u2019t make the thaw. Two were transferred to Lindsey Pierce\u2019s womb, but just one successfully implanted.",
      "According to Dr. John David Gordon, the transfer of the nearly 31-year-old embryo marks the longest-frozen embryo to result in a live birth. He would know, Gordon says his clinic assisted in the previous record, when Lydia and Timothy Ridgeway were born from embryos frozen for 30 years, or 10,905 days.",
      "\u201cI think that these stories catch the imagination,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cBut I think they also provide a little bit of a cautionary tale to say: Why are these embryos sitting in storage? You know, why do we have this problem?\u201d",
      "In a statement, Lindsey and Tim Pierce said the clinic\u2019s support was just what they needed.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t go into this thinking about records \u2014 we just wanted to have a baby,\u201d Lindsey Pierce said.",
      "For Archerd, the donation process has been an emotional roller coaster. Relief that her embryos finally found a home, sadness it couldn\u2019t be with her and a little anxiety about what the future holds next, with possibly meeting the Pierces and the baby in person.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping that they\u2019re going to send pictures,\u201d she said, noting that the parents have already sent several after the birth. \u201cI\u2019d love to meet them some day. That would be a dream come true to meet \u2014 meet them and the baby.\u201d",

      "\"The sergeant-at-arms and any officers appointed by her are directed to send for all absentees whose attendance is not excused for the purposes of securing and maintaining their attendance under warrant of arrest, if necessary, until further order of the House,\" said Republican Rep. Dustin Burrows, the speaker of the Texas House of Representatives.",
      "Shortly after the vote, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said he ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to find and arrest the Democrats who fled the state, an order which will remain in effect until they are \"accounted for and brought back\" to Austin.",
      "The warrants, however, have no power outside state lines and it's unclear to what extent, if at all, Texas law enforcement may and could coordinate with their counterparts in the relevant states.",
      "Later Monday, Abbott said he had asked the Texas Rangers to investigate the Democrats who left the state for potential law violations \u2014 including bribery for soliciting funds to support their effort.",
      "\"Reports indicate that many absentee Texas House Democrats have solicited or received funds to evade conducting legislative business and casting votes. Under the Texas Penal Code, any of those Democrats who solicit, accept, or agree to accept such funds to assist in the violation of legislative duties or for purposes of skipping a vote may have violated bribery laws. Also, it could be a bribery violation for any other person who offers, provides, or agrees to provide such funds to fleeing Democrat House members,\" the governor said in a statement.",
      "The move comes amid a showdown over a Republican-led effort, backed by President Donald Trump, to create a new congressional map with control of the U.S. House potentially at stake.",
      "Abbott had given Texas House Democrats a deadline of 3 p.m. local time on Monday to return to the statehouse for the special session or risk losing their jobs. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton suggested Democrats who left should be arrested and forcibly brought back, though he later admitted that would be a \"challenge.\"",
      "Paxton said in a statement late Monday afternoon that he is \"prepared to do everything in my power\" to hold the Democrats accountable for abdicating their duties in the House and for having \"sacrificed their constituents for a publicity stunt.\"",
      "The response from the Texas House Democratic Caucus to Abbott's threat was, \"Come and take it.\"",
      "Texas House members who left the state were slated to hold various events throughout the day Monday in Democrat-led states.",
      "The proposed congressional map could create up to five new Republican seats and help the party keep control of the House in the 2026 midterm elections. Consideration of the bill had been set for Monday, but couldn't proceed as the missing Democrats denied a quorum.",
      "The first news conference with Texas Democrats on Monday was with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in Albany. Hochul's message for Texas House Democrats was, \"You are on the right side of history. And you're not alone.\"",
      "\"As I said, history will judge us and how we respond to this moment. But here in New York, we will not stand on the sidelines with the timid souls on the sidelines who don't care and will not invest their heart and soul into this battle. This is a war,\" Hochul continued. \"We are at war and that's why the gloves are off. And I say, bring it on.\"",
      "Hochul said that she would seek to disband or change New York's independent redistricting commission through a constitutional amendment in response to Texas -- but admitted that doing so would not be possible before the 2028 election. Under former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New Yorkers passed a constitutional amendment in 2014 prohibiting partisan redistricting.",

      "Trump has said he wants Republicans to pick up five new seats in Texas and others around the country. Democrats have slammed the move and said it risks hurting minority voters.",
      "Asked by Fox News why he is pushing for new districts, Abbott said it is partly to dismantle \"coalition districts\" (where racial minority groups together make up most of the population) and to redraw districts based on political considerations.",
      "\"Gerrymandering can be done or drawing lines can be done on the basis of political makeup, as in Republican versus Democrat, and there's nothing illegal about that,\" Abbott said. \"And then when you look at the outcome of the most recent presidential election, all these districts that are being added are districts that were won by Trump.\"",
      "Texas' redistricting effort has prompted some Democrat-led states to investigate similar moves to \"fight fire with fire,\" as California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has said. Newsom is considering calling a special session on redistricting in November to make the state's congressional map more Democrat-friendly. Newsom said Monday that California Democrats have or are nearly done with a draft of a new map.",

Kevin Kiley will formally introduce the bill on Tuesday which will \"nullify new maps adopted by states before the 2030 census, including any that are adopted this year.\" The bill's future remains uncertain, however, as it's unlikely to be backed by House Republican leadership.",

      "The lawsuit stems from a Rhode Island law dictating how the state issues firearms permits.",

However, it also allows the attorney general\u2019s office to issue open-carry permits \u201cupon a proper showing of need.\u201d Unlike municipalities, the attorney general is not required to issue such permits.",

Court documents show that the attorney general's office denied their permits because all of them had been granted \u201crestricted\u201d permits, which only allowed concealed carry.",
      "Smith said in his ruling that unrestricted permits \u201care a privilege and there is no constitutionally protected liberty interest in obtaining one.\u201d",

      "The fair touts itself as the largest campground fair in the country, where attendees cram into more than 500 two-and-three story wood cabins for eight days every year. The larger cabins can sleep upwards of 30 people, sometimes in the same room.",

It's located in what's known as \u2018watermelon alley,' one of several neighborhoods that divide up the community, which feels like a mix between a candy-colored frontier town and an amusement park. His children grew up going there. The pictures they drew on hot summer days still hang on the walls, joined now by their own children's artwork.",

      "Horse-race watching at the nearby race track and card playing are among Hardy family's favorite activities during the fair. They take their kids to the carnival rides and cook large family meals. On their way to the track, they walk through Founders Square, the oldest section of cabins with a pavilion used for dances and political speeches. It's where Ronald Reagan gave his famous states' rights speech in 1980 while running for president.",

      "The communal atmosphere extends to mealtime. Although only about 20 people stay in their cabin, Salter's family often feeds 50 or 60 people a day.",

      "The Senate is leaving Washington Saturday night for its monthlong August recess without a deal to advance dozens of President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate left Washington Saturday night for its monthlong August recess without a deal to advance dozens of President Donald Trump's nominees, calling it quits after days of contentious bipartisan negotiations and Trump posting on social media that Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer can \u201cGO TO HELL!\u201d",
      "Without a deal in hand, Republicans say they may try to change Senate rules when they return in September to speed up the pace of confirmations. Trump has been pressuring senators to move quickly as Democrats blocked more nominees than usual this year, denying any fast unanimous consent votes and forcing roll calls on each one, a lengthy process that can take several days per nominee.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re desperately in need of change,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune said of Senate rules Saturday after negotiations with Schumer and Trump broke down. \"I think that the last six months have demonstrated that this process, nominations is broken. And so I expect there will be some good robust conversations about that.\u201d",
      "Schumer said a rules change would be a \u201chuge mistake,\" especially as Senate Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass spending bills and other legislation moving forward.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump tried to bully us, go around us, threaten us, call us names, but he got nothing,\" Schumer said.",
      "The latest standoff comes as Democrats and Republicans have gradually escalated their obstruction of the other party's executive branch and judicial nominees over the last two decades, and as Senate leaders have incrementally changed Senate rules to speed up confirmations \u2014 and make them less bipartisan.",
      "In 2013, Democrats changed Senate rules for lower court judicial nominees to remove the 60-vote threshold for confirmations as Republicans blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial picks. In 2017, Republicans did the same for Supreme Court nominees as Democrats tried to block Trump\u2019s nomination of Justice Neil Gorsuch.",
      "Trump has been pressuring Senate Republicans for weeks to cancel the August recess and grind through dozens of his nominations as Democrats have slowed the process. But Republicans hoped to make a deal with Democrats instead, and came close several times over the last few days as the two parties and the White House negotiated over moving a large tranche of nominees in exchange for reversing some of the Trump administration's spending cuts on foreign aid, among other issues.",

But it was clear that there would be no agreement when Trump attacked Schumer on social media Saturday evening and told Republicans to pack it up and go home.",
      "\u201cTell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL!\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social. \u201cDo not accept the offer, go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country.\u201d",
      "Thune said afterward that there were \u201cseveral different times\u201d when the two sides thought they had a deal, but in the end \u201cwe didn't close it out.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the first time in recent history that the minority party hasn\u2019t allowed at least some quick confirmations. Thune has already kept the Senate in session for more days, and with longer hours, this year to try and confirm as many of Trump\u2019s nominees as possible.",
      "But Democrats had little desire to give in without the spending cut reversals or some other incentive, even though they too were eager to skip town after several long months of work and bitter partisan fights over legislation.",
      "\u201cWe have never seen nominees as flawed, as compromised, as unqualified as we have right now,\u201d Schumer said.",

    "story": [
      "Under Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, Florida has executed more people so far this year than any other state, setting a new state record",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- In the final moments of a life defined by violence, 60-year-old Edward Zakrzewski thanked the people of Florida for killing him \"in the most cold, calculated, clean, humane, efficient way possible,\" breathing deeply as a lethal drug cocktail coursed through his veins.",
      "With his last breath, strapped to a gurney inside a state prison's death chamber, Zakrzewski paid what Florida had deemed was his debt to society and became the 27th person put to death in the U.S. so far this year, the highest number in a decade.",
      "Under Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, Florida has executed nine people in 2025, more than than any other state, and set a new state record, with DeSantis overseeing more executions in a single year than any other Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976.",
      "Across the country, more people have been put to death in the first seven months of this year than in all of 2024. Florida's increase is helping put the U.S. on track to surpass 2015\u2019s total of 28 executions.",
      "And the number of executions is expected to keep climbing. Nine more people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025.",
      "After the Supreme Court lifted its ban on capital punishment in the \u201970s, executions steadily increased, peaking in 1999 at 98 deaths. Since then, they had been dropping \u2014 in part due to legal battles, a shortage of lethal injection drugs, and declining public support for capital punishment, which has prompted a majority of states to either pause or abolish it altogether.",
      "The ratcheting up after this yearslong decline comes as Republican President Donald Trump has urged prosecutors to aggressively seek the death penalty and as some GOP-controlled state legislatures have pushed to expand the category of crimes punishable by death and the methods used to carry out executions.",
      "John Blume, director of the Cornell Death Penalty Project, says the uptick in executions doesn\u2019t appear to be linked to a change in public support for the death penalty or an increase in the rate of death sentences, but is rather a function of the discretion of state governors.",
      "\u201cThe most cynical view would be: It seems to matter to the president, so it matters to them,\u201d Blume said of the governors.",
      "In response to questions from The Associated Press, a spokesperson for DeSantis pointed to statements the governor made at a press conference in May, saying he takes capital cases \u201cvery seriously.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are some crimes that are just so horrific, the only appropriate punishment is the death penalty,\u201d DeSantis said, adding: \u201cthese are the worst of the worst.\u201d",
      "Julie Andrew expressed relief after witnessing the April execution of the man who killed her sister in the Florida Keys in 2000.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d she said. \u201cMy heart felt lighter and I can breathe again.\u201d",
      "The governor\u2019s office did not respond to questions about why the governor is increasing the pace of executions now and whether Trump\u2019s policies are playing a role.",
      "Little is publicly known about how the governor decides whose death warrant to sign and when, a process critics have called \u201csecretive\u201d and \u201carbitrary.\u201d",
      "According to the Florida Department of Corrections, there are 266 people currently on death row, including two men in their 80s, both of whom have been awaiting their court-ordered fate for more than 40 years.",

      "\u201cAny time we go forward, I\u2019m convinced that not only was the verdict correct, but that this punishment is absolutely appropriate under the circumstances,\u201d DeSantis said.",
      "For years, the U.S. has ranked alongside Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Egypt as among the countries carrying out the highest number of confirmed executions. China is thought to execute more of its citizens than any other nation, although the exact totals are considered a state secret, according to the non-profit Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Robin Maher, the center's executive director, says elected officials in the U.S. have long used the death penalty as a \u201cpolitical tool,\u201d adding it\u2019s \u201ca way of embellishing their own tough-on-crime credentials.\u201d",
      "In 2024, DeSantis signed one death warrant. From 2020-2022, Florida didn\u2019t carry out a single execution. In 2023, DeSantis oversaw six \u2014 the highest number during his time in office until this year. 2023 was also the year the governor challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.",
      "There are a number of reasons why the rate of executions may vary from one administration to the next, said Mark Schlakman, an attorney and Florida State University professor who advised then-governor Lawton Chiles on the death penalty.",
      "The availability of staff resources, the tempo of lengthy legal appeals, and court challenges against the death penalty itself can all play a role, Schlakman said, as well as a governor\u2019s \u201csensibilities.\u201d",
      "One execution after another, opponents of the death penalty hold vigils in the Florida capitol, outside the governor's mansion, and near the state prison that houses the death chamber, as people of faith across the state pray for mercy, healing and justice.",
      "Suzanne Printy, a volunteer with the group Floridians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, has hand-delivered thousands of petitions to DeSantis' office, but says they seem to have no effect.",
      "Recently, DeSantis signed death warrants for two more men scheduled to die later this month.",

    "story": [
      "A video showing the violent arrest of a Black college student in Florida has sparked calls for drivers to use cameras that show a view from inside their car",
      "A video that captured the brutal arrest of a Black college student pulled from his car and beaten by officers in Florida has led to an investigation and calls for motorists to consider protecting themselves by placing a camera inside their vehicles.",
      "William McNeil Jr. captured his February traffic stop on his cellphone camera, which was mounted above his dashboard. It offered a unique view, providing the only clear footage of the violence by officers, including punches to his head that can't clearly be seen in officer body camera footage released by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.",
      "Since McNeil had the foresight to record the encounter from inside the vehicle, \u201cwe got to see firsthand and hear firsthand and put it all in context what driving while Black is in America,\u201d said civil rights attorney Ben Crump, one of several lawyers advising McNeil.",
      "\u201cAll the young people should be recording these interactions with law enforcement,\" Crump said. Because what it tells us, just like with George Floyd, if we don\u2019t record the video, we can see what they put in the police report with George Floyd before they realized the video existed.\u201d",
      "McNeil was pulled over that day because officers said his headlights should have been on due to bad weather, his lawyers said. His camera shows him asking the officers what he did wrong. Seconds later, an officer smashes his window, strikes him as he sat in the driver\u2019s seat and then pulls him from the car and punches him in the head. After being knocked to the ground, McNeil was punched six more times in his right thigh, a police report states.",
      "The incident reports don't describe the officer punching McNeil in the head. The officer, who pulled McNeil over and then struck him, described the force this way in his report: \u201cPhysical force was applied to the suspect and he was taken to the ground.\u201d",
      "But after McNeil posted his video online last month and it went viral, the sheriff's office launched an internal investigation, which is ongoing. A sheriff\u2019s office spokesperson declined to comment about the case this week, citing pending litigation, though no lawsuit has been filed over the arrest.",
      "McNeil said the ordeal left him traumatized, with a brain injury, a broken tooth and several stiches in his lip. His attorneys accused the sheriff's office of trying to cover up what really happened.",
      "\u201cOn Feb. 19, 2025, Americans saw what America is,\u201d said another of McNeil\u2019s lawyers, Harry Daniels. \u201cWe saw injustice. You saw abuse of police power. But most importantly we saw a young man that had a temperament to control himself in the face of brutality.\u201d",
      "The traffic stop, he said, was not only racially motivated but \u201cit was unlawful, and everything that stemmed from that stop was unlawful.\"",
      "McNeil is hardly the first Black motorist to record video during a traffic stop that turned violent \u2014 Philando Castile's girlfriend livestreamed the bloody aftermath of his death during a 2016 traffic stop near Minneapolis. But McNeil's arrest serves as a reminder of how cellphone video can show a different version of events than what is described in police reports, his lawyers said.",
      "Christopher Mercado, who retired as a lieutenant from the New York Police Department, agreed with McNeil's legal team's suggestion that drivers should record their police interactions and that a camera mounted inside a driver's car could offer a unique point of view.",
      "\"Use technology to your advantage,\" said Mercado, an adjunct assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing nefarious about it. It's actually a smart thing in my opinion.\u201d",
      "Rod Brunson, chairman of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Maryland, said he thinks it's a good idea for citizens to film encounters with police \u2014 as long as doing so doesn't make the situation worse.",

      "\u201cI think that's a form of protection \u2014 it's safeguarding them against false claims of criminal behavior or interfering with officers, etc.,\u201d Brunson said.",
      "Although the sheriff's office declined to speak to The Associated Press this week, Sheriff T.K. Waters has spoken publicly about McNeil's arrest since video of the encounter went viral. He pushed back against some of the allegations made by McNeil's lawyers, noting that McNeil was told more than a half-dozen times to exit the vehicle.",
      "At a news conference last month, Waters also highlighted images of a knife in McNeil's car. The officer who punched him claimed in his police report that McNeil reached toward the floor of the car, where deputies later found the knife.",
      "Crump, though, said McNeil's video shows that he \u201cnever reaches for anything,\u201d and a second officer wrote in his report that McNeil kept his hands up as the other officer smashed the car window.",
      "A camera inside a motorist's vehicle could make up for some shortcomings of police bodycams, which can have a narrow field of view that becomes more limited the closer an officer gets to the person being filmed, Mercado said.",
      "However, after the police murder of Floyd, some states and cities debated how and when citizens should be able to capture video of police. The Constitution guarantees the right to record police in public, but a point of contention in some states has been whether a civilian's recording might interfere with the ability of officers to do their job. In Louisiana, for example, a new law makes it a crime to approach within 25 feet (7.6 meters) of a police officer in certain situations.",
      "Waters acknowledged those limitations at a news conference last year, as he narrated video of a wild brawl between officers and a fan in the stands at EverBank Stadium during a football game last year between the universities of Georgia and Florida.",
      "The sheriff showed the officers' bodycam videos during the start of the confrontation near the top of the stadium. But when the officers subdued the suspect and were pressing against him, the bodycam footage didn't capture much, so the sheriff switched to stadium security video shot from a longer distance away.",
      "In McNeil's case, the bodycam video didn't clearly capture the punches thrown. If it had, the case would have been investigated right away, the sheriff said.",
      "For the past 20 years, Brunson has been interviewing young Black men in several U.S. cities about their encounters with law enforcement. When he first began submitting research papers for academic review, many readers didn't believe the men's stories of being brutalized by officers.",
      "\u201cPeople who live in a civil society don't expect to be treated this way by the police. For them, their police interactions are mostly pleasant, mostly cordial,\" Brunson said.",
      "\u201cSo it's hard for people who don\u2019t have a tenuous relationship with the police to fathom that something like this happens,\u201d he said. \"And that\u2019s where video does play a big part because people can't deny what they see.\u201d",

      "Her publicist, Don Murry Grubbs, said she died Friday after succumbing to complications from an intestinal infection.",
      "Known as \"Miss Country Soul\" for her unique vocal style, Seely was a trailblazer for women in country music, celebrated for her spirited nonconformity and for a string of undeniable hits in the '60s and '70s.",
      "Her second husband, Gene Ward, died in December. In May, Seely revealed that she was in recovery after undergoing multiple back surgeries, two emergency procedures and spending 11 days in the ICU. She also suffered a bout of pneumonia.",
      "\"Rehab is pretty tough, but each day is looking brighter and last night, I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. And it was neon, so I knew it was mine!\" she said in a statement at the time. \"The unsinkable Seely is working her way back.\"",
      "Dolly Parton was one of several country music luminaries paying her tribute on Friday, saying she met Seely when they were both young and starting out in Nashville.",
      "\"She was one of my dearest friends,\" Parton said on her social media accounts. \"I think she was one of the greater singers in Nashville and she had a wonderful sense of humor. We had many wonderful laughs together, cried over certain things together and she will be missed.\"",
      "Singer Charlie Daniels said on X that Seely was \"a national treasure, and one fine lady.\"",
      "Seely was born in July 1940, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, about two hours north of Pittsburgh and was raised in nearby Townville. Her love of country music was instant; her mother sang, and her father played the banjo. When she was a child, she sang on local radio programs and performed on local television. In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job with Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",
      "She kept writing and recording. Nashville was next: She sang on Porter Wagoner's show; she got a deal with Monument Records. Her greatest hit would arrive soon afterward: \"Don't Touch Me,\" the crossover ballad written by Hank Cochran. The song earned Seely her first and only Grammy Award, for best country & western vocal performance in the female category.",
      "Cochran and Seely were married in 1969 and divorced in 1979.",
      "Seely broke boundaries in her career \u2014 at a time when country music expected a kind of subservience from its women performers, Seely was a bit of a rebel, known for wearing a miniskirt on the Grand Ole Opry stage when it was still taboo.",
      "And she had a number of country hits in the '60s and '70s, including three Top 10 hits on what is now known as Billboard's hot country songs chart: \"Don't Touch Me,\" 1967's \"I'll Love You More (Than You Need)\" and 1973's \"Can I Sleep In Your Arms?\", adapted from the folk song \"Can I Sleep In Your Barn Tonight Mister?\"",
      "In the years since, Seely continued to release albums, perform and host, regularly appearing on country music programming. Her songs are considered classics, and have been recorded by everyone from Merle Haggard, Ray Price and Connie Smith to Ernest Tubb, Grandpa Jones and Little Jimmy Dickens.",
      "And Seely never stopped working in country music. Since 2018, she's hosted the weekly \"Sunday's with Seely\" on Willie Nelson's Willie's Roadhouse SiriusXM channel. That same year, she was inducted into the Music City Walk of Fame.",
      "She appeared nearly 5,400 times at the Grand Ole Opry, which she has been a member of since 1967. Grubbs said Saturday's Grand Ole Opry show would be dedicated to Seely.",
      "She released her last song in July 2024, a cover of Dottie West's \"Suffertime,\" recorded at the world-renowned RCA Studio B. She performed it at the Opry the year before.",

    "summary": "The singer's love for the Great American Songbook goes far beyond standards written by Gershwin or Porter.",
    "story": [
      "For most of his 50-year career, Michael Feinstein has shown his love for the great American songs by performing them. \"There was something I connected to with the harmonic invention of the songs, the melodic ideas,\" he said. \"They express fundamental emotions in a very eloquent way that people can still relate to.\"",
      "He got his start early, as a little boy In Columbus, Ohio: \"When I was five, my father said, 'Let's get a piano.' I sat down and started playing 'Do-Re-Mi' from 'The Sound of Music' with both hands. My mother came in from the kitchen and said, 'Who taught you that?' And I said, 'Nobody!' And she sent me to my room for lying!\"",
      "He was playing by ear at five years old. Of his childhood he said, \"I always felt weird. I always felt different than everybody else. I was a lonely kid. I didn't have many friends. The first classical record I bought was the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto, while my friends were all listening to Elton John and Carole King and Carly Simon.\"",
      "But his \"unpopular\" hobby soon made him a popular entertainer. For 12 years, he played in piano bars, five or six hours a night. \"It was mainly gay bars,\" he said, \"'cause those are the places where I could play show tunes without anybody complaining about it.\"",
      "He didn't go to college, but he did get an amazing education. For example, \"I learned that I had to program what I was doing as if I was programming a show, with an emotional arc. I learned what to say between the songs that I learned \u2013 patter and jokes and shtick and things that keep people engaged.\"",
      "Feinstein moved to L.A. when he was 20, where he met one of his idols: 80-year-old Ira Gershwin, George Gershwin's lyric-writing brother. Ira was so impressed by the young man's encyclopedic knowledge of Gershwin material that he gave him a job. \"I was only supposed to be there for a couple of weeks to catalog the phonograph records,\" Feinstein said. \"But I ended up spending six years as Ira's musical companion, an amanuensis, which is a nice word for stooge! It was an incredible time, the most exciting time in my life.\"",
      "In 1986, Feinstein got the invitation that changed his life: to perform in the Oak Room at New York's Algonquin Hotel. \"And from that, everything started popping,\" he said.",
      "At 29 years old, Feinstein's career was launched. Decades of glory days lay ahead \u2013 on stage, on PBS, on his 86 albums, and in his lifelong friendship with Liza Minnelli. (He's collaborating with her on her new memoir.) But he didn't just want to sing the Great American Songs; he also wanted to collect them.",
      "He's amassed a vast collection of memorabilia, recordings and scores, such as the first printing of \"Rhapsody in Blue.\"",
      "In recent years Feinstein has become increasingly dedicated to passing his love of the great songs to the next generation. He said, \"I'm carrying the weight of the responsibility to present these songs in a way that hopefully will appeal to them. Every time these songs are introduced to a younger person, it's like planting a seed, because it becomes part of them, and it goes on.\"",
      "In that spirit, Feinstein has established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Carmel, Indiana. There's a museum of songwriter artifacts \u2026 a performing arts center \u2026 and a weeklong Songbook Academy, in which 40 students from around the U.S. are selected to intensively learn about interpreting this music. \"And it's right alongside Taylor Swift or Adele or whoever else they're listening to,\" he said.",
      "For Feinstein the Great American Songbook isn't just music from before 1950: \"I think that Carole King and Billy Joel and Neil Sedaka and Elton John, they're all part of the American Songbook,\" he said. \"It's not just the 1910s and the '20s and the '30s; it is evolving.\"",
      "Michael Feinstein still performs live all over the country, including a concert of Tony Bennett classics (which you can watch on the streaming service Carnegie Hall+ on August 3) \u2013 because maybe the best way of all to keep the classics alive is to keep singing them.",

      "Former Food Network star Paula Deen announced Friday the abrupt closure of the Savannah restaurant that launched her to fame with its menu of fried chicken, banana pudding and other indulgent Southern dishes.",
      "Deen ran The Lady & Sons restaurant with her two sons, Jamie and Bobby Deen, for nearly three decades. Loyal fans visiting Savannah continued to line up for Deen's buffet long after the Food Network canceled her show, \"Paula's Home Cooking,\" in 2013.",
      "But 78-year-old Deen said Friday that The Lady & Sons closed for good along with her second Savannah eatery, The Chicken Box. A statement posted on Deen's website and social media accounts didn't say why the restaurants had shut down.",
      "\"Hey, y'all, my sons and I made the heartfelt decision that Thursday, July 31st, was the last day of service for The Lady & Sons and The Chicken Box,\" Deen's statement said.",
      "\"Thank you for all the great memories and for your loyalty over the past 36 years,\" she said. \"We have endless love and gratitude for every customer who has walked through our doors.\"",
      "Deen said her four restaurants outside Savannah will remain open. They're located in Nashville and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; and Branson, Missouri.",
      "Deen said Friday she and her sons will visit the Branson establishment on Aug. 8, and said the family is \"excited to continue visiting these restaurants regularly.\"",
      "\"Savannah will always be our home, and we'll always be here to support our wonderful community,\" she said in the statement.",
      "Hey, y\u2019all, my sons and I made the heartfelt decision that Thursday, July 31st, was the last day of service for The Lady...",
      "Windows at The Lady & Sons were covered with brown paper on Friday. Signs posted at the front entrance read: \"It is with heavy hearts and tremendous gratitude that we announce that we have retired and closed.\"",
      "Martin Rowe works in a downtown office across the street from Deen's restaurant. He said business seemed to be going strong up until it closed.",
      "\"Nobody knew anything was wrong,\" Rowe said. \"I walk by there two or three times a week at lunch, and it was always packed.\"",
      "Deen was divorced and nearly broke when she moved to Savannah with her boys in 1989 and started a catering business called The Bag Lady. She opened her first restaurant a few years later at a local Best Western hotel, then started The Lady & Sons in downtown Savannah in 1996.",
      "The restaurant soon had lines out the door and served roughly 1,100 diners per day at the height of Deen's popularity. A USA Today food critic awarded The Lady & Sons his \"meal of the year\" in 1999.",
      "Deen moved her Savannah restaurant to a larger building nearby the year after The Food Network debuted \"Paula's Home Cooking\" in 2002. Filmed mostly in her home kitchen, Deen taped more than 200 episodes over the next decade.",
      "The Food Network canceled Deen's show in 2013 amid fallout from a lawsuit by a former employee. A transcript of Deen answering questions under oath in a legal deposition became public, which included Deen's awkward responses to questions about race.",
      "Asked if she had ever used the N-word, Deen said, \"Yes, of course,\" though she added: \"It's been a very long time.\"",
      "Deen returned to television on ABC's \"Dancing With the Stars,\" on chef Gordon Ramsay's Fox show \"MasterChef: Legends,\" and on Fox Nation, which began streaming \"At Home With Paula Deen\" in 2020. She also posts cooking videos to a YouTube channel that has more than 520,000 subscribers.",

      "\"Amy Bradley is Missing,\" directed by Ari Mark and Phil Lott, explores the unsolved case that has puzzled investigators for nearly three decades. Bradley disappeared from her family's cruise, leaving behind numerous theories but few concrete answers.",
      "\"The Amy Bradley story is something if you've been around the genre, you know about it,\" Mark said. \"It's one of the most baffling mysteries of a disappearance case.\"",
      "The case presents multiple scenarios for what may have happened to Bradley. The film floats several theories: she could have accidentally fallen overboard, committed suicide or been the victim of foul play. Investigators have noted that the sliding door to her balcony was found ajar, raising questions about whether she left voluntarily or was taken against her will.",
      "Mark and Lott said they were drawn to the story after learning that existing coverage barely scratched the surface of the case. After meeting with Bradley's parents, Ron and Iva Bradley, in Virginia, the directors realized the family deserved justice.",
      "\"These are people who are living with such pain every single day,\" Lott said. \"It's a very real hope and possibility every single day that they could bring Amy home.\"",
      "The documentary has generated new tips since its Netflix release, though the directors declined to share details publicly. They emphasized the importance of carefully vetting information and involving law enforcement in any potential leads.",
      "One challenge in the case has been witnesses who claim to have seen Bradley over the years but didn't come forward until long after her disappearance. The directors said many people don't realize the significance of what they witnessed until later connecting it to Bradley's story through media coverage.",

    "story": [
      "A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers, made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played.",
      "It was called a \"baby parade.\"",
      "The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump's administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate.",
      "Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Supporters believe the program could be a model for mitigating the high cost of having children in the U.S.",
      "\"There's all kinds of reasons, no matter what your political affiliation or ideology is, to support this,\" said state Sen. John Damoose, a Republican and ardent supporter of the program.",
      "To qualify, women need to prove they live in a participating location and that they are pregnant, but don't have to share details about their income.",
      "It's designed to be simple.",
      "Pregnant women receive $1,500 before delivery and $500 every month for the first six to 12 months of their babies' lives, depending on the program location.",
      "Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician, associate dean for public health at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine and the program's founding director, said that window is a time of great economic vulnerability for new parents \u2014 and a critical developmental period for babies.",
      "Most participants need diapers, formula, breastfeeding supplies and baby clothes, but every family's needs are different. The monthly payment can also help buy food and cover rent, utilities and transportation.",
      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities\u00a0near Detroit.",
      "Hanna said the main piece of feedback she hears is that the program should be bigger. She's heard from lawmakers and others hoping to start similar programs in other states.",
      "Hanna said the program's data shows nearly all pregnant women in Flint have signed up since it became available.",
      "The locations were designed to target low-income families, though there is no income requirement. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up.",
      "The founders also want mothers to feel celebrated, hence the parade on Friday.",
      "\"For so long, moms have been vilified and not supported,\" Hanna said.",
      "Friends told Angela Sintery, 44, about Rx Kids when she found out she was pregnant with her second child. She's a preschool teacher who spread the word to other parents.",
      "Sintery had her first daughter 19 years before her second and had to buy all new baby supplies.",
      "She said the cash provided by Rx Kids would have been helpful when she had her first child at age 24, before she went to college.",
      "\"So this time around, I didn't have to stress about anything. I just had to worry about my baby,\" she said.",
      "Celeste Lord-Timlin, a Flint resident and program participant, attended the baby parade with her husband and 13-month-old daughter by her side. She said the deposits helped her pay for graduate school while she was pregnant.",
      "\"It allowed us to really enjoy being new parents,\" she said.",
      "The program relies heavily on philanthropic donations, but Hanna's long-term goal is for the government to be the main provider.",
      "\"I see philanthropy as the doula of this program; they are helping birth it,\" she said. \"They are helping us prove that this is possible.\"",
      "Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support. But with a divided Legislature only able to pass six bills total this year, it's unlikely the program will yet expand statewide soon.",
      "Even Damoose, among the program's top backers, said he doesn't think Michigan can afford statewide expansion yet. But the lawmaker who represents parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan does want to keep growing it.",
      "For fellow Republicans who oppose abortion as he does, the approach is a \"no-brainer\" way to help pregnant women, Damoose said.",
      "\"We've been accused for years and years, and not without cause, of being pro-birth, but not pro-life,\" he said. \"And this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is.\"",
      "A new movement of pro-natalist political figures, including Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and other members of Trump's periphery, have harped on the country's declining birth rate.",
      "But a recent Associated Press-NORC poll found that most Americans want the government to focus on the high costs of child care, not just the number of babies being born here.",
      "Under Trump's tax and spending bill that Congress passed in July, the child tax credit is boosted from $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. But millions of families at lower income levels will not get the full credit.",
      "The bill will also create a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.",
      "That's not available until children grow up and is more focused on building wealth rather than immediate relief, Hanna said.",
      "\"We don't have that social infrastructure to invest in our families,\" Hanna said. \"No wonder people aren't having children and our birth rates are going down.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also toyed with the idea of giving families one-time $5,000 \"baby bonuses,\" a policy similar to Rx Kids.",

    "summary": "Revisions are a \"feature, not a bug\" of any jobs report, former BLS commissioner told CBS MoneyWatch.",
    "story": [
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics last week issued a\u00a0steep downward revision\u00a0to May and June's hiring numbers, prompting President Trump to call the edits \"miscalculations\" by the department's commissioner, whom he subsequently fired, in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Aug. 1.",
      "While the downward revision of May and June payroll growth by 258,000 marked the largest two-month downward revision to the jobs numbers since 1968, revisions themselves are not uncommon. Revisions are \"a feature, not a bug\" of the agency's reporting process, according to Erica Groshen, former BLS commissioner under the Obama administration told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Larger revisions have been recorded, but only when the economy has been in a recession, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis for BLS data.",
      "How the BLS processes its reports",
      "The BLS surveys both households and businesses for its monthly jobs report. After releasing an initial report, it's common for the agency to issue revisions to the prior monthly figures, as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "That's because while some survey recipients respond to the agency's surveys immediately, others report data late. In the interest of reporting employment information in a timely manner, though, the BLS will issue its monthly jobs report based on the responses it is given by a certain time.",
      "\"The BLS wants to get the information as accurate as possible, but it doesn't want to wait too long to put out information that's useful,\" Groshen said. \"So it puts out preliminary numbers, saying they are an estimate, then it gathers more information and improves that estimate.\"",
      "\"If you send out a survey to a bunch of people, some will turn it back in on time and some of them won't,\" Michele Evermore, a former Department of Labor employee and senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive, independent think tank told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The faster you make a determination, the more you're going to have to fill in the blanks,\" she said. In the interim, the BLS relies on scientific modeling to paint a more complete picture of the state of the job market. \"You have to fill in the gaps, and the more reports you get back, the more holes you can fill, and the more accurate a report you get.\"",
      "Eventually, the inclusion of late responses to surveys by both employers and workers enables the agency to provide a more accurate picture of the state of hiring and unemployment in the U.S., Evermore explained.",
      "The cuts to the number of jobs that were added in May and June were spread out across both public- and private-sector jobs. The downward revision to public-sector payroll growth \"mostly reflected lower state and local government job gains,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a research note. Private-sector job gains were previously overstated because of incomplete response data, according to the analysts.",
      "Groshen acknowledged that the revisions were \"definitely on the large side,\" but that \"they happen, and are the product of the same monthly process.",
      "Cuts pertaining to government jobs were driven primarily by reductions in hiring by state and local education establishments, according to the BLS. Groshen attributes the job cuts to the expiration of pandemic-era government subsidies that are leading to a pullback in hiring.",
      "\"These subsidies were cut, so they are not hiring as many people as they had been in the past, and state and local governments often report late, so that information came in late,\" she said.",
      "Evermore, of The Century Foundation, noted that the BLS revisions only apply to jobs that were added in both May and June, and not to \"the pool of all the jobs in the U.S.\"",
      "\"While it seems like a big revision, percentage-wise, it's floating on top of the entire labor market. So while it's big, it's not as dramatic as some people are acting like it is,\" she said.",
      "Dismissal of BLS commissioner",
      "In his Truth Social post on Friday, Mr. Trump, accused the agency's Commissioner Erika McEntarfer of political bias before announcing her dismissal in response to the downward revision of jobs numbers. \"I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes,\" the president\u00a0wrote.",
      "Even though it has been asked a number of times since Friday, the White House has not provided any evidence that the numbers were manipulated for political purposes.",
      "According to Groshen, the drastic revise of the job numbers don't reflect a \"failure\" of the BLS to do its job.",
      "\"It's not a failure and it's not bias. It's not like the commissioner said, 'Oh, I think I'm going to change that numbers.' The commissioner has no power, no ability to do that.\"",
      "Evermore concurred. \"Having worked with BLS for years, it's impossible to cook the books as things stand,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For years, it's become increasingly difficult to collect complete data based on surveys fielded to hundreds of thousands of employers and individuals, according to Groshen.",
      "\"There is a very long-term term trend of a declining response rate, which is bedeviling the system,\" she said. That's in part because some surveys are fielded over the phone, and American households are increasingly ditching landlines.",
      "Jeff Strohl, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, a research policy institute, echoes others in noting that BLS releases monthly jobs numbers knowing that they'll be revised. But the agency prioritizes timeliness over 100% accuracy because \"the currency of the data is still important,\" he said.",
      "Low response rates \u2014 only about 70% of employers surveyed respond on time \u2014 make revisions inevitable. according to Strohl. \"A month later, the response rate goes up to 90%-95%, so you have 25%, or 150,000, more firms reporting their data,\" he said.",
      "Additionally, weekly shocks to the economy, such as created by tariffs, adds another layer to the challenge of releasing accurate jobs data each month.",
      "\"The U.S. economy is going through a huge number of shocks on a weekly basis,\" Strohl told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Tariffs are being threatened and applied, and there is a level of economic uncertainty affecting the job market.\"",
      "For example, he said, some job seekers are having offers rescinded as major universities lose research grants. \"That's stopping hires from working on projects the money was going to feed,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Friday's disappointing July employment report\u00a0delivered a reality check on the U.S. economy, with the data suggesting the job market is wobbling from the uncertainty of on-again, off-again tariffs.",
      "What was surprising about the Friday report was that employers not only hired fewer people than expected last month, but the government revised its jobs data sharply downward for the prior two months. With the revisions, the U.S. added 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June, reflecting \"paltry\" employment growth during those months, according to a research note from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco.",
      "The latest jobs data is shedding new light on the U.S. economy as businesses absorb a multitude of changes \u2014 from President Trump's trade deals and fresh tariffs to the new GOP tax law, which provides tax breaks\u00a0to many Americans but also cuts spending on health care and social programs like food stamps. The jobs data backs up anecdotal evidence from the Federal Reserve's most recent \"beige book\"\u00a0\u2014 a report that compiles comments from local businesses \u2014 that many companies are delaying hiring \"until uncertainty diminished.\"",
      "\"Based on what I was hearing from a lot of employers, I kept expecting to see a stagnant jobs report at some point, that's what we got today,\" Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"We know the economy has ups and downs, and we're in a pretty stagnant place right now.\"",
      "In other words, while the labor market isn't seeing massive layoffs, companies also aren't expanding their hiring plans. That can make it difficult for unemployed workers to find new jobs, with the number of people searching for work for more than 27 weeks jumping 11% to 1.8 million last month compared with a year earlier, government data shows.",
      "Pockets of strength",
      "To be sure, there were pockets of strength in the jobs report, with health care and social assistance adding a combined 73,300 jobs last month, the BLS reported. But many major U.S. employment sectors saw little or no hiring, including leisure and hospitality, transportation and construction, while others \u2014 including manufacturing \u2014 saw job losses last month, the July data shows.",
      "President Trump on Friday claimed without evidence that the jobs report was manipulated for \"political purposes,\" and fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer.",
      "He also asserted that the downward revisions were \"a major mistake,\" although the BLS revises its data each month to reflect new information, and the numbers frequently move both up and down.",
      "\"The president's belief that the BLS commissioner personally 'produced' the jobs numbers is preposterous and shows a complete misunderstanding of how government statistical agencies operate,\" noted Heidi Shierholz, the president of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute and a former chief economist at the Department of Labor, in a post about McEntarfer's firing.",
      "She added, \"These data are the product of careful work by hundreds of expert economists, statisticians and civil servants following transparent, well-established methodologies.\"",
      "Tariff uncertainty",
      "Businesses have been expressing hesitation given the uncertain impact\u00a0of the Trump's tariffs, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland president Beth Hammack told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "\"I'm hearing that uncertainty has really been weighing on businesses,\" Hammack said of her discussions with business owners in her district, which spans Eastern Kentucky, Ohio, Western Pennsylvania and part of West Virginia.\u00a0 \"They've been having a tough time to decide when to invest, how much to invest. Many of them have scaled back plans for investment.\"",
      "For instance, one franchise owner said that they planned to refurbish their existing locations, rather than open new locations, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs would revive U.S. manufacturing because companies will reshore or open new factories domestically, rather than pay the import duties.",
      "Some Trump officials portrayed the jobs report as a temporary setback as the administration seeks to revive American jobs through its trade policies.",
      "\"Obviously there were elements of [the jobs report] that we didn't love, but the trade deals are now in place that cover \u2014 including the U.S. \u2014 almost 60% of the global economy,\" Stephen Miran, head of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, told reporters Friday.",
      "With the setting of new tariff rates on Thursday for dozens of nations, uncertainty has also been resolved, he added. \"There probably were a lot of firms that, you know, sort of sitting there in May and June saying, 'Hey, you know, this tariff stuff's about to be resolved, this bill you know hopefully becomes law within a month or two \u2014 maybe I'm just going to hold off on this investment program.'\"",
      "Also on Friday, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt issued a statement describing a flourishing economy under President Trump. \"Inflation has cooled, wages have increased, unemployment is stable, and the private sector is growing. President Trump's America First agenda has ensured new jobs go to American citizens, instead of illegals or foreign-born workers. The tariffs are raking in billions of dollars to make our country wealthy again,\" the statement read in part.",
      "A decline in manufacturing jobs",
      "The U.S. lost 11,000 manufacturing jobs in July, and the revisions for May and June also show that the sector shed workers during those months. That's notable given Mr. Trump's promise to revive manufacturing jobs, which has led to new agreements from the likes of Johnson & Johnson and Apple to build new plants in the U.S.",
      "But the Trump administration's tariffs have added to the challenges facing the manufacturing sector, especially those producing durable goods such as appliances and automobiles, noted Indeed's Ullrich. For instance, tariffs on imported metals such as steel and aluminum are making it pricier for many manufacturers to create their products, putting pressure on their margins and profits.",
      "The downturn in manufacturing jobs \"is hardly surprising,\" said Scott Paul, president of the trade group the Alliance for American Manufacturing, in an email. \"It's another 'treading water' number, which has been the case more often than not for the past few years. But it is concerning that we're now 173,000 jobs below the most recent peak in February 2023,\" when total nonfarm payroll employment rose to 155.4 million.",
      "It's possible that manufacturing jobs could reverse the trend now that the Trump administration's tariffs and tax policies are settled, Paul added.",
      "Progress on the Trump administration's goal of reshoring American manufacturing jobs may take years, given the cost and time required to build new factories, Ullrich noted. \"There are certain products that, even with the tariffs, are still cheaper to make overseas,\" she added.",
      "\"This is not a healthy job market,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email. \"The economy needs certainty soon on tariffs. The longer this tariff whiplash lasts, the more likely this weak hiring environment turns into layoffs.\"",

    "story": [
      "Americans could see inflation tick higher in 2025 as businesses start to pass on the cost of the Trump administration's tariffs to consumers through price hikes, Beth Hammack, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady in an interview.",
      "So far this year, inflation has remained relatively muted despite President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs, partially because many businesses stockpiled goods and manufacturing parts ahead of the import duties' implementation. Some business facing higher tariffs also chose to hold off on passing cost increases onto consumers as they awaited more clarity around where tariff rates would settle. Additionally, the Trump administration instituted numerous pauses on threatened levies, delaying cost increases for businesses and consumers.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pushing the Fed to cut interest rates, citing subdued inflation numbers and cuts from other major central banks, such as in the U.K. and the European Union. But the Federal Reserve last week maintained its benchmark rate at the same level where it's been parked since December 2024, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell citing the risks of higher inflation due to the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "That's a danger also highlighted by Hammack, who said she believes inflation could reach a 3% annual rate this year, representing a pace that would be 1 percentage point higher than the Fed's goal of a 2% annualized rate.",
      "\"Individual businesses have been trying to hold back on, passing on those [tariff] costs, because they're worried about what it might mean for demand,\" Hammack told O'Grady. \"They've been selling inventory that they'd accumulated early in the year, and so they didn't need to charge for the tariffs on that, but they're coming through those stockpiles.\"",
      "She added, \"They're coming to the point where their margins are getting squeezed and they need to start passing that onto consumers.\"",
      "Many households are still struggling with the cost of living, with half of Americans saying they view grocery prices as a major source of stress in their life right now, outpacing housing cost and health care, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\"Two-speed economy\"",
      "Hammack said the U.S. appears to be in a \"two-speed economy.\"",
      "\"The top part of the income spectrum is doing incredibly well,\" she noted. \"They're feeling a lot of excitement about the stock market, how their 401(k)s are doing, and they're feeling flush with cash.\"",
      "But, she added, low-income households are facing a lot of economic challenges.",
      "\"I hear individuals trading down, they go to the supermarket and they can't buy ground beef,\" Hammack said. \"They're buying hot dogs, they're looking at their $400 emergency fund, and it's not able to pay for a new air conditioner or the car repairs that it used to be able to pay for.\"",
      "Price pressures from the Trump administration's tariffs could cause a one-time increase in costs as businesses adjust their prices to cover the import duties, she added. Fed officials are focused on making sure that the price hikes don't become what she calls a \"more persistent inflationary problem.\"",
      "\"What I'm focused on is making sure that we have an economy that's working for all Americans,\" Hammack said. \"Which is why I believe we need to stay really focused on the inflation side of our mandate.\"",
      "At the same time, Friday's disappointing jobs report shows that the labor market is also facing fresh challenges, with employers hiring fewer workers than expected in July. The Fed's mandate is to keep both inflation and unemployment low, with the central bank turning to interest rate hikes to cool inflation or rate cuts to help the job market.",
      "With both inflation on the rise and the job market experiencing some headwinds, the Fed has a delicate balancing act, she noted.",
      "\"This is a really challenging time for monetary policy makers, because both sides of our mandate are being challenged,\" Hammack said. \"And so the decision of which way to go and how quickly to move is a really difficult one right now.",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next decision on interest rates in September, and some analysts are already calling for a rate cut with the US economy seeing three straight months of weak jobs growth. Hammack admits waiting too long to cut rates because of potential inflation is a risk.",
      "\"If we wait too long to cut rates, that could mean that more people are losing their jobs than we'd like to see,\" Hammack said. \"We have to balance those two factors when we're trying to decide what's right to steer the economy forward.",

      "In a December ruling 2024 ruling, Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick reaffirmed an earlier ruling that Tesla must revoke Musk's multibillion-dollar pay package.

      "At the time McCormick also rejected an equally unprecedented and massive\u00a0fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who argued that they were entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $5 billion.

    "story": [
      "U.S. and Chinese officials may be able to settle many of their differences to reach a trade deal and avert punishing tariffs, but they remain far apart on one issue: the U.S. demand that China stop purchasing oil from Iran and Russia.",
      "\"China will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,\" China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff.",
      "\"Coercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" the ministry said.",
      "The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable \u2014 after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the \"Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.\"",
      "\"We don't want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,\" Bessent said.",
      "On Thursday, he called the Chinese \"tough\" negotiators, but said China's pushback hasn't stalled the negotiations. \"I believe that we have the makings of a deal,\" Bessent told CNBC.",
      "Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. \"Realizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance\" for Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said.",
      "In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East.",
      "A CBS News investigation has revealed that\u00a0China is still secretly buying Iranian oil and evading U.S. sanctions by using what's known as a \"dark fleet\" to transfer oil from ship to ship in the middle of the sea.",
      "When Mr. Trump unveiled a sweeping plan for tariffs on dozens of countries in April, China was the only country that retaliated. It refused to give in to U.S. pressure.",
      "\"If the U.S. is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China's consistent official stance,\" said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization.",
      "Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Mr. Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.",
      "Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Mr. Trump, Kennedy said.",
      "Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as \"the one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington.\" He said Mr. Trump has made it clear he wants a \"headline-grabbing deal\" with Xi, \"so rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal\u2011breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay.\"",
      "Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's \"strategic solidarity\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said.",
      "\"Beijing simply can't afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,\" he said. \"It's too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire\u2011sale prices.\"",
      "A 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that roughly 80% to 90% of the oil exported by Iran went to China. The Chinese economy benefits from the more than 1 million barrels of Iranian oil it imports per day.",
      "After the Iranian parliament floated a plan to shut down the Strait of Hormuz in June following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, China spoke out against closing the critical oil transit route.",
      "China also is an important customer for Russia, but is second to India in buying Russian seaborne crude oil exports. In April, Chinese imports of Russian oil rose 20% over the previous month to more than 1.3 million barrels per day, according to the KSE Institute, an analytical center at the Kyiv School of Economics.",
      "This past week, Mr. Trump said the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India's purchasing of Russian oil. India's Foreign Ministry said Friday its relationship with Russia was \"steady and time-tested.\"",
      "Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and a top policy adviser, said Mr. Trump has been clear that it is \"not acceptable\" for India to continue financing the Ukraine war by purchasing oil from Russia.",
      "\"People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil,\" Miller said on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" He said the U.S. needs \"to get real about dealing with the financing of this war.\"",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, is pushing for sanctions and tariffs on Russia and its financial backers. In April, he introduced a bill that would authorize the president to impose tariffs as high as 500% not only on Russia but on any country that \"knowingly\" buys oil, uranium, natural gas, petroleum products or petrochemical products from Russia.",
      "\"The purpose of this legislation is to break the cycle of China \u2014 a communist dictatorship \u2014 buying oil below market price from Putin's Russia, which empowers his war machine to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians,\" Graham said in a June statement.",
      "The bill has 84 co-sponsors in the 100-seat Senate. A corresponding House version has been introduced, also with bipartisan support.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "More than a dozen states are seeking their own versions of Medicaid work requirements. But the incoming new federal standards pose new questions.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump signed a law adding work requirements for some Medicaid recipients, he may have undercut lawmakers in at least 14 states who were designing their own plans, according to health industry observers.",
      "Georgia is the only state with a work requirement in place for Medicaid, but several states have been pursuing such a policy for years, only to be blocked by courts or, most recently, the Biden administration. Some seek state-specific touches to the new rules. Others aim to implement work requirements before the federal law takes effect at the end of 2026.",
      "These states' moves and Mr. Trump's massive tax-and-spending law share one demand: To keep their Medicaid health coverage, adults who can work must prove they're logging a minimum number of hours at a job or school, or else qualify for one of the few exemptions.",
      "But now, states that jumped ahead need to ensure their proposals, which require federal approval, don't stray too far from Mr. Trump's law.",
      "\"The statute sets both the floor and ceiling\" for work requirements, said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor with George Washington University.",
      "South Dakota, for example, announced in July that it would not submit an application for work requirements as previously planned amid concerns that the state's laxer rules would not be allowed under the new federal law. The state's Department of Social Services secretary had warned that working on a state proposal while the federal rules are being hashed out could be \"an exercise in futility.\"",
      "Arkansas' plan, on the other hand, is more stringent than the federal law. There are no exemptions to its work requirements in the application, which is pending with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "Arizona's proposal also includes something that's not in the federal law: a ban on \"able-bodied adults\" receiving Medicaid benefits for longer than five years total in their lives.",
      "Arkansas and Arizona government officials said they were working with federal officials to square their plans with the new standards.",
      "Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the department is analyzing how the new federal standards interact with state waivers.",
      "The federal health department must release rules by next June that outline how states are to implement work requirements, according to Elizabeth Hinton, who has been tracking such waivers as part of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "\"We don't exactly know what that will cover,\" Hinton said.",
      "It's unclear how federal officials will respond to the states' requests, she added, but \"we are aware that some folks think there is no wiggle room here.\"",
      "States can tweak their Medicaid programs through what are known as demonstration waivers, which are subject to federal approval. The waivers are designed to test new ideas in policy gray areas.",
      "The states that have filed or plan to file such applications with work requirements include Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Utah.",
      "Congressional Republicans who passed the budget reconciliation bill left room for states to use waivers to fast-track the national standards. Tara Sklar, a professor leading the University of Arizona's Health Law & Policy Program, said she expects states seeking certain stricter requirements to have a chance of approval, while more lenient ones may face denials.",
      "Federal officials may look favorably on Arizona's plan, Sklar said, as a five-year lifetime Medicaid limit is different from work requirements. Even if the federal government greenlights stricter work requirements than the federal law calls for, those programs are likely to face legal challenges, she added.",
      "The federal law includes an 80-hour-per-month minimum for work or education, with exemptions for certain adults, including people who are medically frail and parents with young, dependent children.",
      "Montana is the first state to draft a waiver application since Congress finalized national work requirements. State lawmakers first approved work requirements \u2014 called \"community engagement\" standards under the state plan \u2014 in 2019, but the state's application stalled through the end of the first Trump term and the Biden administration.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected again, Montana lawmakers lifted the 2025 expiration date of its Medicaid expansion program, making permanent the program that covered more than 76,000 adults in April, with the expectation that the Trump administration would approve work requirements. In mid-July, state officials released their draft plan to make that a reality \"as soon as is practicable.\"",
      "The Montana plan largely aligns with the federal law, but it would create additional exemptions, including for people who are homeless or fleeing domestic violence.",
      "Republican state Sen. Gayle Lammers said work requirements that also protect such people who need Medicaid were a big part of persuading legislators to keep the expansion program. At the time, officials didn't know where the federal government would land on work requirements. And now, Lammers said, it makes sense for Montana to stick to its plan.",
      "\"The state should have a say,\" Lammers said. \"We're very independent, and everyone is different.\"",
      "In South Carolina, state officials are seeking to roll out work requirements for a limited number of newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. South Carolina is one of 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, and yet the state submitted a request with the federal government in June for a partial Medicaid expansion that includes a work requirement component that largely reflects the new federal standards.",
      "In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, called South Carolina's proposal \"a state-specific solution.\"",
      "The only state with an active work requirement program now wants to scale it back and awaits federal approval to do so. \"Georgia Pathways to Coverage\" expires at the end of September unless CMS greenlights an extension of the program with a key change: requiring enrollees to document once a year that they're working, not monthly. That's a pivot away from the program's initial design but also differs from the new federal rules, which call for checks every six months.",
      "Fiona Roberts, a spokesperson for Georgia's Medicaid agency, said the state is still waiting to hear whether it needs to alter its plan.",

      "Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said in an interview that aired Sunday that tariff rates are \"pretty much set\" on more than 60 trading partners after President Trump's executive order last week.",
      "\"So these, these tariff rates are pretty much set,\" Greer said in an interview Friday with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan. \"I expect I do have my phone blowing up. There are trade ministers who, who want to talk more and see how they can work in a different way with the United States, but I think that we have, we're seeing truly the contours of the president's tariff plan right now with these rates.\"",
      "Hours ahead of the Trump administration's self-imposed deadline for baseline tariffs on Friday, the White House announced tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. All imports will have a 10% tariff rate as of Aug. 7, according to the executive order.",
      "When asked if Mr. Trump will be negotiating the tariff rate down in coming days, Greer answered, \"I don't think they will be,\" but he added these tariff rates are \"set rates pursuant to deals.\"",
      "\"When the president is looking at this, he looks at potential deals, and we bring him potential concessions from countries and the things they might want to do,\" Greer said. \"And he compares that to the potential tariff that might be applied to try to get that deficit down. And then talking to his advisors, he makes a call on this.\"",
      "Ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline, the Trump administration touted a number of deals for tariffs, including South Korea, the European Union and Britain. But other major U.S. trading partners did not reach deals, including Canada, which Mr. Trump levied a 35% tariff on goods not subject the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Canada is the U.S.' second-largest trading partner.",
      "\"The President's view with with every country, whether it's Canada or Mexico, and regardless of the kind of trade agreement we have in place, is that the net result of the trading system, whether it's our WTO agreements or our existing trade agreements, the net result has been that a lot of the manufacturing has gone overseas, and when that's the net result, you can't continue with that system,\" Greer said.",
      "\"So you know, I'm not concerned that it's going to complicate things with Canada. Our view is the President is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it. And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have,\" the trade adviser said.",
      "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who Brennan interviewed separately on \"Face the Nation,\" said that Bank of America economists have predicted that while the economy will still continue to grow, they are predicting \"less growth than they would have had six, nine months ago, and reflects the impact of the tariff war and the trade and all that.\"",

      "Nik said, \"I shared this with Adinah: I always wanted to be to the point that when I got to 50 I didn't want to have to work. And so honestly, I didn't exactly know how to achieve that.\"",
      "Then, one day during the pandemic, Nik was poking around on the Internet and discovered the FIRE Movement, which led him to Camp FI \u2013 a group of hardcore savers and careful spenders who share tips, tricks and philosophical discourse with basically one goal \u2026 to get out of the rat race.",
      "It's all inspired by Peter Adeney, who blogs under the name Mr. Money Mustache. \"American life is so inefficient,\" he said. \"We're all just kind of following each other, what each other does, and not realizing where all of this time and money is slipping through our hands. So, start doing things that are different from what other people do, would probably be the first piece of advice.\"",
      "Adeney retired at age 30, and turned 50 this year. He said, \"I often think that, because I retired so early, I have lived a lot longer than a normal 50-year-old. Like, I feel like I retired 100 years ago, because I've had so many experiences. It's a great antidote to the usual thing, where people say, 'Life goes by too fast. Then, you miss it.'",
      "\"However, it doesn't solve your happiness problems,\" Adeney said. \"One of my friends who's also a blogger says, like, he still had to confront some demons and some emotional issues. And taking away his job just exposed them more, 'cause he could no longer distract himself from them.\"",
      "The key to saving for retirement, according to Adeney, is to figure out what's important to you \u2013 and trim your spending everywhere else.",
      "Vicki Robin is a sort of mythical figure in the FIRE Movement. She is the co-author (with Joe Dominguez) of the 1992 personal finance book, \"Your Money or Your Life.\" She said, \"As you start to elaborate what's important to you, you realize, like, 'I'm gonna minimize the amount of money I spend, 'cause that's my life energy.' And there's some formula that arises in your mind of, like, 'The less I spend, the more life I have.'\"",
      "Robin's philosophy is less about early retirement and more about asking what is \"enough,\" which differs for everyone. But the consensus of the FIRE Movement is that, to retire, you have to save and invest 25 times your yearly expenses, and then live off of a 4% drawdown each year.",
      "Robin said, \"It's just, 'Okay, how can I have enough for a life that's really happy, but no excess, so that I can liberate my time to do what I find I'm called to do, what I care to do?' And, you know, that evolves over time. I have a little phrase that I've said: I buy my freedom with my frugality every day.\"",
      "A frugality which Nik and Adina Johnson say they are now reaping the rewards of, along with their three children: a life less defined by the \"stuff\" they possess, and more by the freedom they enjoy.",
      "Nik said, \"They're gonna always remember this trip to Disney. But they're not gonna remember, you know, that extra pair of tennis shoes I bought my son. My son's not gonna look at me like, 'Hey Dad, remember that blazer you had on? Man, it was awesome!'\"",
      "Asked what these early retirees' day looks like, Adinah replied, \"Well, I have to pick up the kids, and then I have to take my son to football practice. And then whatever grocery shopping I may have needed to do while I was doing this interview, I need to go ahead and get some of that grocery shopping done.\"",
      "\"Doesn't sound like she needs my help for any of that; I'll probably go play golf,\" Nik laughed.",
      "I observed, \"Seems like one of you is more retired than the other one.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump ordered his administration to fire the commissioner of labor statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after the July jobs report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring and a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "\"No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media.",
      "He added, \"She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes.\"",
      "The president described the latest report, which showed employers in July added a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, as \"a shock,\" adding that the downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June was a \"major mistake.\"",
      "McEntarfer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Although Mr. Trump claimed, without evidence, that the latest employment report revision for May and June undermines the data's accuracy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics frequently revises its previous job numbers to reflect new information, while past months' numbers are often revised both upwards and downwards. The previous revision was made in the June jobs report, when the BLS revised April and May's numbers higher.",
      "McEntarfer's firing drew criticism from economists and policy experts, who said the move threatens the integrity of economic data from a trusted federal agency",
      "Mr. Trump \"is firing the messenger because he doesn't seem to like jobs numbers that reflect how badly he's damaged the economy,\" Lily Roberts, managing director for Inclusive Growth at the Center for American Progress, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said in a statement.",
      "She added, \"The data he wants to hide is produced by nonpartisan economists who have been doing this work for decades. Politicizing our country's collection of data on what's going on in the economy could shake markets that rely on unbiased information, and it will make it harder to create an economy that makes sure everyone has a good job.\"",
      "Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a social media post that Mr. Trump's dismissal of McEntarfer is \"basically unprecedented and will raise concerns about U.S. data integrity going forward,\" noting that BLS also issues closely watched data on inflation, wages and worker productivity.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers also expressed concern about the firing.",
      "\"The statistics are what they are,\" Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming told CBS News. \"It's not the statistician's fault if the numbers are accurate and that they're not what the president had hoped for.\"",
      "In a social media post, Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said she supported the firing, and added that Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski will serve as acting commissioner. \"A recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner,\" she wrote.",
      "McEntarfer was named as the 16th commissioner of Labor Statistics in January 2024, after she was nominated by President Biden in 2023 and confirmed in early 2024 by the Senate. A labor economist, McEntarfer had spent more than 20 years in positions with the federal government, including the U.S. Census Bureau and the Treasury,\u00a0according\u00a0to her bio.",
      "Stagnating job market",
      "Mr. Trump's firing of McEntarfer came after the July jobs report signaled that the labor market has stalled with employers holding off on hiring in part because of uncertainty of the administration's trade policies.",
      "The July data appears to back up anecdotal evidence from the Federal Reserve's\u00a0most recent \"beige book,\" which compiles comments from local businesses, that many companies were delaying hiring \"until uncertainty diminished.\"",
      "\"Based on what I was hearing from a lot of employers, I kept expecting to see a stagnant job report at some point, that's what we got today,\" Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "summary": "Berkshire Hathaway's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it has to record the current value of its massive investment portfolio.",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett's\u00a0company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in\u00a0Kraft Heinz, as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathaway helped bankroll.",
      "Berkshire said it earned $12.37 billion, or $8,601 per Class A share, during the quarter. That's down from $30.248 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, a year ago, because it recorded a much smaller paper investment gain this year.",
      "Berkshire's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it must record the current value of its massive investment portfolio, even though it doesn't sell most of the stocks. That's why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings, which exclude those investment gains. Although last year Berkshire did surprised shareholders by\u00a0selling off\u00a0a huge chunk of its Apple stake, which inflated the investment gains then.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings were only down slightly at $11.16 billion, or $7,759.58 per Class A share. That compares with $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, a year ago. Most of Berkshire's myriad assortment of companies \u2014 major insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, a group of utilities and a collection of manufacturing and retail businesses \u2014 generally performed well despite the uncertainty about the economy and President Trump's tariffs.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expected Berkshire to report earnings per Class A share of $7,508.10, so the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's results were ahead of that.",
      "Berkshire owns more than 27% of Kraft Heinz' stock and, for years, it has had representatives on the company's board. Buffett has said previously that he believes the company's iconic brands will do well over time, but in hindsight, he overpaid for the investment and underestimated the challenges branded foods face from retailers and the growth of private label products.",
      "This spring, Berkshire's representatives resigned from the Kraft Heinz board shortly before the company announced it is exploring strategic options that may include spinning off a large part of its portfolio of brands.",
      "Over the years since Berkshire helped Kraft buy Heinz in 2015, the company has been hurt by changing consumer tastes and a shift toward healthier options than Kraft's core collection of processed foods.",
      "Buffett's is still sitting on a massive pile of $344.1 billion in cash, although the company's reserves dipped slightly from the $347.7 billion cash it was holding at the end of the first quarter. Buffett told shareholders in May he just isn't finding any attractive deals for companies he understands.",
      "Buffett surprised shareholders at the annual meeting when he announced that he plans to\u00a0give up the CEO title\u00a0at the end of the year and hand over operations to\u00a0Vice Chairman Greg Abel, but Buffett will remain Chairman.",
      "Berkshire shareholders might be disappointed that the company didn't repurchase any of its shares this quarter, even though the price has fallen more than 12% since just before Buffett announced his retirement.",
      "Many investors are watching Berkshire's BNSF closely after\u00a0rival Union Pacific announced\u00a0a plan to buy Norfolk Southern earlier this week to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. The speculation is that BNSF needs to pursue a merger with Eastern Rail CSX to be able to compete.",
      "But CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it isn't Buffett's style to jump into a deal just because the market thinks he should. Over the decades, he has built Berkshire by finding strong companies selling for less than they are worth. CSX is trading near its 52-week high at $35.01 amid all the deal speculation.",
      "\"He wants to do it because he found an undervalued franchise -- not because the market says you need to do a deal,\" Seifert said. \"I think one of the reasons why that cash hasn't been deployed is that valuations run through the Berkshire M-and-A model tend to be too rich. But if there's a logical case to be made they'll accept it.\"",
      "And BNSF appears to be doing fine right now on its own. The railroad recorded a 19% jump in its operating profit this quarter at $1.47 billion as it cut costs and delivered about 1% more shipments.",

      "Greer spoke to \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" hours after the monthly jobs report showed a hiring slowdown in July and revised down earlier reports for May and June. Mr. Trump reacted by firing Commissioner of Labor Statistics Erika McEntarfer, claiming \u2014 without evidence \u2014 Friday's jobs numbers were \"RIGGED.\"",
      "\"You know, even last year during the campaign, there were enormous swings in the jobs numbers, and so it sounds to me like the president has real concerns,\" Greer told CBS News, adding that Mr. Trump's issues with government labor data extend beyond Friday's report.",
      "\"You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways,\" said Greer.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics' reports are based on surveys of households and businesses. It's common for the agency to revise prior months' figures up or down as more data comes in. The May and June revisions \u2014 which cut the number of new jobs by a combined 258,000 \u2014 were the largest downward change in employment figures since 1979, excluding pandemic-era jobs reports, though that doesn't mean the data was manipulated, as Mr. Trump claims.",
      "Greer defended Mr. Trump's right to fire McEntarfer, an economist who was nominated to the post by former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"The President is the President. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",
      "The firing drew staunch criticism, with McEntarfer's predecessor William Beach \u2014 who was first nominated in Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 calling it \"groundless\" and a \"dangerous precedent.\"",
      "\"This rationale for firing Dr. McEntarfer is without merit and undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics that are a cornerstone of intelligent economic decision-making by businesses, families, and policymakers,\" Beach said in a statement.",
      "Friday's report showed the economy added 73,000 jobs in July, below the 115,000 predicted by economists. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, up from 4.1% a month earlier.",
      "Greer predicts \"big increase in manufacturing jobs\"",
      "The jobs report also showed a slight drop in manufacturing jobs last month. Mr. Trump's tariff hikes are intended in part to boost American manufacturing \u2014 though critics warn some U.S.-based factories that rely on foreign-made inputs will be hurt by tariffs.",
      "When asked about July's manufacturing data, Greer \u2014 one of Mr. Trump's trade negotiators \u2014 told CBS News he doesn't \"read tariff policy into that number.\"",
      "Instead, Greer argued that the numbers reflect conditions prior to the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act that passed through Congress last month. He argued businesses were \"waiting to see\" if some of the bill's tax provisions would pass, including parts that GOP lawmakers believe will encourage more business investment.",
      "\"I think that we're going to see a big increase in manufacturing jobs now that we have the 'one big, beautiful bill' passed,\" Greer said. \"And I think that \u2026 our manufacturers know that they have a clear and certain path forward on that now.\"",

      "Materials issued by the White House on Thursday outline new tariff rates for dozens of countries, but details remain scant on how to implement the trade agreements, said Barry Appleton, co-director of the New York Law School Center for International Law.",
      "\"The last thing businesses want to have are unanswered questions. They were looking for certainty, and what we have instead is a gigantic Rubik's Cube,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone has been waiting for 'Liberation Day' to be finished,\" he added, referring to the country-based tariff announcements Mr. Trump first made in early April. \"Instead, with this announcement, we have another perpetuation of what's going on.\"",
      "Under the Trump administration's new import duties, most countries will face a baseline tariff of at least 15%, although other nations will faces levies of more than 40%. The U.S. effective tariff rate is now 17%, according to Fitch Ratings \u2014 the highest in decades.",
      "That could mean pricier garments from Vietnam, shoes and toys from China, chocolate from Switzerland, and coffee from Brazil, according to economists. As a result, the revised U.S. tariffs could cost Americans an average of $2,048 per year, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the National Taxpayers Union, a nonpartisan advocacy organization.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued his tariff strategy is necessary to correct what he views as unfair trading practices and revive American manufacturing, and points to still-fairly-low inflation rates. But many economists warn\u00a0tariffs can lead\u00a0to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth, and some of the president's early trade moves\u00a0rattled financial markets.",
      "The White House has said that Mr. Trump's trade policies benefit Americans.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "On social media, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the tariffs are \"a knockout win over the distorted global trading order that has disadvantaged American workers, farmers, and manufacturers for decades.\"",
      "He added that Trump's foreign trade policy has achieved \"expansive new market access for U.S. exporters, increased tariffs to defend critical industries, and trillions of new manufacturing investments that will create great American jobs.\"",
      "Which products could get pricier?",
      "In the U.S., the products most commonly imported from abroad \u2014 and therefore most likely to see their prices rise because of sharply higher tariffs \u2014 include household appliances, furniture, cars, clothing, sports equipment, toys and cleaning products, according to an analysis from Oxford Economics.",
      "The price of such goods rose about 1% in June, or more than double the increase in May, according to the investment research firm's analysis of consumption data, a sign that tariffs are starting to seep into the cost of everyday items.",
      "\"The question is really what's not going to go up in price. The costs were being eaten in the profits of companies, but that's not sustainable,\" Appleton said.",
      "Mr. Trump slapped some of the highest tariffs on key trade partners like Canada, a major provider of lumber to U.S. companies. That could lead to higher housing costs, according to Oxford. Some fruits and vegetables also could get pricier this winter as grocery stores leans on imports to stock store shelves, he said.",
      "U.S. automakers including Ford, GM and Stellantis have recently warned that higher U.S. tariffs will reduce their profits by billion of dollars. That is likely to increase new car prices, said Terence Lau, dean of the Syracuse University College of Law and formerly a government affairs executive at Ford.",
      "\"My advice to consumers back in April was that they should wait to buy cars,\" said Lau, who expects dealer prices for 2026 models to rise between 4% and 6%. \"In August, my advice is to buy now.\"",
      "Although many businesses are still selling inventory they imported earlier this year in a bid to avoid higher tariffs, subsequent imports will likely be subject to the newly announced levies when they arrive at U.S. ports, according to trade experts.",
      "\"A lot of businesses front-loaded goods to get them in the door before tariffs were announced. They'll now have to increase their costs as inventories dwindle and businesses start replenishing them,\" Oxford Economics' senior U.S. economist Matthew Martin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect cost hikes to peak in the second half of the year,\"",
      "Along with facing potentially higher prices, U.S. consumers could face reduced product choices stemming from supply-chain delays, according to economists. That's largely because companies unable to reshore manufacturing to the U.S. are likely to stop importing low-margin goods as they move to control costs.",
      "\"In many cases, tariffs will be so high that we'll create embargoes,\" Martin said. \"That will make it more difficult for retailers and distributors to get things out to market.\"",
      "Rodney Manzo, a supply-chain expert and senior director at Sage, a business management software company, said higher tariffs often end up affecting businesses and consumers in ways beyond the cash register.",

      "\"Sadly, employment appears set for a further summer slowdown as firms, facing renewed cost volatility from escalating trade tensions, remain focused on managing labor costs through reduced hiring, performance-based layoffs, restrained wage growth and lower entry-level wages,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said in a report. \"We anticipate job creation will weaken further, remaining below trend in the coming months, with the unemployment rate likely rising toward 4.8% by early 2026.\"",

      "What it means",
      "Some market analysts said the subpar job growth in July suggests that stepped-up U.S. tariffs on the country's economic partners are weighing on the labor market. President Trump issued an executive order late Thursday that imposes tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"Today's Jobs report is unambiguously soft and a reflection of the trade and tariff impact on economic growth,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \"Both the actual report and the big negative revisions are more evidence that the trade policy will slow growth.\"",
      "Beyond the ups and down of the job market, meanwhile, many Americans are struggling in an economy bifurcated between rich and poor.",

I hear individuals trading down, they go to the supermarket and they can't buy ground beef. They're buying hot dogs.\"",
      "The latest job numbers could spur Federal Reserve officials to cut interest rates at their next meeting in September, according to economists. The central bank opted this week to\u00a0hold its benchmark rate steady. President Trump has pushed for a rate cut, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that policymakers remain cautious about lowering rates until the impact of tariffs on the economy is clear.",

    "story": [
      "Tesla was found partly liable in a wrongful death case involving the electric vehicle company's Autopilot system, with a jury awarding the plaintiffs $200 million in punitive damages plus additional money in compensatory damages.",
      "The case, which took place in a Miami courtroom over the last couple of weeks, centered on whether defects in Tesla's self-driving technology ultimately contributed to the death of 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon in 2019.",
      "Along with the $200 million in punitive damages, Tesla was also ordered to pay around $43 million in compensatory damages directly to the plaintiffs.",
      "Leon was killed when a man driving a Model S Tesla equipped with Tesla's Autopilot technology plowed through a T-shaped intersection and struck her and her boyfriend Dillon Angulo. Angulo survived but was gravely injured.",
      "The federal jury held that Tesla bore significant responsibility in the incident and that George McGee, the Florida driver who lost sight of the road when he dropped his phone, was not entirely to blame.",
      "\"Today's verdict represents justice for Naibel's tragic death and Dillon's lifelong injuries, holding Tesla and Musk accountable for propping up the company's trillion-dollar valuation with self-driving hype at the expense of human lives,\" said the plaintiffs' attorney Brett Schreiber in a statement shared with CBS News.",
      "The plaintiffs in the case originally asked for $345 million in damages during closing arguments on Thursday.",
      "The most important piece of evidence in the trial, according to the plaintiffs' lawyers, was an augmented video of the crash that included data from the Autopilot computer. Tesla previously claimed the video was deleted, but a forensic data expert was able to recover it.",
      "\"What we ultimately learned from that augmented video is that the vehicle 100% knew that it was about to run off the roadway, through a stop sign, through a blinking red light, through a parked car and through a pedestrian, yet did nothing other than shut itself off when the crash was unavoidable,\" said Adam Boumel, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys.",
      "Tesla plans to appeal",
      "\"Today's verdict is wrong, and only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla's and the entire industry's efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology,\" Tesla said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"This was never about Autopilot; it was a fiction concocted by plaintiffs' lawyers blaming the car when the driver \u2014 from day one \u2014 admitted and accepted responsibility.\"",
      "Tesla also said it plans to appeal the decision.",
      "The case was a big test for the electric vehicle maker, which has been under scrutiny over the safety of its cars. Similar cases have been brought against Tesla, although many have been dismissed.",
      "\"This will open the floodgates,\" said Miguel Custodio, a car crash lawyer not involved in the Tesla case. \"It will embolden a lot of people to come to court.\"",
      "Todd Poses, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said his clients' goal in bringing this to court was ultimately to set a precedent that makes the public safer.",

      "The restaurant soon had lines out the door and served roughly 1,100 diners per day at the height of Deen's popularity. A USA Today food critic awarded The Lady & Sons his \"meal of the year\" in 1999.",

The outplacement firm lists AI as one of the top five factors contributing to job losses in 2025.",
      "Layoffs have jumped this year, adding to fresh concerns about a pullback in hiring after new labor data on Friday showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 well short of analyst forecasts. Through July, companies have announced more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts, the highest number for that period since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Of those layoffs, the technology industry wielded the sharpest axe \u2014 private companies in the sector have announced more than 89,000 job cuts, up 36% from a year ago. Since 2023, more than 27,000 job cuts have been directly tied to the advent of AI, according to the firm.",
      "\"The industry is being reshaped by the advancement of artificial intelligence and ongoing uncertainty surrounding work visas, which have contributed to workforce reductions,\" Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",

Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, the firm found.",

      "The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure \u2014 the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE \u2014 ticked higher last month, signaling that President Trump's tariffs are pushing some prices higher.",
      "Prices rose 2.6% in June compared with a year ago, the Commerce Department said Thursday, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 2.8% in the past year, the same as the previous month, which was revised higher.",
      "The figures help illustrate the central bank's reason for\u00a0its decision Wednesday to keep its\u00a0key interest rate steady, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressing that inflation still remains above the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. Powell suggested it could take months for the central bank to determine whether the president's new import duties would cause just a one-time rise in prices, or a more persistent increase in inflation.",
      "\"The Fed got validation this morning with inflation coming in a little higher than expected,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X in an emailed comment. \"There is some evidence of tariff impact in the inflation data, but it remains modest. Health care, housing and utilities continue to be key sources in driving inflation.\"",
      "On a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.3% from May to June, while core prices also rose 0.3%. Both figures are higher than what would be consistent with the 2% target.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated uncertainty over the nation's economic outlook and inflation that remains higher than its 2% annualized goal. The central bank last cut rates in December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's January inauguration.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pressuring Powell to cut rates, arguing that lower rates are justified because inflation remains tame and that other nations have been cutting their benchmark rates this year. Nevertheless, the majority of the Fed's 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, voted on Wednesday to maintain rates in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, although there were two dissenting votes in favor of a cut.",

      "The cost of some services fell dramatically last month, offsetting some of the price pressures from goods. Air fares dropped 0.7% from May to June, while the cost of hotel rooms plunged 3.6% just in one month.",
      "Thursday's report also showed that consumer spending rose 0.3% from May to June, a modest rise that suggests Americans are still spending cautiously. Adjusted for inflation, the increase was just 0.1%, the government said.",
      "Americans' incomes also saw a modest increase, rising 0.3% last month, a rebound after a 0.4% drop in May. Adjusted for inflation and taxes, however, incomes were flat in June.",

      "Consumer spending, for example, rose at a lackluster 1.4% pace, after an even smaller gain of 0.5% in the first three months of the year. A sharp drop in imports in the April-June quarter, which followed a surge in the first quarter, provided a big lift to the government's calculation of U.S. gross domestic product.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/keep-call-centers-in-america-act-artificial-intelligence/",
    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 11:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposed bill would protect both workers and American consumers from bad experiences with AI.",
    "story": [
      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

    "summary": "Gov. Greg Abbott said he's ordered the Texas DPS to \"locate, arrest and return to the House chamber any member who has abandoned their duty to Texans.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Texas Legislature attempted to meet Monday to consider a redistricting plan that would favor Republicans, but Democratic members who left the state over the weekend did not return, denying the quorum needed to convene the session. Gov. Greg Abbott vowed to take steps to remove those lawmakers from their seats, and Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows said he had signed civil arrest warrants for the absent Democrats.",
      "Republicans \"can make idle threats, but as long as they are out of state, there's really nothing that they can do,\" said Mark Jones, a Rice University political science professor.",
      "More than 50 Texas House Democrats left the state on Sunday, leaving the chamber short of the two-thirds quorum needed to bring a vote to the floor. Democrats are protesting the President Trump-led effort by Republicans to redraw the state's U.S. House congressional map, which could net the GOP up to five more seats.",
      "\"We are fighting for representative democracy, and whether or not that will continue, and so we're willing to face whatever consequences may come our way,\" Democratic state Rep. James Talarico told CBS News.",
      "\"This House will not sit quietly while you obstruct the work of the people,\" Burrows said Monday.",
      "To assist Burrows, Abbott said Monday that he had ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to \"locate, arrest, and return to the House chamber any member who has abandoned their duty to Texans.\" But the Texas DPS does not have jurisdiction to arrest them out of state.",
      "Rep. Ann Johnson, a Houston Democrat, told CBS News' Ed O'Keefe in an interview Monday that \"a quorum break is written into the Texas Constitution,\" and \"the threat of arrest is something that should be an alarm for a lot of folks.\"",
      "Abbott claimed Monday on Fox News that the Democrats could face bribery charges if their costs while out of state are being covered by others.",
      "\"I think based upon comments made by legislators themselves, they face a possibility of facing bribery charges, which is a second-degree felony in the state of Texas, there's one way to cure that, and that is if they get back to the state of Texas and make quorum today at a hearing that we have at 3 o'clock, they can cure themselves of any quid pro quo that would subject them to potential bribery charges,\" Abbott said.",
      "But Jones noted that \"Texas, compared to other states, has very loose ethics laws.\"",
      "\"The governor is certainly welcome to make that argument, and theoretically it has a limited level of potential to move forward, but at the end of the day, if you look at Texas ethics law and look at all of the things that are allowed under Texas ethics law \u2026 we would rank receiving money to pay a fine at the lower end at the potential for an ethics violation, let alone things that are illegal,\" Jones said.",
      "Abbott said Sunday that if members didn't return by 3 p.m. CT Monday, he'd \"invoke Texas Attorney General Opinion No. KP-0382 to remove the missing Democrats from membership in the Texas House.\"",
      "Abbott was citing a 2021 opinion from Texas' Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, which was written after a previous walkout when Democratic lawmakers left the state to protest a change in the voting laws. The opinion, which is nonbinding, says a \"district court may determine that a legislator has forfeited his or her office due to abandonment and can remove the legislator from office, thereby creating a vacancy.\"",
      "But Jones noted that the only legal ways to remove a Texas lawmaker is either for the person to be expelled by a vote of two-thirds of the Legislature \u2014 which happened when legislators voted to expel\u00a0Republican Rep. Byron Slaton\u00a0over misconduct in 2023 \u2014 or by voters at the ballot box.",
      "Republican state Rep. Briscoe Cain\u00a0posted on social media\u00a0Monday that he would file a bill to declare a seat vacant if a legislator missed seven consecutive days of a session. But since there is no quorum, that bill can't receive a vote \u2014 at least for now.",
      "Abbott called a special session last month to take up the redistricting effort, along with 17 other issues, including relief for Texas flood victims, a review of the flood warning system and emergency preparedness, and a THC ban. Congressional redistricting, however, was to be considered first.",
      "Texas has a part-time legislature which meets for 140 days every other year. The governor has the right to call a 30-day special session to address certain topics. The current special session started on July 21.",
      "Abbott can call as many special sessions as he wants, which means that if Democrats run out the clock on this special session, he could call another one as soon as it ends.",

      "\"I get a phone call every week from employers saying, 'Do you have anybody from Ukraine who needs a job?' Because we have a workforce shortage in Iowa and our population is declining,\" Boelens told CBS News.",

      "Heer employed Avetisian, her husband and her cousin before their two-year work permits expired. As the war in Ukraine continues, most European countries are renewing work permits of Ukrainian refugees.  The Trump administration has not, pausing all immigration applications filed by migrants from Latin America and Ukraine earlier this year.",
      "Heer told CBS News he voted for President Trump in the 2024 election. When asked what he would tell the president or his administration about the Ukrainian refugees, Heer said, \"These people are hard to come by.

      "Three Democratic state lawmakers who fled Texas to block an effort to redraw the state's congressional maps to favor Republicans told CBS News on Monday they're prepared to stay out of the state for at least the next two weeks \u2014 as GOP leaders threaten consequences.",
      "Dozens of Texas House Democrats headed to Illinois and other blue states over the weekend, denying the chamber's GOP leaders a quorum on Monday. The move has at least temporarily derailed a special legislative session called by Gov. Greg Abbott to reshape the state's U.S. House district maps \u2014 after President Trump publicly encouraged Texas Republicans to create five more GOP-leaning House seats ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
      "One of the Democrats who left Texas for Illinois, state Rep. John Bucy III, told CBS News \"we've all committed\" to staying out of the state until the end of the legislative session. Special sessions can last up to 30 days, and just over two weeks are left in the current session.",
      "But if the clock runs out without a vote on the new House maps, Abbott has the power to immediately call another legislative session, state Rep. Ann Johnson acknowledged.",
      "If that happens, Democrats will \"assess our options,\" state Rep. James Talarico said.",
      "The map that was floated by Texas Republicans last week could, if approved, tilt as many as 30 of the state's 38 U.S. House districts toward Republicans, which currently hold 25 districts. The map redraws two Democratic seats in the Rio Grande Valley, combines two seats in the Austin area and rearranges districts in the Houston and Dallas areas.",
      "Texas Democrats say they \"knew there would be consequences\"",
      "The GOP-dominated state House voted Monday to compel the absent Democrats to return to Texas, including by issuing civil arrest warrants. Meanwhile, Abbott ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to \"arrest and return\" the Democratic members and investigate them for \"bribery\" because they accepted donations to help pay for their time in other states. Abbott has also suggested there's a legal path to remove any absent Democrats from office.",
      "It's unclear whether those efforts to arrest lawmakers are enforceable outside of Texas. Rice University political science professor Mark Jones told CBS News that Republicans \"can make idle threats, but as long as they are out of state, there's really nothing that they can do.\"",
      "\"If you choose to continue down this road, you should know there will be consequences,\" Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows, a Republican, said during a brief speech Monday afternoon, after the House was unable to establish a quorum.",
      "\"The absconded Democrat House members were elected to meet and vote on legislation \u2014 not to prevent votes that may not go their way,\" Abbott said in an earlier statement.",
      "Talarico told CBS News that House Democrats \"knew there would be consequences.\"",
      "\"We are fighting for representative democracy, and whether or not that will continue, and so we're willing to face whatever consequences may come our way,\" he said.",
      "In addition to redistricting, Abbott called a special session last month to handle other high-profile legislative priorities, like approving disaster relief for the deadly Texas floods. Texas Republicans and Democrats have both accused each other of holding disaster relief hostage.",
      "\"Greg Abbott is prioritizing Donald Trump with this special session,\" Bucy told CBS News. \"Instead of taking action to help the flood victims of Central Texas, he is prioritizing trying to steal five congressional seats from the people of Texas.\"",
      "Johnson rejected accusations by Republicans that Democratic lawmakers had abandoned their work, saying they were exercising \"the fundamental protection by our founding fathers in the Texas Constitution that says the minority party has the opportunity to break quorum when you know that the majority has really gone off the rails.\"",
      "What do Texas Democrats want?",
      "This isn't the first time Democrats have fled Texas to deny Republicans a two-thirds quorum in the state House or Senate. In 2021, House Democrats left the state to block a vote on a restrictive voting law, but the walkout came to an end after just over a month, and a version of the bill ended up passing.",
      "When asked how this week's walkout would be different, Talarico argued the 2021 effort was successful because some of the most controversial provisions of the voting law \u2014 like limits to Sunday voting \u2014 were ultimately taken out of the legislation.",
      "\"This is an effective tool in our toolbox to fight for our constituents and make harmful legislation less dangerous. We're hopeful that's what will happen here,\" he said.",
      "Some of the Texas Democrats want blue states to threaten to retaliate by redrawing their congressional maps to add more Democratic districts. The governors of California and New York have entertained the idea of carrying out redistricting to eke out more blue seats, but those moves could be legally difficult, since California has put an independent commission in charge of redistricting and New York bans political gerrymandering.",
      "All three Texas House Democrats who spoke with CBS News \u2014 Talarico, Bucy and Johnson \u2014 told CBS News they don't support gerrymandering in general. But Talarico said that \"if one side is going to cheat, all bets are off, and maybe that kind of pressure will convince our Republican colleagues and the president to walk back from the brink.\"",
      "\"Democrats and Republican politicians both gerrymander and it's wrong in both instances,\" Talarico said, but \"this is particularly egregious.\"",
      "\"This is kind of like the bully that takes your lunch money every day. At some point, you got to stand up, otherwise you just end up broke and hungry,\" Johnson said. \"We've told Republicans, 'enough \u2014 you've gone way too far.'\"",

He's part of the team covering President Trump and covered all four years of Joe Biden's presidency.

      "Republicans unveiled the new congressional maps\u00a0last week as part of a mid-decade redistricting in an attempt to protect the GOP's razor-thin U.S. House majority. President Trump said in July that he believes Republicans could win five more seats in Texas with different districts.",
      "Abbott included redistricting to be addressed in a special legislative session, along with other high-profile topics like approving disaster relief for the deadly Texas floods and a THC ban.",
      "Democratic lawmakers announced Sunday evening they would leave the state to hold up the special session. \"We will not allow disaster relief to be held hostage to a Trump gerrymander. As of today, this corrupt special session is over,\" Texas House Democrats said in a statement.",
      "\"For weeks, we've been warning that if Republicans in Texas want a showdown \u2014 if they want to delay flood relief to cravenly protect Donald Trump from an inevitable midterm meltdown \u2014 then we'd give them that showdown,\" Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said in a statement, accusing Mr. Trump and Republicans of \"rigging the system\" and \"scheming to hold onto power.\"",
      "Both houses of the Texas legislature are controlled by Republicans, but if most Democratic lawmakers leave the state, they could deny the state House and Senate the two-thirds quorum that they need to vote on the new congressional maps.",

      "Republicans in Texas currently hold 25 of the state's 38 congressional seats. The party hopes the new maps could bring that number up to 30, and all of those new 30 seats were won by Mr. Trump in November by at least 10 points.",
      "The five seats come from redrawing Rio Grande Valley districts \u2014 where Mr. Trump has made gains in what were once Democratic strongholds \u2014 and combining Reps. Lloyd Doggett and Greg Cesar's districts in Austin. In North Texas, Rep. Julie Johnson's suburban 32nd District would be reshaped to stretch from the Dallas area to rural Republican strongholds, and Rep. Marc Veasey would be moved out of Tarrant County entirely, which would leave only a small portion of the county represented by a Democrat. All four Houston-area seats were redrawn, with Rep. Al Green's being the most dramatic.",
      "\"They're turning our districts into crazy shapes to guarantee the outcome they want in the 2026 election,\" Democratic state Rep. James Talarico said in a message\u00a0posted to social media. \"If this power grab succeeds, they will hang on to power without any accountability from the voters.\"",
      "Wu said Texas Republicans are \"using is a racist, gerrymandered map, a map that seeks to use racial lines to divide hard working communities who have spent decades building up their power and strengthening their voices, and Governor Abbott is doing this in submission to Donald Trump.\"",
      "Democrats have fought back against the new districts, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries traveling to Austin on Thursday to pledge national support.",
      "\"We are not fighting for the Democratic Party, we are fighting for the democratic process, and the stakes could not be higher. We have to take a stand,\" Talarico added.",
      "Martin said in an appearance Sunday on MSNBC, \"I'm proud of the Texas Dems for actually breaking quorum here. Our democracy is literally under assault by Donald Trump, Greg Abbott and the Republicans, who know that they are on a track to lose the House majority next year. So what do they do? They cheat. They rigged the system. That's all they have left.\"",
      "\"We're certainly going to be standing with folks who will be litigating this in the courts,\" Martin added. \"We will continue to organize on the ground in Texas, and we will continue to support the House Dems, as they have broke quorum right now.\"",
      "This is not the first time Democrats have left the state to deny Republicans a quorum \u2014 and not the first time they have done it to protest redistricting. During the landmark 2005 mid-decade redistricting, Texas Democrats fled during two separate special sessions to stop the redistricting. But the redistricting eventually did go through. And in 2023, Republicans passed legislation that levies a $500-a-day fine on lawmakers who leave the state.",
      "The last significant quorum break in the Texas House was in 2021, when Democrats fled the state to prevent a restrictive voting bill from passing.",
      "Last month, Paxton threatened to assist police in \"hunting down and compelling the attendance\" of any Democratic lawmakers who leave the state to block votes during the special session.",
      "\"If Democrats ignore their duty to their constituents by breaking quorum, they should be found and arrested no matter where they go,\" said Paxton, who is also running for the GOP nomination in next year's Senate race.",
      "Abbott on Sunday said that \"Any Democrat who 'solicits, accepts, or agrees to accept'\" donations to help cover any fines they may be subjected to under Hous rules for skipping votes, \"may have violated bribery laws.\"",
      "Can other states take on redistricting efforts?",
      "As the efforts ramped up in Texas to redraw the maps, other Democrat-led states threatened to do something similar. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been one of the most prominent voices behind this effort, posting on social media after the GOP's new maps for Texas were unveiled that \"California won't sit back and watch this happen.\"",
      "Other governors have joined suit, with some of the Texas House Democrats joining New York Gov. Kathy Hochul for a press conference on Monday about the topic. Hochul said, \"I'm tired of fighting this fight with one hand tied behind my back.\"",
      "Pritzker also said Sunday \"everything has to be on the table.\"",
      "But legally, it will be difficult to pull off in many of these states. Texas is one of a few states that allows the state legislature to set up the congressional maps, and can allow mid-decade redistricting. In California, an independent commissions is in charge of redistricting \u2014 and there is a law in New York banning gerrymandering for political gains. New York's congressional maps went through a number of legal challenges before the final maps were settled on.",
      "Hochul and New York Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie acknowledged it would require a change to the state constitution, but Heastie insisted that \"we're in close conversations about options there, and so I would say we're presenting all options right now.\"",
      "\"It's very difficult to say play fair when your opponents are playing dirty and using every tool in their tool shed toolbox to kind of undermine democracy,\" Heastie said.",
      "As for Illinois, the state legislature draws the map and Democrats control the legislature \u2014 and they cut out two Republican seats when they redrew the maps in 2021. Prior to redistricting, Illinois had 13 Democrats and five Republicans in the House. The state lost a seat due to population loss, and they ended the 2022 elections with 14 Democrats and three Republicans.",

    "summary": "Border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's ban on asylum claims, lifting a sweeping policy that had effectively closed the U.S. asylum system to many migrants, two officials told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's ban on asylum claims, following a federal court order that said the measure could not be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum-seekers, two Department of Homeland Security officials told CBS News.",
      "The move effectively lifts a sweeping policy that had closed the American asylum system to those entering the U.S. illegally or without proper documents. It's a measure the second Trump administration has credited for a steep drop in illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, where officials last month reported the lowest monthly level of migrant apprehensions on record.",
      "Mr. Trump's asylum crackdown was unprecedented in scope. The proclamation underpinning it, issued just hours after he returned to the White House in January, gave U.S. border officials the power to summarily deport migrants without allowing them to request asylum, a right enshrined in American law for decades.",
      "Mr. Trump said the extraordinary action was necessary due to what he called an \"invasion\" of migrants under the Biden administration, which faced record levels of illegal crossings at the southern border until it too restricted asylum last year.",
      "On Friday, a federal appeals court lifted its pause on a lower judge's ruling that found Mr. Trump's decree violated U.S. asylum laws. While the appellate court narrowed the lower court's order, saying Mr. Trump's proclamation could be used to pause access to the asylum system, it also ruled the U.S. government could not disregard other laws that bar officials from deporting migrants to places where they could be tortured or persecuted.",
      "Those laws require the U.S. to grant legal protections \u2014 known as \"withholding of removal\" and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture \u2014 to migrants who prove they would likely face persecution or torture if deported to their home countries. Unlike asylum, those protections do not allow recipients to get permanent U.S. residency or protect them from being deported to a third party country.",
      "Officials at Customs and Border Protection were instructed this weekend to halt deportations under Mr. Trump's proclamation and to process migrants under U.S. immigration law, which affords foreigners on American soil the right to request humanitarian refuge, the two DHS officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss an internal directive.",
      "CBP officials received instructions to process migrants through different mechanisms, including through a fast-track deportation procedure known as expedited removal, according to the DHS officials. While expedited removal allows for relatively quick deportations, migrants processed under the policy are also allowed to apply for asylum if they convince officials that their fears of being harmed if deported are credible.",
      "For months, U.S. border agents had been using Mr. Trump's asylum ban to swiftly deport those crossing into the country illegally to Mexico, their home countries and, in some cases, third party nations that had agreed to accept them. Internally, officials have dubbed those deportations \"212(f) repatriations,\" in reference to the legal authority Mr. Trump invoked in his proclamation.",
      "While the lifting of Mr. Trump's order may reopen the U.S. asylum system, those caught crossing the southern border illegally will likely remain detained while officials vet their claims. The Trump administration has largely stopped the practice of releasing migrants into the U.S. while they await their court dates, limiting releases to cases involving extraordinary circumstances.",
      "The Justice Department could also try to get Friday's court order suspended by the Supreme Court, in a bid to revive Mr. Trump's asylum ban.",
      "Representatives for DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "After soaring to record levels in late 2023, illegal border crossings dropped sharply in former President Biden's last year office, following increased efforts by Mexico to interdict U.S.-bound migrants and an order issued by Biden in June 2024 to restrict access to the American asylum system. But they have plunged even further since Mr. Trump took office for a second time.",
      "In July, Border Patrol encountered just 4,600 migrants along the southern border, the lowest monthly tally ever publicly reported by the agency. It's also a figure the Biden administration recorded in 24 hours on many days.",

    "summary": "A CBS News review of three of DOGE's largest cuts claimed so far found actual savings of 3% of what was claimed.",
    "story": [
      "The spotlight may have moved off the Department of Government Efficiency since the departure of Elon Musk, but the Trump administration's DOGE continues to post about cost cutting on its so-called \"wall of receipts.\" And once again, some of its claims about savings appear to be significantly overstated, according to a CBS News review.",
      "The review of three of the largest cuts claimed so far indicates the savings from those contracts are less than 3% of what DOGE said they were.",
      "On July 27, DOGE added 705 canceled contracts to the website it uses to track and declare savings from the agency's cost cutting across the federal government, among them three of the largest claimed cuts posted since President Trump launched DOGE in January.",
      "The three contracts \u2014 all from the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 funded COVID-19 testing and treatment for people who were uninsured or underinsured during the pandemic. DOGE claims canceling those contracts saved $6.4 billion.",
      "But CBS News' review of transaction records indicates the actual savings is just a small fraction of that \u2014 around $165 million.",
      "That's about how much in obligated funds were left unspent in the three contracts by the time Mr. Trump took office and DOGE was launched. There was nearly $7 billion that remained, but this figure represented a ceiling that federal contracting experts say is rarely reached.",
      "DOGE adjusted down that total potential value by a combined $6.4 billion \u2014 and then reported it as savings. But with the pandemic long over and the contracts set to expire on May 31 of this year, it is highly unlikely the contractors, which included Walgreens and CVS, would have spent anywhere near that sum on COVID-19 testing and treatment.",
      "The spending \"was never going to reach this number,\" said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, referring to the total potential value. \"You didn't have to terminate this contract, you are the government \u2014 just don't obligate any more money.\"",
      "Since it was launched, multiple news outlets including CBS News have reported that DOGE's \"Wall of Receipts\" has at times vastly overstated the amount of funds cut and discovered numerous errors in the group's accounting.",
      "DOGE now claims it has saved $52.2 billion \u2013 just from contracts canceled. Malkus, who analyzed the actual implications of the cancellations rather than the ceiling values, puts the number closer to $17.8 billion. But that would only be if Congress agreed to rescind the funds that it had already voted to spend.",
      "The DOGE website reports a grand total of $199 \u202fbillion saved, when factoring in real estate lease cancellations and other cuts such as personnel reductions. However, it provides no documentation for roughly half of that amount. According to DOGE, the savings equate to $1,236.02 per person in the U.S.",
      "\"The amount they have per person is fiction,\" Malkus said. \"It's transparency theater.\"",
      "HHS did not respond to a CBS News request for comment about the three contracts. The White House redirected the request to the General Services Administration, which declined to comment.",
      "A substantial portion of those purported savings is a result of cuts to USAID. A recent study in the medical journal The Lancet says those cuts could come with a human toll. By the study's estimates, the loss in humanitarian aid could lead to 14 million deaths in children younger than 5 years of age by 2030.",
      "Malkus told CBS News, \"Their claims are generally to say, 'Hey this is a lot of pain, but it's worth it.'\"",
      "The update is only the second since Musk, who launched DOGE, departed from his role in the White House advising Mr. Trump.",
      "Shortly before Musk's term as a special government employee expired, he told reporters, \"This is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning.\"",
      "\"The DOGE team will only grow stronger over time. The DOGE influence will only grow stronger,\" he said from the Oval Office on May 30, adding that he was confident over time DOGE would cull $1 trillion in savings.",
      "It's unclear exactly how DOGE has functioned since then. In late June, The Washington Post reported that federal officials were instructed to stop routing the grant-making process through DOGE, revoking control of the online clearinghouse for all grant opportunities from the group. In DOGE's latest update, only one additional canceled grant was added.",
      "Several DOGE-associated government employees have left in recent weeks, including the Department of the Interior's Tyler Hassen, whose last day was Friday, The New York Times reported. Hassen was originally hired as a DOGE staffer, and then was later tasked with trimming costs at the Interior Department, where he was named principal deputy assistant secretary of the interior.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum had allowed him broad authority to make cuts to budgets and staffing, and under his watch, a DOGE-associated employee made the claim that a single survey costing $1 billion dollars\u00a0had been cut. That claim was repeated by Elon Musk and Burgum, but no evidence was ever supplied to back it up.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:17:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says possible new locations include Arizona, Nebraska and Louisiana.",
    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says \"Alligator Alcatraz\" will serve as a model for state-run migrant detention centers, and she told CBS News in an interview that she hopes to launch a handful of similar detention centers in multiple airports and jails across the country, in the coming months. Potential sites are already under consideration in Arizona, Nebraska and Louisiana.",
      "\"The locations we're looking at are right by airport runways that will help give us an efficiency that we've never had before,\" Noem said, adding that she's appealed directly to governors and state leaders nationwide to gauge their interest in contributing to the Trump administration's program to detain and deport more unauthorized migrants.",
      "\"Most of them are interested,\" Noem said, adding that in states that support President Trump's mission of securing the southern border, \"many of them have facilities that may be empty or underutilized.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security strategy builds on the opening of a 3,000-bed immigration detention center at a jetport in South Florida last month. Dubbed Alligator Alcatraz by state and federal officials, the makeshift facility will cost an estimated $450 million to operate in its first year. Up and running in just 8 days, the tents and trailers at Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport are surrounded by 39 square miles of isolated swampland, boasting treacherous terrain and wildlife",
      "Last month, President Trump toured the facility, seeing rows of bunk beds lined up behind chain fences and encircled by razor wire. Mr. Trump joked to reporters there that \"we're going to teach them how to run away from an alligator if they escape prison.\" Asked if the temporary facility would be a model of what's to come, the president said he'd like to see similar operations in \"many states.\"",
      "The Arizona's governor's office told CBS News it has not been approached about a state-run facility.",
      "Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen's office said in a statement that his administration \"continues to be in communication with federal partners on how Nebraska can best assist in these efforts,\" but added that for now, \"it is premature to comment\" and the governor would \"make details public at the appropriate time.\"",
      "For her part, Noem called the Alligator Alcatraz model \"much better\" than the current detention prototype, which largely contracts out its Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention capacity to for-profit prison companies and county jails. ICE is an agency that falls under DHS. This model relies on intergovernmental service agreements (IGSAs) negotiated and signed between ICE and individual localities. She called the Florida facility \u2013 with an eventual price tag of $245 per inmate bed, per night, according to DHS officials \u2013 a cost-effective option. \"Obviously it was much less per-bed cost than what some of the previous contracts under the Department of Homeland Security were.\"",
      "According to the Office of Homeland Security Statistics, the estimated average daily cost of detaining an adult migrant in fiscal year 2024 was about $165, though the actual cost of detention typically varies based on region, length of stay and facility type.",
      "Still, Noem argued that the new venues, all with close proximity to airports or runways, will help ICE to cut costs by \"facilitating quick turnarounds.\"",
      "\"They're all strategically designed to make sure that people are in beds for less days,\" Noem said, adding that some of the facilities being considered are still undergoing vetting by the department and subject to ongoing negotiations. \"It can be much more efficient once they get their hearings, due process, paperwork.\"",
      "Unlike Alligator Alcatraz, which uses funds from a shelter, food and transportation program run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Noem said the state-based initiative will tap into a new $45 billion funding pool for ICE prompted by President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\", which was signed into law last month. The pool of money is allocated specifically to the expansion of ICE's detention network and will nearly double the agency's bedspace capacity of 61,000 beds, based on cost analysis. As of Saturday, ICE was holding just over 57,000 individuals in its detention network in more than 150 facilities nationwide.",
      "Noem \u2013 who has implemented a department-wide policy across DHS of personally approving each and every contract and grant over $100,000 \u2013 said keeping ICE detention contracts to a duration of under five years is now \"the model we've pushed for.\" For instance, she added, Alligator Alcatraz is a one-year contract that can be renewed.",
      "\"For me personally, the question that I've asked of every one of these contracts is, why are we signing 15-year deals?\" Noem said. \"I have to look at our mission. If we're still building out and processing 100,000 detention beds 15 years from now, then we didn't do our job.\"",
      "The new policy is a departure from earlier agreements made under the Trump administration. In February, ICE signed a 15-year, $1 billion deal with the GEO Group, a private prison company, to reopen Delaney Hall, a two-story, 1,000-bed facility that ranks among the largest detention centers in the Northeast.",
      "Still, Noem said she doesn't feel the U.S. is moving away from a private detention model. \"I mean, these are competitive contracts,\" she said. \"I want everybody to be at the table, giving us solutions. I just want them to give us a contract that actually does the job \u2013 a contract that doesn't put more money in their pockets while keeping people in detention beds just for the sake of that contract.\"",
      "But Alligator Alcatraz has also come under fire from attorneys claiming that both the Trump and DeSantis administrations are holding detainees without charge or access to immigration courts, violating their constitutional rights. Attorneys argued in a legal filing last month that unauthorized migrants held at the Florida-run site have no legal recourse to challenge their detention.",
      "Lawyers and experts have also called into question the very legality of a state-run immigration detention center, given the federal government's authority over immigration enforcement. Opening the detention center in the Everglades under Florida's emergency state powers marked a departure from the federal government's role of housing migrant detainees, an option typically reserved for those who've recently entered the country illegally or those with criminal convictions.",
      "A U.S. district judge last week ordered state and federal officials to provide a copy of the agreement showing \"who's running the show\" at the Everglades immigrant-detention center.",
      "\"Florida does not have the legal authority to detain undocumented immigrants in the absence of a contract with ICE,\" said Kevin Landy, the director of detention policy and planning for ICE under President Barack Obama. \"A state government can't do that.\"",
      "Detainees held at Alligator Alcatraz have also claimed unsanitary and inhumane conditions, including food with maggots, denial of religious rights and limited access to both legal assistance and water. Florida officials have denied the accusations.",
      "Still, tucked away in the Florida Everglades 45 miles west of Miami, if its location sounds treacherous, Noem concedes, that's kind of the point. \"There definitely is a message that it sends,\" the secretary said. \"President Trump wants people to know if you are a violent criminal and you're in this country illegally, there will be consequences.\"",
      "Noem offered that deterrence is an effective strategy based on U.S. gathered intelligence \"from three letter agencies, from other intelligence officials throughout the federal government and in a lot of the Latin American and South American countries\" that indicates \"overwhelmingly, what encourages people to go back home voluntarily is the consequences.\"",
      "\"They see the laws being enforced in the United States,\" Noem said. \"They know when they are here illegally and if they are detained, they'll be removed. They see that they may never get the chance to come back to America. And they're voluntarily coming home.\"",
      "The DHS secretary met with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum in March. \"One of the questions I asked President Scheinbaum when I was in Mexico is, 'Do you have any idea how many people may have come back to Mexico that we may not know about,'\" Noem said.",
      "\"[Sheinbaum] said 500,000 to 600,000 people have come back to Mexico voluntarily since President Trump's been in office,\" Noem continued, explaining that the Mexican president believes her reluctant citizens fear losing the chance to return to the U.S. on a visa or work program.",
      "It's a datapoint she solicits from many of the foreign leaders she meets with, including Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa, who shared a 90-minute lunch with the DHS secretary in Quito, last Thursday. \"I asked him the same question,\" Noem recalled. \"He doesn't have as many illegal immigrants in the United States as in Mexico and Venezuela, but he said he thinks over 100,000 of his citizens have come back to Ecuador. And that's a huge number.\"",
      "Noem reasoned that her Ecuadorian counterpart's rough estimate is based on two factors \u2013 a strengthening Ecuadorian economy and a DHS television campaign launched across Latin and South America, warning prospective migrants not to enter or remain in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"He was very proud of the fact that he's doing better with his economy. So there's jobs,\" Noem recounted. \"But he said, you know, our ads are running in Ecuador. We're telling people that, if you have family in the United States that are there illegally, it's time to come home.\"",

    "summary": "The State Department said in a notice that it is launching a \"visa bond pilot program\" that aims to curb overstays for visitors who come to the U.S. for business or tourism.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The State Department is set to roll out a pilot program that may require foreign nationals from certain countries seeking business or tourism visas to post a bond of up to $15,000, according to a public notice set to be published Tuesday.",
      "The notice lays out the details of a 12-month \"visa bond pilot program\" that would allow consular officers to require visa bonds. Under the program, the bonds may be required for travelers from countries that the State Department says have high rates of visa overstays, or where screening and vetting information is considered deficient, according to the document.",
      "The notice does not specify the countries covered by the pilot program, but said the State Department will announce the list at least 15 days before it takes effect. The agency will also provide an explanation of why the bonds are required, according to the listing, which will be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday.",
      "The program will take effect 15 days after the notice is officially published and will run through August 2026, the document states.",
      "The program comes in response to an executive order issued by President Trump on the first day of his second term that sought to stem illegal immigration into the U.S., a major focus of the president's policy agenda. The measure directed the treasury secretary, along with the secretaries of state and homeland security, to take action to implement a visa bond program.",
      "As part of his immigration agenda, the president has sought to roll back humanitarian programs for migrants from certain countries, and signed a proclamation in June banning foreign nationals from a dozen countries from traveling to the U.S. The Trump administration has also targeted immigrants on student visas and taken steps to tighten the rules for visa applicants.",
      "A new tax-and-spending bill signed by Mr. Trump last month also subjects many travelers to the U.S. to a $250 \"visa integrity fee.\"",
      "Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, said the latest measures from the Trump administration will deter travel to the U.S. from foreign countries.",
      "\"Bonds on tourist and business visas will convince most foreigners not to bother coming,\" Nowrasteh said in a statement to CBS News. \"The result will be a decimated tourist industry. Tourists spend over $200 billion annually in the U.S., spending that counts as exports. The administration's proposal will not only undermine much of the tourist industry, but it will counteract the administration's goals to reduce the trade deficit. The Trump administration's talent is proposing and enacting the most punitive, expensive, and unnecessary migration restrictions imaginable.\"",
      "The State Department described the pilot program as a \"tool of diplomacy\" and said it will help inform future decisions regarding the potential use of visa bonds \"to address the national security and foreign policy priorities\" raised in Mr. Trump's executive order.",
      "\"The Pilot Program is further designed to serve as a diplomatic tool to encourage foreign governments to take all appropriate actions to ensure robust screening and vetting for all citizens in matters of identity verification and public safety, to create safeguards in [Citizenship by Investment] programs that provide citizenship without any residency in the country, and to encourage specified countries with visa overstays to ensure their nationals timely depart the United States after making temporary visits,\" according to the notice.",
      "Who may be included in the visa bond pilot program?",
      "The State Department did not say which countries with high overstay rates would trigger the visa bond requirement. But an August 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security found that in fiscal year 2023, there were more than 300,000 foreign nationals admitted for business or pleasure who were still in the U.S. after their authorized stay ended.",
      "The pilot program will focus on countries that have high visa overstay rates among those allowed into the U.S. for business or pleasure \u2014 through B-1 or B-2 visas, according to the notice. A B-1 visa is for those temporarily traveling to the U.S. for business activities. A B-2 visa is for foreign nationals who want to come to the U.S. temporarily for tourism or pleasure.",
      "Travelers entering the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program will not have to post a bond, according to the State Department's notice. That program allows residents of more than 40 countries to enter the U.S. for fewer than 90 days without a visa.",
      "While the countries subject to the program will be announced in the future, the list may also be modified on a rolling basis, the State Department said. The countries with the highest overstay rates for people with business and tourism visas in fiscal year 2023 were Chad, Laos, Haiti and Congo, according to the Department of Homeland Security's report.",
      "Only foreign nationals who are applying for B-1 or B-2 nonimmigrant visas, and who are from the countries identified by the State Department, may be required to post a bond of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 as a condition of receiving a visa. The bond can be canceled if the person meets certain criteria, including leaving the U.S. by the date their authorization expires, according to the terms of the program detailed in the notice.",
      "The new requirement for certain foreign nationals seeking to come to the U.S. for business or tourism could have negative consequences for cities that rely on travelers from abroad. A June report from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority found that Sin City experienced an 11% drop in visitation year-over-year, hosting nearly 3.5 million visitors in June 2024 and nearly 3.1 million this June.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Travel Association said the pilot program appears to effect roughly 2,000 applicants, most likely from a few countries with low travel volume to the U.S. But the group is more concerned with the $250 \"Visa Integrity Fee\" included in the tax-and-spending plan, the spokesperson said.",
      "\"If this fee is implemented, the U.S. will have one of, if not the highest, visitor visa fees in the world,\" the spokesperson said. \"If we are to maintain a competitive position in the global travel market, it's critical that U.S. visa policy reflects both national security priorities and the significant economic value of international visitation.\"",
      "David Bier, the Cato Institute's director of immigration studies, called the bond requirement \"draconian.\"",
      "\"Although we can't know for certain the scale of this rule because the administration isn't saying which countries it will apply to, the rule will add what is likely an insurmountable barrier to travel for many applicants who end up being targeted who are often family members of U.S. citizens,\" he said in a statement. \"Its argument that this will pressure governments to somehow force their visa holders to comply with the terms of their visas is incoherent, and it appears to be an admission that it will likely just ban people from coming, not just result in compliance. Most visa overstays leave after some time or end up qualifying for legal status in the United States another way. There is no reason to impose such a draconian rule.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Nancy Mace launched a campaign for South Carolina governor Monday after days of teasing the announcement.",
      "\"This morning, I'm making it official. I am running to be your governor of the great state of South Carolina,\" Mace said in an announcement Monday morning at The Citadel, a military college where she became the first woman to graduate from the Corps of Cadets program in 1999.",
      "Mace, 47, first came to Congress in 2021, and has gained recognition as a GOP firebrand in recent months after shifting positions in recent years.",
      "The South Carolina Republican made headlines for leading a GOP effort to restrict restroom use in the Capitol earlier this year after the first transgender person was elected to Congress. And she's regularly sparred with witnesses while serving on the House Oversight Committee, like at a hearing on immigration policies in March, where she accused Democratic mayors of having \"blood on your hands.\"",
      "Mace has previously taken more moderate positions, like urging her GOP colleagues not to go too far on abortion ahead of the 2022 midterms elections where Democrats defied expectations. And she criticized President Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, suggesting he didn't have a future in the party, before ultimately backing his 2024 presidential bid. In 2022, Mace overcame a primary challenge despite Mr. Trump's endorsement of her opponent.",
      "In 2023, Mace was among a group of eight Republicans who voted to oust former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, spurring a proxy fight with the former speaker in her 2024 primary.\u00a0 Mace ultimately defeated her McCarthy-backed challenger.",

    "summary": "More than a dozen states are seeking their own versions of Medicaid work requirements. But the incoming new federal standards pose new questions.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump signed a law adding work requirements for some Medicaid recipients, he may have undercut lawmakers in at least 14 states who were designing their own plans, according to health industry observers.",
      "Georgia is the only state with a work requirement in place for Medicaid, but several states have been pursuing such a policy for years, only to be blocked by courts or, most recently, the Biden administration. Some seek state-specific touches to the new rules. Others aim to implement work requirements before the federal law takes effect at the end of 2026.",
      "These states' moves and Mr. Trump's massive tax-and-spending law share one demand: To keep their Medicaid health coverage, adults who can work must prove they're logging a minimum number of hours at a job or school, or else qualify for one of the few exemptions.",
      "But now, states that jumped ahead need to ensure their proposals, which require federal approval, don't stray too far from Mr. Trump's law.",
      "\"The statute sets both the floor and ceiling\" for work requirements, said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor with George Washington University.",
      "South Dakota, for example, announced in July that it would not submit an application for work requirements as previously planned amid concerns that the state's laxer rules would not be allowed under the new federal law. The state's Department of Social Services secretary had warned that working on a state proposal while the federal rules are being hashed out could be \"an exercise in futility.\"",
      "Arkansas' plan, on the other hand, is more stringent than the federal law. There are no exemptions to its work requirements in the application, which is pending with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "Arizona's proposal also includes something that's not in the federal law: a ban on \"able-bodied adults\" receiving Medicaid benefits for longer than five years total in their lives.",
      "Arkansas and Arizona government officials said they were working with federal officials to square their plans with the new standards.",
      "Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the department is analyzing how the new federal standards interact with state waivers.",
      "The federal health department must release rules by next June that outline how states are to implement work requirements, according to Elizabeth Hinton, who has been tracking such waivers as part of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "\"We don't exactly know what that will cover,\" Hinton said.",
      "It's unclear how federal officials will respond to the states' requests, she added, but \"we are aware that some folks think there is no wiggle room here.\"",
      "States can tweak their Medicaid programs through what are known as demonstration waivers, which are subject to federal approval. The waivers are designed to test new ideas in policy gray areas.",
      "The states that have filed or plan to file such applications with work requirements include Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Utah.",
      "Congressional Republicans who passed the budget reconciliation bill left room for states to use waivers to fast-track the national standards. Tara Sklar, a professor leading the University of Arizona's Health Law & Policy Program, said she expects states seeking certain stricter requirements to have a chance of approval, while more lenient ones may face denials.",
      "Federal officials may look favorably on Arizona's plan, Sklar said, as a five-year lifetime Medicaid limit is different from work requirements. Even if the federal government greenlights stricter work requirements than the federal law calls for, those programs are likely to face legal challenges, she added.",
      "The federal law includes an 80-hour-per-month minimum for work or education, with exemptions for certain adults, including people who are medically frail and parents with young, dependent children.",
      "Montana is the first state to draft a waiver application since Congress finalized national work requirements. State lawmakers first approved work requirements \u2014 called \"community engagement\" standards under the state plan \u2014 in 2019, but the state's application stalled through the end of the first Trump term and the Biden administration.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected again, Montana lawmakers lifted the 2025 expiration date of its Medicaid expansion program, making permanent the program that covered more than 76,000 adults in April, with the expectation that the Trump administration would approve work requirements. In mid-July, state officials released their draft plan to make that a reality \"as soon as is practicable.\"",
      "The Montana plan largely aligns with the federal law, but it would create additional exemptions, including for people who are homeless or fleeing domestic violence.",
      "Republican state Sen. Gayle Lammers said work requirements that also protect such people who need Medicaid were a big part of persuading legislators to keep the expansion program. At the time, officials didn't know where the federal government would land on work requirements. And now, Lammers said, it makes sense for Montana to stick to its plan.",
      "\"The state should have a say,\" Lammers said. \"We're very independent, and everyone is different.\"",
      "In South Carolina, state officials are seeking to roll out work requirements for a limited number of newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. South Carolina is one of 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, and yet the state submitted a request with the federal government in June for a partial Medicaid expansion that includes a work requirement component that largely reflects the new federal standards.",
      "In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, called South Carolina's proposal \"a state-specific solution.\"",
      "The only state with an active work requirement program now wants to scale it back and awaits federal approval to do so. \"Georgia Pathways to Coverage\" expires at the end of September unless CMS greenlights an extension of the program with a key change: requiring enrollees to document once a year that they're working, not monthly. That's a pivot away from the program's initial design but also differs from the new federal rules, which call for checks every six months.",
      "Fiona Roberts, a spokesperson for Georgia's Medicaid agency, said the state is still waiting to hear whether it needs to alter its plan.",

There are trade ministers who, who want to talk more and see how they can work in a different way with the United States, but I think that we have, we're seeing truly the contours of the president's tariff plan right now with these rates.\"",
      "Hours ahead of the Trump administration's self-imposed deadline for baseline tariffs on Friday, the White House announced tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. All imports will have a 10% tariff rate as of Aug. 7, according to the executive order.",
      "When asked if Mr. Trump will be negotiating the tariff rate down in coming days, Greer answered, \"I don't think they will be,\" but he added these tariff rates are \"set rates pursuant to deals.\"",
      "\"When the president is looking at this, he looks at potential deals, and we bring him potential concessions from countries and the things they might want to do,\" Greer said. \"And he compares that to the potential tariff that might be applied to try to get that deficit down. And then talking to his advisors, he makes a call on this.\"",
      "Ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline, the Trump administration touted a number of deals for tariffs, including South Korea, the European Union and Britain. But other major U.S. trading partners did not reach deals, including Canada, which Mr. Trump levied a 35% tariff on goods not subject the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Canada is the U.S.' second-largest trading partner.",
      "\"The President's view with with every country, whether it's Canada or Mexico, and regardless of the kind of trade agreement we have in place, is that the net result of the trading system, whether it's our WTO agreements or our existing trade agreements, the net result has been that a lot of the manufacturing has gone overseas, and when that's the net result, you can't continue with that system,\" Greer said.",
      "\"So you know, I'm not concerned that it's going to complicate things with Canada. Our view is the President is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it. And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have,\" the trade adviser said.",
      "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who Brennan interviewed separately on \"Face the Nation,\" said that Bank of America economists have predicted that while the economy will still continue to grow, they are predicting \"less growth than they would have had six, nine months ago, and reflects the impact of the tariff war and the trade and all that.\"",
      "As for the economic impact that tariffs will have on the economy, Moynihan said \"no one really knows, honestly, because this is a different regime than we've been in before.\"",

His campaign advisers circulate copies of a political advocacy group's endorsement. Crosswell talks about knocking on doors and meeting voters, one of whom Crosswell said is \"struggling and may need to sell her house.\"",
      "But, unlike many congressional candidates, Crosswell has no campaign experience and has never worked in politics.",
      "He's one of several former Justice Department attorneys and officials seeking public office after resigning from an agency they say has been contaminated by politics.",
      "Among the wave of resignations and firings of Justice Department prosecutors, administrators and career staffers who have resigned or been fired in the first six months of President Trump's second term, some want to resume public service, and now they're exploring different avenues to achieve that.",
      "Crosswell, a longtime federal prosecutor, resigned from the Justice Department on Feb. 17, in protest of the controversial department decision to drop the criminal corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams and a purge of the agency's public integrity division.",
      "He has criticized the Justice Department's reductions in its anti-corruption offices.",
      "\"What the administration has done is removed one of the most important guardrails against corruption within the government at all levels: state, local and federal,\" Croswell told CBS News. \"We're now moving into an area where prosecutions would be determined by political loyalty,\" he said.",
      "Crosswell's race is also uniquely important. He's running for the Democratic nomination in one of the most competitive and high-impact House races in the country, Pennsylvania's 7th District, which flipped from Democratic to Republican in 2024. Crosswell has already raised more than $300,000 since announcing his candidacy in June, while the incumbent Republican, Rep. Ryan MacKenzie, has raised over $1.4 million this year.",
      "It's a big change for a longtime career prosecutor, who just months ago was credited by the Justice Department with helping secure the conviction of a former New Mexico state political candidate who'd gone on a shooting spree that targeted the homes of four elected officials.",

      "She's the granddaughter of civil rights figure Lee Evans, who was among the 1968 Olympics track stars who raised a fist in the air during a medal presentation. Evans told CBS News the Trump administration's dismantling of the Justice Department's Civil Rights division was among her motivations for leaving.",
      "\"We received emails requiring that we report any colleagues doing diversity work in the office. We had 10 to 14 days to report them or we would get in trouble ourselves,\" Evans said. \"That was pretty disgusting.\" She said she didn't feel safe at the agency, in part because she was the co-chair of a diversity effort.",
      "In a campaign video, Evans pledged to challenge Mr. Trump: \"With your vote, I'll take on Trump and demand the community safety we deserve.\" And her campaign materials also promote Evans' work on civil rights issues.",
      "\"I have only worked in public service my entire career. That's the reason why I became a lawyer \u2014 to represent and serve my community,\" Evans said. \"When I realized that that was not going to be possible any longer with the values that the Trump administration was having for the department, I knew I needed to shift.\"",
      "She said her public criticism of the recent changes in the Justice Department is resonating with voters.",
      "\"We've spoken with thousands of voters and we have been knocking on thousands of doors,\" she said. \"It's been really comforting to hear from our voters who say 'You are so brave to step out and speak out against this.'\"",

      "\"It really weighed on my heart\"",
      "Hetal Doshi rose through the ranks of the Justice Department over more than a decade of service, including as deputy assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division. She left in January, when Mr. Trump was sworn in, and is now seeking her first elected office as a candidate in next year's election for Colorado attorney general.",
      "Doshi told CBS News the recent changes at the agency \"really weighed on my heart and on my mind.\"",
      "\"State attorneys general are more important than ever before, in filling an enforcement vacuum,\" she said. \"That's why I made the decision to run for office.\"",
      "\"I faced a lot of complicated feelings about my exit,\" Doshi said, \"and that complexity was coming from the fact that I loved what I did on behalf of the American people so much.\"",
      "Despite her lack of campaign experience, Doshi touted robust early fundraising and a statewide campaign infrastructure as she pursues the Democratic nomination for the post. Doshi's campaign materials, including an introductory video, emphasize she's a first-generation American from a working-class family.",
      "Her campaign website includes a video in which Doshi takes aim at Mr. Trump, saying, \"The rule of law is under attack by Donald Trump and politicians who have abandoned patriotism.\" The video includes images of U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Trump surrogate Jeanine Pirro, who was just confirmed as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.",
      "\"It's hard to watch the dismantling of the norms and traditions of the Department of Justice,\" Doshi said in a phone interview with CBS News.",
      "The Justice Department declined a request to comment on Doshi, Crosswell or Evans and their criticism of recent agency changes.",
      "Doshi's campaign lists several of her Justice Department accomplishments and promotes her record. Her campaign materials highlight her federal case work in challenging an airline merger, big tech mergers, concert ticket pricing and a case she said would have impacted grocery prices.",
      "\"I feel much more comfortable in a courtroom than any other place,\" Doshi admitted, but she says campaigning is a form of public advocacy that mirrors her work as a government attorney.",
      "\"It's normally pretty rare for career DOJ attorneys to run for office. They actively steer clear of partisanship at the department,\" said Stacey Young, a former Justice Department attorney who leads the Justice Connection, a networking organization to help former Justice Department employees who have resigned or been fired.",

      "Salgado told CBS News he decided to leave before the expected shakeup inside the Justice Department.",
      "\"I was just reading tea leaves on the type of people that had been close to Mr. Trump, and the people who would eventually come to run the Department of Justice,\" he said. \"I handicapped it at 90% that within the near future of January 20, the Public Integrity section will be dismantled.\"",
      "There were a series of ousters in the agency's public integrity section within the first two months of the Trump administration.",
      "Salgado enjoyed a storied career at the Justice Department, including an agency award for his work on a major cryptocurrency investigation, which led to a CEO's guilty plea in 2023. The department also credited Salgado with \"substantial contributions\" to the successful prosecution of former Rep. George Santos, a New York Republican who was expelled from Congress, pleaded guilty to fraud and began serving a prison sentence last month.",
      "Salgado said he emphasized his Justice Department work during his brief campaign, and as he met with voters and made campaign stops, he referenced the controversies involving the Trump's administration's use of law enforcement in immigration enforcement.",

      "\"We believe there's a great deal of common ground between the United States and Canada in terms of building two strong economies that work well together,\" LeBlanc said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The White House announced last week that duties would jump from 25% to 35% on Canadian goods not covered under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, claiming that the U.S.' second-largest trading partner hasn't done enough to address immigration and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. LeBlanc said that while \"we were obviously disappointed by that decision,\" negotiators would \"continue to do the work.\"",
      "LeBlanc said his team left with \"a better understanding of the American concerns in the trading relationship\" and characterizing the meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as \"constructive, cordial conversations.\"",
      "\"We're encouraged by the conversations with Secretary Lutnick and Ambassador Greer, but we're not yet where we need to go to get the deal that's in the best interest of the two economies,\" LeBlanc said.",
      "Mr. Trump announced higher tariffs against more than 60 U.S. trading partners late last week. But Canada is the largest American trading partner included, being the world's largest buyer of American goods and the third-largest seller of goods to the U.S. last year, according to\u00a0Census Bureau\u00a0data. The country bought some $350 billion worth of American goods and sold $412 billion to the U.S. market in 2024.",
      "In an interview for \"Face the Nation\" on Friday, Greer cited Canada's retaliatory tariffs imposed earlier this year under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for the increase, saying, \"if the president's going to take an action and the Canadians retaliate, the United States needs to maintain the integrity of our action, the effectiveness, so we have to go up too.\"",
      "\"Our view is the president is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it,\" Greer said. \"And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have.\"",

Mr. Trump reacted by firing Commissioner of Labor Statistics Erika McEntarfer, claiming \u2014 without evidence \u2014 Friday's jobs numbers were \"RIGGED.\"",
      "\"You know, even last year during the campaign, there were enormous swings in the jobs numbers, and so it sounds to me like the president has real concerns,\" Greer told CBS News, adding that Mr. Trump's issues with government labor data extend beyond Friday's report.",
      "\"You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways,\" said Greer.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics' reports are based on surveys of households and businesses. It's common for the agency to revise prior months' figures up or down as more data comes in. The May and June revisions \u2014 which cut the number of new jobs by a combined 258,000 \u2014 were the largest downward change in employment figures since 1979, excluding pandemic-era jobs reports, though that doesn't mean the data was manipulated, as Mr. Trump claims.",

      "Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars \u2014 often known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak's first five years.",
      "\"It's really quite gruesome,\" said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \"puffy arms sticking straight out,\" she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \"then their arms actually fall off.\"",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \"solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Sea stars typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "\"Symptoms of sea star wasting syndrome include abnormally twisted arms, white lesions, deflation of arms and body, arm loss, and body disintegration,\" the National Park Service says. \"They die over the course of days or weeks.\"",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",
      "\"It's incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,\" said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was \"really smart and significant.\"",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the sunflower sea star as critically endangered.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "The study notes that Vibrio bacteria have been called \"the microbial barometer of climate change\" because the species are more prevalent in warming water temperatures. The authors say an important next phase of research will be to work on better understanding the relationship between rising seawater temperatures and sea star wasting disease.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \"look sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\" said Gehman. \"They're voracious eaters.\"",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2014 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",
      "Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations \u2014 and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to \"the rainforests of the ocean.\""

    "summary": "The origin of potatoes has puzzled scientists for years, but researchers now say they've found an unlikely ancestor: tomatoes.",
    "story": [
      "Meet the potato's unexpected ancestor: the tomato.",
      "That's right, a fruit. Potatoes and tomatoes don't look alike, smell alike or taste alike, but in a study published Thursday in the journal Cell, scientists said that the potato evolved from a tomato ancestor around 9 million years ago.",
      "\"We've finally solved the mystery of where potatoes came from,\" corresponding author Sanwen Huang of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences said in a news release.",
      "The origin of the modern potato has puzzled scientists for years. In terms of appearance, potatoes resemble a species from Chile called Etuberosum, with one crucial difference: Etuberosum don't produce the starch-rich tubers. That's where the tomato comes in.",
      "While tomatoes don't have tubers, the ancient tomato did provide a crucial gene that, when mixed with the genetics of Etuberosum, told the modern potato to form tubers, according to the researchers. The SP6A gene from the tomato parent tells the potato plant to make tubers, while the IT1 gene from Etuberosum assists in controlling the growth of the underground stems that form tubers. Both pieces were needed to create the potato that's known and loved today.",
      "\"Our findings show how a hybridization event between species can spark the evolution of new traits, allowing even more species to emerge,\" Huang said.",
      "The research team analyzed 450 genomes from cultivated potatoes and 56 of the wild potato species during the study.",
      "\"Wild potatoes are very difficult to sample, so this dataset represents the most comprehensive collection of wild potato genomic data ever analyzed,\" said the paper's first author, Zhiyang Zhang of the Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen.",
      "Outside of the ancestry, there's also a linguistic similarity, according to Merriam-Webster.",
      "\"The word 'tomato' started out as 'tomate' and came from the Nahuatl word 'tomatl.' Since the potato had been introduced to the English some decades earlier, the word evolved to mimic the form of 'potato' \u2014 hence the spelling 'tomato,'\" the dictionary notes.",

    "story": [
      "An 8.8-magnitude earthquake, one of the strongest ever recorded, struck Russia's Far East early Wednesday, prompting tsunami warnings in coastal towns in multiple countries.",
      "The earthquake was \"on what we call the Pacific Ring of Fire. This is a region around the entire Pacific Rim renowned for significant earthquakes,\" Simon Boxall, lecturer in oceanography at the University of Southampton, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Earth is made up of these sort of geology plates, these geophysical plates, and the Earth where these plates rub, where they sort of join, we get stresses building up, and then every so often we get a sudden release of pressure and part of the seabed flips up,\" Boxall said. \"And so it's that flip that causes the tsunami. And not all flips, not all earthquakes will generate these.\"",
      "Boxal said the tsunami generated by this earthquake was \"not huge. It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground.\"",
      "Two magnitude 9.1 earthquakes - the Tohoku earthquake in 2011 in Japan and the 2004 Sumatra earthquake in Indonesia - caused massive tsunamis that killed thousands of people.",
      "Earthquake scientist Grace Sethanant said there was a reason those temblors caused much more devastating tsunamis than Wednesday's quake.",
      "While a magnitude 9.1 quake \"might seem not so far off from the magnitude 8.8 \u2026 in terms of energy, it's three times stronger,\" Sethanant said.",
      "\"Imagine the 8.8 is, as I drop a rock in the lake, and you see the ripples. That's the energy,\" Sethanant said. \"Imagine you have that rock like three times bigger. So, in terms of the earthquake movement magnitude, the energy of the 2011 and 2004 earthquakes in Sumatra and in Japan, it's actually three to four times bigger. ... And that's why the tsunamis in those events were much more devastating.\"",
      "National Tsunami Warning Center  Tsunami Warning Coordinator Dave Snider said tsunamis should be thought of more as \"ocean floods\" than waves.",
      "\"The most important thing to understand about a tsunami is this is not a surf wave, it's not a wind wave,\" Snider said. \"A tsunami is the entire ocean column that is being lifted above that high tide level there because of that extreme movement of the Earth's crust with the earthquake there, so this is a significant planetary event that we've just witnessed.\"",

      "A SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule homed in on the International Space Station early Saturday and glided in for a problem-free docking \u2014 delivering two NASA astronauts, a Russian cosmonaut and a Japanese flier \u2014 to the outpost after a 16-hour rendezvous.",
      "Catching up from behind and below, the Crew 11 Dragon Endeavour looped up ahead of the lab complex, then to a point directly above the outpost before slowly moving straight in for a linkup at the space-facing port of the forward Harmony module at 2:27 a.m. ET as the two spacecraft orbited 264 miles above the south Pacific Ocean.",
      "Hooks and latches then engaged, pulling the Crew Dragon's nose firmly into the docking mechanism, which locked the craft in place. Umbilicals automatically connected and flight controllers began a series of leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal.",
      "\"Endeavour, welcome to the International Space Station,\" called NASA astronaut Jonny Kim from inside the ISS. \"Zena, Mike, Kimi and Oleg, we have cold drinks, hot food and hugs waiting. See you soon.\"",
      "\"Hello space station, Crew 11 is here!\" Endeavour pilot Mike Fincke, a three-flight veteran, enthusiastically replied. \"And we are super excited to join Expedition 73. We will do our best to also be good stewards of our beautiful ISS during our stay. The ISS has been inhabited and crewed for almost 25 years. We look forward to celebrating with you.\"",
      "Nearly three hours later, after doffing their spacesuits and configuring their capsule for docked operations, Fincke, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, making her first flight, Japanese veteran Kimiya Yui and rookie cosmonaut Oleg Platonov floated through the forward hatch to be welcomed aboard by the space station's seven-member crew.",
      "\"We are so happy to see your smiling faces,\" said ISS commander Takuya Onishi. \"Zena, Oleg, congratulations on your first spaceflight. We are looking forward to hearing your impressions and your feelings about that. Mike and Kimiya, welcome back. Your experience will be an invaluable asset for Expedition 73.\"",
      "Cardman was bumped from a Crew Dragon flight last year to help NASA bring two Starliner astronauts back to Earth after problems prevented them from coming home on their own spacecraft. She was clearly thrilled to finally be aboard the space station.",
      "\"This has been the absolute journey of a lifetime,\" she said with a broad smile. \"We are so incredibly grateful to be here. Thank you so much for this warm welcome. It was such an unbelievably beautiful sight to see the space station come into our view for the first time, especially with these wonderful crewmates.\"",
      "With the arrival of Crew 11, four of the station's crew members \u2014 Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov \u2014 will be clear to undock and return to Earth next Wednesday to close out a 145-day mission.",
      "The other three \u2014 Kim and Soyuz MS-27/73S crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky \u2014 will remain aboard with Cardman and company to continue Expedition 73.",
      "Until now, long-duration crews, U.S. and Russian, have typically spent around six months in orbit. But starting with the Soyuz MS-27/73S mission, the Russians have switched to eight-month stays. NASA may follow suit with Crew 11.",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal 2026 would reduce NASA funding by nearly 25% while directing the agency to scale back work aboard the ISS in favor of more aggressive planning for eventual crewed missions to Mars.",
      "NASA managers are now considering lengthening crew stays and possibly reducing Dragon crews from four to three. A reduced crew would need fewer resupply missions, saving additional money.",
      "No final decisions have been made. But NASA is assessing the possibility of extending Crew 11's stay in space from six to eight months, depending on the actual funding outlook.",
      "\"I can't wait to be in space, and two extra months would be a gift,\" Cardman said before launch. \"Yes, we're baselined for six months right now, with the ability to extend that pending further analysis. For me, it would be an absolute privilege to stay for even longer.\"",

      "The Falcon 9 lifted off at 11:43 a.m. EDT from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, as mission control kept a close eye on clouds rolling into the area shortly before launch time.",
      "With commander Zena Cardman and co-pilot Mike Fincke monitoring cockpit displays, flanked on the left by Japanese Astronaut Kimiya Yui and on the right by cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, the Crew Dragon capsule began its climb. Nine minutes later, they reached orbit and set off after the International Space Station.",
      "\"I have no emotions but joy right now. That was absolutely transcendent, the ride of a lifetime,\" radioed Cardman, making her first flight. \"Thank you, this has been an incredible honor.\"",
      "Added Fincke, a three-flight veteran: \"Boy, it's great to be back in orbit again! Thank you to SpaceX and NASA to get us here. What a ride!\"",
      "The crew\u00a0originally hoped to take off Thursday, but clouds built up over the launch site and SpaceX called off the countdown just 67 seconds before liftoff. Weather remained a concern the second time around, but in the end conditions were \"go\" for launch.",
      "Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, the Falcon 9's first stage engines shut down, the stage dropped away and the flight to orbit continued on the power of the single Merlin engine powering the Falcon 9's second stage.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, flipped around and reversed course, flying itself back to a picture-perfect touchdown on a landing pad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, chalking up SpaceX's 65th Florida landing and its 484th successful booster recovery overall.",
      "One minute after landing, the second stage engine shut down and the Crew Dragon Endeavour was released to fly on its own.",
      "Had the crew launched Thursday, it would have taken them nearly 40 hours to catch up with the space station. With a launch Friday, the trip was expected to take just 16 hours, setting up a docking at the forward Harmony module's space-facing port at 3 a.m. Saturday \u2014 the same time they would have docked had they launched Thursday.",
      "For Cardman, the trip to space finally fulfills a dream she had hoped to accomplish last year when she came within a month or so of launching to the space station as commander of an earlier Crew Dragon flight.",
      "But she and Crew 9 crewmate Stephanie Wilson were bumped from the flight to free up two seats to bring Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams back to Earth after an extended stay in space.",
      "Wilmore and Williams flew to the orbital lab complex in June 2024 in the first piloted flight of a Starliner. But their stay in space was extended because of Starliner propulsion system problems. NASA managers eventually opted to bring them down earlier this year aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, using the seats given up by Cardman and Wilson.",
      "Wilson has not yet been assigned another flight, but Cardman was tapped to command of Crew 11.",
      "\"If I think about it only as an individual, and how it affected me, yes, of course, it was an unexpected change,\" she said. \"But space flight is not about me or about any individual. It's about what we can do together. None of us can do this by ourselves.",
      "\"Now I have the opportunity to train with this wonderful, amazing crew. Life is a journey. It takes many turns, and I'm just grateful to be here.\"",
      "Fincke is a 58-year-old three-flight veteran who trained to fly aboard Boeing's Starliner as did Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui. In the wake of the problems encountered last year during the Starliner test flight, both ended up assigned to Crew 11.",
      "Platonov, making his first flight, was assigned to Crew 11 as part of a joint U.S.-Russian seat-swap program. The arrangement is intended to ensure at least one representative of each country is always on board the ISS even if one crew ferry ship has to depart in an emergency, taking all of its crew members with it.",
      "Platonov is the seventh cosmonaut to fly aboard a Crew Dragon under the agreement.",
      "A long-awaited mission aboard the space station",
      "Crew 11 will be welcomed aboard the space station by by Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese station commander Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, who were launched to the station on March 14. Also on hand: Soyuz MS-27/73S cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky along with NASA's Jonny Kim, launched from Kazakhstan on April 8.",
      "Clothing and personal items for Cardman are already on board, launched last year before her expected Crew 9 flight. Included in those personal items were birthday cards, including one from her father, a physicist, who passed away last August just before NASA bumped Cardman from Crew 9.",
      "She will celebrate her next birthday, her 38th, in October.",
      "\"My parents knew that I would be on the space station for my birthday last year, we thought, so they sent a few items in advance so that I could feel at home while I was up there. And now I'll have the chance to see them,\" Cardman told CBS News.",
      "\"My whole history, the people who have brought me to where I am today, I think it's going to feel really special to feel that connection to my dad, to my parents on my birthday in space.\"",
      "Cardman and her crewmates are replacing the Crew 10 fliers, who plan to undock Aug. 6, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the southern California coast to close out a 145-day mission. Highlights included a spacewalk by McClain and Ayers and a non-stop schedule of research and station maintenance.",
      "\"I'm kind of looking forward to doing nothing for a couple of days,\" McClain joked when asked what she looked forward to the most about returning to Earth. Onishi said he was looking forward to seeing his family again, \"and also taking a hot shower on the ground!\"",
      "Added Ayers, who said she'll miss the opportunity to photograph Earth from the vantage point of space: \"In addition to what Anne and Tak said, I'm actually looking forward to a big, juicy burger on the beach.\"",
      "NASA plans to retire the space station in 2030, using a custom spacecraft being designed by SpaceX to drive the 930,000-pound football-field-size lab out of orbit, making sure it breaks up in the atmosphere over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from any populated areas.",
      "As one might expect of a decades old spacecraft of the size and complexity of the International Space Station, the vehicle is showing signs of wear and tear. One of the more concerning issues is a small-but-persistent leak in a compartment between the Russian Zvezda module and its aft docking port.",
      "The leak was discovered in 2019. The Russians believe its related to metal fatigue. NASA managers think it's more complicated than that. In any case, cosmonauts aboard the station have made multiple attempts to plug the leaks, but they have persisted.",
      "Earlier this summer, NASA held up the launch of the Axiom 4 flight to the space station due to indications a hatch used to seal off the leaking compartment was also leaking. They now have confirmed the hatch can, in fact, be sealed when needed to protect the integrity of the station's primary air supply.",
      "\"The rest of the station is leak tight,\" said Bill Spetch, NASA's ISS integration operations manager. \"We continuously monitor that, and everything else shows that we are really tight on our leak rate on the rest of ISS, no evidence of any other cracks or any other places.\"",

      "\"Our focus here is to really get to this particular launch, to make sure that we have everything cleared for six flights, and then down the road, we may have a little bit more work to do depending on the specific vehicle and how many flights it is.",
      "\"The overall goal was 15 flights, and we've gotten there on many components. Now we're just down to a handful that really are there (confirmed good) for only six flights.\"",
      "Catching up with the space station",
      "It will take the Crew Dragon 16 hours to catch up with the station early Saturday. After passing about 1,200 feet directly below the outpost, Endeavour will loop up, cross in front of the lab and then on up to a point directly above the forward Harmony module's space-facing port. From there, it will move straight down for docking.",
      "The crew will be welcomed aboard by Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese station commander Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, who were launched to the station on March 14. Also on hand will be Soyuz MS-27/73S cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky along with NASA's Jonny Kim, launched from Kazakhstan on April 8.",
      "Also on board: clothing and personal items for Cardman that were launched last year before her expected Crew 9 flight. Included in those personal items were birthday cards, including one from her father, a physicist, who passed away last August just before NASA bumped Cardman from Crew 9.",
      "She will celebrate her next birthday, turning 38, in October.",
      "\"My parents knew that I would be on the space station for my birthday last year, we thought, so they sent a few items in advance so that I could feel at home while I was up there. And now I'll have the chance to see them,\" Cardman told CBS News.",
      "\"My whole history, the people who have brought me to where I am today, I think it's going to feel really special to feel that connection to my dad, to my parents on my birthday in space.\"",
      "Cardman and her crewmates are replacing the Crew 10 fliers, who plan to undock around Aug. 6, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the southern California coast to close out a 145-day mission. Highlights included a spacewalk by McClain and Ayers and a non-stop schedule of research and station maintenance.",
      "\"I'm kind of looking forward to doing nothing for a couple of days,\" McClain joked when asked what she looked forward to the most about returning to Earth. Onishi said he was looking forward to seeing his family again, \"and also taking a hot shower on the ground!\"",
      "Added Ayers, who said she'll miss the opportunity to photograph Earth from the vantage point of space: \"In addition to what Anne and Tak said, I'm actually looking forward to a big, juicy burger on the beach.\"",
      "Planning for months in orbit",
      "It's not yet known how long Crew 11 will be on board the space station.",
      "Up to this point, long-duration crews, U.S. and Russian, have typically spent around six months in orbit. But starting with the Soyuz MS-27/73S mission, the Russians have switched to eight-month stays. NASA may follow suit starting with the Crew 12 mission next year.",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal 2026 would reduce NASA funding by nearly 25 percent while directing the agency to scale back work aboard the ISS in favor of more aggressive planning for eventual crewed missions to Mars.",
      "NASA managers are now considering lengthening crew stays and possibly reducing Dragon crews from four to three and perhaps just two, one American and one Russian. A reduced crew would need fewer resupply missions, saving additional money. But it would sharply reduce the amount of research that could be carried out.",
      "No final decisions have been made.",
      "\"When we launch ... we have a six-month mission duration that we baseline,\" said Stich. \"We can extend the mission in real time as needed as we better understand the reconciliation bill and the appropriations process and what that means relative to the overall station manifest.\"",
      "For her part, Cardman said she would welcome an additional two months in orbit.",
      "\"I can't wait to be in space, and two extra months would be a gift,\" she said. \"Yes, we're baselined for six months right now, with the ability to extend that pending further analysis. For me, it would be an absolute privilege to stay for even longer.\"",

      "In July alone, rising adoption of generative AI technology by private employers accounted for more than 10,000 job cuts, according to a report released this week by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The outplacement firm lists AI as one of the top five factors contributing to job losses in 2025.",
      "Layoffs have jumped this year, adding to fresh concerns about a pullback in hiring after new labor data on Friday showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 well short of analyst forecasts. Through July, companies have announced more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts, the highest number for that period since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Of those layoffs, the technology industry wielded the sharpest axe \u2014 private companies in the sector have announced more than 89,000 job cuts, up 36% from a year ago. Since 2023, more than 27,000 job cuts have been directly tied to the advent of AI, according to the firm.",
      "\"The industry is being reshaped by the advancement of artificial intelligence and ongoing uncertainty surrounding work visas, which have contributed to workforce reductions,\" Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The impact of AI on hiring is perhaps most visible among younger workers. Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to recent college graduates have declined 15%\u00a0over the past year, according to Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z employees. Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, the firm found.",
      "While AI is already starting to reshape how Americans work, for now other factors are having a more immediate impact on the labor market. More than 292,000 positions have been eliminated this year due to cuts linked to the Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), an initiative to reduce federal spending spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk, Challenger, Gray & Christmas found.",
      "\"We are seeing the federal budget cuts implemented by DOGE impact non-profits and health care in addition to the government,\" Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",
      "Layoffs are also accelerating in the vast retail sector as tariffs raise the cost of doing business, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Retailers have announced more than 80,000 cuts through July, up nearly 250% compared to the same period last year, the firm found.",
      "\"Retailers are being impacted by tariffs, inflation and ongoing economic uncertainty causing layoffs and store closures. Further declines in consumer spending could trigger additional losses,\" the group said.",

      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",

      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",

      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",

      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 20:18:39 -0400",
    "summary": "Texas Democrats fled the state Sunday, aiming to delay a plan to redraw the state's congressional map and give the GOP a bigger edge \u2014 an idea blessed by President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Dozens of Democratic state legislators fled Texas over the weekend, denying a quorum on Monday to Republicans hoping to vote on a new congressional map that heavily favors the GOP even more than its current districts.",
      "Texas Republicans have responded by floating civil arrest warrants if their Democratic colleagues don't return to the state and threatening to have the missing lawmakers removed from office altogether. Democratic legislators have remained defiant, and have encouraged states led by Democrats to respond by redrawing their congressional maps \u2014 setting up a national standoff over redistricting.",
      "\"Greg Abbott has answered the call of Donald Trump, and he's holding this special session hostage to try to pass a mid-district, mid-session redistricting to try to steal five congressional seats away from the Texas people,\" state Rep. John Bucy, the top Democrat on the Texas House's elections committee, said of the Texas governor.",
      "\"That's unacceptable, and that's why we're here to fight back,\" said Bucy, who spoke to CBS News in a Monday interview from Illinois, one of several blue states currently hosting the Texas Democrats.",
      "Shortly after attempting to convene on Monday, House Republicans voted to approve a motion for the Texas House sergeant-at-arms to secure the attendance of all absent lawmakers, \"under warrant of arrest if necessary.\"",
      "\"Leaving the state does not stop this House from doing its work. It only delays it,\" Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows, a Republican, said in a brief speech Monday afternoon.",
      "He told Democratic lawmakers, \"If you choose to continue down this road, you should know there will be consequences.\"",
      "Before the House met on Monday, Abbott also said he would seek to \"remove the missing Democrats from membership in the Texas House,\" invoking a 2021 legal opinion from Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton that suggested a court could determine that a legislator had forfeited his or her office.",
      "\"The absconded Democrat House members were elected to meet and vote on legislation\u2014not to prevent votes that may not go their way,\" Abbott said.",
      "Texas House Democrats responded with a four-word statement: \"Come and take it,\" a reference to a statement of defiance on an old Texas battle flag.",
      "Democrats protest GOP-dominated Texas congressional map",
      "Republicans unveiled the new congressional maps\u00a0last week as part of a mid-decade redistricting in an attempt to protect the GOP's razor-thin U.S. House majority. President Trump said in July that he believes Republicans could win five more seats in Texas with different districts.",
      "Abbott included redistricting to be addressed in a special legislative session, along with other high-profile topics like approving disaster relief for the deadly Texas floods and a THC ban.",
      "Democratic lawmakers announced Sunday evening they would leave the state to hold up the special session. \"We will not allow disaster relief to be held hostage to a Trump gerrymander. As of today, this corrupt special session is over,\" Texas House Democrats said in a statement.",
      "\"For weeks, we've been warning that if Republicans in Texas want a showdown \u2014 if they want to delay flood relief to cravenly protect Donald Trump from an inevitable midterm meltdown \u2014 then we'd give them that showdown,\" Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said in a statement, accusing Mr. Trump and Republicans of \"rigging the system\" and \"scheming to hold onto power.\"",
      "Both houses of the Texas legislature are controlled by Republicans, but if most Democratic lawmakers leave the state, they could deny the state House and Senate the two-thirds quorum that they need to vote on the new congressional maps.",
      "At least 51 Texas Democrats have fled the state for Chicago. Politico was first to report the lawmakers had left the state.",
      "\"We're not here to have fun. We're not here because this is easy, and we did make a decision to come here today \u2014 we did not make a decision lightly,\" Texas House Minority Leader Gene Wu said after arriving in Illinois. \"But we come here today with absolute moral clarity that this is absolutely the right thing to do to protect the people of the state of Texas.\"",
      "Republicans in Texas currently hold 25 of the state's 38 congressional seats. The party hopes the new maps could bring that number up to 30, and all of those new 30 seats were won by Mr. Trump in November by at least 10 points.",
      "The five seats come from redrawing Rio Grande Valley districts \u2014 where Mr. Trump has made gains in what were once Democratic strongholds \u2014 and combining Reps. Lloyd Doggett and Greg Cesar's districts in Austin. In North Texas, Rep. Julie Johnson's suburban 32nd District would be reshaped to stretch from the Dallas area to rural Republican strongholds, and Rep. Marc Veasey would be moved out of Tarrant County entirely, which would leave only a small portion of the county represented by a Democrat. All four Houston-area seats were redrawn, with Rep. Al Green's being the most dramatic.",
      "\"They're turning our districts into crazy shapes to guarantee the outcome they want in the 2026 election,\" Democratic state Rep. James Talarico said in a message\u00a0posted to social media. \"If this power grab succeeds, they will hang on to power without any accountability from the voters.\"",
      "Wu said Texas Republicans are \"using is a racist, gerrymandered map, a map that seeks to use racial lines to divide hard working communities who have spent decades building up their power and strengthening their voices, and Governor Abbott is doing this in submission to Donald Trump.\"",
      "Democrats have fought back against the new districts, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries traveling to Austin on Thursday to pledge national support.",
      "\"We are not fighting for the Democratic Party, we are fighting for the democratic process, and the stakes could not be higher. We have to take a stand,\" Talarico added.",
      "Martin said in an appearance Sunday on MSNBC, \"I'm proud of the Texas Dems for actually breaking quorum here. Our democracy is literally under assault by Donald Trump, Greg Abbott and the Republicans, who know that they are on a track to lose the House majority next year. So what do they do? They cheat. They rigged the system. That's all they have left.\"",
      "\"We're certainly going to be standing with folks who will be litigating this in the courts,\" Martin added. \"We will continue to organize on the ground in Texas, and we will continue to support the House Dems, as they have broke quorum right now.\"",
      "This is not the first time Democrats have left the state to deny Republicans a quorum \u2014 and not the first time they have done it to protest redistricting. During the landmark 2005 mid-decade redistricting, Texas Democrats fled during two separate special sessions to stop the redistricting. But the redistricting eventually did go through. And in 2023, Republicans passed legislation that levies a $500-a-day fine on lawmakers who leave the state.",
      "The last significant quorum break in the Texas House was in 2021, when Democrats fled the state to prevent a restrictive voting bill from passing.",
      "Last month, Paxton threatened to assist police in \"hunting down and compelling the attendance\" of any Democratic lawmakers who leave the state to block votes during the special session.",
      "\"If Democrats ignore their duty to their constituents by breaking quorum, they should be found and arrested no matter where they go,\" said Paxton, who is also running for the GOP nomination in next year's Senate race.",
      "Abbott on Sunday said that \"Any Democrat who 'solicits, accepts, or agrees to accept'\" donations to help cover any fines they may be subjected to under Hous rules for skipping votes, \"may have violated bribery laws.\"",
      "Can other states take on redistricting efforts?",
      "As the efforts ramped up in Texas to redraw the maps, other Democrat-led states threatened to do something similar. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been one of the most prominent voices behind this effort, posting on social media after the GOP's new maps for Texas were unveiled that \"California won't sit back and watch this happen.\"",
      "Other governors have joined suit, with some of the Texas House Democrats joining New York Gov. Kathy Hochul for a press conference on Monday about the topic. Hochul said, \"I'm tired of fighting this fight with one hand tied behind my back.\"",
      "Pritzker also said Sunday \"everything has to be on the table.\"",
      "But legally, it will be difficult to pull off in many of these states. Texas is one of a few states that allows the state legislature to set up the congressional maps, and can allow mid-decade redistricting. In California, an independent commissions is in charge of redistricting \u2014 and there is a law in New York banning gerrymandering for political gains. New York's congressional maps went through a number of legal challenges before the final maps were settled on.",
      "Hochul and New York Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie acknowledged it would require a change to the state constitution, but Heastie insisted that \"we're in close conversations about options there, and so I would say we're presenting all options right now.\"",
      "\"It's very difficult to say play fair when your opponents are playing dirty and using every tool in their tool shed toolbox to kind of undermine democracy,\" Heastie said.",
      "As for Illinois, the state legislature draws the map and Democrats control the legislature \u2014 and they cut out two Republican seats when they redrew the maps in 2021. Prior to redistricting, Illinois had 13 Democrats and five Republicans in the House. The state lost a seat due to population loss, and they ended the 2022 elections with 14 Democrats and three Republicans.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 20:18:06 -0400",
    "summary": "Revisions are a \"feature, not a bug\" of any jobs report, former BLS commissioner told CBS MoneyWatch.",
    "story": [
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics last week issued a\u00a0steep downward revision\u00a0to May and June's hiring numbers, prompting President Trump to call the edits \"miscalculations\" by the department's commissioner, whom he subsequently fired, in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Aug. 1.",
      "While the downward revision of May and June payroll growth by 258,000 marked the largest two-month downward revision to the jobs numbers since 1968, revisions themselves are not uncommon. Revisions are \"a feature, not a bug\" of the agency's reporting process, according to Erica Groshen, former BLS commissioner under the Obama administration told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Larger revisions have been recorded, but only when the economy has been in a recession, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis for BLS data.",
      "How the BLS processes its reports",
      "The BLS surveys both households and businesses for its monthly jobs report. After releasing an initial report, it's common for the agency to issue revisions to the prior monthly figures, as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "That's because while some survey recipients respond to the agency's surveys immediately, others report data late. In the interest of reporting employment information in a timely manner, though, the BLS will issue its monthly jobs report based on the responses it is given by a certain time.",
      "\"The BLS wants to get the information as accurate as possible, but it doesn't want to wait too long to put out information that's useful,\" Groshen said. \"So it puts out preliminary numbers, saying they are an estimate, then it gathers more information and improves that estimate.\"",
      "\"If you send out a survey to a bunch of people, some will turn it back in on time and some of them won't,\" Michele Evermore, a former Department of Labor employee and senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive, independent think tank told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The faster you make a determination, the more you're going to have to fill in the blanks,\" she said. In the interim, the BLS relies on scientific modeling to paint a more complete picture of the state of the job market. \"You have to fill in the gaps, and the more reports you get back, the more holes you can fill, and the more accurate a report you get.\"",
      "Eventually, the inclusion of late responses to surveys by both employers and workers enables the agency to provide a more accurate picture of the state of hiring and unemployment in the U.S., Evermore explained.",
      "The cuts to the number of jobs that were added in May and June were spread out across both public- and private-sector jobs. The downward revision to public-sector payroll growth \"mostly reflected lower state and local government job gains,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a research note. Private-sector job gains were previously overstated because of incomplete response data, according to the analysts.",
      "Groshen acknowledged that the revisions were \"definitely on the large side,\" but that \"they happen, and are the product of the same monthly process.",
      "Cuts pertaining to government jobs were driven primarily by reductions in hiring by state and local education establishments, according to the BLS. Groshen attributes the job cuts to the expiration of pandemic-era government subsidies that are leading to a pullback in hiring.",
      "\"These subsidies were cut, so they are not hiring as many people as they had been in the past, and state and local governments often report late, so that information came in late,\" she said.",
      "Evermore, of The Century Foundation, noted that the BLS revisions only apply to jobs that were added in both May and June, and not to \"the pool of all the jobs in the U.S.\"",
      "\"While it seems like a big revision, percentage-wise, it's floating on top of the entire labor market. So while it's big, it's not as dramatic as some people are acting like it is,\" she said.",
      "Dismissal of BLS commissioner",
      "In his Truth Social post on Friday, Mr. Trump, accused the agency's Commissioner Erika McEntarfer of political bias before announcing her dismissal in response to the downward revision of jobs numbers. \"I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes,\" the president\u00a0wrote.",
      "Even though it has been asked a number of times since Friday, the White House has not provided any evidence that the numbers were manipulated for political purposes.",
      "According to Groshen, the drastic revise of the job numbers don't reflect a \"failure\" of the BLS to do its job.",
      "\"It's not a failure and it's not bias. It's not like the commissioner said, 'Oh, I think I'm going to change that numbers.' The commissioner has no power, no ability to do that.\"",
      "Evermore concurred. \"Having worked with BLS for years, it's impossible to cook the books as things stand,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For years, it's become increasingly difficult to collect complete data based on surveys fielded to hundreds of thousands of employers and individuals, according to Groshen.",
      "\"There is a very long-term term trend of a declining response rate, which is bedeviling the system,\" she said. That's in part because some surveys are fielded over the phone, and American households are increasingly ditching landlines.",
      "Jeff Strohl, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, a research policy institute, echoes others in noting that BLS releases monthly jobs numbers knowing that they'll be revised. But the agency prioritizes timeliness over 100% accuracy because \"the currency of the data is still important,\" he said.",
      "Low response rates \u2014 only about 70% of employers surveyed respond on time \u2014 make revisions inevitable. according to Strohl. \"A month later, the response rate goes up to 90%-95%, so you have 25%, or 150,000, more firms reporting their data,\" he said.",
      "Additionally, weekly shocks to the economy, such as created by tariffs, adds another layer to the challenge of releasing accurate jobs data each month.",
      "\"The U.S. economy is going through a huge number of shocks on a weekly basis,\" Strohl told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Tariffs are being threatened and applied, and there is a level of economic uncertainty affecting the job market.\"",
      "For example, he said, some job seekers are having offers rescinded as major universities lose research grants. \"That's stopping hires from working on projects the money was going to feed,\" he said.",

But with the pandemic long over and the contracts set to expire on May 31 of this year, it is highly unlikely the contractors, which included Walgreens and CVS, would have spent anywhere near that sum on COVID-19 testing and treatment.",
      "The spending \"was never going to reach this number,\" said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, referring to the total potential value. \"You didn't have to terminate this contract, you are the government \u2014 just don't obligate any more money.\"",
      "Since it was launched, multiple news outlets including CBS News have reported that DOGE's \"Wall of Receipts\" has at times vastly overstated the amount of funds cut and discovered numerous errors in the group's accounting.",
      "DOGE now claims it has saved $52.2 billion \u2013 just from contracts canceled. Malkus, who analyzed the actual implications of the cancellations rather than the ceiling values, puts the number closer to $17.8 billion. But that would only be if Congress agreed to rescind the funds that it had already voted to spend.",
      "The DOGE website reports a grand total of $199 \u202fbillion saved, when factoring in real estate lease cancellations and other cuts such as personnel reductions. However, it provides no documentation for roughly half of that amount. According to DOGE, the savings equate to $1,236.02 per person in the U.S.",
      "\"The amount they have per person is fiction,\" Malkus said. \"It's transparency theater.\"",
      "HHS did not respond to a CBS News request for comment about the three contracts. The White House redirected the request to the General Services Administration, which declined to comment.",
      "A substantial portion of those purported savings is a result of cuts to USAID. A recent study in the medical journal The Lancet says those cuts could come with a human toll. By the study's estimates, the loss in humanitarian aid could lead to 14 million deaths in children younger than 5 years of age by 2030.",
      "Malkus told CBS News, \"Their claims are generally to say, 'Hey this is a lot of pain, but it's worth it.'\"",
      "The update is only the second since Musk, who launched DOGE, departed from his role in the White House advising Mr. Trump.",
      "Shortly before Musk's term as a special government employee expired, he told reporters, \"This is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning.\"",
      "\"The DOGE team will only grow stronger over time. The DOGE influence will only grow stronger,\" he said from the Oval Office on May 30, adding that he was confident over time DOGE would cull $1 trillion in savings.",
      "It's unclear exactly how DOGE has functioned since then. In late June, The Washington Post reported that federal officials were instructed to stop routing the grant-making process through DOGE, revoking control of the online clearinghouse for all grant opportunities from the group. In DOGE's latest update, only one additional canceled grant was added.",
      "Several DOGE-associated government employees have left in recent weeks, including the Department of the Interior's Tyler Hassen, whose last day was Friday, The New York Times reported. Hassen was originally hired as a DOGE staffer, and then was later tasked with trimming costs at the Interior Department, where he was named principal deputy assistant secretary of the interior.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum had allowed him broad authority to make cuts to budgets and staffing, and under his watch, a DOGE-associated employee made the claim that a single survey costing $1 billion dollars\u00a0had been cut. That claim was repeated by Elon Musk and Burgum, but no evidence was ever supplied to back it up.",

      "The Florida Department of Health is warning about the risks of drinking raw, unpasteurized milk after 21 people, including six children under the age of 10, were sickened by E. coli and campylobacter bacteria linked to raw milk from the same farm. Seven people have been hospitalized, and two have developed severe complications.",
      "\"Sanitation practices in this farm are of particular concern due to the number of cases,\" the department said in a news release. Officials did not identify the farm, but indicated its products were available in Northeast and Central Florida. CBS News has reached out to the health department for more information.",
      "Although it is illegal to sell raw milk for human consumption in Florida, it can be sold in the state if it's labeled as a pet food. Raw milk has been promoted by online wellness influencers and raw food advocates, boosting sales in recent years, but public health officials say it can be risky.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say raw milk can carry life-threatening bacteria, such as E. coli, campylobacter, listeria or salmonella.",
      "These can cause symptoms including diarrhea, vomiting and stomach cramps. Severe cases can result in a condition called hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS, which can lead to kidney failure.",
      "Since 1987, 143 outbreaks have been linked to raw milk or raw milk products, some involving miscarriages, stillbirths, kidney failure and even deaths, according to the FDA.",

      "Latah County prosecutor Bill Thompson, the lead prosecutor in the Bryan Kohberger case, spoke with \"48 Hours\" correspondent Peter Van Sant days after Kohberger was sentenced to four life sentences without the possibility of parole for the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students \u2013 Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin.",
      "In the interview, which was released as a special \"48 Hours\" podcast, Thompson opens up about the immense pressure of the Kohberger case, the controversy surrounding the plea deal and explains his \" judgment call\" on the agreement that didn't include a requirement for Kohberger to provide a full confession. Read on for an inside look at the case.",
      "Inside the Bryan Kohberger case",
      "Peter Van Sant: What was it like to be the lead prosecutor in the Bryan Kohberger case? A case that captured the world's attention with seemingly everyone looking over your shoulder and commenting on your every legal move. And how did that plea deal come to be and why was there no stipulation that Kohberger provide key answers?",
      "Today, I'm speaking with Latah County, Idaho Prosecutor Bill Thompson. He has worked on this case from day one.",
      "This is inside the Bryan Kohberger Case, the Idaho Student Murders. I'm 48 Hours correspondent Peter Van Sant.",
      "Peter Van Sant: It is great to be with you, Bill. Thank you for joining us. Can you tell us what it was like for you to be at the center of this case that literally commanded attention all around the world?",
      "Bill Thompson: Well, I didn't feel like I wanted to be at the center of the case, so it's really just a team effort. This was a huge team effort. I've been the prosecutor here for over 30 years now. I've never seen this degree of coordination with agencies like the FBI and the Idaho State Police, as well as our Moscow Police Department.",
      "Peter Van Sant: You're the quarterback, kind of the team captain and all of that social media pressure. Did you feel that during the course of all of this, did you pay any attention to it or did you try to brush that aside?",
      "Bill Thompson: Actually, I don't watch social media. We made our decisions based on what the law was and what the evidence was, and frankly, we were pretty successful at insulating ourselves from what the swings of public opinion might be out there on the internet.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Bill, I have to tell you, during that sentencing hearing, I have never, as a reporter who's been in dozens and dozens of courtrooms, I've never seen such emotion as I witnessed during that hearing, both you and the judge were moved to tears. What is it about this case that touches you so personally?",
      "Bill Thompson: Well, it's just so, it's so sad in every possible sense. I mean, we've dealt with many homicide cases, unfortunately during my time here as the prosecutor. But this one just was so sad, such a loss of life \u2013 these young people, you know, four people killed in their home in the middle of the night.",
      "It was just simply cruel and heartless and feeling for those families and feeling for the two surviving roommates my goodness. You know, I was sitting right next to one of them as she was giving her statement, and she asked that we block her view of the defendant. That's why I was sitting kind of at a funny angle, but that was overwhelmingly powerful \u2013 pure honesty and emotion from this young woman and such strength.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And it was remarkable. And, and for Dylan Mortensen, after what she had experienced through social media. She just said it all from the heart. Um, it brought that teared me teared me up. I mean, she was just a remarkable person. What was it like for you to listen to her?",
      "Bill Thompson: Oh, it was, it was almost overwhelming. But I saw her strength and I knew that we needed to be strong with her and for her.",
      "\"These murders were brutal\"",
      "Peter Van Sant: Bill, you have been in the house where these students were brutally murdered. You saw the blood. You've seen what was done to these students' bodies. How do you describe the crimes that Bryan Kohberger committed?",
      "Bill Thompson: These crimes, these murders were brutal. We've seen plenty of homicides and each one is different, but this is one that you'll never be able to erase from your eyes and from your memory.",
      "Peter: Were you actually inside that house while the victims were still present?",
      "Bill Thompson: Yes. Ashley Jennings, my senior deputy and I were both on scene on November 13th. We were in the house. We were working with the investigators and seeing firsthand what was going on with the crime scene \u2013\u00a0 looked like. It's part of our philosophy. We work with our officers right from the very beginning um but it brings with it some challenges and this certainly brought emotional, physically emotional challenges with it.",
      "Peter Van Sant: You've also been in the same room as Bryan Kohberger. You've looked into this man's eyes and you've watched his reactions during these victim impact statements. What did you see?",
      "Bill Thompson: I saw nothing in Bryan Kohberger while the impact statements were going on. It's as though his eyes were empty.",
      "Peter Van Sant: He made eye contact with, with each of these people, completely unmoved. No reaction, no remorse, no tears. What does that tell you about this man? What is inside him, if anything?",
      "Bill Thompson: I don't know how to answer that. He's an enigma to me. The evil that he committed is incomprehensible. In many cases when I'm in court, I'm engaging directly with the defendant. I think I did it once at the sentencing and that was just to point out that he wasn't gonna leave prison until he was dead and that was it. I don't care to ever interact with him again. I'd be happy to never hear his voice again, never see him.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Bill, I want to ask you a question. I know you've been asked this already a bunch of times but, as you well know, everyone, the families and friends of those students, the public at large, everyone is vexed by the question of why did he do this? Do you have a theory?",
      "Bill Thompson: I don't know why he did this. Early on in the investigation when we had folks from the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit, their profilers, they were here helping with the investigation in the first few weeks as they were looking at the case, even just the little we knew then they were telling us, in all likelihood, we would never find out or understand why this occurred, and even if the murderer were to tell us the reasons that in all likelihood, it wouldn't make sense to ordinary people like ourselves.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So we know that Kohberger had done some homework. He'd studied past crimes. Is it within the realm of possibility that for Kohberger this was a thrill kill?",
      "Bill Thompson: I don't think we can rule out anything. I mean, he certainly is a criminal justice major. He was studying criminal behavior. He studied serial killers. We know that\u00a0 the investigators recovered textbooks on those topics that were part of classes he was taking. He studied how to manage a crime scene, and that was evidence that we were prepared to offer at trial to help explain why this particular crime scene was so clean of incriminating evidence and his car was so clean of incriminating evidence. There was a lot of thought and preparation put into that.",
      "Peter Van Sant: When I talk to people about this case, people know that there are Ring doorbells and security cameras that pick up automobiles in an area. And everyone knows about DNA. How would you describe \u2013 he meticulously seemed to prepare for this, and yet he made some mistakes.",
      "Bill Thompson: Well, no plan is perfect and we don't know what may have changed his plans if it did inside the home, um, because we don't know who he intended to attack first. We do believe that Xana encountered him while she was still awake. She was up. She'd received a DoorDash order that very likely could have put him into a panic and panicked people make some mistakes or maybe it's just simply he's not as smart as he thought he was. We'll never know for sure and we really don't need to know for sure. I - we look at, at where this investigation went \u2013they started out with one sample of DNA from a knife sheath. It was from a single male unknown source and the car leaving the scene. That's what the investigators had. That's what Kohberger left behind. And from there, the team put the case together to where he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. There's no question.",
      "Peter Van Sant: You know, in those weeks after the murder, when the public was getting more and more frustrated that they felt as though no progress was being made. In fact, progress was being made, it's\u00a0 just, you can't reveal it, right?",
      "Bill Thompson: Correct. Yes. We \u2013 whenever investigation's going on, the investigators aren't gonna compromise what they know. That's important \u2013\u00a0 to protect the quality of the investigation. It was a bit satisfying when we finally were able to come public with the charges and the basis for the charges and to see the skeptics out there, scratch their heads and say, \"Oh yeah, these folks really did know what they were doing.\"",
      "Peter Van Sant: I know you've talked about this quite a bit, but the fact that the defense team came to you seeking a deal, doesn't that mean that you had the leverage in this case? That essentially you were holding all of the cards \u2013 that since Bryan Kohberger clearly now wanted to live. So help me out on this 'cause even the President of the United States weighed in on this issue. Why didn't you put a stipulation into this deal where Kohberger would have to have honestly answered all questions about these murders to the satisfaction of detectives before this plea could be finalized? Why didn't you do that?",
      "Bill Thompson: Well, and you know, Judge Hippler talked about this at the time of sentencing. There is nothing that I believe that Mr. Kohberger could say that would shed the actual truth on what happened. If he were to talk, he would only say things to benefit himself. That would further victimize the families. That's what we've seen repeatedly over the years, and in- particularly, in major cases. Under Idaho law, there's no way we could compel him to disclose. And if we'd gone to trial, he would've never even acknowledged guilt. We would've just moved into appeal time. So it was our conclusion that straight up guilty pleas as charged and waiver of appeal for closure, so we have accountability and closure with fixed life sentences was the best course.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Bill, based on my experience and, and with my colleagues on 48 Hours, we cover murder cases for a living, I had a story in which, in a plea deal, the defendant was, it was contingent on the defendant agreeing to show where he had disposed of a body, and a colleague of mine had a, a case in another state where the plea deal stipulated that not only did they have to show where the body was, but give a narrative of how that person committed the crime and it answered all sorts of questions for the families. You guys didn't \u2013 decided not to do that. And why not at least try? I don't understand that.",
      "Bill Thompson: Well, and I understand what you're saying and, and I certainly understand and hear from the families and members of the public, who will always have the question, \"why?\" as we viewed this and looking at the circumstances of this case, it was our conclusion and ultimately my conclusion, I'll take responsibility \u2013 I'm the elected prosecutor, so it stops with me but it was our team's decision that getting the guilty pleas straight up, factual guilty pleas was going to be the best legal way to approach this. I think that there were concerns that somebody like this particular defendant if he was trying to allocute in a specific factual fashion, he could actually undermine the basis for his plea, and the judge would not have as solid of a foundation to uphold the plea.",
      "So, we analyzed this really from a pretty strict legal factual point of view. It's not to say that we don't understand and appreciate folks' desires to know what really happened, but I have no faith at all that Mr. Kohberger would ever truthfully explain what happened or what he would say would make any sense. And I think that would even further victimize our families.",
      "Peter Van Sant: But why not challenge him on that? Why not see if you might get some honesty from him?",
      "\"It was a judgment call\"",
      "Bill Thompson: Yeah, I hear what you're saying, Peter. And, we have considered that and we decided that our best course on this case, with this defendant in Idaho, was to proceed as we did. I'm not gonna say the decision was perfect. It certainly doesn't perfectly answer everybody's questions, I realize that. But I also accept that, as I said earlier from the beginning, we were advised by the profiling professionals that even if the person who committed these homicides tried to explain his reasoning and what occurred, that it wouldn't make sense to ordinary people and that would further victimize these poor families. It was a judgment call. I accept it. It was a judgment call.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Is it true that you are personally opposed to the death penalty?",
      "Bill Thompson: You know, I don't know that I have strong feelings one way or the other. We've had a handful of death penalty potential cases during the time here. We have had one case where the death penalty was imposed and it was thrown out after the Arizona versus \u2013 Ring versus Arizona decision came down. And that was a case involving Mr. Dale Shackleford. That was a 10 week trial. And we elected at that point that many years after the fact that it wasn't realistic to go back to trial just to seek the death penalty. Um, so, you know, we have pursued the death penalty where we think it's appropriate.",
      "In the cases we've had to try...and death penalty eligible, we've had it there. We've decided each case on its merits and I really don't have a personal moral feeling one way or another. The law of the state of Idaho is the death penalty is a sentencing option for certain crimes, And this crime would certainly fit the elements of a death penalty case if we'd gone to trial.",
      "Peter Van Sant: How difficult was it for you to take the death penalty off the table in this case?",
      "Bill Thompson: I don't know how to characterize it as being difficult. Making the decision was difficult because it was a major decision. And it was changing course from where we'd been working for so many months preparing to go to trial. So, we took a step back and look, we being the attorney team, the prosecutor, attorney team and just kind of analyzed each aspect of this case, and we came to the conclusion that if the defendant was prepared to plead guilty, straight up, factually, admit the crimes and agree to waive appeals and we get fixed life sentences, that that was an appropriate resolution.",
      "Peter Van Sant: I've always thought that the death penalty in various states is basically reserved for those spectacularly heinous crimes like this one where someone like Kohberger here, here he butchers these four kids shows no remorse. Wasn't it your responsibility to take this case as far as you could so that he gets the maximum penalty that is in Idaho law? What do you say to that?",
      "Bill Thompson: I would say that it's my responsibility as a prosecutor to do justice. Prosecutors who blindly go into court on an agenda, I think are doing a disservice to their profession and the public. This case and his actions certainly deserved the death penalty if we had had to go to trial. No question about it.",
      "Peter Van Sant: For Kohberger, in his mind, wasn't this plea deal a victory? He gets to live.",
      "Bill Thompson: You know, I can't speak to what's going on in his mind. I don't see it as being a victory where he's going to prison. The only way he's gonna leave is when he's dead.",
      "Peter Van Sant: I've been in many a maximum security prison and for what it's worth, they are places of extreme punishment. I'll put it that way. I can say a lot more than that, but when you park sometimes in the parking lot outside a maximum security prison, and you hear people shouting inside from the parking lot, you know there's a hellscape behind those walls.",
      "Bill Thompson: You're right, and there's something to be said for a person being reminded every day of the punishment for what they've done.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Give us a sense of what your closing statement would've been if you had an opportunity to sum it all up?",
      "Bill Thompson: Peter. Actually, the best way to look at that is go back to what we did in court on July 2nd in front of Judge Hippler, where we gave the summary of the evidence in this case. And we presented it, I presented it, in a manner very similar to what we have argued, would've argued to the jury, would've presented in opening statements, and argued and closing arguments.",
      "The length of the evidence here, that once the investigators identified Mr. Kohberger they were able to bring into play not only the DNA match, which was significant in and of itself. It's kind of tough to explain that away when your DNA is on the sheath of the murder weapon next to the body of one of the victims.",
      "Peter Van Sant: As you know, Bill, jurors want that CSI moment, they call it. And you had one, in this case, you had a CSI moment that was irrefutable.",
      "Bill Thompson: Well, and as the story came out, it really was a multiple CSI moment because we didn't file charges even though we had a lot of circumstantial evidence until they did the trash pull in Pennsylvania. And we got the paternal DNA match from a Q-tip in that trash pull that said the source of that DNA on the Q-tip is the father of the person whose DNA was on the knife sheath. That was the CSI moment to start for us. That's what really triggered us being able to get the arrest warrant in place, the search warrants in Pennsylvania, get him arrested, get a direct DNA sample from him and it matched. That was, that was overwhelmingly powerful.",
      "Kohberger's family",
      "Peter Van Sant: When do you believe the Kohberger family realized that their son was the murderer in this case?",
      "Bill Thompson: I don't know for sure. When the investigators spoke with them after his arrest, there was nothing the investigators heard or saw to suggest that the family knew that Mr. Kohberger was responsible for this. The information we have and the defense maintained his factual innocence all the way up to the time of the plea, would suggest to us that he never acknowledged guilt to his family quite possibly not until he stood up in court on July 2nd and entered his guilty pleas. As his parents were there at that time, that may very well have been the first time they actually heard it.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Police reports reveal that Kaylee Goncalves had told roommates that she saw a creepy looking man while she was walking her dog, and that roommates returned to find that the front door had been damaged. Do you believe that Kohberger was possibly stalking the house, stalking them?",
      "Bill Thompson: Well, we think that Kohberger was certainly stalking that neighborhood. And we are aware of those incidents where the roommates at the house would, since perhaps somebody was up on the bank behind the house when the dog went out, or, somebody was being followed. The cell phone experts were not able to correlate Mr. Kohberger's phone being in the area at the time of those occurrences, but they were able to show that he was in that area of some 20 plus times other times at night, between like ten and early morning hours, ten in the evening when there would be no legitimate reason for him to be over here to shop here being Moscow, being in Moscow to shop which was his routine practice. So we certainly believe that those trips were \u2013\u00a0 involved Mr. Kohberger looking and surveilling or stalking, whatever the case may be.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Wanting to see what their living patterns were when they came and went from the house, getting familiar with that neighborhood, things like that?",
      "Bill Thompson: Certainly. And certainly there may have been other potential victims that he was looking at.",
      "Peter Van Sant: The Goncalves family told me in an interview some months ago that they thought he must have been in that house prior to the murders because on the night of the murder, it's alleged that he had entered that house and gone right up to Maddie \u2013 Madison Mogen's room. Do you think that's a possibility?",
      "Bill Thompson: It's possible. We \u2013 the investigators never undercovered any evidence that would definitively prove that, but I think that's a legitimate point. The layout of the house is unique, uh,\u00a0 it's a little bit confusing. Admittedly, if he was parked up behind the house on that bank, which we believe is where he parked, he would be able to see into the house at night and he would be able to see whose rooms were where. Whether he was actually in the house at some point before November 13th, we don't know for sure. We can't exclude that.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Bill, for you personally, what questions do you still have about this case?",
      "Bill Thompson: Well, I don't have any question about whether we have convicted the killer. I think if there are questions, there are more details that really in the big picture don't have any significance. Our feeling is that we have accomplished a lot to obtain straight up guilty pleas to all five charges in the indictment and have him spend the rest of his life, not leave prison until he's dead, with no appeals. So we have that finality for the families and for our community.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And so each night now, Bill, as you put your head on that pillow to go to sleep, are you still preoccupied with this case? Is your heart still broken? Do you still have moments of emotion looking back at this tragedy? For the state of Idaho, for the country?",
      "Bill Thompson: There is never a day that goes by that I don't remember this and remember what happened to these poor young people, and what happened to their families and their friends and the community. And I don't know that ever is gonna end. For the past, over two and a half years, I have woken up every night around two o'clock in the morning and will just sit there with this spinning in my head. And I keep a pad of paper and a pen right beside the bed, so I can sit up and write down what's going through my mind about what we need to do with the case before I fall back asleep and forget it. Tthat's been our life for well over two and a half years and I think gradually that will change for us, but what has happened in our community with these murders is forever.",

    "summary": "Friday's unexpectedly weak jobs report signals that some sectors are cutting back on hiring amid economic uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "Friday's disappointing July employment report\u00a0delivered a reality check on the U.S. economy, with the data suggesting the job market is wobbling from the uncertainty of on-again, off-again tariffs.",
      "What was surprising about the Friday report was that employers not only hired fewer people than expected last month, but the government revised its jobs data sharply downward for the prior two months. With the revisions, the U.S. added 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June, reflecting \"paltry\" employment growth during those months, according to a research note from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco.",
      "The latest jobs data is shedding new light on the U.S. economy as businesses absorb a multitude of changes \u2014 from President Trump's trade deals and fresh tariffs to the new GOP tax law, which provides tax breaks\u00a0to many Americans but also cuts spending on health care and social programs like food stamps. The jobs data backs up anecdotal evidence from the Federal Reserve's most recent \"beige book\"\u00a0\u2014 a report that compiles comments from local businesses \u2014 that many companies are delaying hiring \"until uncertainty diminished.\"",
      "\"Based on what I was hearing from a lot of employers, I kept expecting to see a stagnant jobs report at some point, that's what we got today,\" Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"We know the economy has ups and downs, and we're in a pretty stagnant place right now.\"",
      "In other words, while the labor market isn't seeing massive layoffs, companies also aren't expanding their hiring plans. That can make it difficult for unemployed workers to find new jobs, with the number of people searching for work for more than 27 weeks jumping 11% to 1.8 million last month compared with a year earlier, government data shows.",
      "Pockets of strength",
      "To be sure, there were pockets of strength in the jobs report, with health care and social assistance adding a combined 73,300 jobs last month, the BLS reported. But many major U.S. employment sectors saw little or no hiring, including leisure and hospitality, transportation and construction, while others \u2014 including manufacturing \u2014 saw job losses last month, the July data shows.",
      "President Trump on Friday claimed without evidence that the jobs report was manipulated for \"political purposes,\" and fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer.",
      "He also asserted that the downward revisions were \"a major mistake,\" although the BLS revises its data each month to reflect new information, and the numbers frequently move both up and down.",
      "\"The president's belief that the BLS commissioner personally 'produced' the jobs numbers is preposterous and shows a complete misunderstanding of how government statistical agencies operate,\" noted Heidi Shierholz, the president of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute and a former chief economist at the Department of Labor, in a post about McEntarfer's firing.",
      "She added, \"These data are the product of careful work by hundreds of expert economists, statisticians and civil servants following transparent, well-established methodologies.\"",
      "Tariff uncertainty",
      "Businesses have been expressing hesitation given the uncertain impact\u00a0of the Trump's tariffs, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland president Beth Hammack told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "\"I'm hearing that uncertainty has really been weighing on businesses,\" Hammack said of her discussions with business owners in her district, which spans Eastern Kentucky, Ohio, Western Pennsylvania and part of West Virginia.\u00a0 \"They've been having a tough time to decide when to invest, how much to invest. Many of them have scaled back plans for investment.\"",
      "For instance, one franchise owner said that they planned to refurbish their existing locations, rather than open new locations, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs would revive U.S. manufacturing because companies will reshore or open new factories domestically, rather than pay the import duties.",
      "Some Trump officials portrayed the jobs report as a temporary setback as the administration seeks to revive American jobs through its trade policies.",
      "\"Obviously there were elements of [the jobs report] that we didn't love, but the trade deals are now in place that cover \u2014 including the U.S. \u2014 almost 60% of the global economy,\" Stephen Miran, head of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, told reporters Friday.",
      "With the setting of new tariff rates on Thursday for dozens of nations, uncertainty has also been resolved, he added. \"There probably were a lot of firms that, you know, sort of sitting there in May and June saying, 'Hey, you know, this tariff stuff's about to be resolved, this bill you know hopefully becomes law within a month or two \u2014 maybe I'm just going to hold off on this investment program.'\"",
      "Also on Friday, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt issued a statement describing a flourishing economy under President Trump. \"Inflation has cooled, wages have increased, unemployment is stable, and the private sector is growing. President Trump's America First agenda has ensured new jobs go to American citizens, instead of illegals or foreign-born workers. The tariffs are raking in billions of dollars to make our country wealthy again,\" the statement read in part.",
      "A decline in manufacturing jobs",
      "The U.S. lost 11,000 manufacturing jobs in July, and the revisions for May and June also show that the sector shed workers during those months. That's notable given Mr. Trump's promise to revive manufacturing jobs, which has led to new agreements from the likes of Johnson & Johnson and Apple to build new plants in the U.S.",
      "But the Trump administration's tariffs have added to the challenges facing the manufacturing sector, especially those producing durable goods such as appliances and automobiles, noted Indeed's Ullrich. For instance, tariffs on imported metals such as steel and aluminum are making it pricier for many manufacturers to create their products, putting pressure on their margins and profits.",
      "The downturn in manufacturing jobs \"is hardly surprising,\" said Scott Paul, president of the trade group the Alliance for American Manufacturing, in an email. \"It's another 'treading water' number, which has been the case more often than not for the past few years. But it is concerning that we're now 173,000 jobs below the most recent peak in February 2023,\" when total nonfarm payroll employment rose to 155.4 million.",
      "It's possible that manufacturing jobs could reverse the trend now that the Trump administration's tariffs and tax policies are settled, Paul added.",
      "Progress on the Trump administration's goal of reshoring American manufacturing jobs may take years, given the cost and time required to build new factories, Ullrich noted. \"There are certain products that, even with the tariffs, are still cheaper to make overseas,\" she added.",
      "\"This is not a healthy job market,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email. \"The economy needs certainty soon on tariffs. The longer this tariff whiplash lasts, the more likely this weak hiring environment turns into layoffs.\"",

    "story": [
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday ordered the civil arrest of Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to block a vote on a Republican-backed congressional redistricting plan, escalating a standoff that has stalled the legislative session.",
      "The absence of the Democratic lawmakers broke quorum, which meant the House did not have enough members present to hold a debate on a bill to redraw the state's congressional districts to add five seats favoring Republicans. That prompted a Republican-backed motion for their civil arrests.",
      "\"In response to this dereliction of duty,\" House Speaker Dustin Burrows said Monday, \"in pursuant to the rules of the House, I am prepared to recognize a motion to place a call on the House and any other motions necessary to compel the return of absent members. Should such a motion prevail, I will immediately sign the warrants for the civil arrests of the members who have said they will not be here.\"",
      "Minutes after the session adjourned, Abbott made a post on his X account with a \"Breaking News\" banner saying he had ordered the arrest of Democrats who fled the state.",
      "Abbott ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to \"locate, arrest and return any House member who abandoned their duty to Texans;\" however, Texas DPS has no jurisdiction out of state. A civil arrest would force the lawmakers back to the Capitol.",
      "Abbott threatens removal from office as Texas Democrats block redistricting vote by breaking quorum",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott said he'll begin to remove Democratic lawmakers from office if they don't return after\u00a0dozens of them fled the state\u00a0in a last-resort attempt to block the redrawing of U.S. House maps that\u00a0President Trump\u00a0wants before the 2026 midterm elections, although the legal justification for that is shaky.",
      "\"To those who are absent: return now,\" Burrows said. \"Show the courage to face the issues you were elected to solve, come back and fulfill your duty. Because this House will not sit quietly while you obstruct the work of the people.\"",
      "Rep. Charlie Geren, R-Fort Worth, motioned for the \"Sergeant of Arms, or officers appointed by her,   send for all absentees who attendance is not excused for the purpose of securing and maintaining their attendance under warrant of arrest if necessary, and this order to be continued beyond the adjournment of today's session and until the further order of the House.\"",
      "The motion passed with a vote of 85 to 6.",
      "\"The people of Texas are watching and so is the nation, and if you choose to continue down this road, you should know there will be consequences,\" Burrows said.",
      "\"This is not normal,\" Democratic Rep. Ann Johnson said in an interview with CBS News. \"Do not think that we can turn into a nation where you arrest and jail your political opposition for not only rendering their voice for the people, but doing something that is protected by the Texas Constitution. A quorum break is written into the Texas Constitution. It is a tool our founding fathers gave us. The threat of arrest is something that should be a red alarm for a lot of folks.\"",
      "Texas Democratic legislators flee state to protest GOP's redistricting plan",
      "State House Democrats went to Illinois or New York on Sunday, and Abbott gave them a 24-hour ultimatum to come home, ratcheting up a widening fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but has drawn in Democratic governors who have floated the possibility of rushing to redraw their own state's maps in retaliation. Their options, however, are limited.",
      "At the center of the escalating impasse is Mr. Trump's pursuit of adding five more GOP-leaning congressional seats in Texas before next year that would bolster his party's chances of preserving its slim U.S. House majority.",
      "\"Greg Abbott is trying to silence the voices of Texans and prevent them from picking the elected officials of their choice, and now he's literally saying he's going to remove the representatives that the people have put into office,\" said Democratic State Rep. James Talarico. \"So he's taken a page of Donald Trump's authoritarian playbook, and it's something we should all protect.\"",
      "The new congressional maps drawn by Texas Republicans would create five new Republican-leaning seats. Republicans currently hold 25 of the state's 38 seats.",
      "A vote on the proposed maps had been set for Monday in the Texas House of Representatives, but it cannot proceed if the majority of Democratic members deny a quorum by not showing up. After one group of Democrats landed in Chicago on Sunday, they were welcomed by Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, but declined to say how long they were prepared to stay out of Texas.",
      "\"We will do whatever it takes. What that looks like, we don't know,\" said state Rep. Gene Wu, the Texas House Democratic Caucus leader.",
      "But legislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, including in 2021 when many of the same Texas House Democrats left the state for 38 days in protest of new voting restrictions. Once they returned, Republicans still wound up passing that measure.",
      "Four years later, Abbott is taking a far more aggressive stance and swiftly warning Democrats that he will seek to remove them from office if they are not back when the House reconvenes Monday afternoon. He cited a non-binding 2021 legal opinion issued by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, which suggested a court could determine that a legislator had forfeited their office.",
      "He also suggested the lawmakers may have committed felonies by raising money to help pay for fines they'd face.",
      "\"This truancy ends now,\" Abbott said.",
      "In response, House Democrats issued a four-word statement: \"Come and take it.\"",
      "The state of the vote",
      "Lawmakers can't pass bills in the 150-member Texas House without at least two-thirds of them present. Democrats hold 62 of the seats in the majority-Republican chamber and at least 51 left the state, said Josh Rush Nisenson, spokesperson for the House Democratic Caucus.",
      "Republican House Speaker Dustin Burrows said the chamber would still meet as planned on Monday afternoon.",
      "\"If a quorum is not present then, to borrow the recent talking points from some of my Democrat colleagues, all options will be on the table. . .,\" he posted on X.",
      "Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate, said on X that Democrats who \"try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately.\"",
      "Fines for not showing up",
      "A refusal by Texas lawmakers to show up is a civil violation of legislative rules. The Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders had the authority to \"physically compel the attendance\" of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served that year. Two years later, Republicans pushed through new rules that allow daily fines of $500 for lawmakers who don't show up for work as punishment.",
      "The quorum break will also delay votes on flood relief and new warning systems in the wake of last month's catastrophic floods in Texas that killed at least 136 people. Democrats had called for votes on the flooding response before taking up redistricting and have criticized Republicans for not doing so.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 16:31:25 -0400",
    "summary": "Prices could tick higher in 2025 as businesses pass tariff costs on to consumers, Cleveland Fed's Beth Hammack tells CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Americans could see inflation tick higher in 2025 as businesses start to pass on the cost of the Trump administration's tariffs to consumers through price hikes, Beth Hammack, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady in an interview.",
      "So far this year, inflation has remained relatively muted despite President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs, partially because many businesses stockpiled goods and manufacturing parts ahead of the import duties' implementation. Some business facing higher tariffs also chose to hold off on passing cost increases onto consumers as they awaited more clarity around where tariff rates would settle. Additionally, the Trump administration instituted numerous pauses on threatened levies, delaying cost increases for businesses and consumers.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pushing the Fed to cut interest rates, citing subdued inflation numbers and cuts from other major central banks, such as in the U.K. and the European Union. But the Federal Reserve last week maintained its benchmark rate at the same level where it's been parked since December 2024, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell citing the risks of higher inflation due to the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "That's a danger also highlighted by Hammack, who said she believes inflation could reach a 3% annual rate this year, representing a pace that would be 1 percentage point higher than the Fed's goal of a 2% annualized rate.",
      "\"Individual businesses have been trying to hold back on, passing on those [tariff] costs, because they're worried about what it might mean for demand,\" Hammack told O'Grady. \"They've been selling inventory that they'd accumulated early in the year, and so they didn't need to charge for the tariffs on that, but they're coming through those stockpiles.\"",
      "She added, \"They're coming to the point where their margins are getting squeezed and they need to start passing that onto consumers.\"",
      "Many households are still struggling with the cost of living, with half of Americans saying they view grocery prices as a major source of stress in their life right now, outpacing housing cost and health care, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\"Two-speed economy\"",
      "Hammack said the U.S. appears to be in a \"two-speed economy.\"",
      "\"The top part of the income spectrum is doing incredibly well,\" she noted. \"They're feeling a lot of excitement about the stock market, how their 401(k)s are doing, and they're feeling flush with cash.\"",
      "But, she added, low-income households are facing a lot of economic challenges.",
      "\"I hear individuals trading down, they go to the supermarket and they can't buy ground beef,\" Hammack said. \"They're buying hot dogs, they're looking at their $400 emergency fund, and it's not able to pay for a new air conditioner or the car repairs that it used to be able to pay for.\"",
      "Price pressures from the Trump administration's tariffs could cause a one-time increase in costs as businesses adjust their prices to cover the import duties, she added. Fed officials are focused on making sure that the price hikes don't become what she calls a \"more persistent inflationary problem.\"",
      "\"What I'm focused on is making sure that we have an economy that's working for all Americans,\" Hammack said. \"Which is why I believe we need to stay really focused on the inflation side of our mandate.\"",
      "At the same time, Friday's disappointing jobs report shows that the labor market is also facing fresh challenges, with employers hiring fewer workers than expected in July. The Fed's mandate is to keep both inflation and unemployment low, with the central bank turning to interest rate hikes to cool inflation or rate cuts to help the job market.",
      "With both inflation on the rise and the job market experiencing some headwinds, the Fed has a delicate balancing act, she noted.",
      "\"This is a really challenging time for monetary policy makers, because both sides of our mandate are being challenged,\" Hammack said. \"And so the decision of which way to go and how quickly to move is a really difficult one right now.",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next decision on interest rates in September, and some analysts are already calling for a rate cut with the US economy seeing three straight months of weak jobs growth. Hammack admits waiting too long to cut rates because of potential inflation is a risk.",
      "\"If we wait too long to cut rates, that could mean that more people are losing their jobs than we'd like to see,\" Hammack said. \"We have to balance those two factors when we're trying to decide what's right to steer the economy forward.",

      "The notice lays out the details of a 12-month \"visa bond pilot program\" that would allow consular officers to require visa bonds. Under the program, the bonds may be required for travelers from countries that the State Department says have high rates of visa overstays, or where screening and vetting information is considered deficient, according to the document.",
      "The notice does not specify the countries covered by the pilot program, but said the State Department will announce the list at least 15 days before it takes effect. The agency will also provide an explanation of why the bonds are required, according to the listing, which will be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday.",
      "The program will take effect 15 days after the notice is officially published and will run through August 2026, the document states.",
      "The program comes in response to an executive order issued by President Trump on the first day of his second term that sought to stem illegal immigration into the U.S., a major focus of the president's policy agenda. The measure directed the treasury secretary, along with the secretaries of state and homeland security, to take action to implement a visa bond program.",
      "As part of his immigration agenda, the president has sought to roll back humanitarian programs for migrants from certain countries, and signed a proclamation in June banning foreign nationals from a dozen countries from traveling to the U.S. The Trump administration has also targeted immigrants on student visas and taken steps to tighten the rules for visa applicants.",
      "A new tax-and-spending bill signed by Mr. Trump last month also subjects many travelers to the U.S. to a $250 \"visa integrity fee.\"",

Tourists spend over $200 billion annually in the U.S., spending that counts as exports. The administration's proposal will not only undermine much of the tourist industry, but it will counteract the administration's goals to reduce the trade deficit. The Trump administration's talent is proposing and enacting the most punitive, expensive, and unnecessary migration restrictions imaginable.\"",
      "The State Department described the pilot program as a \"tool of diplomacy\" and said it will help inform future decisions regarding the potential use of visa bonds \"to address the national security and foreign policy priorities\" raised in Mr. Trump's executive order.",
      "\"The Pilot Program is further designed to serve as a diplomatic tool to encourage foreign governments to take all appropriate actions to ensure robust screening and vetting for all citizens in matters of identity verification and public safety, to create safeguards in [Citizenship by Investment] programs that provide citizenship without any residency in the country, and to encourage specified countries with visa overstays to ensure their nationals timely depart the United States after making temporary visits,\" according to the notice.",
      "Who may be included in the visa bond pilot program?",
      "The State Department did not say which countries with high overstay rates would trigger the visa bond requirement. But an August 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security found that in fiscal year 2023, there were more than 300,000 foreign nationals admitted for business or pleasure who were still in the U.S. after their authorized stay ended.",
      "The pilot program will focus on countries that have high visa overstay rates among those allowed into the U.S. for business or pleasure \u2014 through B-1 or B-2 visas, according to the notice. A B-1 visa is for those temporarily traveling to the U.S. for business activities. A B-2 visa is for foreign nationals who want to come to the U.S. temporarily for tourism or pleasure.",
      "Travelers entering the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program will not have to post a bond, according to the State Department's notice. That program allows residents of more than 40 countries to enter the U.S. for fewer than 90 days without a visa.",
      "While the countries subject to the program will be announced in the future, the list may also be modified on a rolling basis, the State Department said. The countries with the highest overstay rates for people with business and tourism visas in fiscal year 2023 were Chad, Laos, Haiti and Congo, according to the Department of Homeland Security's report.",
      "Only foreign nationals who are applying for B-1 or B-2 nonimmigrant visas, and who are from the countries identified by the State Department, may be required to post a bond of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 as a condition of receiving a visa.

      "The new requirement for certain foreign nationals seeking to come to the U.S. for business or tourism could have negative consequences for cities that rely on travelers from abroad. A June report from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority found that Sin City experienced an 11% drop in visitation year-over-year, hosting nearly 3.5 million visitors in June 2024 and nearly 3.1 million this June.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Travel Association said the pilot program appears to effect roughly 2,000 applicants, most likely from a few countries with low travel volume to the U.S. But the group is more concerned with the $250 \"Visa Integrity Fee\" included in the tax-and-spending plan, the spokesperson said.",
      "\"If this fee is implemented, the U.S. will have one of, if not the highest, visitor visa fees in the world,\" the spokesperson said. \"If we are to maintain a competitive position in the global travel market, it's critical that U.S. visa policy reflects both national security priorities and the significant economic value of international visitation.\"",
      "David Bier, the Cato Institute's director of immigration studies, called the bond requirement \"draconian.\"",
      "\"Although we can't know for certain the scale of this rule because the administration isn't saying which countries it will apply to, the rule will add what is likely an insurmountable barrier to travel for many applicants who end up being targeted who are often family members of U.S. citizens,\" he said in a statement. \"Its argument that this will pressure governments to somehow force their visa holders to comply with the terms of their visas is incoherent, and it appears to be an admission that it will likely just ban people from coming, not just result in compliance. Most visa overstays leave after some time or end up qualifying for legal status in the United States another way. There is no reason to impose such a draconian rule.\"",

    "story": [
      "The manhunt for a military veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at a bar in Montana stretched into a fourth day Monday.",
      "Police are looking for Michael Paul Brown, 45, who is wanted for allegedly shooting the four people inside The Owl Bar in the small town of Anaconda on Friday before fleeing in a white pickup, which he ditched at some point. Law enforcement now believes Brown abandoned that vehicle and stole a different one that had camping gear, shoes and clothes in it.",
      "Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen told reporters on Sunday that Brown was believed to still be armed and dangerous. A\u00a0reward of up to $10,000 has been offered for any information that leads to his arrest.",
      "\"This is an unstable individual who walked in and murdered four people in cold blood for no reason whatsoever. So there absolutely is concern for the public,\" Knudsen said.",
      "Authorities released a photo of the suspect said to be taken as he fled after the shooting: Gaunt, barefoot and wearing nothing but black shorts, he is seen walking down what appears to be a flight of outdoor concrete steps. But because the vehicle authorities believe Brown may have stolen had shoes and clothes in it, it's possible he's now clothed, authorities said.",
      "Investigators are considering all possible options for Brown's whereabouts, the attorney general said. That includes scouring the woods where Brown hunted and camped while he was a kid. But Knudsen noted that during peak tourist season in western Montana, some law enforcement officials would have to return to their local jurisdictions for their regular responsibilities.",
      "The search involves deputies traversing the rugged mountainous area west of Anaconda, both on the ground and by air. It included multiple local, state and federal agencies. As law enforcement scours the wild terrain, the woods southwest of Anaconda have been closed to the public by the National Forest System.",
      "Anaconda-Deer Lodge Police Chief Bill Sather said Saturday that businesses in the area could open, but he urged caution.",
      "The victims were identified as Daniel Edwin Baillie, 59; Nancy Lauretta Kelly, 64; David Allen Leach, 70, and 74-year-old Tony Wayne Palm. They were all from Anaconda.",
      "Knudsen said the investigation has led them to believe Brown, who lived next door, was a regular at the bar and knew the victims.",
      "\"This is a small, tight-knit community that has been harmed by the heinous actions of one individual who does not represent what this community or Montanans stand for,\" said Lee Johnson, administrator of the Montana Division of Criminal Investigation.",
      "Kristian Kelley, the daughter of Nancy Kelley, told CBS News her mother \"was a wonderful nurse, and she had a gift for taking care of people at the hospital. She was always very kind and good-hearted to her patients. She loved animals.\"",
      "\"She just retired and just kind of did [bartending] to have something to do on a day or two. Just to be out and about,\" she said.",
      "Anaconda, about 25 miles northwest of Butte, is home to roughly 9,000 people. Hemmed in by mountains, it was founded by copper barons who profited from nearby mines in the late 1800s. A smelter stack that is no longer operational looms over the valley.",
      "The Owl Bar's owner, David Gwerder, told The Associated Press he was not aware of any conflict between Brown and the victims.",
      "\"He knew everybody that was in that bar. I guarantee you that,\" Gwerder said. \"He didn't have any running dispute with any of them. I just think he snapped.\"",
      "Brown's niece, Clare Boyle, told AP her uncle has struggled with mental illness for years. She said she and other family members repeatedly sought help.",
      "\"This isn't just a drunk/high man going wild,\" she said in a Facebook message. \"It's a sick man who doesn't know who he is sometimes and frequently doesn't know where or when he is either.\"",
      "Kristian Kelley told CBS News she knows who Brown is, but her mother \"had never mentioned him.\"",
      "\"He was somebody that needed some serious resources. He had some mental health issues as well as PTSD from being in the military,\" Kelley said. \"I've never known him to be violent. He was a person who would tell pretty strange stories and different things like that.\"",
      "Robert Wyatt, 70, said he was a neighbor of one of the victims, David Allen Leach, at a public housing complex for elderly people and people with disabilities.",
      "\"Everybody is nervous\" since Friday, Wyatt said.",
      "Leach was deaf and kept mostly to himself, Wyatt said, and he only recalled Leach having a family visit once, almost a year ago. But Leach was always happy to help his neighbors with chores like moving furniture.",
      "\"If you needed help, Dave would help,\" Wyatt said. \"He was a good neighbor.\"",
      "David Jabarek, 70, said that a mass shooting in a place as small as Anaconda is baffling to many. He said he regularly saw both the shooter and the victims over the course of the 20 years that he has lived in Anaconda.",
      "\"We only have 9,000 people, so it's like, what the hell just happened? Everybody knows everybody here,\" he said.",
      "Jabarek was headed to Owl Bar less than 30 minutes before the shooting happened, at around 10:15 a.m. On an impulse, he went to run an errand nearby instead. When he came back to the area, he saw the bar was surrounded by police.",
      "\"If I'd have been in there when I was supposed to be, you wouldn't be talking to me. Somebody be talking to you about me,\" he said.",
      "The close call is now keeping Jabarek up at night. But he said he isn't afraid of the prospect of Brown returning.",
      "\"Everybody around here has two dozen firearms in their house, and right now they're within hands reach,\" Jabarek said.",
      "Brown served in the Army as an armor crewman from 2001 to 2005 and deployed to Iraq from early 2004 until March 2005, according to Lt. Col. Ruth Castro, an Army spokesperson. Brown was in the Montana National Guard from 2006 to March 2009, Castro said, and left military service at the rank of sergeant.",

    "summary": "A sea star wasting disease\u200b sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska, devastating more than 20 species and continuing today.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars \u2014 often known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak's first five years.",
      "\"It's really quite gruesome,\" said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \"puffy arms sticking straight out,\" she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \"then their arms actually fall off.\"",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \"solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Sea stars typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "\"Symptoms of sea star wasting syndrome include abnormally twisted arms, white lesions, deflation of arms and body, arm loss, and body disintegration,\" the National Park Service says. \"They die over the course of days or weeks.\"",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",
      "\"It's incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,\" said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was \"really smart and significant.\"",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the sunflower sea star as critically endangered.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "The study notes that Vibrio bacteria have been called \"the microbial barometer of climate change\" because the species are more prevalent in warming water temperatures. The authors say an important next phase of research will be to work on better understanding the relationship between rising seawater temperatures and sea star wasting disease.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \"look sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\" said Gehman. \"They're voracious eaters.\"",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2014 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",
      "Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations \u2014 and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to \"the rainforests of the ocean.\""

      "\"Our view is the president is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it,\" Greer said. \"And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have.\"",
      "In a statement released Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was \"disappointed\" by Mr. Trump's actions. He noted that \"Canada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes.\"",

But the same thing is true, obviously in Canada as well.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Office of the Special Counsel has launched an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who investigated President Trump before he returned to office, for alleged illegal political activity.",
      "The independent federal agency confirmed to CBS News on Saturday that it has launched an investigation into Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act, a federal law that \"limits certain political activities of federal employees.\" The New York Post was first to report on the investigation into Smith.",
      "Smith was appointed by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 to take over two investigations into Mr. Trump's handling of classified documents and alleged efforts to subvert the 2020 election. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",
      "Both cases resulted in criminal charges against Mr. Trump but they were\u00a0closed\u00a0last year after he won reelection.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/starfish-sea-star-died-epidemic-scientists-know-why/",
    "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 13:16:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A sea star wasting disease\u200b sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska, devastating more than 20 species and continuing today.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars \u2014 often known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak's first five years.",
      "\"It's really quite gruesome,\" said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \"puffy arms sticking straight out,\" she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \"then their arms actually fall off.\"",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \"solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Sea stars typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "\"Symptoms of sea star wasting syndrome include abnormally twisted arms, white lesions, deflation of arms and body, arm loss, and body disintegration,\" the National Park Service says. \"They die over the course of days or weeks.\"",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",
      "\"It's incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,\" said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was \"really smart and significant.\"",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the sunflower sea star as critically endangered.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "The study notes that Vibrio bacteria have been called \"the microbial barometer of climate change\" because the species are more prevalent in warming water temperatures. The authors say an important next phase of research will be to work on better understanding the relationship between rising seawater temperatures and sea star wasting disease.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \"look sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\" said Gehman. \"They're voracious eaters.\"",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2014 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",
      "Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations \u2014 and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to \"the rainforests of the ocean.\""

      "\"China will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,\" China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff.",
      "\"Coercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" the ministry said.",
      "The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable \u2014 after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the \"Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.\"",
      "\"We don't want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,\" Bessent said.",
      "On Thursday, he called the Chinese \"tough\" negotiators, but said China's pushback hasn't stalled the negotiations. \"I believe that we have the makings of a deal,\" Bessent told CNBC.",
      "Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. \"Realizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance\" for Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said.",
      "In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East.",

WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization.",
      "Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Mr. Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.",
      "Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Mr. Trump, Kennedy said.",
      "Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as \"the one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington.\" He said Mr. Trump has made it clear he wants a \"headline-grabbing deal\" with Xi, \"so rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal\u2011breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay.\"",
      "Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's \"strategic solidarity\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said.",
      "\"Beijing simply can't afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,\" he said. \"It's too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire\u2011sale prices.\"",
      "A 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that roughly 80% to 90% of the oil exported by Iran went to China. The Chinese economy benefits from the more than 1 million barrels of Iranian oil it imports per day.",

      "China also is an important customer for Russia, but is second to India in buying Russian seaborne crude oil exports. In April, Chinese imports of Russian oil rose 20% over the previous month to more than 1.3 million barrels per day, according to the KSE Institute, an analytical center at the Kyiv School of Economics.",
      "This past week, Mr. Trump said the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India's purchasing of Russian oil. India's Foreign Ministry said Friday its relationship with Russia was \"steady and time-tested.\"",
      "Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and a top policy adviser, said Mr. Trump has been clear that it is \"not acceptable\" for India to continue financing the Ukraine war by purchasing oil from Russia.",
      "\"People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil,\" Miller said on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" He said the U.S. needs \"to get real about dealing with the financing of this war.\"",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, is pushing for sanctions and tariffs on Russia and its financial backers. In April, he introduced a bill that would authorize the president to impose tariffs as high as 500% not only on Russia but on any country that \"knowingly\" buys oil, uranium, natural gas, petroleum products or petrochemical products from Russia.",
      "\"The purpose of this legislation is to break the cycle of China \u2014 a communist dictatorship \u2014 buying oil below market price from Putin's Russia, which empowers his war machine to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians,\" Graham said in a June statement.",
      "The bill has 84 co-sponsors in the 100-seat Senate. A corresponding House version has been introduced, also with bipartisan support.",
      "Republicans say they stand ready to move on the sanctions legislation if Mr. Trump asks them to do so, but the bill is on hold for now.",

      "Dreading a task at the end of a long week? There may be a way to trick your brain into seeing that chore as a reward.",
      "\"Dopamine anchoring\" is the latest psychology hack making the rounds on social media.",
      "The technique involves associating a desirable thing \u2013 like music or snacks \u2013 with a less pleasant task or movement, so that \"over time, your brain begins to crave the task itself,\" according to Joshua Stein, M.D., a child and adolescent psychiatrist at PrairieCare in Minnesota.",
      "STANFORD SCIENTISTS 'TOTALLY SURPRISED' BY POTENTIAL PARKINSON'S TREATMENT DISCOVERY",
      "From a neuroscience perspective, the strategy works through the brain\u2019s dopamine pathway.",
      "Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in the brain associated with feelings of pleasure.",
      "By repeatedly pairing something enjoyable with an activity, you could train your brain to associate pleasure with that behavior. (iStock)",
      "\"When we expect a reward, dopamine levels rise before we get the reward\" \u2014 which helps boost motivation, Stein told Fox News Digital.",
      "By repeatedly pairing something enjoyable with an activity like cleaning, writing or even exercising, it's possible to train the brain to release dopamine in advance, which associates pleasure with that behavior.",
      "NEGATIVE THOUGHTS MIGHT BE CHANGING YOUR BRAIN IN SURPRISING WAYS, STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "\"There is strong scientific support for this, from both behavioral psychology and neuroscience,\" said Stein, noting that pairing stimuli and rewards can influence behavior, even potentially helping with addiction.",
      "This anchoring technique can also be helpful for those who have conditions like ADHD or depression, in which the dopamine system can become out of whack or dysregulated.",
      "\"The more consistent the pattern, the stronger the association.\"",
      "Stein noted that some people may struggle with a condition called anhedonia, which means they have issues with experiencing pleasure, starting a task or keeping their attention focused.",
      "\"By strategically anchoring pleasant stimuli to challenging tasks, individuals can essentially 'prime\u2019 the brain\" to better tolerate, or even enjoy, those activities, according to the doctor.",
      "\"Overall, it\u2019s about working with your brain chemistry, not against it.\"",
      "Debunking myths",
      "One of the biggest myths surrounding dopamine is that it\u2019s just a \"pleasure chemical,\" according to Stein.",
      "\"It would be more accurate to say that dopamine is the motivation or anticipation neurotransmitter,\" he said.",
      "One risk of dopamine anchoring is becoming too dependent on it when completing tasks, an expert cautioned. (iStock)",
      "Potential downsides",
      "While dopamine anchoring can be a helpful tool in some cases, experts say it should not be relied upon as the sole treatment.",
      "There can be downsides to relying on the technique as a self-help strategy. \"Like any other psychological tool, dopamine anchoring needs to be used mindfully,\" Stein cautioned.",

      "There is the risk that someone could come to rely on external rewards to do anything at all, which could undermine natural motivation over time.",
      "\"Like any other psychological tool, dopamine anchoring needs to be used mindfully.\"",
      "People should also avoid using unhealthy or overly stimulating rewards as anchors, like eating sugary snacks after reaching a goal or using social media after finishing an assignment \u2014 behaviors that can lead to dysregulation, poor focus or burnout, the expert said.",
      "Activities like journaling or listening to audiobooks are just a few examples of rewards to use when anchoring. (iStock)",
      "Stein suggests anchoring with things that are energizing but not addictive, and building in breaks where motivation can arise more naturally.",
      "\"Think of dopamine anchoring as a bridge, not a crutch,\" he advised.",
      "Stein also pointed out the misconception that people can endlessly boost dopamine. While short-term boosts are possible, too much artificial stimulation can dull the natural response over time.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss hackers using airport USB charging ports and phishing texts to target victims.",
      "Hackers are actively exploiting a new zero-day bug in Microsoft's SharePoint Server software. The same software is used by key U.S. government agencies, including those tied to national security.",
      "The vulnerability affects on-premise versions of SharePoint, allowing attackers to break into systems, steal data and quietly move through connected services. While the cloud version is unaffected, the on-premise version is widely used by major U.S. agencies, universities and private companies. That puts far more than just internal systems at risk.",

      "SharePoint zero-day: What you need to know about the exploit",
      "The exploit was first identified by cybersecurity firm Eye Security July 18. Researchers say it stems from a previously unknown vulnerability chain that can give attackers full control of vulnerable SharePoint servers without needing any credentials. The flaw lets them steal machine keys used to sign authentication tokens, meaning attackers can impersonate legitimate users or services even after a system is patched or rebooted.",
      "According to Eye Security, the vulnerability appears to be based on two bugs demonstrated at the Pwn2Own security conference earlier this year. While those exploits were initially shared as proof-of-concept research, attackers have now weaponized the technique to target real-world organizations. The exploit chain has been dubbed \"ToolShell.\"",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How the SharePoint vulnerability lets hackers access Microsoft services",
      "Once inside a compromised SharePoint server, hackers can access connected Microsoft services. These include Outlook, Teams and OneDrive. This puts a wide range of corporate data at risk. The attack also allows hackers to maintain long-term access. They can do this by stealing cryptographic material that signs authentication tokens. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is urging organizations to act. It recommends checking systems for signs of compromise and isolating vulnerable servers from the internet.",
      "Early reports confirmed about 100 victims. Now, researchers believe attackers have compromised more than 400 SharePoint servers worldwide. However, this number refers to servers, not necessarily organizations. According to reports, the number of affected groups is growing rapidly. One of the highest-profile targets is the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Microsoft confirmed it was targeted but has not confirmed a successful breach.",
      "Other affected agencies include the Department of Education, Florida's Department of Revenue and the Rhode Island General Assembly.",
      "Microsoft\u2019s name and logo on a building (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

The company has released patches for SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019 and SharePoint Subscription Edition. Patches for all supported on-prem versions were issued as of July 21.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "What you should do about the SharePoint security risk",
      "If you're part of a business or organization that runs its own SharePoint servers, especially older on-premise versions, your IT or security team should take this seriously. Even if a system is patched, it could still be at risk if machine keys were stolen. Administrators should also rotate cryptographic keys and audit authentication tokens. For the general public, there's no action needed right now since this issue doesn't affect cloud-based Microsoft accounts like Outlook.com, OneDrive or Microsoft 365. But it's a good reminder to stay cautious online.",

      "1. Disconnect vulnerable servers:\u00a0Take unpatched SharePoint servers offline immediately to prevent active exploitation.",
      "2. Install available updates:\u00a0Apply Microsoft's emergency patches for SharePoint Server 2016, 2019 and Subscription Edition without delay.",
      "3. Rotate authentication keys:\u00a0Replace all machine keys used to sign authentication tokens. These may have been stolen and can allow ongoing access even after patching.",
      "4. Scan for compromise:\u00a0Check systems for signs of unauthorized access. Look for abnormal login behavior, token misuse or lateral movement within the network.",
      "5. Enable security logging: Turn on detailed logging and monitoring tools to help detect suspicious activity going forward.",
      "6. Review connected services: Audit access to Outlook, Teams and OneDrive for signs of suspicious behavior linked to the SharePoint breach.",
      "7. Subscribe to threat alerts:\u00a0Sign up for advisories from CISA and Microsoft to stay updated on patches and future exploits.",
      "8. Consider migration to the cloud: If possible, transition to SharePoint Online, which offers built-in security protection and automatic patching.",
      "9. Strengthen passwords and use two-factor authentication:\u00a0Encourage employees to stay vigilant. Even though this exploit targets organizations, it's a good reminder to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) and use strong passwords. Create strong passwords for all your accounts and devices, and avoid using the same password for multiple online accounts.

      "Meta says it deleted around 10 million accounts in the first half of 2025, mostly for impersonation, spam behavior and fake engagement. This is part of a broader effort to promote original content and clean up the platform and prioritize original content. The accounts were taken down for impersonating large content producers, according to the company, which shared the update in a blog post aimed at creators.",

These actions include reducing how widely Meta shows their content and temporarily disabling access to monetization features. If Meta's systems detect duplicate videos, the platform will prioritize the original version and limit the reach of the copies.",
      "The company is also experimenting with ways to credit original creators more clearly, such as adding links back to the source video. To help creators maintain visibility and reach, Meta recommends focusing on original content, avoiding third-party watermarks and making substantial edits when using material from other sources. Basic stitching or watermarking, the company notes, doesn't count as a meaningful transformation.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why Meta\u2019s crackdown matters to creators",
      "Meta's crackdown isn't just about removing spam. It directly affects how content is ranked, shown and monetized. For creators, especially smaller ones trying to expand an audience, originality now plays a bigger role than ever. If your content is flagged as unoriginal or spammy, Facebook may stop showing it in people's feeds. That can tank your reach and, in some cases, cut off access to monetization tools like in-stream ads or bonus programs.",
      "On the flip side, creators who focus on making unique content or thoughtfully transforming existing media have a better shot at standing out. Meta says it's adjusting its algorithms to boost authentic voices. That could help original creators gain more traction if they play by the new rules.",
      "Facebook app on a smartphone\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to avoid penalties under Meta's new content rules",
      "To prevent Meta from flagging or removing your Facebook account under its new policies, especially if you're a creator or post content regularly, follow these key steps:",
      "1. Post original content. Share content you created yourself, whether it's photos, videos, text or anything else. Meta is more likely to penalize accounts that mostly rely on reposted or recycled material.",
      "2. Transform content if you reuse it.\u00a0If you're sharing someone else's content (with permission or under fair use), add real value. Think reaction videos, voiceover, commentary or edits that change the context or experience. Simply stitching clips together or slapping on a watermark won't cut it.",
      "3. Avoid impersonation and spam tactics.\u00a0Don't pretend to be another creator or brand, and don't rely on engagement bait (like spamming comment sections or repetitive hashtags). Meta is actively removing accounts that engage in fake interactions.",
      "4. Avoid using visible third-party watermarks. If your video shows clear signs of being recycled from another app, such as a TikTok watermark, Meta may flag it. Upload clean versions without logos or branding from other platforms.",

      "With the rise of social media use in children, many people, especially parents, are worried about their online safety.",
      "The concern is not unwarranted, as it's no secret that thousands (maybe even millions) of predators lurk on these platforms. Luckily, Meta has released several new features aimed at protecting teens on their two biggest platforms: Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Meta's initiative aims to create a safer online environment in two ways. The first way targets accounts that display predatory behavior, and the second makes it easy for teens to spot and report suspicious activity.",

      "Teens can now see safety tips, block options and the account's join date. (Meta)",
      "Teens will now be safer on Meta platforms",
      "Meta's latest update has improved the direct messaging protections on its platforms. Specifically, teens will now get safety tips to check who's messaging them. For instance, a huge red flag is when a child is contacted on social media by a recently created account (a tactic used to hide identities, bypass restrictions, and scam people). To help teens immediately spot this, Meta will show them the date the account was created.",
      "Furthermore, the platform will make it easier for teens to block and report accounts. They will be able to cut all communication and notify Meta of inappropriate behavior with a single click. This will give these kids the power to quickly protect themselves and others when they don't feel safe.",
      "In addition, Meta is testing new AI-powered tools to detect when users may be misrepresenting their age. If the system flags an account as likely belonging to a teen, it will automatically shift that user into a Teen Account to apply appropriate safety restrictions. This proactive use of AI helps ensure that minors receive protections even if they try to bypass age limits.",
      "Meta has also made behind-the-scenes algorithm changes to reduce the visibility of content that may attract predators. For example, Instagram will stop recommending child-focused, adult-managed accounts to adults who have shown suspicious behavior. This move is designed to limit exploitative discovery before any direct interaction can occur.",
      "New block and report option in DMs. (Meta)",
      "Meta has removed thousands of predatory accounts",
      "In a transparent move, Meta revealed it had removed more than 600,000 accounts for predatory behavior across Instagram and Facebook. That is a staggeringly high number and just goes to show how much children were at risk.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "What's more? Meta caught about 135,000 of them sexualizing children red-handed. They either left comments or requested images that sexually exploit them on other adult-operated accounts. The removal of these accounts shows that Meta is ready to take an active stand against these threats before someone becomes a victim.",
      "Location Notice lets people know when they\u2019re chatting with someone who may be in a different country. (Meta)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you're a parent or a guardian, you can breathe a little sigh of relief that Meta is making great strides to make your child more digitally literate. If they understand how scammers operate, they become more resilient and masters of their online safety.",

      "Nudity protection feature. (Meta\u00a0)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Protecting teens online is a high priority, and it's great that Meta is showing a growing commitment toward this. Preventing the exploitation and abuse of children is something that all platforms should be proactive about. These updates and removal of accounts are just the beginning steps to creating a space where children feel safe. It's important to acknowledge that there will always be risks on these platforms, but giving teens the tools to fight back is extremely welcome.",

Security researchers have found that a persistent malvertising campaign is plaguing Facebook, leveraging the reputations of well-known cryptocurrency exchanges to lure victims into a maze of malware.",

      "An iPhone with Facebook login screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the Facebook crypto scam works",
      "Bitdefender Labs reports that a malicious ad campaign has been running on Facebook for several months. The attackers use deceptive ads that imitate popular cryptocurrency brands like Binance, TradingView, ByBit and MetaMask. To make the scams seem legitimate, the ads often feature familiar faces such as Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or Zendaya.",
      "When users click the ads, they land on fake websites that look nearly identical to the real ones. These sites prompt visitors to download a so-called \"desktop client.\" That download serves as the entry point for a sophisticated malware system.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Instead of delivering malware directly, the fake site launches a silent server on the victim's device. This server then connects with a back-end channel to receive malicious instructions. The method makes it harder for traditional security tools to detect the attack.",
      "To avoid exposure, the attackers also use advanced filtering and tracking tools. If a user doesn't arrive through specific Facebook ad links, the website may show harmless content instead. The site also checks for automated tools or sandbox environments designed to catch threats. In some cases, it even blocks access unless the user opens it in Microsoft Edge, showing blank pages in other browsers.",
      "Screenshot showing a malicious Facebook ad. (Bitdefender)",
      "How hackers use fake Facebook pages to spread malware",
      "Bitdefender researchers found hundreds of Facebook accounts involved in promoting the campaign, sometimes posting over 100 ads in a single day. While many of these ads are taken down quickly, they often rack up thousands of views before disappearing.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "One Facebook page perfectly imitated TradingView\u2019s official account, including fake comments, posts and imagery, except for the redirect links that led to the malicious clone. The victims targeted tended to be men interested in technology and finance, and some ads specifically honed in on users in Bulgaria and Slovakia, showing how attackers fine-tune their campaigns based on geography and demographics.",

      "6 ways to avoid Facebook crypto malware scams",
      "As this Facebook scam shows, cybercriminals are getting more creative and more convincing by the day. These tips can help you stay a step ahead.",
      "Scammers have become masters of visual deception. They replicate branding, use celebrity endorsements and mimic official pages to give their ads an air of legitimacy. In the Facebook malvertising campaign, attackers used names like Binance and faces like Elon Musk to earn trust instantly. Instead of clicking on ads, it's safer to visit the company's official website directly by typing the URL yourself. Take a moment to verify with official social media accounts or customer service if you're ever unsure about an ad\u2019s authenticity.",
      "In these attacks, users were tricked into downloading what appeared to be desktop apps for trusted services but were actually malware installers. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech.",
      "Interestingly, the attackers in this campaign used browser filtering to avoid detection, even prompting users to reopen the site specifically in Microsoft Edge. Using a secure browser like Firefox or Brave can help, and keeping it up to date ensures you're protected against the latest threats. Tools like content blockers or script filters can also help stop malicious behavior before it starts.",
      "Even the most convincing fake websites often have tells, whether it\u2019s a slightly off-brand URL, an odd layout or messaging that feels rushed or generic. A secure URL should begin with \"https://\" and match the official domain name. If a site urges you to act quickly, promises high returns or asks for personal information up front, take a step back. These emotional pressure tactics are a hallmark of modern scams.",
      "Two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) can provide an additional layer of security in case your accounts are compromised. Even if you accidentally fall for a scam and your login credentials are stolen, 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to access your account without the second verification step.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, using a personal data removal service can reduce your risk of being targeted in the first place. These services continuously scan data broker sites and request removals on your behalf, helping to keep your contact info, location history, and interests out of the hands of advertisers and potentially scammers. Given how this campaign leveraged Facebook data to target users interested in crypto and tech, the less data available about you online, the harder it is for attackers to personalize their scams.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Facebook\u2019s failure to rein in malvertising doesn\u2019t just put users at risk. It undermines the entire point of its ads platform. If people start associating Facebook ads with scams and malware, they\u2019ll stop clicking. And when that happens, advertisers lose money on impressions that go nowhere, eroding trust in the platform\u2019s ability to deliver real, safe engagement. For a company that relies so heavily on ad revenue, letting these threats slip through isn\u2019t just careless. It\u2019s self-destructive. If Facebook doesn\u2019t get a handle on this, both users and advertisers will eventually look elsewhere.",

It's subtle, smart and makes the most of what's already on your device. Just remember that when your quiet conversation is over, tidy up behind you.

      "Dior has begun notifying U.S. customers of a data breach that exposed sensitive personal information after a cybersecurity incident earlier this year. In a notification letter, the French brand says the breach occurred Jan. 26, 2025, but wasn\u2019t discovered until more than three months later, on May 7.",
      "\"The House of Dior recently discovered that an unauthorized external party accessed some of the data we hold for our Dior Fashion and Accessories customers. We immediately took steps to contain this incident,\" the company told CyberGuy in a statement.",
      "The compromised data includes names, contact details, physical addresses, dates of birth and, in some cases, passport or government-issued ID numbers. Social Security numbers were also exposed for a subset of affected individuals.",
      "The company, part of the LVMH luxury group, clarified that no payment or financial data was stored in the affected systems.",
      "\"No payment information, including bank account or payment card information, was contained in the database accessed,\" the company said, adding that law enforcement has been notified, and third-party cybersecurity experts were brought in to investigate.",
      "Although the breach occurred in January and was discovered in early May, customers were not notified until late July, raising questions about the delay. This gap between detection and disclosure is drawing attention, especially given the sensitive nature of the data involved.",
      "Dior purse\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Previous Dior and LVMH breaches suggest larger pattern",
      "The incident mirrors a previously reported breach involving Dior customers in South Korea and China. At the time, Dior did not mention any impact in the U.S., but the timeline aligns. Moreover, its sibling brand Louis Vuitton, also owned by LVMH, recently disclosed similar breaches affecting customers in the U.K., Turkey and South Korea.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Dior has not confirmed how many U.S. customers were affected or the full scale of the breach. However, BleepingComputer reports that the same attack targeted Dior and Louis Vuitton. Investigators have tentatively linked the breach to the ShinyHunters extortion group, which reportedly accessed the data through a compromised third-party vendor.",
      "ShinyHunters has a history of targeting large organizations and selling stolen data on hacking forums. If the group is indeed responsible, further disclosures from other LVMH brands could follow. Louis Vuitton may soon notify U.S. customers if their data was similarly exposed.",

      "One proactive step is to consider a personal data removal service. This kind of service specializes in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process.",

      "Since the Dior data breach exposed personal information,\u00a0stay proactive against identity theft. The best way to do that is to use an identity theft protection service.",
      "These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft",
      "Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data.

      "In the viral clip, the full-sized humanoid robot named DeREX is suspended from a crane inside a factory in China.

      "As discovered by researchers at Slashnext, cybercriminals are adopting a new tactic that makes scam websites nearly invisible to the security systems meant to stop them. Known as web cloaking, the technique uses artificial intelligence to hide phishing pages, fake storefronts, and malware delivery sites from automated scanners while showing them only to human victims.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Platforms like Hoax Tech and JS Click Cloaker are emerging as key players in this trend. While both market themselves as traffic filtering tools for digital marketers, they are also being used to protect criminal infrastructure. These services use advanced fingerprinting, machine learning, and real-time decision-making to control what each visitor sees.",

      "Hoax Tech analyzes hundreds of data points to build a digital fingerprint of every visitor, from their browser configuration and plugins to their geographic location and IP history. The company\u2019s AI engine, called Matchex, compares this data to a massive database of known crawlers and security scanners. If the system detects a suspicious visitor, it redirects them to a clean, harmless site. If it identifies the visitor as legitimate, it displays the actual scam content.",

The system scans for behavioral anomalies and uses historical click data to decide whether to allow access to the real page. It also includes features like traffic splitting and A/B testing, giving its users a suite of tools more commonly seen in professional marketing software.",
      "At the core of both platforms is the \"white page\" and \"black page\" system. The system shows security scanners the white page, which looks benign and passes review. It serves human victims the black page, which contains the scam or malicious payload.

      "The image shows a component related to lithium-ion battery recycling technology\u00a0 (WPI)",
      "Why lithium-ion batteries need a second life",
      "From your phone to electric vehicles and even power grids, lithium-ion batteries are everywhere. They offer unmatched energy density and can scale to meet large infrastructure demands. However, there's a catch. Even with optimal use, these batteries wear out after a few thousand charge cycles. When they die, they leave behind components such as nickel, cobalt, and manganese, materials that are expensive and environmentally damaging to mine. Without a solid plan for recycling, the clean energy revolution could create a very dirty problem.",
      "The problem with traditional battery recycling",
      "Standard recycling methods aren't quite up to the task. They're energy-intensive, generate significant emissions, and often fail to recover materials in usable form. This means many recycled batteries can't be turned into new, high-performing ones. As a result, manufacturers continue to mine for raw materials, causing further environmental harm. That's why scientists have been searching for a better way to close the loop.",

      "Why this matters for clean energy and supply chains",
      "Battery waste is piling up, and mining for fresh materials isn't sustainable. Wang's team has proven that high-performance batteries can be made from recycled components at scale.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "This reduces our dependence on destructive mining operations, lowers emissions, and makes battery manufacturing more resilient to global supply shocks. Even better? These recycled batteries perform just as well as new ones. Unlike traditional methods that recover raw metals but degrade performance, this upcycling process regenerates high-value cathodes with next-gen chemistry, turning old batteries into components even better aligned with today's EV and storage systems.",
      "Image of a lithium battery\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you rely on a smartphone, drive an EV, or use a laptop daily, this research affects you. The push toward clean energy is not just about wind turbines and solar panels. It's about making the entire system, including batteries, more sustainable. Right now, most of us toss old devices without thinking about where the battery ends up. But that battery contains valuable metals, metals that are expensive to mine and harmful to extract.",
      "This new method from WPI means future batteries in your devices could be made from sustainably recycled materials, without sacrificing performance. That helps keep costs down, reduces toxic waste, and shrinks your personal carbon footprint. These high-performance recycled batteries could soon power electric vehicles, solar-powered homes, and even the devices in your pocket, bringing sustainability directly into your life. Plus, as governments and companies invest in battery-powered everything, innovations like this help ensure there are enough materials to go around, without ripping more resources out of the ground.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This innovation could become a cornerstone of the circular battery economy, where old batteries fuel new technology without harming the planet. WPI's approach doesn't just tackle waste. It redefines how we think about energy storage in a world that urgently needs sustainable solutions.",

      "Kiswani, whose protests shut down Manhattan\u2019s Grand Central Station and have polarized neighborhoods, accused Berger of harassing female fellow activists.",
      "\"He sexually harasses and fetishizes Arab women, according to multiple reports,\": she said. \"Several women have described feeling unsafe around him, especially in activist spaces.\"",
      "Neither Kiswani nor Berger responded to requests for comment, but Berger\u00a0published a video response to Kiswani in which he denied her claims. He said \"some heavy allegations have been leveled against me\" and called the charges as a \"personal vendetta\" that arose after he did an interview with a podcast host critical of Kiswani.",
      "In a reverse Uno move straight out of a Muslim soap opera, Berger, he accused Kiswani of causing \"baseless fitna.\" Fitna is an Arabic word that means civil war and carries with it serious negative subtext among ideologues bound to a collective identity of one \"ummah,\" or Muslim community.",

(Photo by Selcuk Acar/Anadolu via Getty Images) (Getty Images)",
      "The allegations are particularly awkward because, since the brutal Oct. 7, 2023, invasion of Israel by Hamas, Berger has become a virtual rock star in the anti-Israel scene, publishing selfies with activist luminaries, including socialist politician\u00a0Cornel West, political scientist\u00a0Norman Finkelstein, previously-detained protest leader\u00a0Mamoud Khalil, Hollywood actor\u00a0Rami Malek and rapper\u00a0Macklemore.",

      "The clash offers a window into the murky dynamics of the anti-Israel movement, which has branded itself as moral and virtuous, calling for a \"resistance\" to \"genocide.\" While it welcomed Berger, he had previously been known for creating a library of social media content that critics say \"fetishizes\" not only Arab women but also cleavage-popping Hispanic, Black and Asian women.",
      "In late February 2022, Berger had a very different business model. A former mental health and substance abuse counselor with a master\u2019s degree in social work from Columbia University, according to an\u00a0official bio, Berger had switched careers to become an actor. That month, he\u00a0launched a new business on the OnlyFans platform for sexually-charged video content, promoting himself as \"The Instagram Cop.\" He dressed in a New York Police Department uniform while performing sexual capers around town with buxom women, usually earning less than 100,000 views on TikTok.",

      "By late November 2023, Berger\u00a0wrapped a black-and-white checkered keffiyeh, the symbol of the global intifada, over his shoulders, under a Pittsburgh Pirates beanie and marched near Kiswani and a banner that read, \"BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.\" That post garnered 2.6 million views.",
      "\"Ten toes down for \ud83c\udf49,\" he wrote, using the watermelon emoji that\u2019s become a symbol for Palestine, its red, black and green colors matching the colors of the Palestinian flag.",

She established the group as an offshoot of the New York City chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, known for its virulent anti-semitism.",
      "Over the years, Kiswani has chanted, \"We want to see Israel fall within our lifetime,\" telling protestors: \"We need allies who are gonna help us achieve a victory, not allies who are gonna tell us to be nonviolent.\" She has said, \"No Zionists are welcome in our city,\" and she has declared, \"We don\u2019t want two states.

      "Kiswani didn\u2019t publicly challenge Berber over the next two-and-a-half years, as he embedded himself deeper in the anti-Israel protest movement with often-cringey content about chasing \"Habibti,\" or Arab women, and declaring,\u00a0\"Asian Women Are Thick Now\u2665\ufe0f,\"",
      "\"It's a handful of videos out of hundreds,\" Berger says, in his video response to the allegations against him. \"I'm an entertainer, comedian and a streamer. I say funny things. Her trying to haram police my content and my live stream style is just insane and out of line.\"",
      "Kiswani now faces her own backlash. A\u00a0self-described \"Arab alphamale\" supporter of Berger\u00a0says, \"Nerdeen is good at being a dictator,\" \"acting retarded,\" running a \"useless organization,\" storming Grand Central Station \"like idiots\" and making Palestinians \"look stupid.\"",
      "By August 2024, Berger\u00a0journeyed to Egypt to raise funds for \"orphans and single moms from Gaza,\" displaced by the war.",

      "By October 2024, Berger moved to live in Cairo. Kiswani accuses him of \"getting a free apartment, not paying for anything, and living comfortably while volunteers around him were actually working.\" He denies the charges as \"so laughable.\"",
      "The next month, Berger\u00a0shared a supposed message from a follower: \"As beautiful Muslim women, I feel we should give anti-zionist Jewish guys a shot. I feel like it isn\u2019t Haram,\" or Islamically illegal, \"if he rides with Muslims\"",
      "By the end of the year, Berger\u00a0posted a skit of himself hitting on a dark-haired woman in torn jeans, her midriff bare under a jean jacket, tube top and caption that read, \"How to get a womans [sic] attention in an Egyptian club.\"",
      "Months later, in the spring of 2025, Kiswani\u00a0flashed a wide smile and \"V\" for victory with her fingers, in a video with Berger from an anti-Israel protest, both draped in kefiyyehs.",

      "When much of the world had written off northern Gaza as unreachable, 30-year-old east-Jerusalem resident Sarah Awaidah and her team carved out a lifeline. Under the umbrella of Mena Aid, a regional partner coalition operating through the Multifaith Alliance (MFA), and in coordination with Israeli authorities, she built a system that moved hundreds of trucks of food and supplies into Gaza \u2013 bypassing Hamas and private contractors who had turned hunger into a business.",
      "The result: more than 100,000 families fed. The cost: her own safety. \"I never imagined that creating a safe, independent humanitarian route would become the reason my life might end,\" Sarah Awaidah told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that took place in a safe house in Israel.",

      "Operating through Mena Aid, Awaidah\u2019s team designed an alternative route to deliver food and essential supplies.",
      "In Israel, a trusted logistics company transported the goods from the port of Ashdod to the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings. Inside Gaza, another logistics partner handled transport, while Awaidah\u2019s own staff \u2013 coordinating in real time with Israel \u2013 shadowed every shipment.",

      "\"Our teams are present during offloading and accompany the aid from the crossing to secure warehouses. Inside the warehouses, we begin distribution immediately \u2013 aiming to deliver everything the same day, and at most within two to three days. Nothing is allowed to sit idle.\"",
      "That level of control allowed them to achieve what few others could: reaching northern Gaza, where people had not seen a staple supply of food for months.",

Others try to take over the supply routes so they can resell it.\"",
      "According to Awaidah, her team\u2019s success threatened those who profit from scarcity. By flooding the market with free goods, they not only fed families but also drove down the inflated prices charged for basics like sugar and flour.",
      "\"If there\u2019s no sugar in Gaza, and we bring it in for free, they can\u2019t keep selling it at outrageous prices,\" she said. \"So we became their problem.\"",
      "Israeli authorities also tried to cut off these private-sector schemes by shutting down routes that allowed commercial profiteering. While this helped curb some corruption, it also made the remaining humanitarian channels more dangerous.",
      "Hamas terrorists take up positions ahead of a hostage release in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, Feb. 8, 2025. (AP)",
      "\"The private sector was blocked, and so those who lost their profits started trying harder to threaten and infiltrate the humanitarian route,\" she said. \"They couldn\u2019t control it, so they tried to break it \u2013 and me.\"",
      "The attacks on her came quickly. \"I began receiving death threats \u2013 not just from Gaza, but from the West Bank\u2026 heartbreakingly, some came from people I once trusted.\"",
      "One of the most painful betrayals came from someone close to her, she said, \"I even discovered that I was in a relationship full of lies,\" she said. \"That person was part of a gang that wanted to exploit the aid operation \u2013 and he tried to use me too. But I stood firm. I made sure he, and people like him, never got near it. And now, my life is at risk because I refused to let the private sector hijack aid for commercial gain, or let political actors bend it to serve their goals.\"",
      "Aid workers delivered food to Gazans in the northern part of the enclave last week. (Multifaith Alliance)",
      "For Awaidah, the families she helps are the reason she refuses to quit. \"We created a distribution model based on verified beneficiary lists, using ID checks to ensure fair and dignified access to food,\" she said. \"People stood in line calmly, organized, even in impossible conditions. That\u2019s something the media rarely shows \u2013 the dignity and patience of the people.\"",
      "In the past month alone, her group has delivered 75 trucks and has another 112 on the way from Ashdod. Each day, she focuses on the mission, even as the threats grow.",
      "\"What broke me most wasn\u2019t the threats from strangers \u2013 it was realizing that people close to me were part of it,\" she said. \"It\u2019s easier to fight enemies from the outside. But when it comes from your own circle, it cuts deeper. Still, that only confirms we\u2019re doing something right. If they\u2019re losing their minds over this, it means the mechanism we built works. It means it\u2019s secure.

Those who tried to flee, they caught them and killed them in the compound. And then some others who managed to run towards the road, those also were caught and killed.

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 White House officials began the week scrambling to find a permanent replacement after President Donald Trump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Friday, following a weaker-than-expected July jobs report and drastic downward revisions of employment for the prior two months.",
      "Steve Bannon, a senior White House adviser in Trump's first term who is influential with the MAGA wing of the GOP, is pushing hard for E.J. Antoni, the chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Antoni, a contributor to the Project 2025 policy rubric, has been a longtime skeptic of BLS data. On Bannon's podcast last week, Antoni called for McEntarfer to be fired shortly before Trump pulled the trigger.",
      "In an interview with NBC News Monday afternoon, Antoni said he had not been contacted by anyone in the White House about the job. West Wing officials were \"still running traps\" on candidates for the Senate-confirmed position Monday, one White House aide said.",
      "The White House did not return a request for comment on whether Antoni is under consideration.",
      "Trump said Sunday that he plans to announce a pick in the next three or four days.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to have to be somebody that has tremendous credibility and experience,\u201d said a senior White House official who noted that Trump would likely listen to the thoughts of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and Stephen Miran, the chair of the National Economic Council.",
      "Hiring such a person could potentially be a challenge for Trump. In ousting McEntarfer, he baselessly claimed that jobs numbers are subject to political manipulation \u2014 \"RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad,\" he said \u2014 raising the specter that a new commissioner would not release numbers that made Trump look bad.",
      "\"I find it so hard to believe that your average person hears Trump fired someone because he claimed that they manipulated data and whoever he\u2019s replaced them with is going to produce trustworthy data,\" Kathryn Anne Edwards, an independent economic consultant and host of a podcast called The Optimist, said.",
      "Trump's decision was widely condemned, including by William Beach, who served as McEntarfer's predecessor in Trump's first term. He said her firing \"sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the statistical mission of the Bureau.\"",
      "In his interview with NBC News, Antoni said new leadership could help increase faith in the agency and its numbers. But he suggested that won't happen overnight.",
      "\"We\u2019re going to need to rebuild trust, which happens over time, and it happens with consistency. So again, I\u2019m not even sure anybody is going to get a fair shake no matter who gets appointed to this role,\" he said. \u201cWhoever is in that role is going to need to make the changes necessary to make the numbers more accurate, and then over time, we will again have faith in the data. That is ultimately what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s about having faith in the data.\u201d",
      "Over the weekend and into Monday, Trump's allies moved away from the narrative that McEntarfer, a political appointee of President Joe Biden, altered figures to suit a partisan agenda and toward a framing that held her responsible for revisions to earlier data.",
      "BLS has traditionally updated its monthly jobs figures based primarily on employment surveys that come in late. Together, the revisions for May and June amounted to more than 250,000 fewer jobs than originally reported.",
      "\"For Trump to say she\u2019s fixing the numbers and so on, I think there\u2019s no evidence of that. It might be true, but there\u2019s no real evidence of that,\u201d said Stephen Moore, a former Trump campaign adviser on economic issues. \"The main thing is, whoever Trump chooses, if they\u2019re coming out with these wild estimates that are completely off base then people would lose faith in the numbers, but I think that\u2019s already happening.\"",
      "The senior White House official said that it's hard for the government and the private sector to make decisions if employment numbers don't reflect current reality \u2014 and pinned that problem on McEntarfer and BLS as one of reluctance to modernize.",
      "\"The goal here is to provide data that the markets, the policy makers, can rely on and people know how it\u2019s being produced,\" the official said. \"I think what we know factually is that there\u2019s no transparency in how these numbers are produced and why they\u2019re so bad and you know that there\u2019s been a resistance, too, From BLS to really explore that.\"",
      "BLS publishes the methods it uses to calculate employment data, including complex formulas, on its website, and the standards have not changed since Trump was elected.",
      "\"It's purely transparent,\" Edwards said. \"You can go and download every single survey that was sent in. ... The idea that the numbers aren't transparent, bald-faced lie; the idea that the numbers could be manipulated by a single commissioner, bald-faced lie; the idea that there is the capacity for manipulation, bald-faced lie.\""

    "story": [
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed DOJ prosecutors to launch a grand jury investigation of whether Obama administration officials committed federal crimes when they assessed Russia's actions during the 2016 election, a senior Trump administration official said.",
      "The move comes after the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, claimed in a White House press conference last month that top Obama administration officials carried out a \u201ctreasonous conspiracy\u201d against former President Trump. Gabbard said she was sending criminal referrals to the Justice Department.",
      "A former senior DOJ official condemned the move as \u201ca dangerous political stunt.\u201d And a former senior national security official pointed out that multiple past reviews, including ones conducted by Republicans, found no such crimes.",
      "\"There\u2019s no logical, rational basis for this,\" said the official, who asked not to be named.",
      "The senior Trump Administration official said there is no exact timetable for when the grand jury will meet and that it could take months for the proceeding to begin. The news of Bondi\u2019s letter was first reported by FOX News.",
      "The official said a letter signed by Bondi instructs an unnamed federal prosecutor to begin presenting evidence to a grand jury to secure potential federal indictments. But the letter did not say what the charges would be, who the grand jury will investigate, or where the grand jury will meet.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have accused the administration of seeking to distract attention from the Jeffrey Epstein case. Conservative media and influencers have criticized how the administration has handled the case and demand the release of more documents and information.",
      "President Trump, Attorney General Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel have all been criticized by conservative media and influencers over their handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation and material related to it.",
      "The idea that there was a conspiracy by the Obama administration officials against Trump was contradicted by a 2020 bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee review, which found significant evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Then Senator Marco Rubio, the acting chair of the committee at the time, signed off on the report.",
      "The plans for a grand jury investigation are the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration designed to rewrite the history 2016 election and seek retribution against those the president accuses of trying to sabotage his first term in the White House.",
      "Democratic lawmakers and former senior officials say Trump and his deputies have used the tools of government authority to try to \u201crewrite\u201dthe history of the 2016 election, seeking to reverse an eight-year-old assessment that Russia waged an information war to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy.",
      "Trump and his supporters have long claimed that intelligence and law enforcement officials sought to undermine his first term by allegedly overstating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and investigating Trump\u2019s aides over their possible contacts with Moscow.",
      "They have accused former FBI director James Comey and former CIA director John Brennan of using the probes as a way to undermine Trump.",
      "A lawyer for Comey did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Comey and Brennan, who is a paid contributor to NBC News and MSNBC, have both denied wrongdoing.",
      "The intelligence community\u2019s analysis of the 2016 election and subsequent government investigations failed to satisfy the far-right and far-left sides of the American political divide.",
      "A probe by special counsel Robert Mueller found that Russia intervened in 2016 to undercut Hillary Clinton. But it did not find evidence thay the Trump team colluded with the Kremlin, as some voices on the left had suggested.",
      "At the same time, the special counsel Trump appointed in his first term, John Durham, disappointed far-right activists with his three-year investigation.",
      "Durham found no criminal conspiracy among Obama administration officials to fabricate intelligence about Russia\u2019s actions in 2016. He also filed no charges against the intelligence officers who oversaw a 2017 assessment that found Russia had tried to skew the election outcome in Trump\u2019s favor."

In today\u2019s edition, NBC News reporters in Austin, Boston, Chicago and Washington bring you the latest from the redistricting standoff in Texas, after Democrats fled the state to deny Republicans a quorum to move forward with legislation.

      "Redistricting clash escalates in Texas after Democrats scatter, denying state House a quorum",
      "The Texas state House briefly reconvened this afternoon amid a nationally watched clash over the GOP majority\u2019s plan to redraw the state\u2019s congressional lines, with Republican lawmakers voting to approve civil arrest warrants targeting the dozens of Democrats who fled the state, blocking Republicans from proceeding with the plan.",
      "The bulk of the 50-plus Democrats who left the state are in Illinois, where they\u2019ve been welcomed by Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker. Others are in Boston and in Albany, New York, where Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, in response to Texas, is pushing for a change in state law to allow redistricting in future years.",
      "There, beyond the reach of the state sergeant-at-arms and the Texas Department of Public Safety, the warrants may have little practical effect. But back home, the Democrats face mounting fines, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is threatening to boot the Democratic lawmakers from office or send law enforcement to force them to return to the state.",
      "Because House business requires a quorum, 51 out of the state\u2019s 62 Democratic House members can, by remaining out of state, prevent the Republican-led state House from moving forward with legislation.",
      "The absences deprived the House of its quorum, a reality confirmed quickly after legislators gaveled in this afternoon.",
      "Republican Speaker Dustin Burrows admonished the dozens of Democrats who fled the state as having \u201cabandoned their post and turned their backs on the constituents they swore to represent.\u201d",
      "Democrats have decried Republicans\u2019 redistricting move as a power play and criticized them for moving on the redistricting bill before having responded legislatively to the devastating floods this summer that killed more than 100 people in Kerr County, outside San Antonio. Today, Burrows shot back by arguing that Democrats are delaying their ability to move on other legislative priorities, like addressing the floods.",
      "Democratic state Rep. Ann Johnson of Houston, speaking yesterday evening after she arrived at a news conference at a strip mall about 30 miles west of Chicago, said the redistricting bill is happening only because Trump is \u201cafraid of the electorate next November.\u201d",

      "The senior White House official said that it's hard for the government and the private sector to make decisions if employment numbers don't reflect current reality \u2014 and pinned that problem on McEntarfer and BLS as one of reluctance to modernize.",

      "\u201cSo if you go talk to ChatGPT about your most sensitive stuff and then there\u2019s a lawsuit or whatever, we could be required to produce that. And I think that\u2019s very screwed up,\u201d Altman said. \u201cI think we should have the same concept of privacy for your conversations with AI that we do with a therapist or whatever. And no one had to think about that even a year ago.\u201d",
      "The updates come during a buzzy time for ChatGPT: It just rolled out an agent mode, which can complete online tasks like making an appointment or summarizing an email inbox, and many online are now speculating about the highly anticipated release of GPT-5. Head of ChatGPT Nick Turley said Monday that the AI model is on track to reach 700 million weekly active users this week.",
      "As OpenAI continues to jockey in the global race for AI dominance, the company noted that less time spent in ChatGPT could actually be a sign that its product did its job.",
      "\u201cInstead of measuring success by time spent or clicks, we care more about whether you leave the product having done what you came for,\u201d OpenAI wrote. \u201cWe also pay attention to whether you return daily, weekly, or monthly, because that shows ChatGPT is useful enough to come back to.\u201d"

    "summary": "Two GOP lawmakers say they'll offer bills to curtail gerrymandering. They could be in the line of fire if Democrats in states like California and New York respond in kind to the Texas push.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Some Republicans representing competitive districts in blue states are speaking out against their party\u2019s push to redraw congressional lines in Texas in an attempt give the GOP up to five more House seats.",
      "Reps. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., and Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., have called to impose nationwide limits on partisan gerrymandering, a rare move for Republicans in Washington who have thwarted proposed bans for years.",
      "Follow along for live updates",
      "Democratic governors like California\u2019s Gavin Newsom and New York\u2019s Kathy Hochul have threatened to retaliate against Texas by pursuing their own redistricting plans that could knock out GOP-held swing districts, like those Lawler and Kiley represent.",
      "Kiley announced he will introduce legislation Tuesday to nullify new House maps states adopt before the 2030 census, including any that might be approved this year.",
      "That would block the ongoing Texas effort and any potential push in California, his office said.",
      "\u201cGavin Newsom is trying to subvert the will of voters and do lasting damage to democracy in California,\u201d Kiley said in a statement Monday. \u201cFortunately, Congress has the ability to protect California voters using its authority under the Elections Clause of the U.S. Constitution. This will also stop a damaging redistricting war from breaking out across the country.\u201d",
      "Lawler, a fellow second-term Republican who represents a swing district, also said he will introduce legislation to prohibit gerrymandering in every state.",
      "\u201cGerrymandering is wrong and should be banned everywhere \u2014 including in New York, Texas, California, and Illinois. I\u2019m introducing legislation to ban it,\u201d Lawler said Monday on X, inviting Democrats to sign on.",
      "Still, it\u2019s unlikely that House Republican leaders would allow a vote on any legislation to limit partisan redistricting. That would be an about-face from the party\u2019s long-standing view that Washington shouldn't impose any such limits on states. The office of Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., didn't immediately comment on the idea.",
      "Speaking to reporters recently in the Capitol, Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., chair of House Republicans\u2019 campaign operation this cycle, kept his distance from the Texas push and wouldn\u2019t say whether he supports it.",
      "\u201cWell, it\u2019s up to the states. I mean, I have nothing to do with it. I found out about it when you all wrote about it,\u201d Hudson said. Asked whether he\u2019s worried about California retaliating, he replied: \u201cI\u2019m not concerned. Some of the states, they can do what they want to do.\u201d",
      "Newsom has mounted an aggressive push in recent days, on podcasts and social media, to build support for doing away with California's redistricting commission and allowing the state\u2019s supermajority-Democratic Legislature to draw its own maps for House districts. He even reposted a user\u2019s hypothetical suggestion to create an extremely gerrymandered map with 52 Democratic-friendly seats, which would knock out all nine Republicans currently representing California, including Kiley.",
      "And Democrats in Washington have tried to pass legislation to prohibit partisan gerrymandering, some of it in recent years during the Biden administration. A section of the sweeping For the People Act of 2021 would have required all states to set up independent redistricting commissions with balanced partisan representation. Democrats passed it in the House along party lines during the Biden administration, but a different version of the bill failed to overcome a Senate GOP filibuster.",
      "Fighting to win back the majority and become speaker, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has turned his focus to combating the GOP\u2019s efforts in Texas in recent weeks. On Capitol Hill, Jeffries privately met with members of the California congressional delegation to discuss options for responding to Texas Republicans, a Democratic lawmaker said.",
      "Last week, Jeffries traveled to the Texas State Capitol in Austin to meet with Democrats in both the congressional delegation and the statehouse to draw attention to the matter. He said the Texas special legislative session should have focused on fixing the state\u2019s broken energy grid and \u201crelief, recovery and resiliency\u201d in the wake of deadly floods in the Hill Country.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump has ordered Greg Abbott and compliant Texas Republicans to race back to Austin have a special session in order to rig the congressional map and undermine the ability of Texans to have a free and fair midterm election. That is wrong,\u201d Jeffries said at a news conference, flanked by Democrats.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an all-hands-on-deck moment, and all options should be on the table to protect the people of Texas,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe will fight them politically. We will fight them governmentally. We will fight them in court. We will fight them in terms of winning the hearts and minds of the people of Texas and beyond.\u201d",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said that if Republicans use the redistricting tactic, Democrats must fight with the same firepower.",
      "\u201cI hate what Texas is doing. But if they\u2019re going to do it, of course we have to fight back,\u201d Murphy told NBC News. \u201cDemocracies die when the regime plays outside the box and the opposition decides to stay inside the box. So as norms change, we can\u2019t just cry about it complain about it. We\u2019ve got to fight fire with fire.\u201d",
      "Another Democrat, Rep. Mark Takano of California, who is set to become chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee again if Democrats take back the House next year, said he\u2019s confident California voters would have Democrats\u2019 backs if they pursue mid-decade redistricting.",
      "\u201cThe voters of California are pretty clear that ... not just California but the future of our country is harmed by Donald Trump not having any checks put on him,\u201d Takano said. \u201cI think California is very interested in seeing a check being put on Donald Trump\u2019s power; he\u2019s voracious. He doesn\u2019t see any limits to himself. It\u2019s all very personal to him, and it\u2019s, frankly, just corrupt.\u201d"

      "The Department of Homeland Security will update visa policies to prevent transgender women from traveling to the United States to participate in elite women\u2019s sporting events.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services issued guidance Monday intended to bar trans women athletes from obtaining \u201cextraordinary ability\u201d visas to compete in female sports, the conservative news website The Daily Wire first reported. The guidance builds on an executive order President Donald Trump issued during the early weeks of the second term of his presidency that intended to bar trans women from competing in female sports.",
      "The guidance doesn\u2019t use the word \u201ctransgender\u201d or refer to trans women; rather, it refers to \u201cmale athletes\u201d who seek to compete in women\u2019s sports.",
      "Matthew Tragesser, a spokesperson for USCIS, said in a statement that the agency is \u201cclosing the loophole for foreign male athletes whose only chance at winning elite sports is to change their gender identity and leverage their biological advantages against women.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of safety, fairness, respect, and truth that only female athletes receive a visa to come to the U.S. to participate in women\u2019s sports,\u201d Tragesser said in the statement. \u201cThe Trump Administration is standing up for the silent majority who\u2019ve long been victims of leftist policies that defy common sense.\u201d",
      "The policy update applies to three visa categories for people who possess \u201cextraordinary ability\u201d in science, art, education, business or athletics. It also affects national interest waivers, which allow applicants to self-petition to waive the labor certification for green cards if they can show that their work serves the national interest.",
      "The updated guidance clarifies that USCIS \u201cconsiders the fact that a male athlete has been competing against women as a negative factor\u201d in determining whether they are among the top in the sport.",
      "The guidance adds that it is not in the national interest of the United States to waive the labor certification requirement for trans women athletes \u201cwhose proposed endeavor is to compete in women\u2019s sports.\u201d",
      "USCIS did not respond to a request for comment about how many people the new policy could affect or whether there are recent examples of trans female athletes\u2019 traveling to the United States under the affected visa categories.",
      "Within the NCAA, the nonprofit group that regulates college athletics, about 25,000 international student-athletes compete in NCAA sports out of the more than 500,000 total who compete each year, according to the association. While it is unclear how many NCAA athletes are trans, the association\u2019s president, Charlie Baker, told a Senate committee in December that he is aware of fewer than 10.",
      "The USCIS policy update may have affected athletes who planned to travel to Los Angeles for the 2028 Summer Olympics; however, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee barred trans women from competing in female sports last month.",
      "Only a handful of trans athletes have ever competed in the Olympics. Weightlifter Laurel Hubbard became the first out trans athlete to compete in the Olympics in the Tokyo Games in 2021, though she did not medal. American skateboarder Alana Smith and Canadian soccer star Quinn also competed in the Tokyo Games, and Quinn became the first nonbinary and trans athlete to ever medal when their team won gold that year."

She has said there is a conflict of interest because Netanyahu and several former aides face a series of criminal investigations.",

      "Almost 200 wildfires are burning out of control in Canada, including 81 in Saskatchewan, 159 in Manitoba and 61 in Ontario. Figures from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center indicate that more than 16.5 million acres have been scorched so far this year in what will likely be the country\u2019s second-worst wildfire season on record.",
      "A high-pressure system parked over the Midwest is  trapping the smoke in place, causing air quality issues to linger for several days, according to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.",
      "The air quality index Monday across 14 states in the Midwest and the Northeast ranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201cunhealthy\u201d for the general public.",
      "Wildfire smoke is of particular concern because it contains small particles that are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter \u2014 around 4% of the diameter of an average strand of human hair. This type of air pollution is dangerous because the particles are small enough to reach deep inside the lungs, which can exacerbate or increase the risk of asthma, lung cancer and other chronic lung diseases.",

      "Wiles, President Donald Trump\u2019s longtime adviser and his current chief of staff, was at the event to receive the party\u2019s \u201cStatesman of the Year\u201d award, its highest honor.",
      "\u201cI find it amazingly wonderful that almost every speaker has talked about voter registration and grassroots,\u201d she told the audience of party dignitaries. \u201cIt is the backbone of what we do and why we do it and why we win.\u201d",
      "As the evening went on, speaker after speaker hailed Wiles, with one calling her the \u201cmost powerful woman in the world.\u201d Along with her keynote address, the main portion of the weekend convention was dominated by figures in Trump\u2019s inner circle \u2014 some of whom had, like Wiles, previously worked for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis before publicly falling out with him.",
      "The lineup underpinned how abruptly the Florida GOP appears to have moved on from DeSantis, the man who had for the past five years been, by far, its most prominent figure and also was once named the party\u2019s \u201cStatesman of the Year.\u201d",
      "After DeSantis\u2019 dominating 2022 re-election bid, he quickly turned to flirting with a run for president, a move that left his power in Florida Republican circles nearly unchecked as most in the party were eager to hand the governor victories to boost his chances of getting the Republican nomination.",
      "But DeSantis lost to Trump, who also calls Florida home. And over the weekend here, it became clear that not only has Trump taken over the Republican Party at the national level, but the state party has also fully gotten on board.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, this is Donald Trump\u2019s \u2014 not Ron DeSantis\u2019 \u2014 GOP,\u201d an adviser to the Florida GOP said. \u201cAnyone who thinks otherwise has not paid attention since Iowa. Voters are ready to move forward and not focus on figures of the past.\u201d",
      "\u201cFlorida will continue to be the national standard bearer, with or without Ron DeSantis,\u201d the person added.",
      "That sentiment was palpable over the weekend at the Rosen Shingle Creek hotel that hosted the Florida GOP event.",
      "Along with Wiles, Trump deputy chief of staff James Blair, a  former DeSantis administration official, addressed the audience, as did Tony Fabrizio, Trump\u2019s top pollster, who was joined on stage by Chris LaCivita, the co-manager of Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign.",
      "Not only was the Trump theme overwhelming at the event, the feeling of the party moving on was made more acute because many who were given prime speaking slots were those with whom DeSantis has had public feuds in the past \u2014 most notably Wiles. LaCivita also spent much of the early phases of the 2024 presidential campaign attacking DeSantis, including calling him a \u201csad little man.\u201d",
      "DeSantis did give a well-received speech at the event, but was given a 2 p.m. speaking time, which was well before the main dinner speeches that featured the Trump-heavy lineup.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure he was not thrilled by it,\u201d said a former DeSantis adviser who remains an ally of the governor. \u201cHe had to notice, it was hard not to. But I would point to his polling numbers. He\u2019s still a very popular figure with Florida Republicans.\u201d",
      "In July, a poll from the University of North Florida (UNF) had DeSantis\u2019 approval marginally rating higher than Trump\u2019s, 83% to 82%, with both remaining overwhelmingly popular with Republican voters in the state.",
      "But along with his diminished presence at the state party event where he was once the star, DeSantis for the first time since first being elected in 2018 received significant pushback from the state\u2019s Republican-dominated Legislature earlier this year on an immigration measure \u2014 a move that sent clear signals that his stock with Florida Republican leaders is dropping.",
      "His status in his own state will also continue to be challenged in the 2026 midterms, as he struggles to find a candidate he can support to replace him as governor.",
      "The current front-runner is Rep. Byron Donalds, who was quickly endorsed by Trump and has amassed an early war chest of more than $22 million. Many of DeSantis\u2019 supporters have publicly attacked Donalds, who has not yet returned fire, and there is little expectation that DeSantis will endorse his campaign.",
      "The most prominent name to consider getting in the race has been DeSantis\u2019 wife, Casey DeSantis, but after months of speculation, she does not appear poised to make any announcement in the near future.",
      "Polling had Casey DeSantis and Donalds neck and neck, but after Trump\u2019s endorsement, Donalds quickly cut into what was once her dominating lead.",
      "\u201cCasey DeSantis was an early favorite when we asked about this in fall of 2023 with 22%, ahead of Donalds with 9%, and 40% undecided, but after Trump\u2019s endorsement of Donalds and as we get closer to August 2026, DeSantis\u2019 lead has all but disappeared,\" Michael Binder, head of UNF\u2019s polling department, said in late July. It\u2019s \"now inside the margin of error for this poll,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "We don\u2019t always have the answers, but we have some people on speed dial who do \u2014 which is why we present to you our series FYI where we have experts explain if lip balm is actually bad, how often you should wash your hair and more.",
      "French onion soup? Delicious. Adding a grilled onion to your burger? Chef\u2019s kiss. The latest TikTok trend? Incorporating onions into a hair care routine. Yup, you read that right. Onion extract in shampoo may actually be beneficial for your strands, according to experts.",
      "\u201cOnions are naturally antimicrobial while rich in sulfur and antioxidants so there is truth in onion being potentially helpful as an ingredient in hair products,\u201d says Dr. Anna Chacon, a board-certified dermatologist in Miami, Florida. Because of this, there are a number of shampoos on the market that list onion extract as one of their primary ingredients.",
      "Below, we spoke to experts about the potential benefits associated with onion shampoo, whether you can use it if you have color-treated hair and more \u2014 plus, gathered a few highly rated options for you to shop.",
      "What is onion shampoo?",
      "Onion shampoo is exactly what it sounds like \u2014 shampoo that has onion as a main ingredient. Though it may sound funky, the experts we spoke to agree that onion extract can help hair health. \u201cOnion contains sulfur, which is a key building block for keratin, the protein that makes up your hair,\u201d says Dr. Ross Kopelman, a hair transplant surgeon at Kopelman Hair Restoration. \u201cIt also has antimicrobial properties that can support a healthier scalp environment. Some studies suggest it may increase blood flow to the scalp and reduce inflammation, which are both important for hair health.\u201d",
      "Most commonly, hair products with this vegetable are aimed at helping with hair thinning and encouraging growth. One clinical trial even found that when onion extract was applied topically, it helped people with alopecia areata (an autoimmune disorder that causes hair loss) with regrowth. \u201cWhile we need more research, I\u2019ve seen some patients benefit when using onion-based treatments as part of a broader hair care routine,\u201d says Kopelman.",
      "The perks may sound great, but worried that onion shampoo will leave you smelling like the deli counter? Don\u2019t be. While onion extract may be a primary ingredient, the shampoos available that use it also have other beneficial (and pleasant-smelling) ingredients, such as lavender or rosemary.",
      "Can anyone use onion shampoo?",
      "In general, over-the-counter shampoos with onion extract are gentle and sulfate-free, so they should be safe for just about everyone to use. That said, if you have color-treated hair, you may want to think twice. \u201cOnions are acidic, so using them on color-treated hair can disrupt the delicate PH balance needed to prolong the look of freshly colored hair,\u201d says Chacon. \u201cAvoiding the shaft of the treated hair and concentrating at the scalp is an option but be sure to patch test to ensure you don\u2019t have any scalp sensitivity.\u201d",
      "Chacon also recommends that those with sensitive skin proceed with caution. \u201cThe smell could also be a hindrance here as well as the effect onions have on the eyes and the close proximity of the scalp to the eyes,\u201d says Chacon. \u201cInstead, I would opt for rosemary oil \u2014 which is an alternative natural ingredient that has all of the antifungal, growth promoting effects but with a pleasant scent.\u201d",
      "Finally, if you are allergic to anything in the allium family (like onions or garlic), it\u2019s best to skip this type of shampoo. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a few cases of contact dermatitis from poorly formulated onion shampoos,\u201d says Kopelman. \u201cAlso, if you have eczema or active scalp inflammation, it\u2019s best to consult with a specialist before adding anything new to your regimen.\u201d",

      "The unsolved fatal shootings of four teenage girls inside of a yogurt shop in Austin, Texas, more than three decades ago are getting a renewed spotlight in a new HBO docuseries.",
      "The first episode of \"The Yogurt Shop Murders\" premiered on Aug. 3, and shows how the unsolved murders of Eliza Thomas, Jennifer Harbison, Sarah Harbison and Amy Ayers in 1991 have continued to traumatize those close to the case.",
      "The series features archival footage from Austin filmmaker Claire Huie, who sat for interviews for the doc and described her work making a film about the case, though she never finished it.",
      "\"The yogurt shop murders was like a ghost story that people told,\" Huie said in the first episode. \"It was always told in hushed tones: 'This happened here.' Partly because nobody has all the details, also because it was never solved. This case was so big in Austin, it was exciting to work on a film about it, even if I didn't really know what I was doing.\"",
      "Investigators, the victims' families and the two men who served time for the crime \u2014 though their murder convictions were overturned and the murder charges against them were dismissed in 2009 \u2014 were also interviewed in the series.",
      "\"For one, it's been 30 years, seven months and five days and I still can't believe it,\" Bob Ayers, the father of victim Ayers said in the first episode of the doc.",

      "The store was set on fire after the girls were killed, which damaged key evidence in the case, in addition to water damage from when firefighters arrived to put out the blaze, the Austin American-Statesman reported at the time.",

      "A judge later released both men on bond, and in 2009, prosecutors moved to dismiss all charges against Springsteen and Scott.",

      "\"And then 17 years earlier, a mother is in the Philadelphia airport and she tragically loses her child,\" she continues. \"It's how all these women's lives come together and collide, but it is a story that explores connection and the feeling of being seen \u2014 and not seen \u2014 when you are a teenager and when you're an adult, and it is about that yearning to belong.\"",
      "Nanami Strenner says the opening pages of the book were inspired by times she's been in foreign airports with her own daughter, and her fears of the worst case scenario.",
      "\"I've been in that situation so many times with my own daughter ... and I just remember being in really far flung countries where sometimes the people there didn't speak English, and I couldn't speak their language,\" Nanami Strenner says. \"It would be the most terrifying thing that she would get away from me and I wouldn't be able to do anything.\"",
      "\"I allowed myself to consider the worst case scenario in that which is what led me to the beginning of the novel,\" she adds. \"What if I was powerless and I didn't have language, and I had no means and ... I was in this situation where I was completely rendered helpless and unable to find the most precious thing in my life?\"",
      "Nanami Strenner says she began to get the idea for the full novel when she looked on how much time she's spent in airports in her own life, growing up in England before living in Japan, Vietnam and more, before landing in Philadelphia before the pandemic.",

      "Nanami Strenner started writing the book in 2020, and would wake up every day at 5 a.m. to have two full hours of writing time before her daughter woke up until the first draft was completed.",
      "\"This is the most disciplined I've ever been in my life, and it's sort of not been fully repeated since,\" she jokes.",
      "One of the themes Nanami Strenner hopes readers explore after finishing \"My Other Heart\" is the question of nature versus nurture.",
      "\"From a parental point of view, that\u2019s really interesting, because we know so much more now about the impact of parents on children as they grow up,\" she says. \"But also, ideal nature versus how everything else has shaped us, I think that\u2019s a really interesting idea. That\u2019s actually at the center of the book too.\"",
      "\"Kit, for example, is a product of the society that she\u2019s brought up in, but she knows the nature inside is slightly different, because she\u2019s had this ambiguity about her background,\" she continues. \"And I think that\u2019s something that people could really sink their teeth into.\"",

      "\"I feel like I am a person, in hopefully a healthy way, that finds themselves inspired by or interested in human stories of trauma,\" she says.",
      "In recent years, she\u2019s found herself telling stories about people, often women, after the hardest moments of their lives, whether it\u2019s through her \u201c9-1-1\u201d character; as Julie James in the sequel to \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d; or as the narrator of the new docuseries \u201cA Killer Among Friends.\u201d",
      "Hewitt says in an interview with TODAY.com, she found herself exploring this theme again and again \"by accident.\" But the similarities between her roles have never been more stark.",
      "In 2025's \"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\" Julie has long left Southport and is now a divorc\u00e9e college psychology professor specializing in the study of \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 trauma. But she's drawn back into the fray by Ava (Chase Sui Wonders), one of the group of 20-somethings being terrorized by the next killer to take up the fisherman's mantle.",
      "Without sharing too many spoilers, the film's ambitious finale sees Julie return to Southport for the first time after years of avoiding it \u2014 and face a killer once again. (She quite literally voices her mettle with a reprise of her line, \"What are you waiting for, huh?\")",
      "\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" hit theaters July 18. That same week, another one of Hewitt's projects hit the small screen.",
      "Hewitt is the narrator and executive producer of Investigation Discovery's \"A Killer Among Friends.\" The docuseries premiered July 14, with new episodes airing each Monday on ID and streaming the next day on HBO Max.",
      "The premiere episode, \"Killer on Campus,\" follows the 1994 slaying of University of Kentucky student Trent DiGiuro, which was the subject of a \"Dateline\" investigation in March 2019. The first scene shows one of DiGiuro's friends, Sean, return for the first time to the off-campus house where DiGiuro was murdered.",
      "Introducing the episode and the group of students at the center of it, Hewitt says, \"In the real world you never truly know who you can trust. Something evil was coming for them.\" Each episode will follow a friend group \"haunted by a murder of one of their own,\" the logline reads.",
      "\u201c(Trauma) seems to be a theme for me, and I\u2019m not really sure why,\u201d Hewitt says. \u201cI seem to gravitate towards it. Or it seems to be my universal lesson. So I embrace it.\u201d",
      "A Role She's Never Filled",
      "\"A Killer Among Friends\" seemingly relates to the original premise of \"I Know What You Did Last Summer.\" Even the posters for both projects feature a similar style, down to the title's font size and shape.",
      "\"I think that's probably why they thought of me, because I haven't really been in the true crime space. I've definitely produced things before, but I've never been a narrator,\" Hewitt says.",
      "Hewitt's narration moves the story along. She introduces each episode's central conceit, and if you hear her voice mid-episode, prepare for a plot twist or major reveal.",
      "I think trauma has been seen as a weakness. And I think my goal ... in being the narrator of this show and showing how these people have continued to live life because they got the chance to \u2014 you know, trauma can also be a strength.",
      "Jennifer Love Hewitt",
      "Becoming the narrator involved learning a brand-new skill, \"taking your face completely out of it, and trying with your voice to convey strength and fear,\" she says.",
      "\"I've been doing this business now for 36 years, and so to find something new that I haven't tried yet was exciting for me,\" she adds.",
      "But she has a confession.",
      "\u201cTruth be told, because I like to keep it real, I\u2019m not a big true crime watcher,\u201d she says. \u201cOnly because I get very freaked out by things very easily, and I\u2019m a mom of three children, so I just like to not go there sometimes.",
      "But reading the stories of the sources in \"A Killer Among Friends\" felt different, she says.",
      "\"It felt like these were stories that really held onto and captured an innocence and a human condition and a heart condition in the true crime space that maybe I hadn't really seen before,\" she says.",
      "\"I felt like that was what I could attach to,\" she continues, \"the vulnerability of our youth and the friend group angle in all of these stories, with these friends grappling with these things and being left behind and all these unanswered questions.\"",
      "Though the job marks a first for Hewitt, she cites one of her past roles with preparing her for the task: Melinda Gordon from \"Ghost Whisperer.\" In the CBS drama, which aired from 2005 to 2010, Melinda communicated with spirits and helped bring closure to people who had lost loved ones.",
      "\"I really did think about her a lot when I was narrating this,\" Hewitt says. \"My job in this was to not be on top of the story, or overdo the story, but to really just service these people's stories and endings, however sad they might be. But to also somehow pay respect and provide closure.\"",
      "She also sees similarities between the narrator role and her \"9-1-1\" character, Maddie, who works as a Los Angeles dispatcher on the ABC drama.",
      "\"Sometimes people pick on me for Maddie being a crier as a dispatcher, and I always have to say, 'It's a TV show. I'm supposed to be giving you emotion.' I know that if I really worked at 911, I would not be able to sob with people all the time,\" she says.",
      "But it was thinking about the reality of the dispatcher job that helped her while recording her lines in the booth.",
      "\"There were definitely a couple of times where I was reading things in the booth where I felt myself wanting to be emotional about it, and in my mind, had to remind myself that this was not the place,\" she says. \"I could feel that way later.\"",

      "Narrating \"A Killer Among Friends\" was far from easy.",
      "\"Knowing these stories are out there and happening to people, your heart breaks,\" Hewitt says.",
      "Asked how she puts that heaviness aside at the end of the day, Hewitt is blunt: \"When you have three children, there is no unwinding.\"",
      "Hewitt and husband Brian Hallisay became parents in 2013 after welcoming daughter Autumn. She went on to have two sons, Atticus, born in 2015, and Aidan in 2021.",
      "\"People ask me this question all the time about '9-1-1,'\" she says. \"You literally go from darkness into sneezing out rainbows and Skittles. That is just your job.\"",
      "\"But I do think that there is, thank God, a beautiful lift and light that is provided by my kids at the ends of days when I have to do heavy things, that I'm very grateful for,\" she adds.",
      "Hewitt says after finishing filming for \"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\" she went straight to narrating \"A Killer Among Friends,\" all while still filming for \"9-1-1\" Season 8. (As of at least July 24, filming for Season 9 is notably underway, per social media posts shared by the cast.)",
      "It was this summer, in the course of doing interviews for the various projects, that Hewitt says she's recognized the connecting factor of trauma in her work \u2014\u00a0Julie James as an \"active trauma live-r\"; Maddie, a survivor of kidnapping (twice!), postpartum depression, fire and more; a narrator who \"pushes past my trauma of having to know these stories.\"",
      "\"I'm 46 years old, I don't know that I would have put that piece together before now,\" she says.",
      "And there's her own trauma, which she says she experiences \"all the time, in little, tiny ways.\"",
      "\"My children have had trauma growing up in COVID and fires in L.A. and all those things,\" she says. \"I mean I just think it is something that we all have.\"",
      "Her approach to finding opportunities is to stay open.",
      "\"I don't look super hard for the things that I'm in or that I'm a part of,\" she says. \"I really try to just stay open and know that the right things will find me, and they have so far.\"",
      "While she didn't explicitly seek out stories of trauma, she's found power in each story's message. And she describes connecting to these roles, specifically to women \"strong in their broken pieces,\" like it's a purpose, a calling.",
      "\"I think trauma has been seen as a weakness,\" Hewitt says. \"And I think my goal ... in being the narrator of this show and showing how these people have continued to live life because they got the chance to\u00a0\u2014 you know, trauma can also be a strength.\"",
      "\"I think it is a beautiful, beautiful vulnerability to be able to say, 'I have trauma, and I make it work for me every day,'\" she adds. \"'Trauma and I hold hands, and we walk right on through it.' ... Hopefully I'm able to show, yes, they get knocked down, but they also get right back up.\""

    "story": [
      "Jinkx Monsoon is taking Broadway by storm. Literally.",
      "From portraying Mama Morton in \"Chicago\" to most recently playing a bawdy pirate maid in the Tony-nominated musical \"Pirates! The Penzance Musical,\" Monsoon has been racking up stage accolades in spades, including a recent Drama League Award nomination among others.",
      "But according to the two-time winner of \"RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\" competitions, while trophies are nice, they aren't everything.",
      "\"Awards are great, and I've won a handful of awards in my life, and I want to win more,\" Monsoon says during a sit-down conversation with TODAY.com. \"But I've learned to not treat them like they are the end-all, be-all of things.\"",
      "Even so, Monsoon could very well be looking at scoring another one as she steps into the role of Mary Todd Lincoln in the hit Broadway show \"Oh, Mary!\"",
      "Written by Cole Escola, the dark comedy spoofs the imagined life of Abraham Lincoln and his beleaguered wife, Mary, in the days leading up to Lincoln's assassination.",
      "Critically acclaimed, the show has already taken home two Tony Awards for best direction of a play and best performance by an actor in a leading role in a play. Escola took home the latter for their portrayal of Mary Todd Lincoln: something Monsoon says was initially daunting as she prepared to take over the role.",
      "\"Cole Escola created the show. It is their brainchild, and I've got to say, when I was watching it the very first time, I was sitting there thinking, 'Only Cole Escola could do this, it's written so well for them to perform.' And I'm sitting there thinking, 'No one but Cole could ever play this role this way,'\" she explains.",
      "But the further into \"Oh, Mary!\" Monsoon got, the more she realized that even though the show has what she calls Escola's \"DNA\" in it, the writing allowed for \"multiple perspectives,\" including that of Tituss Burgess. The \"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\" star played Mary Todd Lincoln after Escola's departure in June until Monsoon's shows in August.",
      "\"I just truly believe the writing is so good that as long as you know what you're doing when it comes to comedy, you can come in and really own this role completely independently from the past performances,\" she says."

      "But \u201cMayonaise\u201d almost didn't set the wistful tone for this intense moment, Han reveals. Instead, she says one person advocated for featuring Mazzy Star\u2019s classic \u201cFade Into You.\u201d",

      "Williams reflected on the moment during a July 29 episode of her podcast \u201cChecking In with Michelle Williams,\u201d sharing the behind-the-scenes story about how the reunion came to be, including the last-minute rehearsals and decisions to be made about the performance itself.",
      "During the rehearsals, Williams said she had one past incident from decades prior at the top of mind that kept her on edge.",
      "\u201cI was trying to stay focused because y\u2019all know I still have trauma from falling on \u2018106 & Park,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI need y\u2019all to be my therapist about that too because every time I perform with the girls, it\u2019s in my head, \u2018Do not fall. Do not fall. Do not fall.\u2019\u201d",
      "Williams cited the incident from more than 20 years prior when Destiny\u2019s Child appeared on \u201c106 & Park\u201d to promote their final studio album, \u201cDestiny Fulfilled.\u201d",
      "While performing their song \u201cSoldier\u201d on the show, Williams, Rowland and Beyonc\u00e9 were walking down the stage in unison when Williams tripped and fell. The singer quickly recovered and stood back up before diving into the dance moves, though the incident left an impression on Williams over the years.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s still in my head,\u201d she added. \u201cSteps do frighten me.\u201d",
      "Williams noted that in the Broadway musical \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d she has to descend steps during the show, though she noted that she has \u201ctwo gorgeous men on the right of me and the left of me holding my hand\u201d to help her down.",
      "\u201cDid I rehearse them steps? Sure did,\u201d Williams said, referring to her \u201cDeath Becomes Her\u201d steps. \u201cAnd then when it came to, I was like \u2018Oh my gosh, you dummy. You let fear or lack of trust on that first step,\u2019 because y\u2019all I\u2019m not going to let social media do me, because if that were to happen and I fell, I would not be able to live that down for the next 20 years.\u201d",
      "Williams said the only aspect of the reunion performance she didn't like was her lack of trust in the steps, citing her experience starring in \u201cDeath Becomes Her\u201d for over a year between performances in Chicago and on Broadway in New York City.",
      "\u201cThere are certain aspects of that stage that I know, I\u2019m comfortable. I don\u2019t have to look at certain marks,\u201d she explained. \u201c There are certain things that I know that I can hit because I\u2019m at home on that stage. I\u2019m not at home on the \u2018Cowboy Carter\u2019 stage, nope. And y\u2019all wasn\u2019t going to do me. So that\u2019s the only thing that I\u2019m like, \u2018You could have trusted that the steps were not going to let you down.\u2019\u201d",
      "Williams said that all of the necessary changes were made \u201cwardrobe wise\u201d to make sure she wouldn't tumble on the \u201cCowboy Carter Tour,\u201d including requesting for the fringe to be cut off of the pants she wore to reduce to risk of tripping and falling.",
      "Despite the fear of the moment she experienced, the singer said that everything fell back into place for the group, sharing, \u201cWe turned into little girls again, them teenage girls, those younger girls who just wanted to since, dance and travel the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd Beyonc\u00e9 was like \u2018Y\u2019all, let\u2019s have fun. We just going to go out there and have fun. Whatever happens, happens, but we\u2019re going to have fun,\u2019\u201d Williams added. \u201cI knew we were going to have fun, we always have fun, but when you come from Destiny\u2019s Child, and then when you see the level of excellence that Beyonc\u00e9 performs at, you step it up.\u201d",
      "There were no missed steps in sight during the reunion on the \u201cCowboy Carter Tour.\u201d",
      "The trio, who officially disbanded in 2006, were in lock step as they kicked off their performance with a synchronized strut to kick off \u201cLose My Breath.\u201d",
      "Their medley transitioned into Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cRenaissance\u201d track \u201cEnergy,\u201d including the mute challenge from last tour, before ending with their hit single \u201cBootylicious.\u201d"

      "It wasn't clear from Meloni's Instagram post if they were on the set of \"SVU,\" which recently started filming its 27th season, but they did appear to be in their \"Law & Order\" characters' attire. Another OG cast member, however, was seen on set this week filming.",
      "Former \u201cSVU\u201d star Dean Winters, who was also part of the show\u2019s Season 1 cast, was spotted on set July 31. His character, Brian Cassidy, had a fling with Benson in the first season and returned as a more permanent love interest for her after Stabler left. Benson and Cassidy eventually ended things for good, with Cassidy later saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to admit to me that you were never going to bare your soul to me.\u201d",
      "Benson\u2019s more recent potential love interest has been Stabler.",
      "The two nearly kissed in her kitchen back in Season 24, but they stopped at the last second, with their faces inches apart.",
      "\u201cElliot, I want to \u2014 I want to, but I can\u2019t,\u201d Benson said, adding she feared the repercussions if a romantic relationship didn\u2019t work between them.",
      "\u201cAnd what if things work out?\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cElliot, I\u2019m not ready for this,\u201d she responded. \u201cI\u2019m not ready for this.\u201d",
      "Since that scene aired, both actors have respectively spoken out about it, revealing what fans saw on TV that night wasn\u2019t how the scene was supposed to play out.",
      "\u201cTo be honest with you, Chris and I thought it should go one way and the powers that be didn\u2019t, so it got changed at the last minute, that near kiss,\u201d Hargitay said in a May 2024 interview with Variety. \u201cObviously, Dick (Wolf, the show\u2019s creator) gets final say. It\u2019s his show and he didn\u2019t want that.\u201d",
      "Meloni addressed the near kiss in a panel discussion with TVLine and fans in April.",
      "\u201cWe were attempting something. I don\u2019t think it worked. But I\u2019m not going to tell you why it didn\u2019t work, because you all have your opinion; I know what transpired,\u201d he said.",
      "Meloni also said he has \u201cno idea\u201d what will ultimately happen with the characters and that those creative decisions are above him and Hargitay.",
      "He did, however, have some creative control over \u201cLaw & Order: Organized Crime\u201d in Season 5 when he wrote an episode Hargitay guest starred in.",
      "\u201cI intentionally wrote this because when she and I are together, I inevitably rewrite it, and not out of \u2014 you know, just simply because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone alive that knows the relationship as intimately and as well as I do. Or she does,\u201d he told TODAY.com in April.",
      "Meloni also said the humor he infused into some of Benson and Stabler\u2019s scenes, including one in which Stabler jokes to Benson she can watch him get naked, was \u201ca nod to the fans.\u201d"

      "But humanitarian organizations say the amount of aid that has entered the enclave is not enough, and without more food, growing numbers of Palestinians will die from hunger.",
      "NBC News takes a look at how much aid has entered Gaza in the week since Israel announced the new system, and how that stacks up to the needs of the population.",
      "A tally of aid",
      "Humanitarian aid is entering Gaza in three ways: airdrops, distribution by the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and through the United Nations and other aid organizations\u2019 using the newly formed \u201chumanitarian corridors\u201d the Israeli military put in place last week.",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which began distributing aid  in the enclave in late May, has been widely condemned for the hundreds of people killed, often by Israeli soldiers, near its aid sites, and for its limited distribution.",
      "Last Sunday, GHF distributed around 1 million meals and at least another 1.2 million from Monday to Wednesday, and 1.3 million on Thursday. GHF did not appear to publish the number of meals distributed on Friday, but on Saturday said it released at least 1.7 million meals.",
      "In a population of roughly 2 million people, that averages out to around half a meal to just under a full meal per person per day.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military branch responsible for overseeing aid into Gaza, said Sunday that a total of 1,200 aid trucks had entered the enclave over the past week and that the same number had been collected by the United Nations and other aid organizations. It said that \"hundreds of trucks remain inside Gaza\" and were still waiting to be picked up.",
      "Before Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza began, around 500 trucks carrying aid were entering the enclave daily, according to the British Red Cross and other organizations.",
      "The below graph shows how the amount of aid entering Gaza soared during the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas before it stopped during Israel's blockade, with only a trickle entering in the months after it was lifted.",
      "Asked for the number of trucks allowed into Gaza and collected by humanitarian groups on Friday and Saturday, COGAT did not immediately respond.",
      "While COGAT has shared information about trucks entering Gaza and being collected by aid groups on its social media pages over the past week, it has not updated its online dashboard for aid into Gaza since Monday, despite international focus on the matter.",
      "According to the World Food Program, only about two-thirds of the amount of food the U.N. organization has requested Israeli authorities allow into Gaza had been approved as of Thursday since the Israeli military began tactical pauses.",
      "How Israeli restrictions caused the hunger crisis",
      "The hunger crisis in Gaza drastically worsened in March after Israel imposed a blockade barring the entry of aid into Gaza, in the midst of its ceasefire with Hamas.",
      "Israel lifted the crippling blockade in May, but for months, it has allowed only a limited amount of aid to enter the enclave, most of which has been distributed by the U.S.- and Israel-backed group known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "COGAT did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accusation that the amount of aid entering Gaza is not enough. It has previously accused humanitarian groups, including the United Nations, of exacerbating hunger by failing to collect and distribute aid to Palestinians fast enough.",
      "However, humanitarian organizations have said efforts to distribute the limited aid they\u2019ve been able to get into Gaza has been hampered by Israeli restrictions. They\u2019ve also emphasized that even after Israel vowed to lift some restrictions last Sunday, the amount of aid entering the enclave remains limited.",
      "Meanwhile WFP has said it needs faster approvals and clearances to move trucks inside Gaza safely, as well as for Israeli military members to adhere to the \u201cestablished rules of engagement,\u201d including having no armed presence or shooting near humanitarian convoys, food distributions and operations.",
      "What is needed?",
      "\u201cThis is not an adequate response,\u201d Jeanette Bailey, the International Rescue Committee\u2019s global practice lead and director of research for nutrition, said in a phone interview on Wednesday.",
      "A gradual entry of aid \u201chere or there,\u201d she said, \u201cis not going to be adequate to prevent us from entering into a full-blown famine where the numbers of deaths go way, way up.\u201d"

      "While lion hunting is not illegal in Zimbabwe, Blondie\u2019s killing was because he was under the country\u2019s minimum age of 6, according to Eduardo Gon\u00e7alves, the organization\u2019s founder.",
      "\u201cBlondie was a father, a leader, a national treasure, not a plaything for a rich Westerner with a gun,\u201d Gon\u00e7alves said. \u201cGovernments must act now.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis allegation that these people are saying the lion was less than 6 years? We don\u2019t know that. Was there any DNA which was taken to prove that the lion was less than 6 years? The answer is definitely no,\u201d Tinashe Farawo told NBC News.",
      "This claim was backed up by Michael Blignaut, co-owner of Victoria Falls Safari Service, the company allegedly behind the killing of Blondie.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately at this time I cannot comment,\u201d he told NBC News via the WhatsApp messaging service. \u201cI wanna assure you the hunt was done ethically and it was legal.\u201d",
      "The identity of the hunter, who presumptively paid thousands of dollars to kill the lion, has not been released.",
      "But Farawo denied that anything illegal happened, and said these sorts of hunts paid for conservation efforts.",

      "At the time, Palmer said he had the correct permits, worked with local guides, and had no reason to question the legitimacy of the hunt until after it was over.",
      "Zimbabwean authorities charged Theo Bronchorst, a professional hunter who allegedly took Palmer on the hunt, but later dropped them. Cecil was also being tracked by researchers at the University of Oxford\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit.",

      "Plastic production is on course to triple by 2060, less than 10% of it is recycled, and around 8,000 megatons now pollute the planet, according to a review of recent studies published Sunday by The Lancet.",
      "That causes harm at every stage of its lifecycle: from the extraction of fossil fuels and production to its use by humans and eventual disposal into the environment, the British publication said.",
      "\u201cPlastics are a grave, growing, and under-recognised danger to human and planetary health,\u201d it said. \u201cPlastics cause disease and death from infancy to old age\u201d and are \u201ccontributing to climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss.\u201d",

      "Sunday\u2019s release marked the start of a new monitoring system called \u201cThe Lancet Countdown on health and plastics,\u201d which it says will track political attempts to combat the problem.",
      "It was launched to coincide with the latest and final round of talks in Geneva, where 175 countries are trying to forge the world\u2019s first Global Plastics Treaty.",
      "Campaigners hope the talks, running Tuesday through Aug. 14, will result in mandatory targets to reduce plastic production. A group of countries, including China, Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia, have opposed the measures, instead lobbying for increased plastic recycling.",
      "According to The Lancet, such petrochemical giants are a \u201ckey driver\u201d of spiraling plastic production as they pivot their businesses toward plastic in response to the global decline in demand for fossil energy.",
      "Different plastics are made from up to 16,000 chemicals, which \u201center the human body via ingestion, inhalation, and dermal absorption,\u201d often from food and drink containers and packaging, the study said.",
      "Unborn babies, infants and young children are \u201cespecially at risk,\u201d with harms including miscarriage, physical malformations, reduced cognitive function and diabetes, it said. For adults, the risks include cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer.",

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 A 12-year-old Chinese swimmer has become a global sensation with her history-making times, even as observers and fans back home caution against overhyping the young athlete.",
      "On Thursday, Yu Zidi became the youngest-ever medalist at the World Aquatics Championships, which are being held in Singapore this year. On Sunday, she finished fourth in the women's 400 individual medley final.",
      "Yu was part of the Chinese team that took bronze in the women\u2019s 4x200-meter freestyle relay, with the United States winning silver and Australia winning gold. Though she did not compete in the final, she received a medal because she swam in the qualifying race.",
      "\u201cI was really excited to join the relay. It felt great,\u201d Yu told reporters Thursday. \u201cThe World Championships are fun, and I hope to swim faster.\u201d",
      "The Chinese prodigy began swimming around age 6 just to beat the heat in her home province of Hebei. She said she never thought about becoming a professional athlete until a coach approached her at a swimming pool one day.",
      "\u201cAt the time, I thought: why not give training a try?\u201d Yu told Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency, in May.",
      "Yu, who is also the youngest person to medal at a major international competition since 1936, swims so fast that she qualified for the World Aquatics Championships even though the minimum age requirement is usually 14.",
      "She came close to medaling in three other events in Singapore, missing the podium by 0.06 seconds in the women\u2019s 200-meter medley Monday, 0.31 seconds in the women\u2019s 200-meter butterfly Thursday and 0.50 seconds in the women\u2019s 400-meter individual medley on Sunday.",
      "At the Chinese national championships in May, Yu finished the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 2:10.63, winning a silver medal and setting a world record in the event for any 12-year-old, male or female.",
      "Hailed as the world\u2019s greatest swimmer her age, Yu has been compared to phenoms such as Canada\u2019s Summer McIntosh, who won four golds in Singapore including the 400-meter medley. Though Yu came in fourth, she is already swimming that event about 15 seconds faster than McIntosh was at the same age.",
      "Her stunning performance before she\u2019s even a teenager has many wondering how she might shape competitive swimming in the years to come.",
      "But some Chinese sports fans and commentators have urged the public not to overhype the preteen rising star.",
      "Yu\u2019s sudden fame may expose her to \u201cdisproportionate\u201d pressure that could keep her from achieving her full potential, the state-backed digital news outlet Shanghai Observer said in an editorial Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe must let this 12-year-old grow her splash slowly into a wave,\u201d it said, adding that there is \u201cno need to rush into hero worship.\u201d",
      "The warning hinted at a shift in how China promotes its elite athletes in the wake of persistent doping allegations and what has been criticized as a \u201ctoxic\u201d fan culture.",
      "Success at the highest levels of sport has been central to China\u2019s construction of national identity, with the government focused on  dominating medal tables at the Olympics and other events.",
      "But the push for gold medals also puts a lot of stress on the countries\u2019 star athletes, as does the intensity of public scrutiny.",
      "Organized sports fandom first emerged around 2016 when Chinese social media users, jaded by sex scandals that had tarnished the wholesome image of pop stars they previously adored, began following Olympic athletes instead, said Zhang Bin, a veteran sports commentator in China.",
      "The new fans brought \u201csophisticated strategies\u201d from the entertainment industry, setting off \u201cfandom wars\u201d among different groups that tried to outdo each other in supporting their athletes, Zhang said.",
      "China\u2019s extreme sports fan culture, which can include fan mobs, cyberbullying of athletes and heckling behavior at sports events, was especially visible around the Paris Olympics last year.",
      "When gold-medal-winning diver Quan Hongchan returned to her hometown, visitors flocked to her home for days. Some livestreamed with their phones while others flew drones, and travel agencies even started offering tours of her village.",
      "Pan Zhanle, an Olympic champion swimmer, was praised for disbanding his official fan group after his success at the Paris Games overwhelmed him with a surge of new followers.",
      "The Chinese government has been cracking down, with its cyberspace watchdog saying in April that it had shut down over 3,700 social media accounts with illegal or noncompliant content aimed at Chinese athletes.",
      "But sometimes the frenzy goes beyond the internet. Chinese table tennis player Fan Zhendong, an Olympic gold medalist, said he was traumatized when a stranger sneaked into his hotel room in 2023.",
      "\u201cI never thought, as an athlete, I would have to go through something like this,\u201d he told Phoenix TV last week, adding that organized online abuse had caused him \u201csevere\u201d mental stress that contributed to several unexpected losses.",
      "Since sports prodigies naturally attract followers, fan groups could also be a concern for Yu in the future, said Zhang, who was at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore.",
      "China is often overprotective of its athletes, but it \u201cmay not be a good thing if Yu is living in isolation like protected giant pandas,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor athletes, learning to interact with the media is a necessary part of their development,\u201d Zhang added.",
      "Jessie Zhou, 23, a graduate student in Hong Kong who closely follows table tennis star Fan, said it was a \u201cgood call\u201d for Chinese media to cover Yu in a \u201crestrained tone\u201d while extreme sports fandom remains unresolved.",
      "\u201cJust let the kid stay focused on training,\u201d Zhou said."

      "\"The driver became concerned when he noticed the bag moving,\" he said. \"When the driver opened the suitcase, they discovered the two-year-old girl.\"",
      "The toddler was taken to a hospital for an \"extensive medical assessment\" and was \"reported to be very hot, but otherwise appeared physically unharmed,\" Harrison said.",
      "The suspect, a 27-year-old woman whose name was not released, was arrested and charged with \"ill-treatment/neglect\" of a child, he said. Further charges are not being ruled out, he added.",
      "She is due in court Monday, Harrison said.",
      "It is not clear why the toddler was in a suitcase. Entrada Travel Group, which operates New Zealand's national bus line, InterCity, acknowledged that the incident involved one of its buses.",
      "The bus line says online that children up to 2 years old travel free if they do so on a guardian's lap. Children 3 and older may travel with guardians, but that requires a child ticket, usually sold at a deeply discounted rate.",
      "\"We are aware of an incident involving a passenger on one of our services,\" Entrada Travel Group said by email. \"Police were called to respond and are investigating the matter. No one was harmed during the incident, and the service resumed.\"",
      "It said it could not comment further amid the ongoing investigation.",
      "Harrison praised the bus driver for being aware and taking action.",
      "\"We would like to acknowledge and commend the bus driver, who noticed something wasn\u2019t right and took immediate action, preventing what could have been a far worse outcome,\" he said.",
      "Kaiwaka is about 60 miles north of Auckland along the country's central artery, State Highway 1."

      "The seven world wins put Ledecky at the top of the chart for the most triumphs in a single event, as she passed her own record of six victories in the 1500 free and Sarah Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m of Sweden's six titles in the 50 butterfly.",
      "Ledecky said she didn't feel too much pressure coming into this race, satisfied with how she's been training all year.",
      "\"It's been a really great season and I think coming into tonight, no matter what the outcome was, I was gonna be really happy with my season,\" she told NBC Sports. \"And I think I just took the pressure off and allowed me to enjoy the race and kind of appreciate that moment.\"",

      "\u201cThat last 100 was pretty stressful,\u201d Ledecky said. \u201cLani was and Summer was right there.\u201d",
      "Ledecky clocked in at 8:05.62, Pallister at 8:05.98 and McIntosh 8:07.29. It was by far the closest worlds win of Ledecky's seven in the 800 free.",

      "Weeks of rising anger over Palestinians starving due to Israel's offensive and aid restrictions had reached all the way to the White House, with President Donald Trump lamenting the sight of emaciated children on the brink of starvation.",
      "On Friday, his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, entered Gaza in a rare visit by high-level U.S. officials to the besieged enclave.",
      "Accompanied by the Israeli military, Witkoff visited an aid distribution site in southern Gaza run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, where hundreds of Palestinians waited desperately behind barbed wire for food.",
      "\u201cIncredible feat!\u201d Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, who accompanied Witkoff, said in a post on X on Friday, after touring GHF's operations and speaking to \"folks on the ground.\"",
      "Palestinians and others inside Gaza have criticized the visit as a public relations stunt for GHF, whose aid distribution process has been marked by chaos, looting and deadly shootings, often by Israeli soldiers, that have killed hundreds of hungry Palestinians seeking aid.",
      "\u201cIt was a PR stunt, a controlled visit supervised and dictated by the Israeli military,\u201d Ellie Burgos, an American critical care nurse volunteering at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, told NBC News' crew on the ground. \u201cWhat they saw was not the reality.\u201d",
      "Burgos had earlier called for Witkoff to visit Gaza, urging him to witness the conditions on the ground for himself, but felt his limited tour did little to change the situation on the ground.",
      "\u201cFood is still incredibly difficult to find, people are still being shot at aid distribution sites, and violence continues,\u201d she said.",
      "On the day of the visit, at least 92 people were killed on Friday across Gaza, including 51 people who were seeking aid, Dr. Mohammed Saqr, director of nursing at Nasser Hospital, told NBC News.",
      "Mohamed Saddak, 47, who was hoping to collect food for his family of nine, told NBC News' crew that tanks had advanced toward him and others as they sought to receive aid.",
      "\u201cThey are constantly shooting at us,\u201d he said, \u201cfiring from tanks, and sometimes by drones.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News on the shootings at aid sites following Witkoff's visit.",
      "Israeli officials continued to deny claims of widespread hunger inside Gaza, though in a sign of shifting discourse, top U.S. officials have begun to acknowledge the crisis.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got little kids who are clearly starving to death,\u201d Vice President JD Vance told reporters on Monday.",
      "In a post on X, Witkoff said the visit's purpose was to give Trump a \"clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza.\"",
      "After Gaza, Witkoff on Saturday visited Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, where families of Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas were demanding that the Israeli government secure a deal to release the remaining hostages. Fifty hostages remain in Gaza, about 20 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "According to a statement by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, Witkoff told them, \u201cWe will get your children home and hold Hamas responsible for any bad acts on their part.\u201d He added, \u201cWe will do what\u2019s right for the Gazan people.\u201d",
      "The protests came after a video of an Israeli hostage in Gaza, Rom Braslavski, was released by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad on Thursday. A day later, Hamas released a video of another Israeli hostage, Evyatar David, showing him alive but frail. It is unclear when the videos were filmed.",
      "\u201cWe cannot endure even one more minute without bringing him home,\u201d Braslavski\u2019s cousin Adam Hajaj said in a statement. \u201cThis video tore my family apart!\u201d",
      "Huckabee, meanwhile, hailed GHF's distribution of over a million meals a day, which at Gaza's population of roughly 2 million people averages to half a meal per person per day.",
      "GHF stepped in to distribute food in the weeks after Israel lifted its nearly three-month total blockade on all food and supplies entering the enclave. But the aid GHF distributed, alongside some limited quantities by other international organizations, fell far short of the needs of the population. Last Sunday, Israel said it was expanding aid access into Gaza after outrage mounted over the widespread starvation and surging deaths from malnutrition.",
      "GHF runs four aid sites in Gaza, and even though it claims independence from any government, it runs the sites inside Israel's militarized zone with the backing of the Israeli military.",
      "Witnesses and aid agencies have decried the aid delivery process, which, according to the U.N., has resulted in deaths of nearly 1,400 people while collecting aid, including 859 in the vicinity of the GHF sites.",
      "The Israeli military and the GHF have acknowledged that some shots have been fired but said only as warnings.",
      "\u201cUS-backed Israeli forces and private contractors have put in place a flawed, militarized aid distribution system that has turned aid distributions into regular bloodbaths,\u201d New York-based Human Rights Watch said Friday.",
      "Burgos' colleague, Dr. Tom Adamkiewicz, urged the diplomats to see \"what\u2019s happening to the children, the families, to these young boys and women and men that are being basically shot at like rabbits.\""

    "story": [
      "BOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 Former Colombian President \u00c1lvaro Uribe was sentenced Friday to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and bribery in a historic case that gripped the South American nation and tarnished the conservative strongman\u2019s legacy.",
      "The sentence, which Uribe said will be appealed, followed a nearly six-month trial in which prosecutors presented evidence that he attempted to influence witnesses who accused the law-and-order leader of having links to a paramilitary group in the 1990s.",
      "\u201cPolitics prevailed over the law in sentencing,\u201d Uribe said after Friday\u2019s hearing.",
      "Uribe, 73, has denied any wrongdoing. He faced up to 12 years in prison after being convicted Monday.",
      "His attorney had asked the court to allow Uribe to remain free while he appeals the verdict. Judge Sandra Heredia on Friday said she did not grant the defense\u2019s request because it would be \u201ceasy\u201d for the former president to leave the country to \u201cevade the imposed sanction.\u201d",
      "Heredia also banned Uribe from holding public office for eight years and fined him about $776,000.",
      "Ahead of Friday\u2019s sentencing, Uribe posted on X that he was preparing arguments to support his appeal. He added that one must \u201cthink much more about the solution than the problem\u201d during personal crises.",
      "The appeals court will have until early October to issue a ruling, which either party could then challenge before Colombia\u2019s Supreme Court.",
      "The former president governed from 2002 to 2010 with strong support from the United States. He is a polarizing figure in Colombia, where many credit him for saving the country from becoming a failed state, while others associate him with human rights violations and the rise of paramilitary groups in the 1990s.",
      "Heredia on Monday said she had seen enough evidence to determine that Uribe conspired with a lawyer to coax three former paramilitary group members, who were in prison, into changing testimony they had provided to Ivan Cepeda, a leftist senator who had launched an investigation into Uribe\u2019s alleged ties to a paramilitary group.",
      "Uribe in 2012 filed a libel suit against Cepeda in the Supreme Court. But in a twist, the high court in 2018 dismissed the accusations against Cepeda and began investigating Uribe.",
      "Martha Pe\u00f1uela Rosales, a supporter of Uribe\u2019s party in the capital, Bogota, said she wept and prayed after hearing of the sentence. \u201cIt\u2019s an unjust sentence. He deserves to be free,\u201d she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Sergio Andr\u00e9s Parra, who protested against Uribe outside the courthouse, said the 12-year sentence \u201cis enough\u201d and, even if the former president appeals, \u201chistory has already condemned him.\u201d",
      "During Uribe\u2019s presidency, Colombia\u2019s military attained some of its biggest battlefield victories against Latin America\u2019s oldest leftist insurgency, pushing the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia into remote pockets and forcing the group\u2019s leadership into peace talks that led to the disarmament of more than 13,000 fighters in 2016."

      "\u201cIf you do what the body wants to do, which is to just drink and eat as much as possible the minute you see food, you can actually create these permanent imbalances that can cause things like heart failure or organ damage, because the body had to adapt to get to that starvation mode,\u201d NBC News medical contributor Dr. Kavita Patel, an internal medicine doctor, said.",
      "At the most severe stages of starvation, even giving a person water can push their body into failure, Patel said.",
      "What happens to the body when it\u2019s starving?",
      "Humans can generally go without any food or water for several days because the body finds a way to adapt in order to survive. First by feeding off of so-called glycogen stores \u2014 a starchy substance from carbohydrates that\u2019s stored in the liver and muscles. The body stores about 1,700 to 2,200 calories\u2019 worth of energy as glycogen.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the first thing your body goes for that can get you through without eating or any water for about several days, in some cases, maybe a little longer,\u201d Patel said.",
      "Once those glycogen stores are depleted, the body starts to break down fat for energy, but when that\u2019s gone, it turns to muscle. This is what causes the body to shrink and the starving person to assume a gaunt, hollow-cheeked look.Eventually the brain doesn\u2019t have the energy it needs to function, leading to irritability, mood swings and trouble concentrating.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to even just make sound judgments,\u201d Patel said. \u201cYou can see people have psychotic illusions. You can see people hearing things. All of that is basically the body\u2019s way of surviving.\u201d",
      "Most starving people die from infections as their immune system shuts down. Eventually, the heart will be affected, causing a person\u2019s blood pressure and pulse to drop. If they don\u2019t die from infection, the heart will shut down, doctors said.",
      "The more vulnerable parts of the population are likely to suffer the most. \u201cChildren \u2014 specifically infants \u2014 pregnant women, the elderly and people with certain kinds of chronic illness are the risk groups that we need to pay special attention to,\u201d said Dr. Irwin Redlener, a clinical professor of pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.",
      "How is starvation treated?",
      "Patel said a good analogy to giving food to a starving person is a downpour after a drought. The land desperately needs water, but because it\u2019s so dry it repels water instead of absorbing it, leading to flash flooding. \u201cRefeeding\u201d after starvation needs to be managed clinically and by medical professionals.",
      "\u201cWhen a person has reached a state of starvation, the body undergoes extreme metabolic changes,\u201d she said. \u201cGiving too much food \u2014 or the wrong kind \u2014 too quickly can trigger a dangerous shift in fluids and electrolytes known as refeeding syndrome, which can be fatal if not carefully managed.\u201d",
      "\u201cA bag of flour \u2014 some of the only food aid that has gotten in recently \u2014 won\u2019t save anyone because it has none of the essential nutrients,\u201d said Dr. Nour Alamassi, a doctor and the medical team lead for Project HOPE, an international nongovernmental organization focused on global health and humanitarian aid.",
      "\u201cToo many carbs can actually be life-threatening for anyone with Severe Acute Malnourishment (SAM), and even for the average person in Gaza who has not had a regular diet in many months, it is very difficult to digest,\u201d Alamassi, who is caring for children and pregnant women in Gaza, wrote in an email.",
      "Ideally, doctors told NBC News, there would be enough medical staff to monitor the refeeding process for each person for a period stretching from weeks to even months. Children would be stabilized with fortified milks, which contain the nutrients that a malnourished child needs, and something called ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF), which are energy-dense, easy to digest and carefully balanced in the nutrients children need to start to recover. Doctors would draw blood to monitor sodium and potassium levels \u2014 if these electrolytes are too low or too high, it can be deadly.",
      "But the situation on the ground in Gaza is far from ideal. There are not enough doctors, not enough supplies and not the right supplies, experts say.",
      "\u201cThe aid blockade has prevented us from accessing the medications and nutrition supplies that are necessary to treat these people,\u201d Alamassi said. \u201cWe recently ran out of High Energy Biscuits (HEB) in our clinics, which really limits our ability to help patients. We hope to get more in the coming days, but each day without these supplies can make a major difference for a patient\u2019s outcome.\u201d",
      "What are the long-term effects of starvation?",
      "Even if refeeding is successful, people who survive starvation can experience physical and psychological effects for the rest of their lives, experts said. The damage, especially for young and very old victims, is permanent.",
      "In children, malnutrition can cause delays in both physical and cognitive development. Physically, they\u2019re more likely to have weakened immune systems, leading to a harder time recovering from infections. Malnourished children are also more likely to experience stunted growth, which can affect their height, muscle mass and bone density and even delay puberty, experts said.",
      "Cognitively, children can suffer from permanent brain damage due to iron and zinc deficiencies, affecting their ability to learn and problem solve.",
      "Alamassi said the hunger crisis in Gaza is affecting \u201can entire generation of children who will suffer lifelong consequences.\u201dThe recovery of adults from very severe malnutrition is not only possible, but likely, Redlener said.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s done right, most adults, unless they\u2019re really at a terminal stage of undernutrition, the refeeding will result in restoration of everything \u2014 a far different story than the ability for a young child with prolonged malnutrition, where it\u2019s often impossible to get a full recovery,\u201d he said.",
      "Patel said even people with a history of malnutrition are monitored over years to make sure their bodies are functioning properly.",
      "\u201cAs they age and develop, different parts of the body pull on memories of that nutrition depletion,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the question we all have to ask ourselves is, how long are we going to be able to do this without having adequate support on the ground?\u201d"
