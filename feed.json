      "Another one that isn't at the top of any prediction lists, except perhaps for Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' synthy score (which won a Golden Globe), but this tennis menage a trois with Zendaya, Mike Faist and Josh O'Connor is great fun anyway.",

      "Comedian and host Conan O\u2019Brien is the newest recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for lifetime achievement in comedy",
      "WASHINGTON -- Comedian and host Conan O'Brien was named the newest recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for lifetime achievement in comedy on Thursday.",
      "O'Brien, 61, has carved out an improbable decadeslong career arc, moving from goofy television interloper to comedic elder statesman. Along the way, he survived one of the most public failures in the history of television on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d \u2014 only to launch a successful, and sustained, next act.",
      "His travel series \u201cConan O'Brien Must Go\u201d sparked popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. In March, O'Brien will host the Academy Awards three weeks before his own Mark Twain ceremony in Washington.",
      "Deborah Rutter, president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in a statement called O'Brien \u201ca master of invention and reinvention, consistently pushing the envelope in search of new comedic heights.\"",
      "O\u2019Brien offered his own tongue-in-cheek assessment, saying in the Kennedy Center statement that he would be \u201cthe first winner of the Mark Twain Prize recognized not for humor, but for my work as a riverboat pilot.\u201d He will be honored on March 23 in a special ceremony in which he will receive a bronze bust of Twain, the iconic American writer and satirist whose real name was Samuel Clemens.",
      "Mark Twain recipients are honored with a night of testimonials and video tributes, often featuring previous award winners. The ceremony will stream on Netflix at a later date yet to be announced.",
      "O'Brien leaped into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993, when he was chosen to replace the legendary David Letterman as host of \u201cLate Night\u201d despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \u201cSNL\u201d skits.",
      "Bringing a skittish, awkward energy that contrasted with Letterman's deadpan persona, O'Brien constantly made fun of his own gangly appearance and inappropriateness for the job. He went on to host \u201cLate Night\u201d for 16 years, longer than any other host.",
      "In 2009, O'Brien's career and persona took a turn. He became the man who publicly gained and lost his dream job while America watched.",
      "O'Brien was tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d despite public warnings from his own guests that Leno wasn't ready to cede the throne. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d back. O'Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O'Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "The aftermath split the comedy world, with Leno cast as the villain and O'Brien as the victim who was set up to fail.",
      "In an emotional goodbye on his final \u201cTonight Show,\u201d O'Brien described himself as lucky and refused to sound bitter.",
      "\u201cEvery comedian dreams of hosting 'The Tonight Show,' and for seven months I got to do it,\" he said. \"I did it my way with people I love, and I don't regret one second.\u201d",
      "He ended with a sort of generational rallying cry.",
      "\u201cAll I ask is this one thing, particularly of young people that watch: Please do not be cynical,\u201d O'Brien said, his voice cracking. \u201cNobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get, but if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen.\u201d",
      "O'Brien reemerged later in 2010 with a new talk show on the cable station TBS. Despite the channel's lower profile, the show ran for 11 years while he launched parallel ventures like the podcast \u201cConan O'Brien Needs a Friend\u201d and the travel show \u201cConan Without Borders,\u201d a precursor to his current show.",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett and Dave Chappelle. Bill Cosby, the 2009 recipient, had his Mark Twain Prize rescinded in 2019 amid multiple allegations of sexual assault."

    "story": [
      "Walter Salles' film \u201cI'm Still Here\u201d tells the story of Eunice Paiva after the disappearance of her husband",
      "It\u2019s easy to fall in love with the Paiva family. Filmmaker Walter Salles makes sure of that in \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "He drops the audience into the warm everyday of the beautiful home of Eunice (Fernanda Torres) and Rubens Paiva (Selton Mello), in 1970s Rio de Janeiro, where their five kids run freely between the beach and their living room. Life is calmly chaotic, full of affection, gentle familial teasing and various life stages (one is about to lose a tooth, another about to go to university). Someone always seems to have wet hair, be covered in sand, or bringing in a mangy stray, as their youngest, Marcelo, does in the film\u2019s lovely opening. Even if their life is technically worlds away from any one person in the audience, it feels familiar and close.",
      "Anyone coming to \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d will surely know that this domestic tranquility does not and cannot hold. It was about seven years into Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship, which would last until 1985. And while the film suggests that there was a semblance of normalcy in their day to day, there are also ominous signs of change and oppression \u2014 reports of ambassadors being kidnapped on the news, and tense \u201crandom\u201d traffic stops that their eldest daughter endures one night. Some left-leaning citizens are making plans to leave, but the Paiva family is not in a terrible rush. They\u2019re even making plans to build a new home.",
      "So when three men in civilian clothes enter their home one afternoon and tell Rubens, a former left-leaning congressman, that he needs to come in for questioning, it happens with little incident. Everyone is on guard \u2014 they\u2019re not naive \u2014 but you sense that Eunice believes he will come back that night. Maybe even the next day. Rubens is calm changing into a collared shirt and tie and lying to his daughter that he is going into the office, even though it\u2019s a holiday. But he also savors this moment with her, perhaps because he knows he\u2019s likely to not return.",
      "The film is based on a memoir written by Paiva\u2019s son, Marcelo, but you don\u2019t need to know that to know that it is first and foremost a memory piece. It is deeply personal and imbued with the kind of tenderness that is extremely difficult to see or appreciate in the moment. And although it\u2019s certainly idealized and wistful, we accept any assumed white lies because we all wish that for ourselves: to truly recognize what we have before it\u2019s gone.",
      "This story is not about the abduction, however, or what may have happened to Rubens after that day. It\u2019s about how Eunice continues on, through uncertainty, absence and, ultimately, the loss of hope. Salles chooses to tell this story in a rather straightforward manner, which works well, allowing the compelling narrative and the talented actors to carry the audience through.",
      "At the heart of it is Torres, who has already won a Golden Globe for her performance and whose portrayal of Eunice is a true marvel. Mothers and wives often get the short shrift in movies like this, about Big Important Topics decided on by men, but Torres instills Eunice with a deep emotional and practical intelligence that\u2019s beautifully feminine, whether she\u2019s dealing with a misogynist banker, a dead dog in the street or the thugs surveilling her home. She\u2019s fascinating and resilient in a way that so many women are in times of historical strife but rarely celebrated for.",
      "In one particularly poignant scene, she and the kids are being photographed by a journalist hoping to tell their story. They smile together, as they did earlier in the film when Rubens was there. Now he\u2019s not, and the reporters are confused. They ask Eunice to try a more serious expression. She laughs, \u201cThey want us to look sad,\u201d and instructs her kids to keep smiling. It\u2019s a perfect encapsulation of the complex spirit of the movie. Political disappearances don\u2019t begin and end with the victim, or the toppling of a regime \u2014 they are generational traumas that live on in the survivors and alter everything in their wake.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d a Sony Pictures Classics release in limited release Friday (expanding on Jan. 24), is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csmoking, drug use, brief nudity, some strong language, thematic content.\u201d Running time: 135 minutes.

      "Creepy stuff and jump scares, we\u2019ve been told, have proved better suited for channeling our abiding contemporary dread. But the communal joys of big-screen comedy have, and always will, suit dark days as much as light ones, if not more so. \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d for instance, happens to arrive while Los Angeles, where the movie is set, has been decimated by wildfires. The Southern California skies, though, are crystal clear in \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d In the opening moments, someone says, \u201cIt\u2019s always cooler on the West side.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d which had its premiere cancelled by the fires, is a welcome warm breeze for a movie landscape that has largely frozen out the comedy. There\u2019s one overwhelming reason for this: Keke Palmer.",
      "This is a buddy comedy, so it might seem unfair to single out one half of a duo. SZA, in her first feature, acquits herself well. But this is Palmer\u2019s show.",
      "Palmer plays Dreux, a Los Angeles waitress who, when her artist roommate Alyssa (SZA) gives their rent money to an untrustworthy boyfriend, Keshawn (Joshua David Neal), goes on a madcap, day-long odyssey to raise the money before they\u2019re evicted. This seemingly low-stakes premise is itself a kind of throwback to a more 1990s-flavored movie. The antic spirit of F. Gary Gray\u2019s \u201cFriday\u201d can be felt throughout \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d",
      "The tone here, courtesy of director Lawrence Lamont, producer Issa Rae and screenwriter Syreeta Singleton, is amiably realistic.

When they\u2019re forced to raise $1,500 \u2014 a race complete with a ticking-clock countdown to eviction, and, as things develop, until \u201ccertain death\u201d \u2014 Dreux is also scheduled for the biggest job interview of her life, to become a franchise manager for the restaurant chain she\u2019s employed by.",
      "The satire of \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d is mostly directed at the feeble opportunities afforded to those striving to break out of a paycheck-to-paycheck cycle. When the roommates seek a loan, their payday center advertises a comical APR of 1,900.5%. (The agent, who takes great pleasure in their credit scores, is memorably played by Keyla Monterroso Mejia.)",
      "That\u2019s just one of the characters the two encounter in their pleasantly meandering journey to raise money via everything from blood donation to Air Jordans hung on power lines. Some of the characters along the way include Katt Williams, as a conscientious homeless man who warns against predatory lending; Vanessa Bell Calloway\u2019s stripper-turned-blood-bank-worker; a new white neighbor named Bethany (Maude Apatow); and Keshawn\u2019s new hook-up (Janelle James), who proves the movie\u2019s most regular villain, despite the looming presence of a fearsome gangster (Amin Joseph).",

Here, that\u2019s Dreux\u2019s crush, Maniac (Patrick Cage), who drives a Mercedes and who she suspects is a criminal.",
      "If all of this sounds somewhat low stakes (I failed to mention Lil Rel Howery as their prospective sneaker buyer), that\u2019s more of a pleasing feature than a bug in \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d Besides, filling this movie with anything more \u2014 star cameos or broad comedy set pieces \u2014 would be a mistake. That would leave less room for the interplay between Palmer and SZA.",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days\u201d hinges on central buddy comedy, which Lamont seems to recognize even in his feature directorial debut. SZA\u2019s uber-cool unsurprisingly transfers easily to the big screen; her performance is winning because it\u2019s so unforced.",
      "But it\u2019s a testament to Palmer\u2019s dynamism as a performer that \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d would work no matter where their day takes them. There\u2019s a freewheeling wit and ever-shifting subtlety to Palmer, who so enlivened Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cNope.\u201d Only a theatrical comedy can really showcase charisma like hers. For an actress who\u2019s hustled to get to this point, \u201cOne of Them\u201d days is perfect platform for Palmer, scrappy and unstoppable.",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d a Sony Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language throughout, sexual material and brief drug use. Running time: 97 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "A hip-hop superstar beef was cranked up another notch Wednesday when Drake sued Universal Music Group for defamation over rival Kendrick Lamar's diss track \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges UMG \u2014 the parent record label for Drake and Lamar \u2014 published and promoted the track even though it included false pedophilia allegations against Drake and suggested listeners should resort to vigilante justice. Lamar is not named in the suit.",
      "The result, the suit says, was intruders shooting a security guard and two attempted break-ins at Drake\u2019s Toronto home, online hate and harassment, a hit to his reputation and a decrease in his brand's value before his contract renegotiation with UMG this year.",
      "\u201cThe lawsuit is not about the artist who created \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019\" the lawsuit says, referring to Lamar. \u201cIt is, instead, entirely about UMG, the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.\u201d",
      "The suit later alleges, \u201cUMG did so because it understood that the Recording's inflammatory and shocking allegations were a gold mine.\u201d",
      "And, the suit claims, the music company has made large investments and used its connections to arrange for \u201cNot Like Us\u201d to be performed at next month's Super Bowl, where Lamar will be the halftime entertainment.",
      "The lawsuit, which is seeking a trial and an undisclosed amount of money for damages, also repeated allegations in other legal filings that UMG falsely pumped up the popularity of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d on streaming services.",
      "The track is nominated for five Grammys, including record of the year and song of the year.",
      "UMG disputed the lawsuit's allegations in a statement Wednesday afternoon.",
      "\u201cNot only are these claims untrue, but the notion that we would seek to harm the reputation of any artist \u2014 let alone Drake \u2014 is illogical,\" the company said. \u201cWe have invested massively in his music and our employees around the world have worked tirelessly for many years to help him achieve historic commercial and personal financial success.\u201d",
      "The company added: \u201cThroughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth \u2018rap battles\u2019 to express his feelings about other artists. He now seeks to weaponize the legal process to silence an artist\u2019s creative expression and to seek damages from UMG for distributing that artist\u2019s music. \u201d",
      "Representatives for Lamar did not respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "The feud between Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner whose full name is Aubrey Drake Graham, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner, is among the biggest in hip-hop in recent years, with two of the genre\u2019s biggest stars at its center.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply last year.",
      "Drake's lawyers, from New York-based Willkie Farr & Gallagher, said the lawsuit seeks to hold UMG accountable for knowingly promoting false and defamatory allegations against him. They said the shooting and break-in attempts at Drake's home, and the online vitriol, prompted him to move his family out of the house, and that he fears for his and their safety.",
      "\u201cBeginning on May 4, 2024 and every day since, UMG has used its massive resources as the world\u2019s most powerful music company to elevate a dangerous and inflammatory message that was designed to assassinate Drake\u2019s character, and led to actual violence at Drake\u2019s doorstep,\u201d the law firm said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit reveals the human and business consequences to UMG\u2019s elevation of profits over the safety and well-being of its artists, and shines a light on the manipulation of artists and the public for corporate gain,\u201d it said."

      "It will not, of course, because this is a Blumhouse movie called \u201cWolf Man.\u201d It will not be good for Blake and it will not be good for the audience. That's because this film is a terrible misfire using a classic movie monster poorly rebooted by the modern home of horror.",
      "Slack when it should be terrifying, \u201cWolf Man\u201d suffers from cheap sentimentality, laughably obvious script reveals, poor continuity and a creature that is less predatory than painful. Pity comes to mind.",

When it does, the filmmakers lean on creepy sounds way too much.",
      "There's a Wolf Man out there and he's, well, underwhelming. He is largely unseen for most of the movie because seeing the monster is always a bad idea. At one, point, he attacks through the cabin's doggie door, one of the most disappointing assaults on film.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s some really exciting stories in there and just a real glorious range of film-making this year,\u201d she said.",
      "She also highlighted that 14 of the 24 nominations in the acting categories were first-timers, and that whoever takes the best actress award will be a first-time BAFTA winner.",
      "Demi Moore has a chance, with a nomination for lead actress for her role in the body horror film \u201c The Substance.\u201d",
      "Other notable nominations for best supporting actress were Selena Gomez and Ariana Grande for their roles in \u201cEmilia Perez\u201d and the musical \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "Like other major movie awards, Britain's film academy has introduced changes in recent years to increase diversity. In 2020, no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running, and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white.",

      "Edward Berger, the German-born director of \u201cConclave,\u201d expressed his joy at the number of nominations received, including one for himself, but acknowledged the \u201cstrange\u201d time to be celebrating when everyone\u2019s thoughts are with the people of Los Angeles.",

      "Best-selling British author Neil Gaiman has released a statement denying he has ever engaged in non-consensual sex after a magazine published allegations from several women, accusing him of sexual assault",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Best-selling British author Neil Gaiman released a statement Wednesday denying he had ever engaged in non-consensual sex after a magazine this week published allegations from several women, accusing him of sexual assault.",
      "The 64-year-old author of \u201cThe Sandman\u201d comic book series and novel \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d was responding to a New York Magazine article that detailed allegations of assault, abuse and coercion leveled by eight women. The allegations of four of them had been broadcast in July in a Tortoise Media podcast.",
      "Gaiman said he had watched stories about him circulate on the Internet for months with \u201chorror and dismay.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs I read through this latest collection of accounts, there are moments I half-recognise and moments I don\u2019t, descriptions of things that happened sitting beside things that emphatically did not happen. I\u2019m far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.\u201d Gaiman posted on the social media platform Tumblr.",
      "Gaiman said he had read back message exchanges he had had with his accusers. They still read like \u201ctwo people enjoying entirely consensual sexual relationships and wanting to see one another again,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAnd I also realise, looking through them, years later, that I could have and should have done so much better. I was emotionally unavailable while being sexually available, self-focused and not as thoughtful as I could or should have been. I was obviously careless with people\u2019s hearts and feelings, and that\u2019s something that I really, deeply regret,\u201d Gaiman said.",
      "Most of the allegations relate to occasions when Gaiman was in his 40s or older and living in the United States, Britain and New Zealand.",
      "One of the accusers, Scarlett Pavlovich, told New York Magazine she met Gaiman through his then-wife, U.S. performer Amanda Palmer, on a New Zealand island where the couple lived with their son in 2022. Pavlovich alleges Gaiman abused her several times starting the night they met.",
      "Some of Pavlovich\u2019s allegations were first made public six months earlier in the podcast.",
      "She told the magazine she filed a police report in January 2023 accusing Gaiman of sexual assault.",
      "New Zealand Police this week would not say whether Gaiman was, or had been, under investigation.",
      "\u201cIn general, Police cannot respond to queries which seek to establish whether specific individuals are, or have been, under Police investigation. Additionally, anyone who makes a complaint to Police has the right to privacy,\u201d New Zealand Police told The Associated Press in an email on Tuesday.",
      "The AP\u2019s messages to Gaiman\u2019s agent, his office and to Bloomsbury, publisher of several of his recent books, were not returned.",
      "Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, which both have Gaiman-related projects scheduled for this year, haven't responded to the AP\u2019s messages.",
      "Several of Gaiman's works have been turned into movies and television programs."

      "When the Palisades Fire broke out in Los Angeles, Hollywood\u2019s awards season was in full swing",
      "When the Palisades Fire broke out in Los Angeles last Tuesday, Hollywood\u2019s awards season was in full swing. The Golden Globes had transpired less than 48 hours earlier and a series of splashy awards banquets followed in the days after.",
      "But the enormity of the destruction in Southern California has quickly snuffed out all festiveness in the movie industry\u2019s high season of celebration. At one point, the flames even encroached on the hillside above the Dolby Theatre, the home of the Academy Awards.",
      "The fires have struck at the very heart of a movie industry still trying to stabilize itself after years of pandemic, labor turmoil and technological upheaval. Not for the first time this decade, the Oscars are facing the question of: Should the show go on? And if it does, what do they mean now?",
      "\u201cWith ALL due respect during Hollywood\u2019s season of celebration, I hope any of the networks televising the upcoming awards will seriously consider NOT televising them and donating the revenue they would have gathered to victims of the fires and the firefighters,\u201d \u201cHacks\u201d star Jean Smart, a recent Globe winner, wrote on Instagram.",
      "The Oscars remain as scheduled, but it\u2019s certain that they will be transformed due to the wildfires, and that most of the red-carpet pomp that typically stretches between now and then will be curtailed if not altogether canceled. With so many left without a home by the fires, there\u2019s scant appetite for the usual self-congratulatory parades of the season.",
      "Focus has turned, instead, to what the Oscars might symbolize for a traumatized Los Angeles. The Oscars have never meant less, but, at the same time, they might be more important than ever as a beacon of perseverance for the reeling movie capital.",
      "The film academy on Monday for the second time delayed its nominations announcement. Nominations will now be announced virtually on Feb. 23. The academy also canceled its annual nominees luncheon and said it\u2019s planning to honor frontline workers and to support relief efforts.",
      "\u201cWe will get through this together and bring a sense of healing to our global film community,\u201d vowed Bill Kramer, academy chief executive, and Janet Yang, academy president.",
      "The fires, one of the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history, continue. The ongoing nature of the crisis, which has killed at least 25 people, has made remaking well-laid plans a moving target. The Critics Choice Awards have been postponed. Nominations to the Producers Guild Awards have been delayed twice with no new date set. On Tuesday, the guild established a fund to support producers affected by the fires.",
      "The 67th Grammy Awards, scheduled to be held Feb. 2 in downtown Los Angeles, are going forward, albeit with significant changes. Harvey Mason jr., Recording Academy chief executive and Board of Trustees chair Tammy Hurt said this year's Grammys \u201cwill carry a renewed sense of purpose: raising additional funds to support wildfire relief efforts and honoring the bravery and dedication of first responders who risk their lives to protect ours.\u201d",
      "Some telethon-like element also seems sure to accompany the Oscars. In recent days, many throughout the industry have voiced suggestions for how the broadcast could be reconsidered. A not dissimilar process happened during the 2021 Oscars, which were postponed to late April because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Oscars have been moved a few times throughout history, including in 1938, when the show was delayed a week due to historic flooding in Los Angeles.",
      "For the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, the wildfires have been acutely personal. Four of the academy\u2019s 55-person board of governors lost their homes, according to The Hollywood Reporter, including producer Lynette Howell Taylor, visual effects governor Brooke Breton, sound branch governor Mark P. Stoeckinger and animation branch governor Jinko Gotoh. The Pacific Palisades, which was largely destroyed by the fires, was home to many stars and executives.",
      "For potential nominees, this would normally be when they\u2019d be at their most active, campaigning in Q&As and other events tied to the all-important nominations voting period. All of that has ground to a halt. Isabella Rossellini, who\u2019s favored to be nominated for best supporting actress for her performance in \u201cConclave,\u201d on Instagram posted a photograph of an Oscar lying in ashes. The photo turned out to be fake, but it accurately captured Hollywood\u2019s current mood.",
      "Several high-profile TV series were forced to pause production because of the fires but notably few movie shoots were affected. That, in itself, is a reflection of a Hollywood that has seen the majority of film production seek tax incentives in other states.",
      "Work throughout the film and TV industry hasn\u2019t rebounded following the 2023 strikes, leaving large numbers of crew members unemployed. So quiet are studio lots that actress Natalie Morales (\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d) has advocated for studios, in the wake of the fires, to turn empty soundstages into temporary classrooms, erected by out-of-work craftspeople, for children whose schools burned down.",
      "It\u2019s a reminder that many in the film business need all the work they can find, including all the jobs that accompany the Oscars. Not only are the Academy Awards a vital spotlight on a wide swath of movies that otherwise might struggle to find audiences, the awards provide a lot of jobs to an awards season industrial complex of workers, stylists and vendors.",
      "With so many out of work before the fires hit, Silvina Knight, an Emmy-winning makeup artist, calls this latest crisis \u201canother setback \u2013 a big one.\u201d She is currently working on \u201cSuits LA,\u201d one of the series that stopped filming due to the fires.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure how people are going to feel about getting dressed up and when they just lost everything,\u201d said Knight of the Oscars. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know, it might be a show of force when we come back. Yeah, this is tragic, but we are all coming together. Even driving home the other night, motorists were being very considerate of each other, which is unusual for Los Angeles.\u201d",

      "When Lucy Walker debuted her harrowing documentary about California wildfires, \u201cBring Your Own Brigade,\u201d at Sundance in 2021, it was during peak COVID",
      "NEW YORK -- When Lucy Walker debuted her harrowing documentary about California wildfires, \u201cBring Your Own Brigade,\u201d at Sundance in 2021, it was during peak COVID. Not the best time for a film on a wholly different scourge.",
      "\u201cIt was really hard,\u201d the Oscar-nominated filmmaker says now. \u201cI didn\u2019t blame people for not wanting to watch a film about the fires in the middle of the pandemic, because it was just too much horror.\"",
      "And so the film, though acclaimed \u2014 it was named one of the 10 best films of the year by the New York Times \u2013 didn\u2019t reach an audience as large as Walker had hoped, with its urgent display of the human cost of wildfires and its tough, crucial questions for the future.",
      "That could change. Walker thinks people may now be more receptive to her message, given the devastating wildfires that have wrought havoc on Los Angeles itself the past week. Firefighters were preparing on Tuesday to attack new blazes amid warnings that winds combined with severely dry conditions created a \u201c particularly dangerous situation.\"",
      "\u201cThis is probably the moment where it becomes undeniable,\u201d she said in an interview.",
      "She added: \"It does feel like people are now asking the question that I was asking a few years ago, like, 'Is it safe to live in Los Angeles? And why is this happening, and what can we do about it? And the good news is that there are some things we can do about it. What\u2019s tricky is that they\u2019re really hard to accomplish.\u201d",
      "In \u201cBring Your Own Brigade\" (available on Paramount+), Walker portrays in sometimes terrifying detail the devastation caused by two wildfires on the same day in 2018, products of the same wind event \u2014 the Camp Fire that engulfed the northern California city of Paradise and the Woolsey fire in Malibu, two towns on opposite ends of the political and economic spectrum.",
      "She embeds herself with firefighters, and explores the lives of locals affected by the fire. She shares harrowing cellphone footage of people driving through exploding columns of fire as they try to escape, crying out \u201cI don\u2019t want to die!\u201d She plays 911 calls in which people plead vainly for rescue as fire laps at their backyards or invades their homes.",
      "And she conveys a layered message: Devastating fires in California are increasingly inevitable. Climate change is a clear accelerating factor, yes, but it\u2019s not the only one, and therein lies an element of hope: There are things people can do, if they start to make different (and difficult) choices \u2014 in both where and how they choose to live.",
      "But first, complacency must be vanquished.",
      "\u201cComplacency sets in when there hasn\u2019t been a fire for a few years and you start to think, it might not happen again,\u201d Walker says.",
      "It even affected Walker herself a few months ago. A British transplant to Los Angeles, she had chosen to live on the Venice-Santa Monica border \u2014 too scared, she says, to live in the city's lovely hilly areas with small winding roads, surrounded by nature and vegetation, near the canyons that wildfires love.",
      "But a few months ago, she started wondering if over-anxiety about wildfires had incorrectly influenced her choice. And then, of course, came the Palisades catastrophe \u2014\u201cthis God awful reminder that it only takes one event,\u201d she says.",
      "Walker became interested in making a film about wildfires after she arrived in the city and wondered if she was safe. \u201cWhy is the hillside on fire?\u201d she says she wondered. \u201cWhy do people just keep on driving?\u201d She had considered such fires \u201ca medieval problem.\"",
      "One thing she learned while filming: Firefighters were even more impressive and courageous than she'd thought. \u201cIf you want to watch a firefighter have their heart broken, it\u2019s when they want to do more,\u201d she says. \"I was just absolutely wowed by how incredibly selfless and brilliant they were.\u201d",
      "Not that the public wasn\u2019t angry at them \u2014 her film depicts angry residents of Malibu, for example, chastising firefighters for not doing enough.",
      "One of the most stunning parts of \u201cBring Your Own Brigade\u201d \u2014 the title is a reference to the economic inequity of wealthy homeowners or celebrities like Kim Kardashian hiring private firefighters \u2014 is watching the reaction of firefighters at a town meeting in Paradise, where 85 people had been killed in the fire. They've convened to discuss adopting safety measures as they rebuild. One by one, measures are rejected \u2014 even the simplest, requiring a five-foot buffer around every house where nothing is flammable. Safety takes a back burner to individual choice.",
      "\u201cIt was very shocking to be at that meeting in particular, given that people had died in the most horrible way in that community. And you have firefighters with tears in their eyes saying, 'This is what we need to have happen to keep us safe, and then (they) get voted down.\"",
      "Walker is not the only filmmaker to have made a film about Paradise. In 2020, Ron Howard directed \u201cRebuilding Paradise,\u201d focused on the effort to rebuild, and the resilience of residents. Walker says she looked at the same set of facts and arrived at different takeaways.",
      "Townspeople were indeed amazing and resilient, Walker says. \u201cBut are we right to be building back without a real rethink? Because the tragedy is that these fires are predictably going to be repeating and against the backdrop of climate change, they're getting worse, not better.\u201d",
      "That rethink involves making hard calls about where people should live. \u201cThe population is overwhelmingly moving into these wildland urban interface areas,\u201d Walker says, referring to areas where housing meets undeveloped wildland vegetation \u2014 exactly the areas most likely to burn.",
      "In California, some of these places are very expensive \u2014 like Palisades and Malibu \u2014 but others are in more affordable areas. With the great pressure on housing, more people are moving into such areas, she says. But the \u201cbraking mechanism\u201d could be that insurance companies \u201care doing the math, and it\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d",
      "It's not only a question of where people live.",
      "\u201cWhat does a fire-hardened home look like?\u201d Walker asks. \u201cDesign-wise, that that does dictate certain things.\u201d For example: \u201cThis lovely wood is going to require tremendous firefighting.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s too early to know, but Walker thinks she may be hearing something different now from those who've lost homes, of whom she knows many.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing from people is not just \u2018I can\u2019t wait to rebuild. Let me rebuild,'\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s: 'How could we go through that again?'\u201d"

      "LONDON -- A commemorative coin featuring the image of an eye and the inscription \u201cBig Brother is watching you\" is being released to pay tribute to \u201cNineteen Eighty-four\u201d author George Orwell and mark his death 75 years ago.",
      "The 2-pound ($2.40) coin depicts what appears to be an eye but is a camera lens, and the coin's edge is inscribed with another quote from Orwell's dystopian novel: \u201cThere was truth and there was untruth.\u201d",
      "Coinage artist Henry Gray said the theme of totalitarianism was central to his design.",
      "\u201cWith phones and cameras being everywhere in your house, and being listened to by advertisers on your phone, you are really aware of how you\u2019re being surveyed \u2014 and that\u2019s what \u20181984\u2019 is all about,\" he said.",
      "\"That\u2019s why the eye (in the design) isn\u2019t a realistic eye. It doesn\u2019t have eyelashes and things like that because I wanted it to be monocular. It\u2019s almost like a camera lens staring at you all the time, unblinking.\u201d",
      "The novel, set in a fictional future, depicts civil servant Winston Smith\u2019s secret rebellion against a totalitarian government and its leader, Big Brother.",
      "Orwell, who also wrote the political fable \u201cAnimal Farm,\u201d died in a London hospital at age 46 on Jan. 21, 1950, a few months after \u201cNineteen Eighty-four\u201d was published.",

      "Oliviero Toscani, the photographer behind Benetton\u2019s provocative ad campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s who later broke with the Italian knitwear brand under controversy, has died at age 82",
      "MILAN -- Oliviero Toscani, the photographer behind Benetton\u2019s provocative ad campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s who later broke with the Italian knitwear brand amid controversy, died Monday at age 82.",
      "Toscani disclosed last year he had a rare disease. \"It is with immense pain that we announce that our beloved Oliviero has undertaken his next journey,\" his wife, Kirsti, and their three children said in a statement. He died at a hospital in Livorno, Tuscany, the news agency ANSA reported.",
      "Toscani had amyloidosis, a disease characterized by a buildup of abnormal protein deposits in the body. He told Corriere della Sera in August he had lost 40 kilograms (nearly 90 pounds) in a year, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I have left to live, but I\u2019m not interested in living like this anyway.\u201d",
      "Toscani also said he would like to be remembered \u201cnot for any one photo but for my whole work, for the commitment.\u201d",
      "Toscani was the creative force behind shock ad campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s that featured images such as the pope kissing an imam on the lips, which angered the Vatican.",
      "Other images promoting the United Colors of Benetton depicted a priest embracing a nun, a newborn baby with its umbilical cord and a black woman breastfeeding a white baby, part of the brand\u2019s advocacy for diversity, religious tolerance and environmental messages.",
      "During a 1997 shoot of a Benetton campaign featuring Jews and Arabs living peacefully together in Israel, Toscani told The Associated Press, \u201cAny picture is a political image, so we make our choice and we go for the real thing.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cYou might have to face criticism. A lot of people don\u2019t like things that are different. Everybody likes to conform. We don\u2019t conform.\u201d",
      "His decadeslong relationship with Benetton was severed in 2020 after Toscani outraged relatives of victims of the deadly 2018 Genoa bridge collapse, telling RAI television, \u201cWho cares about a bridge collapse?\u201d He was responding to an outcry over a photograph of founding members of a political protest movement alongside key members of the Benetton family, which controlled the company that maintained the bridge.",
      "Toscani apologized in an interview with La Repubblica, saying: \u201cI am sorry. More: I am ashamed to apologize. I am humanly destroyed and deeply pained.\u201d But the damage was done, and Benetton ended a relationship that had flourished from 1982-2000 and been rekindled in 2018.",
      "Benetton remembered Toscani in a social media post: \u201cFarewell, Oliviero. Keep on dreaming,\u2019\u2019 beneath Toscani's 1989 photo of a hand offering a bouquet of flowers.",
      "Toscani was born in Milan on Feb. 28, 1942, the son of a photojournalist for Corriere della Sera. He studied photography and graphics at the University of the Arts in Zurich from 1961-65, and worked with the newly founded Vogue Italia and other major fashion publications.",
      "Over the years, he shot campaigns for such brands as Chanel, Robe di Kappa, Fiorucci and Esprit. But he was probably best known for his work for the United Colors of Benetton, with images that carried messages promoting equality and diversity while denouncing anorexia, homophobia, the death penalty and racism.",
      "His work for United Colors of Benetton, a brand then known most for its colorful knitwear, raised its global profile. In the early 1990s, he conceived and directed \u201cColors,\u201d a global publication distributed in Benetton stores, and created along with Luciano Benetton the research center Fabrica in Benetton\u2019s home city of Treviso that supported and launched many fashion industry careers.",
      "Toscani tackled the AIDS crisis in the early 1990s with a colored condom campaign, during which Benetton sold a range of colored condoms, and used a colorized version of a portrait of AIDS activist David Kirby surrounded by family as he was dying.",
      "In 2007, Toscani\u2019s \u201cNo Anorexia\u201d campaign for the Italian fashion brand Nolita sparked fresh discussions about the illness and its relationship to the fashion industry. Toscani\u2019s photograph with skeletally thin model Isabelle Caro was revealed on giant billboards and in newspaper ads during Milan Fashion Week and received worldwide attention.",
      "He was also involved in projects addressing problems such as road safety, violence against women and stray dogs.",

      "Kemp's announcement came as President-elect Donald Trump returns to office and more state and federal officials consider Medicaid work requirements.",
      "Georgia is the only state that requires some people to work, study or volunteer to enroll in Medicaid, under the program Georgia Pathways. If the incoming Trump administration approves Kemp's plan, parents and guardians of kids up to age 6 in households at or below 100% of the federal poverty level could receive Medicaid without meeting those requirements.",
      "\u201cIn a growing state that needs more Georgians in the workforce than ever before, providing health insurance to a family or individual with young children may be the last piece they need to restart a career and be on the path for a brighter future,\u201d Kemp said.",
      "Most states cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level with primarily federal funds. Kemp has championed Georgia Pathways as an alternative to expanding Medicaid for low-income adults. Enrollees have to complete 80 hours of work, volunteer activity, schooling or vocational rehabilitation a month to receive coverage. Kemp says the goal is to ease them into a job that provides private insurance.",
      "Georgia Pathways had a rough start. After its first year, the program had around 4,300 members, a sliver of those who are eligible. Health policy experts have called the program a \u201cfailure,\" saying the requirements are too burdensome a large number of struggling people.",
      "Opponents also say the program has wasted money. Nonprofit health policy research organization KFF reports the program has costed more than $40 million in state and federal tax dollars that have been spent mostly on administrative costs rather than medical care. Others complain about sign-up complications and the program's slow processing times.",
      "In a written statement, state Senate Democrats called the new plan \u201cdamage control\u201d for the Georgia Pathways program.",
      "\u201cThere are over half a million Georgians who need health insurance, and the governor\u2019s proposal falls well short of that, and we\u2019re leaving federal dollars on the table that would help close the coverage gap in Georgia,\" said Democratic state Sen. Jason Esteves, of Atlanta. \"Because of the governor\u2019s plan, we will continue to struggle to strengthen our healthcare system.\"",
      "Kemp has regularly doubled down on his commitment to Georgia Pathways.",
      "\u201cThe old system is not working,\u201d Kemp said Wednesday. \u201cAnd the other side, their only answer to any of this is they want government-run healthcare. And I am not in that boat.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirement plans in 13 states, but the Biden administration revoked these waivers in 2021. Georgia Pathways survived after a legal fight.",

      "A group of Democratic state attorneys general are asking a court to let them defend a federal policy to allow young adult immigrants known as \u201cDreamers\u201d to access subsidized health care",
      "A group of Democratic attorneys general asked a court on Wednesday to let them defend a federal policy that opened subsidized health coverage to \u201cDreamers,\" young adults who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.",
      "They want to take up the mantle since they anticipate President-elect Donald Trump's administration will not do so after he takes office on Monday.",
      "The request in U.S. District Court in Bismarck, North Dakota, is among the first of what are expected to be many legal skirmishes over policy as the presidency changes hands. New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin is leading 14 Democratic prosecutors in the health care effort.",
      "\u201cUndermining Dreamers\u2019 access to healthcare not only hurts them and their American children, but it harms states like New Jersey too,\u201d Platkin said in a statement. \"We will never back down from fighting for our Dreamers, no matter who is in charge in Washington.\u201d",
      "For decades, states have often sued the the federal government \u2014 particularly when it's under control of the opposing party \u2014 over policy. Democratic attorneys general are also preparing to do just that. There could also be more requests like Wednesday's to let states defend actions taken by the Biden administration.",
      "If a judge allows the Democratic attorneys general to intervene in this case, it would set up a legal battle between red and blue states.",
      "A group of 19 Republican attorneys general, led by Kansas's Kris Kobach, sued over a federal regulation adopted last year to allow an estimated 147,000 immigrants eligible for coverage through the Affordable Care Act's public marketplace. They assert that the ACA and a 1996 law prohibit U.S. government benefits from flowing to immigrants who are in the country illegally.",
      "A federal judge in North Dakota ruled last month that the immigrants would not be allowed to obtain the coverage in the states that sued while the case moves forward. Members of the group in other states can now get coverage.",
      "The \u201cDreamers\u201d are part of a program that makes them a low priority for deportation. In his first term as president, Trump had varying stances on the program. He attempted to end it but was thwarted by the Supreme Court.",
      "More recently, he has promised \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history\u201d when he takes office and and also said he would look for ways for Dreamers to stay in the U.S.",
      "Last week, Biden's administration extended Temporary Protected Status to allow people from Venezuela, El Salvador, Ukraine and Sudan to remain in the U.S. legally for another 18 months."

    "summary": "U.S. regulators are banning the dye called Red 3 from the food supply",
    "story": [
      "U.S. regulators are banning the dye called Red 3 from the food supply",
      "U.S. regulators on Wednesday banned the dye called Red 3 from the nation\u2019s food supply, nearly 35 years after it was barred from cosmetics because of potential cancer risk.",
      "Food and Drug Administration officials granted a 2022 petition filed by two dozen food safety and health advocates, who urged the agency to revoke authorization for the substance that gives some candies, snack cakes and maraschino cherries a bright red hue.",
      "The agency said it was taking the action as a \u201cmatter of law\u201d because some studies have found that the dye caused cancer in lab rats. Officials cited a statute known as the Delaney Clause, which requires FDA to ban any additive found to cause cancer in people or animals.",
      "The dye is known as erythrosine, FD&C Red No. 3 or Red 3. The ban removes it from the list of approved color additives in foods, dietary supplements and oral medicines, such as cough syrups. More than three decades ago, the FDA declined to authorize use of Red 3 in cosmetics and externally applied drugs because a study showed it caused cancer when eaten by rats.",
      "\u201cThe FDA is taking action that will remove the authorization for the use of FD&C Red No. 3 in food and ingested drugs,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods. \u201cEvidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No.3. Importantly, the way that FD&C Red No. 3 causes cancer in male rats does not occur in humans.\u201d",
      "Food manufacturers will have until January 2027 to remove the dye from their products, while makers of ingested drugs have until January 2028 to do the same. Other countries still allow for certain uses of the dye, but imported foods must meet the new U.S. requirement.",
      "Consumer advocates praised the decision.",
      "\u201cThis is a welcome, but long overdue, action from the FDA: removing the unsustainable double standard in which Red 3 was banned from lipstick but permitted in candy,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, director of the group Center for Science in the Public Interest, which led the petition effort.",
      "It's not clear whether the ban will face legal challenges from food manufacturers because evidence hasn\u2019t determined that the dye causes cancer when consumed by humans. At a hearing in December, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf suggested that's a risk.",
      "\u201cWhen we do ban something, it will go to court,\u201d he told members of Congress on Dec. 5. \u201cAnd if we don't have the scientific evidence, we will lose in court.\u201d",
      "When the FDA declined to allow Red 3 in cosmetics and topical drugs in 1990, the color additive was already permitted in foods and ingested drugs. Because research showed then that the way the dye causes cancer in rats does not apply to humans, \"the FDA did not take action to revoke the authorization of Red No. 3 in food,\u201d the agency has said on its website.",
      "Health advocates for years have asked the FDA to reconsider that decision, including the 2022 petition led by CSPI. In November, nearly two dozen members of Congress sent a letter demanding that FDA officials ban Red 3.",
      "Lawmakers cited the Delaney Clause and said the action was especially important to protect children, who consume more of the dye on a bodyweight basis than adults, the lawmakers said.",
      "\u201cThe FDA should act quickly to protect the nation's youth from this harmful dye, used simply to give food and drinks a bright red color,\u201d the letter said. \u201cNo aesthetic reason could justify the use of a carcinogen in our food supply.\u201d",
      "Red 3 is banned for food use in Europe, Australia and New Zealand except in certain kinds of cherries. The dye will be banned in California starting in January 2027.",
      "The International Association of Color Manufacturers defends the dye, saying that it is safe in levels typically consumed by humans. The group points to research by scientific committees operated by the United Nations and the World Health Organization, including a 2018 review that reaffirmed the safety of Red 3 in food.",
      "Some food manufacturers have already reformulated products to remove Red 3. In its place they use beet juice; carmine, a dye made from insects; and pigments from foods such as purple sweet potato, radish and red cabbage, according to Sensient Food Colors, a St. Louis-based supplier of food colors and flavorings.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 09:22:40 -0500",
    "summary": "The Biden administration is floating a long-awaited proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine levels",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is floating a long-awaited proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine levels",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal officials on Wednesday released a far-reaching proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine content, a goal long sought by antismoking advocates that is unlikely to go into effect anytime soon.",
      "The proposed rule from the Food and Drug Administration comes in the final days of President Joe Biden\u2019s term, greatly reducing the likelihood that it will actually be enacted. President-elect Donald Trump and his health nominees have not commented on the measure, but a similar effort led by Trump\u2019s first FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, was sidelined during his first term.",
      "Trump\u2019s health secretary nominee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has said little about how regulating tobacco fits into his plans to overhaul the government's approach to fighting chronic disease. Even if the effort goes ahead under Trump, tobacco companies like Reynolds American and Altria are almost certain to challenge it in court, delaying implementation.",
      "The FDA has spent years studying the issue and said Wednesday that reducing nicotine would help nearly 13 million current smokers quit cigarettes within one year. Roughly 48 million more young people would never take up the habit because cigarettes would essentially become nonaddictive, according to agency projections.",
      "Under the agency's plan, nicotine would be capped at levels that \u201ccould no longer create and sustain this addiction among people who smoke.\u201d The agency's 334-page analysis was posted online in the federal register Wednesday morning.",
      "Antismoking advocates overwhelmingly back the idea and urged Kennedy to help implement it, if he is confirmed.",
      "\u201cTobacco regulation is a huge part of reaching the goals he\u2019s outlined for reducing chronic disease and a really important part of the conversation we need to have in this country,\u201d said Chrissie Juliano of the Big Cities Health Coalition, which represents the heads of more than 30 metropolitan health departments",
      "Smoking causes more than 480,000 U.S. deaths each year due to cancer, heart disease, stroke and other smoking-related illnesses. Those conditions often take decades to develop and remain elevated today despite ongoing declines in smoking among adults and teenagers.",
      "The idea of limiting nicotine has its roots in sweeping powers given to the FDA by Congress in 2009 to regulate the tobacco industry. But the FDA\u2019s efforts on nicotine and a host of other tobacco measures \u2014 such as adding graphic warning labels to cigarette packs \u2014 have been hampered for years by tobacco industry lawsuits.",
      "Under the law, FDA regulators can regulate nicotine but they cannot remove it completely. The agency's ability to set a maximum nicotine threshold is unique worldwide and the attempt would represent a first in global efforts to reduce smoking-related deaths.",
      "Currently, there are no U.S. limits on nicotine, which occurs naturally in tobacco plants. There are several techniques for removing it, including chemical extraction and cross-breeding plants.",
      "The FDA formally announced it would begin work on the proposed rule in 2022 and regulators received thousands of public comments from tobacco companies, retailers, health experts and consumers.",
      "The latest FDA announcement comes as smoking in the U.S. continues to fall. Last year, the smoking rate hit another all-time low of just 1 in 9 adults saying they currently smoke.",
      "Low-nicotine cigarettes are not a new idea. Several companies, including Philip Morris, experimented with selling the products during the 1980s and 1990s, without much success. In 2019, the FDA authorized a cigarette that contains 95% less nicotine than standard cigarettes.",
      "The FDA has sponsored studies showing that when smokers switch to very low nicotine cigarettes they smoke less and are more likely to try quitting. That research is considered pivotal to establishing that smokers won\u2019t compensate by just smoking more cigarettes or inhaling more deeply. That was sometimes the case with \u201clight\u201d and \u201clow tar\u201d cigarettes marketed in decades past. Those products were subsequently banned as misleading.",

      "COVID-19 remains a very present threat for the 55-year-old. Scarbro has multiple immune disorders, making her vulnerable to infection.",
      "\u201cAny minute anybody could cough, just incidentally,\u201d said Scarbro, who lives in Sunset Beach, North Carolina. \u201cAnd that cough could be the one thing that could make me sick.\u201d",
      "This month marks the fifth anniversary of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the U.S. The virus would go on to kill 1.2 million Americans and disrupt countless lives.",
      "While the pandemic's emergency phase ended in May 2023, the threat of infection remains a governing force in the lives of people like Scarbro. They protect themselves from the virus with masks and isolate themselves in small family bubbles. Some grasp for unproven strategies \u2014 gargling with antiseptic mouthwash, carrying a personal carbon dioxide monitor to check the ventilation of indoor spaces.",
      "In online support groups, they trade research about the danger of repeat infections and cognitive impairment. They miss the empathy they felt during the early days of the pandemic. Some have lost friendships, but they strive to maintain the social ties that are important to mental health.",
      "Scarbro\u2019s bowling league helps her feel connected to her neighbors. But recently, she\u2019s detected more stares and skeptical looks from strangers when she bowls in a mask.",
      "\u201cThere was more respect and understanding, but now they\u2019re over it,\" she said. \"They expect me to be over it, but they don\u2019t understand that even before COVID-19, these were the precautions I needed to take.\u201d",
      "Most Americans have developed some level of protection against severe disease from previous COVID-19 infections, vaccinations or both. But immunocompromised people like Scarbro, who has common variable immune deficiency, must be constantly vigilant. Unlike the flu, COVID has not settled into a seasonal pattern.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s never a time when they can relax a little bit,\u201d said Andrew Pekosz, a virologist at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cThat\u2019s a really challenging and exhausting thing to ask someone to do.\u201d",
      "Who are the people still cautious about COVID-19? They include young caregivers of vulnerable relatives, people with chronic health conditions and families rallying around a loved one. In interviews with The Associated Press, they talked about how they manage the trade-offs and the toll of isolation on their mental health.",
      "Before the pandemic, Bazia Zebrowski, 61, of Newbury, Ohio, dined out, shopped for groceries and took her dog, Shadoh, to the park. When she felt well, she occasionally could get together with friends despite having myalgic encephalomyelitis, a condition formerly known as chronic fatigue syndrome that causes inflammation, immune system problems, fatigue and pain.",
      "Now she keeps close to home, venturing out only for medical appointments. Her husband does the shopping and wears a mask at his workplace.",
      "They have not had COVID-19 and hope their luck holds. Getting sick would be a disaster, she said, potentially triggering a relapse or superimposing long COVID-19 onto her illness.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t consider myself COVID cautious. I consider myself COVID competent,\u201d Zebrowski said. \u201cCautious would imply that I have an unreasonable fear of something. I do not have an unreasonable fear of this disease.\u201d",
      "What does Zebrowski miss about pre-pandemic times? \u201cI miss the illusion that people are willing to care for each other,\u201d she said. \u201cHow hard is it to put a mask on? It rattles your faith in humankind \u2026 (you learn) how little the people in your life understood how sick you were to begin with.\u201d",
      "Trauma is part of the experience of having a chronic illness, said DePaul University psychologist Leonard Jason, who has studied myalgic encephalomyelitis for more than three decades.",
      "\u201cThen you're traumatized by the societal reaction to the illness,\" he said.",
      "Some people aren\u2019t sick themselves but are taking precautions to protect a family member. Steve Alejandro, 42, of Wentzville, Missouri, calls himself a COVID shielder.",
      "His wife, Ashley Alejandro, 44, also has myalgic encephalomyelitis. \u201cShe\u2019s got maybe four good hours a day,\u201d Alejandro said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a thing in the world I wouldn\u2019t do to protect those four hours.\u201d",
      "Alejandro changed careers during the pandemic, leaving behind \u201cmy whole support system\u201d so he could sell vintage books online from home. His three children \u2014 now 20, 18 and 12 \u2014 never went back to in-person school after lockdowns ended and are continuing their learning at home.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve really come together,\u201d Alejandro said. \u201cThis is a choice that can be made and you can win at it.\u201d",
      "In Miami, Kira Levin is the primary caregiver for her 98-year-old grandmother. She said the thought of getting COVID-19 and risking her grandmother\u2019s health is terrifying.",
      "So, at a July wedding, the 29-year-old was the only bridesmaid and attendee in a mask \u2014 an N95 layered with a pretty mask to match the bride\u2019s green color scheme.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t take off the mask for pictures and nobody asked me to,\u201d Levin said. \u201cAnd I felt incredibly grateful for that.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe have done everything we possibly could to maintain our mental health and our social life,\u201d said Jacqueline, who has an immune disease that makes her vulnerable to infections. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than being disabled and isolated. As someone who has been disabled and isolated, I don\u2019t want that isolation part.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline, 30, and her sister Alexa, 34, launched a dating app in 2022 for people who are disabled or chronically ill, though all are welcomed. Users can add a \u201cCOVID Cautious\u201d tag to their profiles to signal they\u2019re interested in meeting others who take precautions. The Child sisters say 10% of their 30,000 users add \u201cCOVID Cautious\u201d to their dating profiles.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a market that we didn\u2019t expect to target but we happily accept,\u201d Jacqueline said.",
      "Alexa said the precautions started as a way to protect Jacqueline, \u201cbut they\u2019re no longer about that.\u201d She\u2019s trying to avoid long COVID, a long-term disability.",
      "Tossing aside the threat of long COVID is hard to imagine for Yale University immunologist Akiko Iwasaki. Though people have been studying the virus since its emergence, she said scientists still don\u2019t know how pieces of the virus can stick around in the blood of some people for more than a year after they\u2019ve recovered from the illness.",
      "Iwasaki still wears masks indoors and stays up to date with vaccines.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t afford to get sick and become chronically ill,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel that we really are in a position to be able to better understand the disease, to help millions of people.\u201d",
      "While Scarbro understands that others are ready to return to \u201cnormal,\u201d it\u2019s not that easy for her or her family. It's true for many others with chronic immune illnesses, said Jorey Berry, CEO of Immune Deficiency Foundation.",

      "Fewer than half of people with limb loss have been prescribed a prosthesis, according to a report by the AHRQ. Plans may deny coverage for prosthetic limbs by claiming they aren't medically necessary or are experimental devices, even though microprocessor-controlled knees like Adams' have been in use for decades.",
      "",
      "Cain was instrumental in getting passed a 2000 Colorado law that requires insurers to cover prosthetic arms and legs at parity with Medicare, which requires coverage with a 20% coinsurance payment. Since that measure was enacted, about half of states have passed \"insurance fairness\" laws that require prosthetic coverage on par with other covered medical services in a plan or laws that require coverage of prostheses that enable people to do sports. But these laws apply only to plans regulated by the state. Over half of people with private coverage are in plans not governed by state law.",
      "",
      "The Medicare program's 80% coverage of prosthetic limbs mirrors its coverage for other services. Still, an October report by the Government Accountability Office found that only 30% of beneficiaries who lost a limb in 2016 received a prosthesis in the following 3 years.",
      "",
      "Cost is a factor for many people.",
      "",
      "\"No matter your coverage, most people have to pay something on that device,\" White said. As a result, \"many people will be on a payment plan for their device,\" she said. Some may take out loans.",

      "The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed a rule that would prohibit lenders from repossessing medical devices such as wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs if people can't repay their loans.",
      "",
      "\"It is a replacement limb,\" said White, whose organization has heard of several cases in which lenders have repossessed wheelchairs or prostheses. Repossession is \"literally a punishment to the individual.\"",
      "",
      "Adams ultimately owed a coinsurance payment of about $4,000 for his new leg, which reflected his portion of the insurer's negotiated rate for the knee and foot portion of the leg but did not include the costly part that fits around his stump, which didn't need replacing. The insurer approved the prosthetic leg on appeal, claiming it had made an administrative error, Adams said.",
      "",
      "\"We're fortunate that we're able to afford that 20%,\" said Adams, who is a self-employed leadership consultant.",
      "",
      "Leah Kaplan doesn't have that financial flexibility. Born without a left hand, she did not have a prosthetic limb until a few years ago.",
      "",
      "Growing up, \"I didn't want more reasons to be stared at,\" said Kaplan, 32, of her decision not to use a prosthesis. A few years ago, the cycling enthusiast got a prosthetic hand specially designed for use with her bike. That device was covered under the health plan she has through her county government job in Spokane, Washington, helping developmentally disabled people transition from school to work.",
      "",
      "But when she tried to get approval for a prosthetic hand to use for everyday activities, her health plan turned her down. The myoelectric hand she requested would respond to electrical impulses in her arm that would move the hand to perform certain actions. Without insurance coverage, the hand would cost her just over $46,000, which she said she can't afford.",
      "",
      "Working with her doctor, she has appealed the decision to her insurer and been denied three times. Kaplan said she's still not sure exactly what the rationale is, except that the insurer has questioned the medical necessity of the prosthetic hand. The next step is to file an appeal with an independent review organization certified by the state insurance commissioner's office.",
      "",
      "A prosthetic hand is not a luxury device, Kaplan said. The prosthetic clinic has ordered the hand and made the customized socket that will fit around the end of her arm. But until insurance coverage is sorted out, she can't use it.",
      "",
      "At this point she feels defeated. \"I've been waiting for this for so long,\" Kaplan said.",

    "summary": "To age well, geriatricians say one underappreciated key is maintaining good balance",

      "To age well, geriatricians say one underappreciated key is maintaining good balance",
      "Taking a shower. Grocery shopping. Moving around the kitchen. Getting dressed. The underappreciated link between these mundane activities is good balance, which geriatricians say is key to maintaining an independent lifestyle as we age.",
      "Lacking balance can be dangerous. In the U.S., 3 million older people seek medical care for fall-related injuries each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control. But falls are not inevitable, said Roopa Anmolsingh, a geriatrician who created the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s balance classes.",
      "\u201cSome people have a misconception that part of getting old is, you\u2019re going to fall. That\u2019s not true,\u201d Anmolsingh said. \u201cYou can control how you fall, or if you fall.\u201d",
      "To prevent falls, geriatricians say people should start asking themselves questions about their balance as early as 50 years old.",
      "Besides muscles and bones, other systems in the body can affect balance, so it\u2019s important to have a doctor check you if you ever feel unsteady, even if only occasionally. The cause could be related to blood pressure, a medication, inner-ear function, a nervous system issue or countless other potential problems.",
      "Even if unsteadiness is not an issue, you can determine whether you still might need an intervention with an easy at-home assessment.",
      "Standing next to a wall or something that can lend support if needed, raise one leg. If you can balance on each leg for 10 seconds, you should be fine, said Greg W. Hartley, a University of Miami professor of physical therapy specializing in geriatrics.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t do that, then you should probably go see a physical therapist,\u201d he said.",
      "Another assessment, which Hartley recommended doing supervised, is called TUG, for \u201ctimed up and go.\u201d Sit in a chair and start a timer when you stand. Walk 10 feet (3 meters), come back and stop the timer upon sitting back down. If it takes longer than 15 seconds, the risk for a fall is very high. Twelve seconds or less, the likelihood of a fall is almost zero.",
      "The National Council on Aging offers an online resource to assess the risk of a fall with questions about medications, whether you worry about falling and if you have trouble stepping over a curb, among others.",
      "Because muscle mass begins to decline in most people during their 30s, geriatricians say the best way to preserve good balance is to stay physically active throughout life. But it\u2019s never too late to start prioritizing it, Anmolsingh said.",
      "Tai chi and yoga are particularly good for older adults because they involve controlled movements while shifting body weight. There also are individual exercises people can work into their everyday lives.",
      "Anmolsingh recommended standing on one foot while waiting in line at the grocery store. At home, try sitting up and down from a chair several times without using arm rests. While holding onto a chair or the wall, do three-way leg lifts on each side, lifting a leg to the front, side and then back. At the kitchen counter, take a few steps to the side in each direction.",
      "For general physical activity, which will improve balance as well as mood and overall health, the National Institute of Aging recommends at least 150 minutes per week. That should include a mixture of stretching to improve flexibility, an aerobic activity increasing the heart rate and strength training with weights or resistance bands.",
      "For balance-specific exercises, it\u2019s particularly important to do them regularly because it takes at least 50 hours of training to have a measurable impact, Hartley said. Besides strengthening the associated muscles, doing exercises repetitively for extended periods trains the brain to react properly when you slip or trip.",
      "\u201cJust like an athlete needs to do repetition to train for a sport, you\u2019re doing repetition to train for everyday balance activities,\u201d he said.",

      "It was a week of fire and ice.",
      "It began with millions of people across the U.S. shivering amid blizzard conditions and frigid air that lasted for days, thanks to a jet stream that slips out of its usual path more often these days. Then, catastrophe in California, with wind-whipped flames taking off in a landscape parched by months of drought to become Los Angeles' worst-ever wildfires.",
      "To cap it off, major weather monitoring agencies confirmed 2024 as the hottest year in global history. Even more dire, four of the six agencies said it was the first full year Earth went beyond a warming threshold seen as critical to limiting the worst effects of climate change.",
      "Welcome to one wild week of the climate crisis, scientists say. There will be more.",
      "\u201cFor the average person, this means the changes you\u2019re experiencing \u2014 more extreme weather, rising costs due to climate impacts, threats to food and water security \u2014 aren\u2019t anomalies,\u201d said Victor Gensini, a meteorology professor at Northern Illinois University. \u201cThey\u2019re the new normal unless we take action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe last week of weird weather has been alarming,\u201d said Natalie Mahowald, chair of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not a sign of things to come, because we\u2019ve barely seen any climate change compared to what we are going to get unless we radically cut CO2 emissions.\u201d",
      "Here's how the week unfolded.",
      "The cold came first.",
      "The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world, which means the difference between temperatures up north and down south are shrinking \u2014 along with sea ice that releases more heat into atmosphere. That means more energy bouncing off and warping or moving the polar vortex, scientists say. And climate change is also messing with the jet stream, the air currents that circle the globe.",
      "The result? More frequent blasts of intense cold in winter even as global temperatures heat up overall.",
      "The blizzard dumped more snow in some parts of Kansas than they usually get in a year, one Kansas State University meteorologist said. Ice-coated trees downed power lines in eastern Kentucky, and a U.S. Olympian skied on the National Mall in Washington.",
      "Farmers rushed to move cows to keep them from freezing to death and to feed and water them as rural roads became impassable. Travel stalled as multiple states warned motorists not to chance the treacherous snow and ice.",
      "About 200 people, many homeless, sheltered at a roller rink in Cincinnati. The alternative was frostbite or worse in exposure to temperatures that were expected to slip from freezing to sub-freezing overnight.",
      "Out West, wildfire took hold.",
      "The Palisades Fire erupted in the Santa Monica mountains and moved quickly on Santa Ana winds gusting to 100 mph \u2014 much faster than normal. The winds were so strong they grounded airplanes normally used to drop water on the flames.",
      "The blaze reached near the Getty Museum and by the end of the day, several celebrities, including Billy Crystal, Mandy Moore and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko, had lost homes. Less than 72 hours before, many stars had convened to walk the Golden Globes\u2019 red carpet.",
      "The Eaton Fire tore through Altadena, killing 2 people and closing about 10 school districts.",
      "Climate change laid the groundwork for California\u2019s megafires. Atmospheric rivers dumped huge amounts of water on the region that caused plenty of plant growth. Then, a fast onset of drought dried them out, providing plenty of fodder for the flames.",
      "The water system used to fight the Palisades fire in Los Angeles buckled in the morning, as some hydrants ran dry as they were overstressed without assistance from firefighting aircraft.",
      "The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was pumping from aqueducts and groundwater into the system, but demand was so high that it wasn\u2019t enough to refill three 1-million gallon tanks in hilly Pacific Palisades. At least 1,000 buildings were engulfed in flames.",
      "The Sunset Fire started, too, threatening the Hollywood Hills and forcing mandatory evacuations in Hollywood.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump criticized state and local officials' water management policies. But experts said critics were connecting unrelated issues and spreading false information during a crisis.",
      "By the afternoon, calmer winds aided firefighters in making some headway, though by that point at least five fires were still active and some burned out of control in the L.A. area.",
      "Scenes of the destruction started to emerge. Recovery crews pulled a body from the rubble of a beachfront residence in Malibu.",
      "AccuWeather, a private company that provides data on weather and its impact, estimated the overall wildfire damage could reach $57 billion, though much of the destruction remains to be surveyed.",
      "At the same time, another winter storm bore down on the South, with warnings and advisories for at least 20 states. Many had gone through the same thing just days earlier.",
      "Major weather monitoring agencies said 2024 was the hottest since record-keeping began, easily passing 2023.",
      "Even more significant: 2024 was the first year with a global average that broke the long-term warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s that was set as a goal by the 2015 Paris climate agreement.",
      "Extreme weather like this week's is \u201caffecting so many more people all at one time,\u201d said Barbara Hofer, a professor emerita of psychology at Middlebury College. \u201cIncreasingly, the scale is changing. The loss is mounting.\"",
      "Hofer said the growing impact may make some people deny climate change, ignore it or become numb to it as \u201ca way to avoid what's psychologically uncomfortable.\"",
      "Such a week can also energize positive change, she said. But Hofer said she thinks that will be harder, at least in the U.S., as Trump takes office. He's promised to halt federal climate action and repeal existing legislation aimed at the problem.",
      "\u201cI worry about the denial, the misinformation, and the forces that are feeding that denial,\" she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we have to address.\u201d",

      "A California man says his two cats died and a third was hospitalized after he fed them raw milk recalled for bird flu risk",
      "A California man whose two cats died after drinking raw milk recalled for bird flu risk says he meant to keep his beloved pets healthy, but his efforts tragically backfired.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrible when you realize that you\u2019re the one that actually gave them the milk that killed them,\u201d said Joseph Journell, 56, of San Bernardino.",
      "Journell lost his 14-year-old tabby, Alexander, and Tuxsie, a 4-year-old tuxedo cat, in late November. A third cat, 4-year-old Big Boy, was hospitalized for a week before tests showed the animal was infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus.",
      "The cats drank unpasteurized milk from lots recalled by Raw Farm, of Fresno, whose dairy products were pulled from California store shelves in December after health officials found the virus in milk for sale, he said. The animals' deaths were confirmed by state and county health officials. The cats were kept indoors, with no access to potentially infected birds, and ate conventional, not raw, pet food, the owner said.",
      "Journell said he had been drinking Raw Farm milk himself for several months because he heard it had \u201cbetter immunity and healing properties\u201d than pasteurized milk. He thought it might be able to help Alexander, who had been losing weight.",
      "\u201cI was trying to make him healthier and make him live longer,\u201d Journell said.",
      "Instead, Alexander died on Thanksgiving Day. Tuxsie followed two days later.",
      "Big Boy was hospitalized and treated with antiviral medications, Journell said. The veterinary team collected urine samples from the cat, which were confirmed positive for H5N1 at labs run by the U.S. Agriculture Department and Cornell University, records show.",
      "Big Boy returned home blind and without the use of his back legs, though he is recovering, Journell said. A fourth cat, Cleo, didn\u2019t drink the milk and remained healthy.",
      "Journell has demanded that Raw Farm owner Mark McAfee compensate him for the more than $12,000 he spent treating the cats, according Seattle food safety lawyer Ilana Korchia, who is representing him.",
      "In an interview, McAfee disputed that the virus was capable of sickening the animals days after it was bottled and sold, citing preliminary research.",
      "But Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, said flu virus survival likely varies widely in different lots of milk. Experts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously confirmed that cats that drank raw milk from infected cows developed neurological disease and died.",
      "\u201cI think the poor cats are the best indicator!\u201d Webby wrote in an email.",
      "Nearly a dozen cats in California have died since early December after consuming raw milk or raw pet food contaminated with bird flu, health officials have said.",
      "The infections have followed a massive outbreak of the bird flu virus in dairy cows, which has affected in more than 900 U.S. dairy herds in 16 states. About 80% of those herds are in California.",
      "Federal and state health officials have warned people not to drink raw milk because of the potential for infection with bird flu and a host of other germs. Officials also have cautioned pet owners to avoid feeding unpasteurized milk and raw meat diets to their animals.",
      "\u201cCats should not be fed any products from affected farms if those products have not been thoroughly cooked or pasteurized to kill the virus,\u201d the FDA warned last month.",
      "After the cats got sick, Journell said he fell ill himself and sought care at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in Fontana, Calif. He said he wasn't checked for bird flu, despite his known exposure to the virus, because medical staff didn't have tests available to detect it.",
      "A Kaiser spokesperson declined to comment on Journell's case specifically, but said the hospital system is following CDC guidelines for screening for bird flu.",
      "Journell has recovered physically but said he's still suffering from the \u201cmental anguish\" of losing his pets. Despite the ordeal, he said he still thinks raw milk offers some health benefits.",
      "Nevertheless, he won't be drinking it any time soon.",
      "\u201cNot right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not in the foreseeable future.\u201d",

      "",
      "\"We would prefer to provide your care ourselves, but Providence executives' refusal to continue meeting with caregivers has forced us onto the picket line to advocate for you, our communities, and our colleagues,\" the statement continued. \"Going into a hospital or clinic to get the care you need is not crossing our strike line.

    "story": [
      "The District of Columbia is suing the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, hoping it will lead to a cleanup of the urban waterway",
      "The District of Columbia on Friday filed a lawsuit against the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, arguing it has inflicted \u201ccatastrophic harm\u201d on the mostly poor and minority communities living along the urban waterway.",
      "The lawsuit argues that federal government, which owns and controls the riverbed, has since the 1800s dumped toxic waste, heavy metals and chemicals including carcinogenic PCBs in the river and refused to clean it up. The 9-mile (14-kilometer) river flows through Washington, D.C. and parts of Maryland. For decades, it was treated as a municipal dumping ground for industrial waste, storm sewers and trash. That contamination largely affected communities of color.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that PCBs from the Washington Navy Yard were dumped in the river along with hazardous chemicals from the Kenilworth Landfill and chemical waste from federal printing facilities. It also blamed the federal government for poorly managing the District of Columbia's sewer system, which led to the dumping of raw sewage and toxic waste into the river.",
      "That pollution has led to swimming bans and warnings about fishing along the river, the lawsuit alleges, calling the federal government its biggest polluter.",
      "\u201cIt has systematically contaminated the River through the indiscriminate dumping and release of hazardous substances and through destructive dredge and fill operations,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said pollutants in the river don't break down and cause long-lasting harm to the environment, aquatic wildlife, and human health, including cancer, neurological and developmental disorders and birth defects.",
      "The District of Columbia is demanding that the federal government pay for the river's cleanup.",
      "The lawsuit comes as the District of Columbia has made progress in cleaning up the river and returning to a time where residents fished and boated and wildlife including bald eagles, osprey, cranes, kingfishers and eel thrived there.",
      "A $3.29 billion sewer upgrade, including a series of tunnels drilled under the city to capture storm and sewage water, has reduced overflows into the river by 91%, according to DC Water, the city\u2019s water utility. The final section of the Anacostia Tunnel System went online in 2023, and the overall system is expected to reduce overflows by 98%.",
      "Pepco, the city\u2019s utility, also reached an agreement with the District of Columbia to pay more than $57 million for discharging hazardous chemicals from their power plants into soil, groundwater and storm sewers for decades that polluted the Anacostia and other areas. The settlement was believed to be the largest in the utility\u2019s history.",
      "The payments will be used in part to clean up the river. Other measures the city government instituted like a fee on plastic bags since 2009 have also helped keep trash out, experts say.",
      "Still, the Anacostia remains polluted. It received a failing grade for the third time in six years in 2023 from a nonprofit that grades the river\u2019s health based on its fecal bacteria content and the state of its aquatic vegetation.",

And we will deliver, hopefully. I\u2019m still optimistic even though I just started.\u201d",

      "Brunner\u2019s visit to Athens comes days after a landmark ruling by the European Court of Human Rights found that Greece illegally deported a woman back to neighboring Turkey, and described pushbacks as being systematic. The decision could impact how Europe handles migrants at its borders. Frontline EU member states receive financial support from Brussels to handle illegal migration.",
      "The court awarded damages of 20,000 euros ($21,000) to the woman, a Turkish national identified by her initials A.R.E., ruling she had been improperly expelled in 2019 after crossing into Greece, with no opportunity to make an asylum claim.",

      "Greece registered more than 60,000 illegal arrivals of migrants last year, an increase of nearly 50% from 2023. It seeks direct funding from the EU to pay for the planned expansion of a border wall along the land frontier with Turkey."

      "BANGKOK -- Tropical Thailand is experiencing an unusually cool stretch of weather that forecasters say could last until mid-February, leading many residents to dig out their sweaters and cardigans.",
      "Thursday morning\u2019s forecast showed areas all over Thailand were feeling the cool, especially in the north. The Meteorological Department said temperatures in the north and northeast dropped as low as 8-9 degrees Celsius (46.4-48.2 degrees Fahrenheit), while on the mountains they hit 2 degrees Celsius.",
      "The past few weeks have been particularly enjoyable for many people in Bangkok, where high temperatures in the summer can rise to 35-40 degrees Celsius.",
      "Thursday saw a slight rise in temperatures in the city, but the lows were still measured at 19-21 degrees Celsius.",
      "At a park in central Bangkok, many joggers were out early in the morning to enjoy the cooler temperatures and sweat-free exercise.",
      "German expat Thomas Singenberger, who has been living in Thailand for 10 years, said the weather made his morning run much more pleasant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really nice and cold. So it\u2019s a good feeling to get up early,\u201d he said. \u201cEven sleeping without AC is really nice at the moment and to open the windows.\u201d",
      "Earlier this week the weather was even cooler. On Monday, Bangkok temperatures touched 15 degrees Celsius, which the weather department said was the lowest this year for the capital.",
      "Food vendor Ekkarak Kamtan, wearing a thick denim shirt over a T-shirt, said he didn\u2019t care for the chilly temperatures. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt so cold like this... The hot weather\u2019s better,\u201d he said with a laugh.",
      "While temperatures could rise next week, the Meteorological Department said the cooler conditions will likely remain until mid-February, especially in the north and northeast, and summer temperatures are expected to be milder than usual.",
      "This is due to the impact of La Nina, an occasional but natural cooling of the equatorial Pacific that also changes weather worldwide.",
      "The cool spell coincides with seasonal air pollution in Bangkok, which usually starts in October and lasts until February. Along with warm clothing, many people also donned face masks outdoors."

      "After forging unexpectedly fond ties with President Biden, Italy\u2019s right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni is poised to leverage a more natural alliance with incoming President Trump that positions her as a key interlocutor between the U.S. and Europe",
      "ROME -- After forging unexpectedly fond ties with U.S. President Joe Biden, Italy\u2019s right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni is poised to leverage a more natural alliance with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump that positions her as a key interlocutor between the U.S. and Europe.",
      "Weeks before his inauguration, Meloni met Trump at his Mar-a-Lago retreat, a visit that she said went \u201cbeyond expectations.\u201d The trip, she said, \"was an opportunity to confirm a relationship that promises to be very solid,\u2019\u2019 adding diplomatically, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can say privileged.\u201d",
      "A strong trans-Atlantic relationship between two conservative governments creates \u201can added value, not only for Italy but for Europe as a whole,\u2019\u2019 she told journalists this month.",
      "It remains to be seen to whose advantage the relationship will be, with some observers saying that Meloni could either become a Trump whisperer, exerting influence, or a Trojan horse in Europe \u2014 for Trump\u2019s purposes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that if Trump is looking for a person to call in Europe when in need, Meloni is the one,\u201d said Franco Pavoncello, political science professor and president of Rome\u2019s John Cabot University. \u201cAround her in Europe, it's a desert.\u201d",
      "Known for its rotating governments that rarely complete full parliamentary terms, Italy is in the unusual position of being the most stable government among major European and G-7 allies, as Germany, France and even Canada struggle.",
      "Meloni has led her once-fringe, post-fascist party from the extreme right to more mainstream positions, especially on foreign policy. She gained ground as a leading political figure in Europe after her far-right Brothers of Italy party scored a sound performance in the EU election last June.",
      "The 48-year-old Italian leader made the trip to Florida as her government was working to win the release from Iran of an Italian journalist who was arrested in mid-December. Within days of her return, the journalist, Cecilia Sala, was released in what Meloni described as \u201cdiplomatic triangulation\u201d between the U.S., Italy and Iran. Four days later, Italy freed an Iranian citizen held on a U.S. warrant.",
      "While Meloni denied any direct Trump involvement in the deal, her defense minister said the images of Meloni standing alongside him reinforced her \u201ccredibility\u201d at a critical juncture.",
      "On ideological grounds, Meloni is a natural ally for the incoming U.S. president. She has taken on migration, seeking deals with African nations to discourage departures and is determined to vet male asylum seekers at two centers Italy built in Albania. Her government also has adopted conservative family policies, including a ban on surrogacy and has taken action meant to curb abortions.",
      "The personal chemistry between Trump and Meloni is also evident and reinforces her chances to become his go-to leader in Europe. The two were seen locked in discussions during celebrations for the reopening of Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral on Dec. 7, when they set in motion the Mar-a-Lago visit. Meloni also has a well-documented friendship with key Trump adviser, Elon Musk.",
      "The Italian prime minister is one of just a handful of world leaders who will likely attend Trump\u2019s inauguration ceremony on Jan. 20, confirming the strong ties with the U.S. administration.",
      "More surprising was Meloni\u2019s strong relationship with Biden, who initially viewed Meloni\u2019s rise to power as a harbinger of a rightward shift in global politics. But Biden\u2019s concerns about her ideology were eased by her support for Ukraine in its effort to repel Russia\u2019s grinding invasion and her openness to pulling back from Italy\u2019s participation in China\u2019s infrastructure-building Belt and Road Initiative.",
      "The two met at least twice in Washington, highly unusual for an Italian leader in just two years in office. Biden had even planned to make his last overseas trip as president this month to Italy. That trip, however, was scrapped at the last minute so Biden could stay in Washington to oversee the federal response to wildfires devastating Los Angeles.",
      "Instead, Biden and Meloni spoke by phone last Friday. The White House said Biden expressed his appreciation to Meloni for Italy\u2019s support for Ukraine as well as the country\u2019s leadership at the G7, NATO and European Union.",
      "Meloni\u2019s pro-Atlantic position, which secured her ties with Biden, may prove a challenge to a Trump relationship. Trump is pushing NATO allies to increase their spending to 5% of national output, with Italy one of just eight members that falls below the 2% defense spending target.",
      "\u201cOn Ukraine, the Trump administration will try to find a way to dialogue with Russia to reach a solution and will likely ask Europe to do more,\u201d said Mario Del Pero, expert of transatlantic relations and professor of international history at SciencesPo in Paris. \u201cThat will put Italy in a tough spot.\u201d",
      "Meloni has already been forced to comment on Trump\u2019s recent expansionist rhetoric, telling reporters that his comments about annexing Greenland, Canada and Panama were meant as a deterrent, a \u201cforceful message to other big global players rather than a hostile action.\u201d",
      "Italy\u2019s economy would also be challenged by Trump\u2019s pledge of tariffs on exports, which at 10% could cost Italy's export-driven economy up to $7 billion, according to a study by the Prometeia risk analysis firm. Italy has a trade surplus of 42 billion euros with the United States, its second export partner after Germany.",
      "The bottom line, according to analysts, is that Meloni remains a true nationalist, who will protect Italian interests before all else.",
      "That could turn in Europe\u2019s favor, for example in the case of trade tariff wars or defense spending clashes. But it may prove disruptive for European unity in the long term.",
      "Already a reported deal with Musk's SpaceX to provide communications through the Starlink technology to Italian institutions threatens to undermine the Iris2 orbital constellation of 290 satellites led by a European consortium that includes Italian defense contractor Leonardo.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s naive to imagine that she\u2019ll be able to defend EU interests, while she will more likely act as a Trojan horse for Trump into Europe,\u201d said Nathalie Tocci, director of Rome-based Institute of International Affairs. \u201cWhen she faces tough choices, the euro-skeptic way is where she always ends up going, because it\u2019s where her heart truly beats.\u201d",

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has arrived in Ukraine's capital with a pledge to help guarantee the country\u2019s security for a century, days before Donald Trump is to be sworn in as U.S. president",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- British Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in Ukraine's capital on Thursday with a pledge to help guarantee the country\u2019s security for a century, days before Donald Trump is sworn in as U.S. president.",
      "The British government says Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will sign a \u201c100-Year Partnership\u201d treaty in Kyiv covering areas including defense, science, energy and trade.",
      "Starmer\u2019s unannounced visit is his first trip to Ukraine since he took office in July. He visited the country in 2023 when he was opposition leader, and has twice held talks with Zelenskyy in London since becoming prime minister.",
      "On a gray and frosty morning, Starmer was greeted at Kyiv railway station by the U.K. ambassador to Ukraine, Martin Harris, and Ukraine\u2019s envoy to London, Valerii Zaluzhnyi.",
      "The U.K., one of Ukraine\u2019s biggest military backers, has pledged 12.8 billion pounds ($16 billion) in military and civilian aid since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion three years ago, and has trained more than 50,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil. Starmer is to announce another 40 million pounds ($49 million) for Ukraine\u2019s postwar economic recovery.",
      "But the U.K.\u2019s role is dwarfed by that of the United States, and there is deep uncertainty over the fate of American support for Ukraine once Trump takes office on Jan. 20. The president-elect has balked at the cost of U.S. aid to Kyiv, says he wants to bring the war to a swift end and is planning to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom he has long expressed admiration.",
      "Kyiv\u2019s allies have rushed to flood Ukraine with as much support as possible before Trump\u2019s inauguration, with the aim of putting Ukraine in the strongest position possible for any future negotiations to end the war.",
      "Zelenskyy has said that in any peace negotiation, Ukraine would need assurances about its future protection from its much bigger neighbor.",
      "Britain says its 100-year pledge is part of that assurance and will help ensure Ukraine is \u201cnever again vulnerable to the kind of brutality inflicted on it by Russia,\u201d which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and attempted a full-scale invasion in February 2022.",
      "The deal commits the two sides to cooperate on defense \u2014 especially maritime security against Russian activity in the Batlic Sea, Black Sea and Sea of Azov \u2014 and on technology projects including drones, which have become vital weapons for both sides in the war. The treaty also includes a system to help track stolen Ukrainian grain exported by Russia from occupied parts of the country.",
      "\u201cPutin\u2019s ambition to wrench Ukraine away from its closest partners has been a monumental strategic failure. Instead, we are closer than ever, and this partnership will take that friendship to the next level,\u201d Starmer said ahead of the visit.",
      "\u201cThis is not just about the here and now, it is also about an investment in our two countries for the next century, bringing together technology development, scientific advances and cultural exchanges, and harnessing the phenomenal innovation shown by Ukraine in recent years for generations to come.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy says he and Starmer also will discuss a plan proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron that would see troops from France and other Western countries stationed in Ukraine to oversee a ceasefire agreement.",
      "Zelenskyy has said any such proposal should go alongside a timeline for Ukraine to join NATO. The alliance\u2019s 32 member countries say that Ukraine will join one day, but not until after the war. Trump has appeared to sympathize with Putin\u2019s position that Ukraine should not be part of NATO.",
      "As the grinding war nears the three-year mark, both Russia and Ukraine are pushing for battlefield gains ahead of possible peace talks. Ukraine has started a second offensive in Russia\u2019s Kursk region, where it is struggling to hang onto a chunk of territory it captured last year, and has stepped up drone and missile attacks on weapons sites and fuel depots inside Russia.",
      "Moscow is slowly taking territory at the cost of high casualties along the 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) front line in eastern Ukraine and launching intense barrages at Ukraine\u2019s energy system, seeking to deprive Ukrainians of heat and light in the depths of winter. A major Russian ballistic and cruise missile attack on regions across Ukraine on Wednesday compelled authorities to shut down the power grid in some areas.",

      "Lawyers representing South Korea\u2019s impeached president say he will refuse further questioning after being detained by anti-corruption officials over his ill-fated declaration of martial law last month, maintaining that the investigation is illegal",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Lawyers representing South Korea\u2019s impeached president said Thursday he will refuse further questioning after being detained by anti-corruption officials over his ill-fated declaration of martial law last month, maintaining that the investigation is illegal.",
      "President Yoon Suk Yeol exercised his right to remain silent as he underwent more than 10 hours of questioning on Wednesday at the headquarters of the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, following a massive law enforcement operation to detain him at his official residence in Seoul.",
      "Investigators are expected to move to place him under arrest in the coming days.",
      "The anti-corruption agency, which is leading a joint investigation with the police and the military over whether Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration amounted to attempted rebellion, has 48 hours either to request a court order for his formal arrest or to release him.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers have argued that the detention warrant issued by the Seoul Western District Court is invalid and have asked the Seoul Central District Court to consider his release.",
      "The clock for the arrest warrant is on hold while the court reviews his petition, which can take up to 48 hours. There is a possibility that Yoon could attend a hearing at the Central District Court as part of the review. Court records showed that the hearing was set for 5 p.m. Thursday, indicating that the decision could come sometime during the evening.",
      "Yoon set off the country's most serious political crisis since its democratization in the late 1980s when he attempted to break through gridlock in legislation by declaring martial law and deploying troops around the National Assembly on Dec. 3. The standoff lasted only hours before lawmakers managed to get through the blockade and voted to lift the measure.",
      "His presidential powers were suspended when the opposition-dominated assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14, accusing him of rebellion. His fate now rests with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberating on whether to formally remove Yoon from office or reject the charges and reinstate him.",
      "Yoon and his allies have defied efforts to investigate his role in the chaos of Dec. 3. He ignored requests to appear for questioning for weeks, remaining in his official residence to avoid detention as his lawyers turned away police, citing a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge \u2014 Yoon himself. They also said that the anti-corruption agency had no legal authority to investigate rebellion allegations.",
      "Yoon also resisted one attempt to detain him as the presidential security service barricaded the residence. He was finally brought into custody after hundreds of anti-corruption investigators and police raided the presidential compound for some five hours in a second attempt.",
      "In a video message recorded shortly before he was escorted to the headquarters of the anti-corruption agency, Yoon lamented that the \u201crule of law has completely collapsed in this country.\u201d He echoed the arguments of his lawyers that the anti-corruption agency does not have the authority to investigate his actions, but said he accepted detention to prevent violence.",
      "The Constitutional Court rejected a request by Yoon's lawyers to postpone a hearing on his case scheduled for Thursday. It remains possible for Yoon to exercise his right to attend, even while under detention.",
      "If a court grants a warrant for Yoon\u2019s formal arrest, the anti-corruption investigators can extend his detention to 20 days, during which it will transfer the case to public prosecutors for an indictment.",
      "If prosecutors indict Yoon on the possible charges of rebellion and abuse of power, he could remain under arrest until the first court ruling, which is typically made within six months, said Park Sung-bae, an attorney specializing in criminal law. Under South Korean law, the leader of a rebellion can face the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted."

      "HAVANA -- Cuba started releasing some prisoners Wednesday as part of talks with the Vatican, a day after President Joe Biden's administration announced his intent to lift the U.S. designation of the island nation as a state sponsor of terrorism.",
      "More than a dozen people who were convicted of different crimes \u2014 and some of them were arrested after taking part in the historic 2021 protests \u2014 were released during the day, according to Cuban civil groups following the cases of detainees on the island.",
      "Among those freed was tattooist Reyna Yacnara Barreto Batista, 24, who was detained in the 2021 protests and convicted to four years in prison for attacks and public disorder. She was released from a prison in the province of Camag\u00fcey, and told The Associated Press that eight men were also freed along with her.",
      "On Tuesday, the U.S. government said it notified Congress about the intent to lift the designation of Cuba as part of a deal facilitated by the Vatican. Cuban authorities would release some of them before Biden's administration ends on Jan. 20, officials said.",
      "Hours later, the Cuban foreign ministry said the government informed Pope Francis it would gradually release 553 convicts as authorities explore legal and humanitarian ways to make it happen.",
      "Havana did not link the prisoners' release to the U.S. decision on lifting the designation but said it was \u201cin the spirit of the Ordinary Jubilee of the year 2025 declared by His Holiness,\u201d referring to the Vatican's once-every-25-year tradition of a Jubilee, in which the Catholic faithful make pilgrimages to Rome.",
      "Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr\u00edguez did not mention the release on Wednesday \u2014 consistent with his stance the day before, indicating they were separate issues \u2014 but mentioned removing Cuba from the list of states sponsors of terrorism.",
      "\u201cYou can reverse a country\u2019s status on that list, but the tremendous damage to U.S. foreign policy cannot be undone,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cIt has been proven that this list is not a tool or instrument in the fight against terrorism, but rather a brutal and mere tool of political coercion against sovereign states.\u201d",
      "The Cuban Observatory of Human Rights, one of the civil groups, said that by 4 p.m. EST, 18 people had been released, including Barreto Batista.",
      "\u201cAt three in the morning they knocked,\" Barreto Batista told the AP over the phone. \"I was sleeping (in the cell) and they told me to gather all my things, that I was free.\u201d",
      "She said that she and the eight men were warned it was not a pardon or a forgiveness and that they had to be on good behavior or they could be sent back to prison.",
      "\u201cI am at home with my mother,\" she said. \u201cThe whole family is celebrating.\u201d",
      "In July 2021, thousands of Cubans took to the streets to protest widespread power outages and shortages amid a severe economic crisis. The government\u2019s crackdown on the demonstrators, which included arrests and detentions, sparked international criticism, while Cuban officials blamed U.S. sanctions and a media campaign for the unrest.",
      "In November, another Cuban nongovernmental organization, Justice 11J, said that 554 people remained in custody in connection with the protests.",
      "Biden's intention to lift the U.S. designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism is likely to be reversed as early as next week after President-elect Donald Trump takes office and Secretary of State-designate Marco Rubio assumes the position of America\u2019s top diplomat.",
      "Rubio, whose family left Cuba in the 1950s before the communist revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power, has long been a proponent of sanctions on the communist island."

      "The Cosa Mesa, California-based defense technology company plans to begin construction of what it's calling \u201cArsenal 1\u201d as soon as state and local approvals are secured. The 5 million-square-foot (464,515-square-meter) facility will be located on a 500-acre (202-hectare) site near Rickenbacker International Airport in rural Pickaway County, about 16 miles (26 kilometers) southeast of Columbus.",
      "Production of military drones and autonomous air vehicles would begin in July 2026 under the plan, said Christian Brose, Anduril's chief strategy officer.",
      "Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said it is the largest single job creation and payroll project that Ohio has announced. The governor said winning Anduril's manufacturing plant marks a continuation of Ohio's history of advanced aviation, which began with the Ohio-born Wright brothers and continues to grow surrounding the Dayton-area Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.",
      "\u201cWe are an aerospace state,\u201d DeWine said. He called Ohio \u201cthe brains of the Air Force.\u201d",
      "DeWine, Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and JobsOhio CEO J.P. Nauseef said that, through targeted economic development efforts, the state boasts a strong and diverse aerospace workforce. They said it also has a network of job training centers, colleges and universities prepared to educate new advanced manufacturing workers. Those helped attract the nationally-competitive deal, they said.",
      "\u201cOhio has literally built a strategy around this kind of project, and so we are perfect for them,\" Husted said.",
      "The defense sector in Ohio includes the global headquarters of GE Aerospace and a new Joby Aviation manufacturing facility near Dayton that's preparing to manufacture electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft beginning this year.",
      "Anduril casts the Ohio facility as integral to its goal to \u201cRebuild the Arsenal\u201d of U.S. military weapons and platforms by \u201chyperscaling\u201d manufacturing with advanced software and production technologies.",
      "The latest development adds to what is becoming known as a \u201csilicon corridor\u201d based in Ohio. It includes Intel, which is building a $20 billion chip factory just east of the Columbus, and Honda and LG Energy Solution of South Korea, which are building a $3.5 billion battery plant in nearby Fayette County that the automaker envisions as its North American electric vehicle hub. Ohio State University also announced plans in 2023 to build a $110 million software innovation center to dovetail with those efforts.",
      "At separate upcoming state meetings, the Anduril project will pursue a job creation tax credit from the Ohio Department of Development and a $70 million infusion from the All Ohio Future Fund, which the DeWine administration and lawmakers established to help local governments prepare sites for economic development projects. JobsOhio also plans to provide the project a sizeable grant, whose exact amount will be announced once agreements are signed, as well as talent acquisition services."

      "Americans stepped up their spending at retail stores and restaurants last month in a clear sign that consumers are still able and willing to shop.",
      "Retail sales rose 0.4% in December from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Thursday, though down from November's upwardly revised 0.8% gain.",
      "The figures suggest that even as many Americans are struggling with higher prices and elevated interest rates, a low unemployment rate and rising wages are encouraging millions of consumers to spend, bolstering economic growth. Last Friday the government reported that employers stepped up hiring in December and the unemployment rate fell to a low 4.1%.",
      "Much of last month's increase in spending was driven by a 0.7% jump in car sales, and a 2.3% spike in purchases of furniture. The report isn't adjusted for price increases, though the sales gains mostly reflects greater buying.",
      "After dropping precipitously in 2023, inflation has been stuck at about 2.7% in recent months, and prices are still much higher than four years ago. Still, on Wednesday the Labor Department said that core prices \u2014 excluding the volatile food and energy categories \u2014 rose more slowly last month, as clothing prices barely increases and apartment rental costs climbed at a slower pace.",
      "The cooler core inflation figures renewed hopes among economists and Wall Street investors that the Federal Reserve will cut its key rate further this year, after three reductions last year reduced by a percentage point to about 4.3%.",

      "LONDON -- U.K.-based oil company BP is cutting 4,700 jobs worldwide and a further 3,000 contractor roles as part of a cost-saving drive.",
      "In an email to staff on Thursday that has been seen by The Associated Press, CEO Murray Auchincloss said the job losses \u201caccount for much of the anticipated reduction this year.\"",
      "The reductions amount to just over 5% of BP's 90,000 worldwide employees. Auchincloss\u2019s memo said that about 2,600 of the contractors involved in the job cuts have already left the business.",
      "Last October, the company said it had identified $500 million of cost savings to be delivered this year, a quarter of the $2 billion-target set in April by the end of 2026.",
      "Auchincloss said that the company is \u201cfocusing resources on our highest-value opportunities\u201d and that it has stopped or paused 30 projects since June.",
      "The reductions come as BP tries to bring more digital capabilities into the business, with artificial intelligence increasingly playing a role in engineering and marketing operations.",
      "In April, Auchincloss announced a plan to make savings of $2 billion (1.6 billion pounds) by the end of 2026.",
      "The plan is designed partly to reinvigorate the company\u2019s flagging share price, which has fallen about 20% since last spring.",
      "BP also has pulled back from a number of renewable energy projects, and according to media reports, abandoned a previous plan to cut oil and gas output by 40% by 2030.",
      "Auchincloss, however, said that the company was still \u201cuniquely positioned to grow value through the energy transition,\u201d but that it needed \u201cto keep improving our competitiveness and moving at the pace of our customers and society.\u201d",
      "It comes days after BP delayed an investor event due to be held in New York to allow the CEO to recover after a medical procedure. Its scheduled capital markets event that was due on Feb. 11 has been postponed until Feb. 26 and will take place in London \u201cto ensure his full recuperation.\""

      "The final jobs report of 2024 underscores that the economy and hiring were able to grow at a solid pace even with interest rates much higher than they were before the pandemic. As a result, the Federal Reserve could be much less likely to cut borrowing costs again in the coming months after issuing three cuts late in 2024.",

      "La June Montgomery Tabron believes many Americans have a desire for racial healing. They just don\u2019t know how to start.",
      "\u201cIt may sound mysterious or challenging,\u201d said Montgomery Tabron, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation\u2019s first woman and first Black CEO. \u201cBut it\u2019s actually quite simple.\u201d",
      "It starts, she says, with a conversation \u2014 with the sharing of stories between people of different backgrounds so they can better understand each other. So when Montgomery Tabron set out to explain the foundation\u2019s \u201cTruth, Racial Healing & Transformation\u201d work and its creation of the annual National Day of Racial Healing, set for Jan. 21 this year, she realized she should do it by sharing her own story.",
      "That\u2019s what she does in a pair of books released earlier this month \u2014\u201cHow We Heal: A Journey Toward Truth, Racial Healing and Community Transformation from the Inside Out,\u201d a memoir tracing the steps from her Detroit childhood to leading one of philanthropy\u2019s most prestigious foundations, and \u201cOur Differences Make Us Stronger,\u201d a children\u2019s book about connecting with others outside our comfort zones.",
      "\u201cI wanted to use the methodology of healing that we use, which is through storytelling,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people relate through stories. And this became a book of very interconnected stories.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press recently spoke with Montgomery Tabron about her books and the Kellogg Foundation\u2019s racial healing work. The interview was edited for clarity and length.",
      "Yes. There were several places across our portfolio where we had the same reaction: Had it not been for the healing work, a situation could have escalated, particularly in Buffalo. Not only was that work about connecting people, it also was about affirming everyone as part of the process, affirming everyone\u2019s value. They felt it was a moment to show up in a very different way that honors healing. It was about the grounding in their humanity and using those principles of trust and mutual respect and shared understanding as a way to express their own grief and healing in that moment.",
      "It was a process. In many ways, it was cathartic because my own healing journey happened also during the writing of the book. I touched on moments in my life that I had not totally processed or really fully healed from. There\u2019s nothing like going through the healing journey that you\u2019re writing about. I think it brings a level of authenticity to the writing itself.",
      "It was, but that made it even more important for me to do so. I wish I had such a book at that stage of my life, so I\u2019m telling the story. But more importantly, I\u2019m sharing the power of healing with a very young audience that I believe will help them navigate the nation and the world.",
      "Teaching young people how to communicate across differences and showing them that it can result in strong relationships and shared understanding is the beginning of the work. It\u2019s work that, for those who practice, can lead to making connections and building strong and trusting relationships. I hope we also find that we (adults) can do it as well. It\u2019s not too late to have these conversations, and, particularly in this moment, is imperative that we have them.",
      "I think it is calling for this more than ever. When I think about the attacks on DEI, I attribute the attacks to a lack of understanding, a lack of shared purpose and an empathy gap. And what the book speaks about is exactly how those types of disagreements need to be reconciled and can be reconciled through a healing process and healing conversation. I believe that through dialogue we can come closer to understanding why there would be such an attack and have a conversation about whether there is shared faith underneath that would align us and take us to a different place, where you resolve the issue. So I look at that particular issue and say it needs a healing framework just as much as many of the most important conversations we\u2019re having in this nation right now.",
      "What we\u2019ve always hoped is for people to take action. And we hope that both books can be used as tools to show what action looks like. We want people to begin to not only hear and understand my story but see their story in the book and understand that part of this process is telling your story and having comfort in telling your truth, regardless of whether it may or may not align with someone else\u2019s story. We then want them to take collective action. What can we do together within our family, within our community, within our organization, across our friend groups? What can we do to help others and join in to help others see through conversation and dialogue that there are other pathways that maybe they haven\u2019t envisioned themselves?",

      "BANGKOK -- Nate Anderson, the founder of the muckraking financial information firm Hindenburg Research, says he is disbanding the organization after it finished the pipeline of work it set out to do.",
      "Hindenburg, founded in 2017, has a track record of sending the stock prices of its targets tumbling by disclosing fraud and other abuses that it has unearthed through deep forensic financial research. It had a financial incentive to do so, using a trading technique called short-selling to make money if its reports caused stock and bond prices of its targeted companies to fall.",
      "In one of its dozens of projects, it focused on the Indian conglomerate Adani Group, accusing it of \u201ca brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme.\u201d Hindenburg cited two years of research, including talks with former Adani senior executives and reviews of thousands of documents. Adani has challenged the allegations, which caused share prices of its group companies to plunge.",
      "In another case, Hindenburg Research questioned the number of pre-orders that startup electric truck maker Lordstown Motors had reported for its Endurance model, leading to a shakeup in its management. The automaker has been struggling and sold a huge auto assembly plant in Ohio to Taiwan iPhone manufacturer Foxconn to alleviate its financial woes.",
      "Anderson said in a letter posted in X, or Twitter, late Wednesday that he was \u201cwriting this from a place of joy,\u201d but that Hindenburg was a chapter in his life, \u201cnot a central thing that defines me.\u201d",
      "He said there was no specific reason for choosing to quit, though the intensity and focus of the work had come at the cost of missing people and experiences. The next step is to work on providing open source information about how Hindenburg conducted its investigations, he said.",
      "\u201cTo my family and friends, I'm sorry for the times I have ignored you while I let my attention be drawn away. I can't wait to have more time to share with you together,\u201d he said.",
      "Anderson said he would work to ensure the people on his team would \u201cland where they want to be next.\u201d Some plan to start their own research firm, which he will not be involved with. Some others will be \u201cfree agents.\u201d",
      "He said that nearly 100 people had faced criminal or civil charges by regulators at least partly due to Hindenburg\u2019s work, which focused on accounting irregularities, illegal or unethical business or financial reporting practices and other undisclosed regulatory, product or financial issues.",
      "One of its most famous reports was a 2020 expose on Nikola, a company in the electric-vehicle industry whose founder Hindenburg said made misleading claims to ink partnerships with top auto companies hungry to catch up to Tesla.",
      "Among its allegations, Hindenburg accused Nikola of staging a video to calm skepticism about its truck, one that showed the vehicle cruising on a road. Hindenburg said the video was actually just showing the truck rolling down a hill after getting towed to the top.",
      "In late 2021, Nikola agreed to pay $125 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it defrauded investors by misleading them about its products, technical advancements, and commercial prospects.",
      "Anderson praised his team of 11 people who he said are smart, focused and \u201cvery nice and polite,\u201d but at the same time are \u201cruthless assassins, capable of world-class work.\u201d",
      "The firm says it sees the Hindenburg, the airship that famously caught fire in the 1930s to the cry of \u201cOh, the humanity,\u201d as the \u201cepitome of a totally man-made, totally avoidable disaster.\u201d It says it looks for similar disasters in financial markets \u201cbefore they lure in more unsuspecting victims.\u201d",
      "\u201cOver time, people began to see what I hoped we could show \u2014 that having an impact is possible, no matter who you are,\u201d Anderson wrote."

      "The announcement Wednesday dashed ideas like returning the money to taxpayers or using the windfall on roads. But it also led to more questions: why wasn't the error reported when it was first discovered back around 2018, and should the elected state treasurer, Curtis Loftis, step down or be impeached.",

      "While Richard Eckstrom stepped aside in that case, Loftis has defended himself and his office.",
      "The problems with the $1.8 billion error started as the state changed computer systems in the 2010s. Grooms said the initial mistake happened when Loftis, whose job is to write checks for the state, shifted accounts from the old system to the new one.",
      "Loftis testified under oath before senators last year that he invested the money in the mystery $1.8 billion account and made nearly $200 million in interest for the state, which Grooms said seems impossible since there was no money there. The senator said Loftis also appears to have lied under oath when he said their was no federal investigation into his office.",

      "Gov. Henry McMaster said he has confidence in everyone going forward to handle the state's accounts and doesn't think there was any intention to deceive anyone.",
      "\u201cIt was an accounting error with no criminal conduct, no wrongful intent, no intent to make the error \u2014 errors sometimes happen and unfortunately, that was a big one,\u201d McMaster told reporters.",
      "Among other recommendations, the audit said South Carolina should hire a third-party auditor to look over the shoulders of the Treasurer and Comptroller General offices to make sure the state's accounting books are properly kept.",
      "The state has its own auditor, but that person is hired by a five-person board that includes both the treasurer and comptroller general. Lawmakers are likely to look into why that person didn't raise the alarm about the accounting problems sooner, Grooms said.",
      "Meetings have already been scheduled with a House subcommittee, and the Senate Finance Committee will likely call Loftis to testify by the end of the month, Grooms said.",
      "South Carolina has had a long history of accounting issues.",
      "The Treasurer\u2019s Office was created when the state\u2019s first constitution was written in 1776. Back then, the General Assembly selected the treasurer. But by the early 1800s, the state\u2019s finances were in \u201ca state of bewildering confusion\u201d and no one could \u201ctell the amounts of debts or of the credit of the State,\u201d according to History of South Carolina, a book edited in 1920 by Yates Snowden and Howard Cutler.",
      "The first comptroller general determined the state was owed about $750,000 in debts, which would be worth about $20 million today."

That comes amid a proliferation of homeless encampments in cities large and small and related concerns about public safety. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has set crime and homelessness as a central focus for of the 60-day legislative session that begins Tuesday.",

      "Spending on K-12 public education would increase by $263 million, or 6%, to $4.7 billion. Additionally, the proposal sets aside $150 million for pilot programs to improve literacy, elementary school math proficiency and lagging attendance rates.",
      "Distributions from New Mexico's early childhood education trust \u2014 an endowment built on a windfall in state income from oil production \u2014 would increase by $290 million, or nearly 9%, to $854 million to expand childcare and related medical assistance.",
      "New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is advocating for a slightly larger, 7% annual general fund spending increase. The Legislature develops its own competing spending plan, and Lujan Grisham can veto any and all provisions approved by legislators.",
      "The Legislature's budget recommendation includes an average 4% pay increase for public employees across state government, public schools and colleges.",
      "The budget proposals do not outline possible tax cuts or incentives. Republicans in the state House minority are advocating to eliminate personal income taxes that peak at 5.9% for top earners."

      "\u201cAirlines have a legal obligation to ensure that their flight schedules provide travelers with realistic departure and arrival times,\" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s action sends a message to all airlines that the Department is prepared to go to court in order to enforce passenger protections.\u201d",

      "The announcement comes less than two weeks after the Transportation Department fined JetBlue $2 million for chronic delays, the first time it imposed a penalty for lateness on specific routes.

      "A nonprofit research lab is getting attention from some wealthy tech philanthropists",
      "MONTREAL -- Peeps trickle out of a soundproof chamber as its door opens. Female zebra finches are chattering away inside the microphone-lined box. The laboratory room sounds like a chorus of squeaky toys.",
      "\u201cThey're probably talking about us a little bit,\u201d says McGill University postdoctoral fellow Logan James.",
      "It's unclear, of course, what they are saying. But James believes he is getting closer to deciphering their vocalizations through a partnership with the Earth Species Project. The nonprofit laboratory has drawn some of the technology industry's wealthiest philanthropists \u2014 and they want to see more than just scientific progress. On top of breakthroughs in animal language, they expect improved interspecies understanding will foster greater appreciation for the planet in the face of climate change.",
      "The Earth Species Project hopes to decode other creatures' communications with its pioneering artificial intelligence tools. The goal is not to build a \u201ctranslator that will allow us to speak to other species,\u201d Director of Impact Jane Lawton said. However, she added, \u201crudimentary dictionaries\u201d for other animals are not only possible but could help craft better conservation strategies and reconnect humanity with often forgotten ecosystems.",
      "\u201cWe believe that by reminding people of the beauty, the sophistication, the intelligence that is resident in other species and in nature as a whole, we can start to, kind of, almost repair that relationship,\" Lawton said.",
      "At McGill University, the technology generates specific calls during simulated conversations with live finches that help researchers isolate each unique noise. The computer processes calls in real time and responds with one of its own. Those recordings are then used to train the Berkeley, California-based research group\u2019s audio language model for animal sounds.",
      "This ad hoc collaboration is only a glimpse into what ESP says will come. By 2030, Lawton said, it expects \u201creally interesting insights into how other animals communicate.\u201d Artificial intelligence advancements are expediting the research. New grants totaling $17 million will help hire engineers and at least double the size of the research team, which currently has roughly seven members. Over the next two years, Lawton said, the nonprofit's researchers will select species that \u201cmight actually shift something\u201d in people's relationship with nature.",
      "Standing to benefit are animal groups threatened by habitat loss or human activity that could be better protected with better understandings of their languages. Existing collaborations aim to document the vocal repertoires \u2014 the distinct calls and their different contexts \u2014 of the Hawaiian crow and St. Lawrence River beluga whales.",
      "After spending more than two decades extinct in the wild, the crows have been reintroduced to their home of Maui. But some conservationists fear that critical vocabulary has faded in captivity. Lawton said the birds might need to relearn some \u201cwords\u201d before they reenter their natural habitat in droves.",
      "In Canada's St. Lawrence River, where shipping traffic imperils the marine mammals who feed there, the group's scientists are exploring whether machine learning can categorize unlabeled calls from the remaining belugas. Perhaps, Lawton suggested, authorities could alert nearby vessels if they understood that certain sounds signaled the whales were about to surface.",
      "Big donors include LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, the family charity founded by late Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen and Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019 Waverley Street Foundation. The latter aims to support \u201cbottom-up\u201d solutions to the \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d At the root of that crisis, according to Waverley Street Foundation President Jared Blumenfeld, is the idea that humans deserve \u201cdominion\u201d over the world.",
      "Blumenfeld finds that ESP's work is an important reminder that we are instead stewards of the planet.",
      "\"This is not a silver bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly part of a suite of things that can help transform how we view ourselves in relation to nature.\u201d",
      "Gail Patricelli -- an unaffiliated animal behavior professor at the University of California, Davis -- remembers when such tools were just \u201cpie in the sky.\u201d Researchers previously spent months laboring to manually comb through terabytes of recordings and annotate calls.",
      "She said she's seen an \u201cexponential takeoff\u201d the past few years in bioacoustics' use of machine learning to accelerate that process. While she finds that ESP has the promise to make finer distinctions in existing \u201cdictionaries,\u201d especially for harder-to-reach species, she cautioned observers against attributing human characteristics to these animals.",
      "Considering this research\u2019s high equipment and labor costs, Patricelli said she\u2019s happy to see big philanthropists backing it. But she said the field shouldn\u2019t rely too much on one funding source. Government support is still necessary, she noted, because ecosystem protection also requires that conservationists examine \u201cunsexy\u201d species that she expects get less attention than more charismatic ones. She also encouraged funders to consult scientists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn and it\u2019s very expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat might not be a big deal to some of these donors but it\u2019s very hard to come up with the money to do this.\u201d",
      "The current work largely involves developing baseline technologies to do all this. A separate initiative has recently described the basic elements of how sperm whales might talk. But ESP is trying to be \u201cspecies agnostic,\u201d AI Research Director Olivier Pietquin said, to provide tools that can sort out many animals\u2019 speech patterns.",
      "ESP introduced NatureLM-audio this fall, touting the system as the first large audio-language model fit for animals. The tool can identify species and distinguish characteristics such as sex or stage of life. When applied to a population \u2014 zebra finches \u2014 it had not been trained on, NatureLM-audio accurately counted the number of birds at a rate higher than random chance, according to ESP. The results were a positive sign for Pietquin that NatureLM might be able to scale across species.",
      "\u201cThat is only possible with a lot of computing, a lot of data and many, many collaborations with ecologists and biologists,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, I think, makes us, makes it, quite serious.\u201d",
      "ESP acknowledges that it isn\u2019t sure what will be discovered about animal communications and won\u2019t know when its model gets it absolutely right. But the team likens AI to the microscope: advancements that allowed scientists to see far more than previously considered possible.",
      "Zebra finches are highly social animals with large call repertoires. Whether congregating in pairs or by the hundreds, they produce hours of data \u2014 a help to the nonprofit's AI scientists given that animal sounds aren't as abundant as the pages of internet text scraped to train chatbots.",
      "James, an affiliated researcher with the Earth Species Project, struggles with the concept of decoding animal communications. Sure, he can clearly distinguish when a chick is screaming for food. But he doesn\u2019t expect to ever translate that call or any others into a human word.",
      "Still, he wonders if he can gather more hints about their interactions from aspects of the call such as its pitch or duration.",
      "\u201cSo can we find a link between a form and function is sort of our way of maybe thinking about decoding,\" James said. \u201cAs she elongates her call, is that because she\u2019s trying harder to elicit a response?\u201d",

      "The bank\u2019s consumer banking business also thrived, with clients opening nearly 2 million checking accounts.",
      "The New York bank set aside $2.6 billion to cover bad loans, down slightly from the same period a year ago.",
      "JPMorgan shares rose 1.2% before the bell.",
      "Wells Fargo also topped profit expectations Wednesday with a nearly 50% jump in net income, with earnings of $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter, or $1.43 per share. Revenue came in at $20.4 billion, a touch lower than expectations. In the same quarter a year ago, Wells posted net income of $3.4 billion, or 86 cents per share, on $20.5 billion in revenue.",
      "In September, Wells Fargo agreed to work with U.S. bank regulators to shore up its financial crimes risk management, including internal controls related to suspicious activity and money laundering. The agreement came just seven months after the Biden Administration lifted a consent order on the bank that had been in place since 2016 following a series of scandals, including the opening of fake customer accounts.",
      "Wells rose 3.2% before markets opened.",
      "JPMorgan's Dimon said the U.S. economy remains strong, noting the nation's low unemployment and strong consumer spending.",
      "\u201cBusinesses are more optimistic about the economy, and they are encouraged by expectations for a more pro-growth agenda and improved collaboration between government and business,\u201d said, alluding the an incoming Trump administration that has promised to cut regulations across industries.",
      "Dimon said that any regulation should balance promoting growth and keeping the banking system safe. \u201cThis is not about weakening regulation ... but rather about setting rules that are transparent, fair and holistic in their approach and based on rigorous data analysis, so that banks can play their critical role in the economy and markets.\u201d",
      "Dimon, however, said that the state of the geopolitics \u201cremains the most dangerous and complicated since World War II\u201d and that JPMorgan is preparing for a wide range of outcomes."

      "CES in Las Vegas provides an annual preview of high-tech attractions headed for the car world",
      "CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, in Las Vegas continues to provide a sneak peek at future technology. The annual showcase includes advanced automotive tech in an industry striving to reduce pollution and increase occupant safety while also providing greater convenience and entertainment for road warriors. These are the most impressive innovations we saw at this year\u2019s event.",
      "What kind of screens and technology can you expect to see in new vehicles in the coming years? BMW\u2019s all-new in-cabin digital interface, dubbed Panoramic iDrive, gives us a compelling preview.",
      "Panoramic iDrive has a digital display at the base of the windshield spanning the entire dashboard. This display is called Panoramic Vision, and it projects everything from speed to EV range to navigation guidance, along with climate and audio info. This display pairs with an easy-to-reach central touchscreen and advanced head-up display that can project 3D-like information on the windshield for the driver. BMW also showcased a new squared-off steering wheel with illuminated buttons that the company says are very easy to use.",
      "We expect Panoramic iDrive will debut in upcoming BMW vehicles in late 2025.",
      "Honda jumped into the deep end of the electric vehicle pool at CES 2025 with the debut of two all-new, all-electric models. The Honda 0 SUV and 0 Saloon are based on two wild-looking concept cars shown at last year\u2019s CES, yet these production-ready models haven\u2019t lost any of their aggressive style and will definitely turn heads when they arrive in 2026.",
      "Both will be built in Ohio and will be capable of Level 3 automated driving functionality, meaning drivers will be allowed to drive hands-free and take their eyes off the road for short periods of time when specific environmental conditions are met. Honda says these 0 models will also use a new technology interface, called Asimo, that will provide a high degree of personalization to customize the driving experience for each user.",
      "The launch of the 0 SUV and 0 Saloon will coincide with Honda\u2019s effort to improve charging access to drivers through a joint effort with seven other automakers. The goal is to have 30,000 high-speed charging stations built in North America by 2030. These stations will have plugs with the Tesla-style North American Charging Standard, or NACS, which most automakers have been switching to.",
      "Even in 2025, getting consistent and stable internet service can be a challenge. We can access the information superhighway through Wi-Fi networks, cellular service or satellite signals, though all three have limitations and are certainly not 100% reliable.",
      "But what if you could combine the power of satellite, cellular and Wi-Fi networks into a single pipeline of internet service? And what if that pipeline could constantly evaluate and optimize the data stream as you travel between signal sources? That\u2019s exactly what Stellar, a new company from France, is offering. The company is working with automakers to optimize mobile service by using hardware already built into today\u2019s cars. The end goal is to have improved, more consistent high-speed internet access in your vehicle, whether you\u2019re going through a city tunnel or driving across the open plains.",
      "Toyota\u2019s vision for the future of mobility goes beyond EVs and self-driving cars. The company is engineering a complete city environment in Japan where everything from building construction to food supply to education and transportation are coordinated for maximum efficiency and minimal environmental impact. The areas of focus include personal transportation, and the company\u2019s massive site, called Woven City, will serve as a test course for automated tech development.",
      "Woven City will scale from an initial 50,000 square miles up to 700,000 square miles as construction continues. By the fall of 2025, it will provide housing for about 360 Toyota staff and family members and eventually expand to 2,000-plus residents, including Woven City partner companies involved in construction, food and drink, education and even rocket production.",
      "While it\u2019s hard to predict what will come out of Toyota\u2019s Woven City that will actually end up in production vehicles, it\u2019s fair to say that Toyota will have a head start on how to leverage various new technologies best.",
      "Full self-driving cars have yet to appear, but automakers are chipping away at this elusive tech while making clear progress in advanced user interfaces, electric vehicle design, and even comprehensive city planning. While the last few years have seen moderate progress in these areas, it feels like we\u2019re on the cusp of multiple breakthroughs in the automotive space.",

      "Albanian Premier Edi Rama valued the energy deal at around 1 billion euros.",
      "Meloni said the three-way arrangement would help Italy meet its long-term electricity needs while honoring its sustainable energy commitments made at U.N. climate conferences. She praised it as pragmatic way to transition away from fossil fuels at a time when energy needs are soaring due to the demand from AI-generated technologies.",
      "\u201cThe future of energy transition and digitization will thus depend on our ability to strike a balance between sustainability and innovation,\u201d she said, adding that nuclear fusion could be another way to produce clean and safe energy.

      "The year's weak performance underlines Germany's status as Europe's worst performing major economy and shows the country as having no meaningful growth in the past four years as it has struggled to deal with major shifts in the global economy.",

Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s three-party coalition government collapsed in November when Scholz fired his finance minister in a dispute over how to revitalize the economy. That paved the way for an early election on Feb. 23.",
      "Contenders to lead the next government have made contrasting proposals on how to inject new vigor into the economy.",
      "Ruth Brand, the head of the statistics office, ticked off the list of short- and long-term challenges: higher energy prices after the loss of cheap natural gas from Russia; high interest rates from the European Central Bank that deter investment in new machinery and vehicles; and consumers worried about the future who are saving their wages instead of spending them.",
      "Spending on hotels and restaurants sagged by 4.4% and outlays for clothing and shoes fell by 2.8% despite rising disposable income.",
      "On top of that comes increasing competition for export markets from China in traditional areas of German strength such as cars, industrial machinery and chemicals.",
      "Other, more chronic issues include excessive bureaucracy and a shortage of skilled labor.",
      "\u201cGerman exports saw themselves exposed to stronger international competition, not least from the People's Republic of China,\u201d Brand said. \u201cGerman exports shrank although world trade increased in 2024.\u201d",

      "Despite the weak growth figures, the jobs market remains strong and disposable income is rising along with pay raises from new wage agreements aimed at making up for inflation.",
      "But a willingness to spend is being held back by worries fed by a range of factors, including a drumbeat of job cut announcements at major companies including Volkswagen, steelmaker and industrial conglomerate Thyssenkrupp and auto technology supplier Bosch, and by the war in Ukraine.",
      "Brand said that the economy is believed to have shrunk by 0.1% in the fourth quarter compared with the previous three-month period. That, however, is a rough initial estimate because hard economic data for December haven't yet been released."

      "The Office for National Statistics said Wednesday that inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, was 2.5% in the year to December, largely as a result of easing price pressures in the services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the British economy.",
      "That was down from 2.6% the previous month. Economists had expected no change in the annual rate.",
      "Though inflation has fallen, it remains above the Bank of England's target of 2%.",

      "Inflation is way down from levels seen a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and then because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up energy costs.",
      "As inflation rates have fallen from multidecade highs, central banks have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009.",

      "Long-range attacks have been a feature of the nearly three-year war, where on the front line snaking about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) from northeast to southern Ukraine, the armies have been engaged in a war of attrition. Russia has been advancing on the battlefield over the past year, though its progress has been slow and costly.",

      "U.S. inflation likely worsened last month on the back of higher prices for gas, eggs, and used cars, a trend that could make it less likely that the Federal Reserve will cut its key interest rate much this year",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. inflation probably worsened last month on the back of higher prices for gas, eggs, and used cars, a trend that could make it less likely that the Federal Reserve will cut its key interest rate much this year.",
      "On Wednesday the Labor Department is expected to report that in December the consumer price index rose 2.8% from a year ago, according to economists surveyed by FactSet, up from a 2.7% yearly increase in November. It would be the third straight rise, after inflation fell to a 3 1/2 year low of 2.4% in September.",
      "The uptick could fuel ongoing concerns among many economists and in financial markets that inflation has gotten stuck above the Fed's 2% target. Such concerns have sent interest rates on Treasury securities higher, which has also pushed up borrowing costs for mortgages, cars, and credit cards, even as the Fed has cut its key rate.",
      "Last Friday's unexpectedly strong jobs report caused stock and bond prices to plunge on fears that a healthy economy could keep inflation elevated, preventing the Fed from cutting its key rate further.",
      "Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, economists forecast that so-called core inflation remained at 3.3% in December for the fourth month in a row.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices likely rose 0.3% in December for the second month in a row. Price increases at that pace would exceed the Fed's 2% target. Core prices are forecast to have risen 0.2%.",
      "Some of the uptick in prices was likely fueled by one-time factors, such as another jump in the cost of eggs, which has been one of the most volatile food categories in recent years. An outbreak of avian flu is decimating many chicken flocks, reducing egg supply.",
      "Economists generally expect inflation to decline a bit in the coming months, as apartment rental prices, wages, and car insurance costs grow more slowly. But clouding the outlook are potentially inflationary policies from President-elect Donald Trump. Trump has proposed to boost tariffs on all imports to the U.S. and to implement mass deportations of unauthorized migrants.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump said that he would create the \u201cExternal Revenue Service\u201d to collect tariffs, suggesting he expects many duties to ultimately be imposed, even as he has also said he intends to use them as bargaining chips. During the campaign, he promised to impose up to 20% duties on all imports and as high as 60% tariffs on goods from China.",
      "Last week, minutes from the Fed's December meeting showed that economists at the central bank expect inflation to remain about the same this year as in 2024, pushed up a bit by higher tariffs.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the central bank will keep its key interest rate elevated until inflation is back to 2%. As a result, Wall Street investors expect the Fed to cut its key rate just a single time this year, from its current level of 4.3%, according to futures prices.",
      "Other borrowing costs remain high, in part because of expectations for higher inflation and few Fed rate cuts. Mortgage rates, which are strongly influenced by the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, rose for the fourth straight time last week to 6.9%, far above the pandemic-era lows of below 3%.",
      "With the job market resilient \u2014 the unemployment rate ticked down to a low 4.1% last month \u2014 consumers are able to keep spending and drive growth. If demand exceeds what companies can produce, however, that could fuel further inflation.",
      "Earlier this month, several prominent economists, including former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke, agreed that the tariffs Trump will ultimately impose will probably only have minor effects on inflation. The issue was discussed at the American Economic Association's annual meeting in San Francisco.",
      "Jason Furman, a top economic adviser during the Obama administration, said at the conference that the duties may lift the annual inflation rate by just several tenths of a percentage point. But he added that even an increase of that size could be enough to affect the Fed's rate decisions.",
      "\u201cYou are in a world where the Trump policies are more like tenths, than something cataclysmic,\" he said Jan. 4. \"But I think we\u2019re also in a world where the direction of whether rates are staying the same, going down, or going up, depends on those tenths.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Bob Uecker, the voice of his hometown Milwaukee Brewers who after a short playing career earned the moniker \u201cMr. Baseball\u201d and honors from the Hall of Fame, has died",
      "MILWAUKEE -- Bob Uecker, the voice of his hometown Milwaukee Brewers who after a short playing career earned the moniker \"Mr. Baseball\" and honors from the Hall of Fame, has died. He was 90.",
      "The team announced Uecker died Thursday morning, calling it \"one of the most difficult days in Milwaukee Brewers history.\" In a statement released by the club, Uecker\u2019s family said he had battled small cell lung cancer since early 2023.",
      "\u201cEven in the face of this challenge, his enthusiasm for life was always present, never allowing his spirit to falter,\u201d the family said.",
      "Uecker was best known as a colorful comedian and broadcaster who earned his nickname during one of his numerous appearances on Johnny Carson\u2019s late night show.",
      "Born and raised in Milwaukee, Uecker signed his first professional contract with the Milwaukee Braves in 1956 and reached the majors in 1962. He\u2019d last six seasons in the big leagues as a backup catcher, finishing with a .200 average and 14 homers.",
      "He won a World Series ring with St. Louis in 1964 and also played for Atlanta and Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cCareer highlights? I had two,\u201d he often joked. \u201cI got an intentional walk from Sandy Koufax and I got out of a rundown against the Mets.\u201d",
      "Uecker also befriended former Brewers owner and MLB commissioner Bud Selig, who initially hired him as a scout. Selig liked to joke about how Uecker\u2019s initial scouting report was stained with mashed potatoes and gravy.",
      "Selig eventually brought Uecker to the broadcast booth. Uecker became the voice of the Brewers in 1971, in the second year after the team moved from Seattle.",
      "Uecker remained with the club from that point on and became one of the Brewers\u2019 most indelible figures. Brewers manager Craig Counsell grew up in the Milwaukee area and remembered spending summer days throwing a baseball against the roof and catching it while listening to Uecker\u2019s broadcasts.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no single person in this franchise\u2019s history who has been as iconic and as important as Bob Uecker,\u201d said Jeff Levering, a member of the Brewers\u2019 broadcast team since 2015.",
      "Even as his celebrity status grew nationwide, Uecker savored the opportunity to continue calling games to fans in his hometown.",
      "\u201cTo be able to do a game each and every day throughout the summer and talk to people every day at 6:30 for a night game, you become part of people\u2019s families,\u201d Uecker once said. \u201cI know that because I get mail from people that tell me that. That\u2019s part of the reward for being here, just to be recognized by the way you talk, the way you describe a game, whatever.\u201d",
      "Uecker was honored by the Hall of Fame with the Ford C. Frick award in 2003 and spent nearly 20 minutes keeping the Cooperstown, New York, crowd of about 18,000 in stitches.",
      "\u201cI still \u2014 and this is not sour grapes by any means \u2014 still think I should have gone in as a player,\u201d he quipped.",
      "\u201cUeck\u201d got his big break off the field after opening for Don Rickles at Al Hirt\u2019s nightclub in Atlanta in 1969. That performance caught Hirt\u2019s attention, and the musician set him up to appear on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d with Johnny Carson. He became one of Carson\u2019s favorite guests, making more than 100 appearances.",
      "Carson was the one who dubbed Uecker \u201cMr. Baseball.\u201d And the name stuck.",
      "But Uecker\u2019s comedy was just a part of his abilities. His warm storytelling and delivery made Uecker a natural to become one of the first color commentators on network TV broadcasts in the 1970s with ABC. In the \u201990s, he teamed up with Bob Costas and Joe Morgan for the World Series.",
      "From there, Uecker reached most households as one of the Miller Lite All-Stars in popular commercials for the beer brand based out of Milwaukee and Uecker later launched his TV acting career in 1985 on the ABC sitcom, \u201cMr. Belvedere.\u201d",
      "Uecker played George Owens during the successful 122-episode run of the series that lasted six years, as the head of the family and sports writer in a home that brings in a butler who struggles to adapt to an American household.",
      "In a bit of casting that kept things pretty close to home, Uecker also played a prominent role in the movies Major League (1989) and Major League II (1994) as crass announcer Harry Doyle for a down-and-out Cleveland Indians franchise that finds a way to become playoff contenders.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m part of American folklore, I guess,\u201d Uecker told The Associated Press in 2003. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a Hollywood guy. Baseball and broadcasting are in my blood.\u201d",
      "His wry description of a badly wayward pitch \u2014 \u201cJuuuust a bit outside!\u201d \u2014 in the movie is still often-repeated by announcers and fans at ballparks all over.",
      "Uecker\u2019s acting left some to believe he was more about being funny than a serious baseball announcer, but his tenure and observations with the Brewers were spot on, especially when games were tight. Equally enjoyable were games that weren\u2019t, when Uecker would tell stories about other major leaguers, his own career and his hobbies as an avid fisherman and golfer.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants to hear somebody screwing around when you got a good game going,\u201d Uecker said. \u201cI think people see \u2018Major League\u2019 and they think Harry Doyle and figure that\u2019s what Bob Uecker does. I do that sometimes, I do. But when we\u2019ve got a good game going, I don\u2019t mess around.\u201d",
      "In his later years, he took a serious approach to his health, swimming daily leading up to heart surgery in April 2010. Very soon after the procedures, doctors said Uecker returned to walking several miles and was ahead in recovery.",
      "Uecker pushed to return to the booth and began calling games again in July, saying he bribed the doctors by allowing them to throw out the first pitch.",
      "\u201cYou talk about all the things Bob has done, he never wanted to leave Milwaukee,\u201d Selig said. \u201cAbove all, he made himself into a great play-by-play announcer. That\u2019s what he did. He\u2019s everything to this franchise and loves every minute of it.\u201d",
      "Uecker\u2019s own career provided him most of his material. His former teammates said Uecker would do impressions of other broadcasters on the bus, but Uecker turned the spotlight on himself after his playing career was over.",
      "\u201cI signed with the Milwaukee Braves for $3,000. That bothered my dad at the time because he didn\u2019t have that kind of dough,\u201d he said \u201cBut he eventually scraped it up.\u201d",
      "Another classic: \u201cWhen I came up to bat with three men on and two outs in the ninth, I looked in the other team\u2019s dugout and they were already in street clothes.\u201d",
      "Uecker also presided over the stirring ceremony that closed Milwaukee County Stadium in 2000. When the Brewers\u2019 new stadium opened as Miller Park in 2001, the team began selling \u201cUecker Seats\u201d high in the upper deck and obstructed for a $1.",
      "The stadium, now known as American Family Field, has two statues in Uecker\u2019s honor. There\u2019s a statue outside the stadium and another one in the back of Section 422, a nod to the Miller Lite commercial in which he famously said \u201cI must be in the front row!\u201d while getting taken to one of the worst seats in the ballpark.",

      "GENEVA -- The head of the United Nations labor agency says it has good relations with Saudi Arabia during an ongoing investigation of alleged rights abuses by the 2034 World Cup host, and aims to send more expert staff to Riyadh.",
      "International Labour Organization director general Gilbert Houngbo spoke of \u201cvery constructive\u201d bilateral relations with Saudi Arabia on Thursday at a briefing ahead of attending the annual gathering of world leaders next week in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "Houngbo also said he shared outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s concerns about the growing influence of a \u201ctech-industrial complex,\u201d expressed on Wednesday in a farewell address from the White House.",
      "Houngbo addressed a range of issues in a briefing with reporters to launch the agency's annual analysis of global employment trends.",
      "The ILO is investigating a formal complaint by an international trade union, which Houngbo confirmed is active, accusing Saudi Arabia of mistreatment within the \u201ckafala\u201d employment system of migrant workers needed for the kingdom's construction boom.",
      "It was filed last year as FIFA steered the 2034 edition of its marquee men\u2019s soccer tournament toward the oil-rich kingdom. Days before the Saudi win was confirmed in December, Human Rights Watch urged FIFA to insist on binding commitments to protect migrant workers there who mostly come from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Yemen.",
      "No assurances were publicly given nor commitments to let civil society groups monitor World Cup projects on the ground, though Saudi bid documents sent to FIFA last year did offer to work with just one international body \u2014 the ILO.",
      "\u201cThe (Saudi) authorities have told me that they really want to work with ILO,\" Houngbo, the former prime minister of Togo, said on Thursday. \"If there is an understanding on both parties that there is some deficit (in labor conditions) then they are ready to work and correct them.\u201d",
      "Saudi Arabia plans to build and renovate 15 stadiums in five cities for the 48-team, 104-game soccer tournament. Eight stadiums \u2014 as many as neighboring Qatar used in total for the 2022 World Cup \u2014 must be built from scratch. Some are extravagantly innovative.",
      "Rights activists and trades unions fear FIFA and Saudi Arabia are not building in safeguards to avoid a repeat of the challenges faced during more than a decade of World Cup preparations in Qatar, including at least hundreds of deaths of migrant workers.",
      "The ILO did work with Qatar, and opened an office in Doha, to help reform its \u201ckafala\u201d laws.",
      "\u201cWe are discussing with the authorities to increase our presence even with some more experts in Riyadh,\u201d said Houngbo, who pointed to the Saudi capital hosting the 2030 World Expo as another signature construction project.",
      "Houngbo said he will visit Riyadh for the Jan. 29-30 Global Labor Market Conference.",

      "Danielle Collins has gotten into a back-and-forth with a booing crowd at the Australian Open after eliminating a local player",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Danielle Collins got into a back-and-forth with a booing crowd at the Australian Open after eliminating a local player on Thursday night, blowing kisses to the spectators and repeating the phrase, \u201cHow about that?!\u201d",
      "The 10th-seeded Collins, an American who was the runner-up to Australia's Ash Barty in the 2022 final, defeated Destanee Aiava 7-6 (4), 4-6, 6-2 across nearly 2 1/2 hours.",
      "That's when the fun began. First, the 31-year-old Collins \u2014 who originally planned to retire after last season but decided to return to the tour in 2025 \u2014 held her hand to her left ear and, looking into the stands at Kia Arena, said that three-word phrase a couple of times. Then, as the jeers grew louder, she began blowing kisses toward the fans.",
      "\u201cThe people that don't like you, and the people that hate you, they actually pay your bills. Obviously my professional career is not going to last forever,\u201d Collins said at her news conference, noting that anyone who \u201cbought a ticket to come out here and heckle me, it's all going toward the Danielle Collins Fund.\u201d",
      "She said she planned to spend some money on a \u201cfive-star vacation,\u201d and mentioned that she and her friends \u201clike boats; we like big boats; we like yachts.\u201d",
      "Earlier, when Collins began the customary post-match interview in the stadium, the noise from the seats kept coming and interrupted her first answer. So she paused and grinned, then said: \u201cI was thinking during the match ... as long as I'm out here, I might as well take that big fat check.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cThank you for coming out here and supporting us tonight.\u201d",
      "After speaking briefly about her next opponent \u2014 another American, No. 19 Madison Keys, who reached the final of the 2017 U.S. Open \u2014 Collins turned her attention back to the crowd and closed by saying, \u201cThanks, everyone. Thank you, guys. Love ya!\u201d",
      "Aiava is ranked only 195th and needed to go through qualifying rounds to earn a spot in the women's bracket. But she gave Collins a tough contest.",
      "\u201cI wasn't super surprised by how Destanee was playing,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI just had to ... do everything I can.\u201d",
      "Collins, who is from Florida and played college tennis at Virginia, famously got into a post-match spat with Iga Swiatek at the Paris Olympics last August.",
      "As for the acrimony out there on court with the paying customers on Thursday, Collins said: \u201cI loved it. I've been doing this my whole life. I love playing (in front of) a crowd that has energy, regardless of which side they're on. It kind of motivates me more.\u201d",

      "The Australian Open is getting in on the newest trend in the sports world by re-creating tennis matches in video-game form",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Maybe attending sports events in person is too been-there, done-that in the modern age. So, apparently, is watching the actual action on a TV, laptop or phone. The Australian Open is getting in on the newest trend in the sports world by re-creating tennis matches in video-game form.",
      "The year's first Grand Slam tournament, which runs through Jan. 26, is streaming real-time animated feeds on its YouTube channel that mimic what's happening in the three main stadiums.",
      "Players are represented by characters that look like something out of a Wii game \u2014 not exactly perfect portrayals of Coco Gauff or Novak Djokovic, perhaps, but the graphics do try to show the correct outfit colors or hats and bandanas the athletes are wearing and reflect what is happening in the matches, with about a one-point delay.",
      "\u201cSometimes I think it\u2019s a very accurate (depiction) of the actual player that\u2019s playing. So it\u2019s weird. It\u2019s funny and weird,\u201d said 2021 U.S. Open finalist Leylah Fernandez, who will face Gauff in the third round Friday. \u201cI did not see myself just yet. Maybe I will. Now I\u2019m curious, because I\u2019ve seen different players ... and I think I want to watch myself, too.\u201d",
      "Tennis Australia created its own \u201cskins\u201d to represent players, chair umpires and ball persons.",
      "\u201cThe wonderful part of it is it\u2019s the players\u2019 actual movement. It\u2019s the actual trajectory of the ball,\u201d Machar Reid, Tennis Australia\u2019s director of innovation, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re taking the real into the unreal. That\u2019s part of the magic.\u201d",
      "Carlos Alcaraz, a four-time Grand Slam champion at age 21, called it \u201ca good alternative.\u201d",
      "Like many players preparing for future opponents, Fernandez often scours YouTube to try to find footage of past matches to aid with scouting. That, Fernandez said with a chuckle, is how she accidentally discovered the cartoonish replays from Melbourne Park that have been creating a buzz among the competitors.",
      "She was having trouble finding a certain match when she noticed a thumbnail photo of two players, Fernandez said.",
      "\u201cSo I click on it and think, \u2019This is it! Finally! I have one,'\u201d Fernandez said. \"Nope. It\u2019s a Wii character, which is hilarious.\u201d",
      "Jiri Lehecka, a Czech player seeded 24th in Australia, was checking social media the other day when he came across a \u201creplay\u201d of 2021 U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev's avatar destroying a net camera by smacking it repeatedly with his racket during a first-round victory.",
      "\u201cI had no idea that something like that exists, so for me, it was quite funny to see that,\u201d Lehecka said. \u201cMaybe I will see myself as a game character one day. We will see.\u201d",
      "To get the chance, he'll need to play a match in Rod Laver Arena, Margaret Court Arena or John Cain Arena. Tennis Australia first experimented with this on one court during last year's tournament, hoping to attract gamers and a younger audience to the sport.",
      "The NFL, NBA and NHL also have tried this type of approach, using animation for alternate game telecasts.",
      "The 2024 debut in Melbourne \u201cwas kind of in stealth and didn\u2019t necessarily capture the world\u2019s imagination. But this year, we\u2019ve seen that happening,\u201d Reid said.",
      "The streams in the first four days of the event this week drew more than 950,000 views, according to Tennis Australia; the figure for the same time period in 2024 was about 140,000.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of our DNA to innovate and try to challenge the status quo or, in this instance, provide experiences to different groups of fans that are more personalized for them to consume,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing younger kids or the gaming demographic gravitating to the sport maybe in this way. Clearly, it\u2019s not for everyone.\u201d",
      "Might this eventually became the No. 1 way fans \u201cwatch\u201d sports?",
      "\u201cNot in my lifetime and not in yours, I don\u2019t think. But who knows? The world of sport and entertainment is moving so, so quickly,\u201d Reid said. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re always going to be drawn to the amazing athletes doing their thing in front of our very eyes.\u201d",

      "The trio each make compelling cases. Alli, the moguls standout, touts the knee-jarring bumps and jumps; Lauren, the downhill ski racer, cites speeds in excess of 70 mph (112.6 kph) along an icy course; and Sam, the ski jumper, offers up soaring through the air after launching off a fear-inspiring jump.",

      "Each sibling was born in a different state \u2014 Sam in California, Lauren in Michigan, Alli in Washington and Daniel in Texas. Living in Dallas, an opportunity came around for the family to settle down in Park City, Utah.",
      "Amy and Dan jumped at the chance. Recreational skiers, they got their young kids involved through the Youth Sports Alliance, a program set up after the Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympics to encourage children to try different winter sports.",
      "Sam eventually gravitated toward ski jumping, where the elite jumpers sit on a bar about as high as a 40-story building until they glide down the runway and see how far they can fly.",
      "\u201cI remember Sam just said, \u2018Mom, dad, I\u2019m going to do this,\u2019\u201d recalled Lauren, who's competing in Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, Italy, this weekend at the venue for the upcoming Olympics. \u201cI think they just thought she was skiing over jumps. And then it turns out she was jumping these HUGE jumps.\u201d",
      "For Lauren, it was the thrill of speed that led her to ski racing (once she conquered the fear). This offered an early hint of her potential: She won a junior national event with a borrowed race suit and on a pair of skis where the bottom looked as if she'd just rolled across a gravel parking lot.",
      "In the case of Alli, she tried out a little bit of everything \u2014 aerials, slopestyle, halfpipe, big mountain \u2014 before being drawn into the world of moguls by the combination of bumps and flips.",
      "A side benefit to competing in different disciplines? No sibling rivalries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to have my \u2018thing\u2019 and be able to tune in and cheer for my other siblings as they do theirs,\u201d Sam said. \u201cComparing experiences and stories is so cool.\u201d",
      "Of course, all of them think their event is the most challenging. None of them, though, really want to do the other\u2019s discipline.",
      "Alli on Sam's ski jumping: \u201cWhile the idea of literally flying sounds amazing, I\u2019ll stick with the smaller airs rather than sending myself down a giant hill.\u201d",
      "Sam on Alli and the moguls: \u201cThat\u2019s definitely a sport I\u2019m leaving to the professionals (Alli).\u201d",
      "Alli on Lauren and the downhill: \u201cProps to her for being able to go that fast down a hill and still be giggling in the finish.\u201d",
      "Lauren had plenty to smile about last Sunday in St. Anton, when she captured her first World Cup win. Her childhood idol, Lindsey Vonn, even came over to the leader\u2019s box and gave her a celebratory hug (Vonn took fourth). It meant the world to Lauren, who counts a slalom ski from Vonn (or so she's been told) as a prized possession.",
      "One of the best parts for Lauren was the call home to share the news of her victory. It was still early back in Utah and her father was sleeping.",
      "\u201cHe was like, \u2018What\u2019s wrong? Are you OK?\u2018\u201d Lauren said with a laugh. \u201cI was like, \u201cDad, I won!\u2019\"",
      "Meanwhile, Alli was getting ready to be taken to the airport by her mother.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it and rushed downstairs and we were both in shock,\" Alli said. \"It was so surreal to see her on the winner\u2019s chair.\u201d",
      "Sam was skiing in Norway with no cell service, but \"she called me the moment she had service and was like, \u2018What the heck?\u2019\u201d said Lauren, whose known for wearing bucket hats, of which she currently has around 26. \u201cIt was so fun.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to keep track of all their training and travel schedules. That\u2019s why their mom created the \u201cMacuga Calendar,\u201d a detailed, color-coded spreadsheet.",
      "This week, for instance, there\u2019s notations for Lauren racing in Cortina; Alli getting ready to travel to Waterville Valley in New Hampshire for a World Cup event; 19-year-old Daniel competing in a series of races at Mt. Bachelor in Oregon; and Sam preparing an event in Sapporo, Japan, where Amy and Dan were also heading. The calendar also features a \u201cnotes\u201d section to make sure their dogs are well taken care of while they're away.",
      "It\u2019s an invaluable tool.",
      "\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know where they are, what country they\u2019re in most of the time,\u201d Lauren said. \u201cIt\u2019s just chaos. I don\u2019t know how my mom does it.\"",
      "Should all three sisters make their Olympic teams, it will present another logistical challenge. Their disciplines spread out all over Italy, with moguls in Livigno, ski jumping in Predazzo and ski racing in Cortina. They\u2019re hours from each other.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll make it all work,\u201d Amy said. \u201cWe'll find a way.\u201d",

      "O\u2019Neil, who takes over for Greg Norman, was CEO of Merlin Entertainments who was in charge of business operations of more than 140 of the company\u2019s attractions. He previously was CEO of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, whose holdings include the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and the NHL's New Jersey Devils.",
      "\u201cScott has the passion, the tenacity and the vision to continue leveraging LIV Golf\u2019s position as a preeminent, global sports and entertainment company and to lead our amazing teams and players for years to come,\u201d said Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia and chairman of LIV Golf.",

      "LIV Golf begins its fourth season on Feb. 6 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The first U.S. event is April 4-6 at Trump Doral, a week before the Masters.",

      "Then it\u2019s Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens against Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills to cap the weekend.",
      "Three of the home teams are favorites by at least six points, according to Bet MGM Sportsbook.",
      "Line: Chiefs minus 8 1/2",
      "Kansas City\u2019s quest for a three-peat starts against the Texans, who are coming off an impressive 32-12 win over the Los Angeles Chargers. Stroud made big plays with his arm and even had a career-long 27-yard run that sparked the offense against Los Angeles. Houston\u2019s defense baffled Justin Herbert, forcing four interceptions, including a pair by All-Pro cornerback Derek Stingley. If Stroud and the offense avoid turnovers and Joe Mixon has another 100-yard game rushing, the Texans can keep Mahomes off the field and have a chance to pull off the upset.",
      "The Chiefs beat the Texans 27-19 in Week 16. They were home for that one, too. Houston lost wide receiver Tank Dell to a knee injury on a touchdown catch in that game. Mahomes finished the season with 11 TDs and zero picks in his last six games. After sitting out in Week 18 and a bye, Mahomes and most of the starters have to avoid being rusty in their first game action in three weeks.",
      "The Chiefs are 8-0 with Mahomes in the divisional and wild-card rounds. They\u2019re 6-0 against the spread in their past six playoff games. But Kansas City is 22-32-3 ATS as a favorite of at least seven points with Mahomes, including 0-5-1 this season.",
      "CHIEFS: 27-17",
      "Line: Lions minus 9 1/2",
      "The Commanders keep finding ways to win late with five straight victories coming down to the final play. The victory in Tampa Bay was the franchise\u2019s first playoff win since 2006. Daniels connected often with Terry McLaurin and Dyami Brown, but Washington will need Brian Robinson and Austin Ekeler to run more effectively to have a chance against Detroit. A defense that held Baker Mayfield and the Buccaneers to their worst game in eight weeks has to step up against the most dynamic offense in the NFL.",
      "The Lions could get running back David Montgomery back to join Jahmyr Gibbs in an elite backfield. That should open things up even more for Jared Goff throwing to All-Pro wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and other playmakers.",

      "The Rams used a dominant defensive effort to eliminate the Vikings, sacking Sam Darnold nine times in a 27-9 victory. Getting to Hurts won\u2019t be that easy behind an offensive line that features five guys who received All-Pro votes.",
      "Plus, the Eagles are going to run the ball often with Barkley, who set a franchise record with 255 yards rushing in a 37-20 win in Los Angeles on Nov. 24.",
      "Rams coach Sean McVay vs. Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio should be a classic head-to-head matchup. Matthew Stafford had success throwing against Philly\u2019s No. 1 defense in the previous meeting. He connected with Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp 17 times for 177 of his 243 yards passing.",
      "The Rams have to travel cross-country and have one less day of rest following a Monday night win. But McVay is 16-7 against the spread on short rest, going 7-1 ATS in his past eight games. With Stafford at quarterback, McVay is 8-2 ATS on short rest.",
      "Still, playing in Philadelphia in January is different and the Eagles are 6-0 straight up at home in the divisional round, covering the spread in five of those games.",
      "BEST BET: EAGLES: 29-17",
      "Line: Ravens minus 1",
      "Jackson vs. Allen gets all the hype but this isn\u2019t going to decide the NFL MVP. Votes were cast before the playoffs started. Jackson, who earned All-Pro honors, led Baltimore to a 28-14 win against Pittsburgh last week while Allen and the Bills routed Denver 31-7.",
      "The Ravens put a 35-10 beatdown on the Bills at home in Week 4. They\u2019re road favorites, a sign of disrespect for Buffalo. The Bills haven\u2019t been home underdogs in the playoffs since 1967 against the Chiefs.",
      "Buffalo\u2019s defense has a tough task trying to slow down Jackson and Derrick Henry. Greg Rousseau, Von Miller and Ed Oliver need to pressure Jackson and somehow keep him contained.",

      "TCU won its first 14 games in Campbell\u2019s debut last season, but Prince (broken finger) and Conner (MCL) got sidelined by injuries and senior point guard Jaden Owens sustained a season-ending knee injury within a couple of weeks after that school-record start. That left the Frogs with six available scholarship players, and two of them were on minutes restrictions coming off their own injuries.",
      "About 40 students then went through tryouts on campus the same week that TCU forfeited Big 12 games against Kansas State and Iowa State. Four of them were added to the roster before the season resumed with a 66-60 win at home last Jan. 23 over UCF, the same team the 10th-ranked Frogs beat 90-81 at home Tuesday night for their second nine-game winning streak this season.",

There\u2019s a huge mural in our offices of pictures from that game that will be up there as long as I get to coach here.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-7 Prince had 27 points on 11-of-15 shooting and seven rebounds against UCF this week. Van Lith scored 20 points while matching her career high with six 3-pointers and had seven assists without a turnover, while Conner made four 3s while scoring 14 points and having six assists. The Frogs had assists on 29 of their 32 made field goals and finished with 15 3-pointers, their most ever in a Big 12 game.",

      "\u201cThat game probably is going to be the biggest blessing of our season. Honestly, it taught me a lot personally, but I think our team a lot. Each person learned different things that were needed for the rest of the season,\u201d Prince, a former Oregon player, said this week. \u201cThis is the most fun group I\u2019ve ever played with in my entire college career, my entire probably basketball career in my life.\u201d",
      "The Frogs are seeking their first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2010.",
      "The four walk-ons added to the roster after open tryouts on campus last January became known as the \u201cUnderfrogs.\u201d",
      "Sophomore guard Ella Hamlin from nearby Granbury, Texas, the only of those four still with the team, is now on a full scholarship. An emotional Campbell surprised Hamlin with that news in the locker room after the win over UCF on Tuesday night, the timing being specific and symbolic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. ... It\u2019s just amazing to look back and see like how far it\u2019s come,\u201d said Hamlin, who has played only 23 minutes while appearing in 10 games this season.",

      "This will start in March in the 43rd year of the women's NCAA Tournament. The NCAA sharing March Madness revenue with its member schools has long been a feature of the men\u2019s tournament. The lack of a units system for the women\u2019s tournament has been a point of sharp criticism.",

      "Urban Meyer will join Nick Saban in the 2025 College Football Hall of Fame class",
      "Urban Meyer will join Nick Saban in the 2025 College Football Hall of Fame class, and Michael Vick and Michael Strahan are among the former players who will be inducted.",
      "The National Football Foundation announced Saban's selection last week and the rest of the 18-player, four-coach class on Wednesday.",
      "Saban retired last year as the NCAA's active leader in wins with 292-71-1 over 28 seasons at Toledo, Michigan State, LSU and Alabama. His seven national championships \u2014 one at LSU, six at Alabama \u2014 are most by a Football Bowl Subdivision coach.",
      "Meyer was 187-32 with three national championships over 17 seasons at Bowling Green, Utah, Florida and Ohio State. He won 22 of 24 games at Utah before taking over at Florida, where he won national titles in 2006 and 2008. He moved to Ohio State in 2012, won his third national championship in 2014 and went 83-9 over seven seasons.",
      "Vick was the consummate dual-threat quarterback in his two seasons at Virginia Tech, where he led the Hokies to a 22-2 record and the 1999 national championship game. His 13-year NFL career was interrupted by his 2007 conviction for his involvement in a dogfighting ring. He pleaded guilty and served 21 months in federal prison before resuming his career in 2009. Last month he was hired as Norfolk State's head coach.",
      "Strahan, now co-host on ABC's Good Morning America and a FOX NFL Sunday analyst, was a terror as a defensive lineman for Texas Southern from 1989-92. He recorded 41.5 sacks in four seasons before he went on to play 15 seasons for the New York Giants. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2014.",
      "Terry Hanratty, 24-4-2 as Ara Parseghian's quarterback at Notre Dame from 1966-68, also was selected. He helped lead the 1966 team to a share of the national championship and joins teammates Jim Lynch, Alan Page and Joe Theismann in the Hall of Fame.",
      "Among other picks was Wisconsin's Montee Ball, who won the 2012 Doak Walker Award as the nation\u2019s best running back. The year before he tied Barry Sanders\u2019 NCAA record of 39 total touchdowns in a season. He finished his career with 5,140 rushing yards, averaging 104.9 per game, and 77 rushing touchdowns.",

Blakeney guided the Trojans from Division II to the FBS from 1991-2014 and remains the Sun Belt Conference's coaching wins leader with a 178-113-1 record. Korver was 212-77-6 with two NAIA championships in 28 years (1967-94) at Northwestern.",
      "The 2025 class will be inducted Dec. 9 during an awards dinner in Las Vegas. The Hall of Fame is in Atlanta.",

      "Kluetmeier died Tuesday due to complications from Parkinson\u2019s disease and a stroke, according to his longtime employer, Sports Illustrated. He was considered a pioneer in remote and underwater camera technology.",
      "\u201cBesides his body of work, he left an impression on everybody that he met or worked with,\" said New York City-based photographer Jeff Kavanaugh, who worked alongside Kluetmeier for decades. \u201cIn some ways, that was a great impression. Sometimes it wasn\u2019t. But all in all, it\u2019s just the drive and the determination and just the sheer genius of some of the things that he engineered.",
      "\u201cThe advances that he helped bring along, especially in sports photography, he\u2019ll be remembered for that.\u201d",
      "Kluetmeier was born in Germany in 1942 and moved with his family to Milwaukee at age 9. He was introduced to the idea of a career in photojournalism when pictures of him and his pet parakeet, Chirpy, were published by The Associated Press.",
      "By age 15, he was shooting photos for the AP. Using a Nikon S camera that his parents bought him, he began freelancing for the AP and the Milwaukee Journal.",
      "He once recalled driving to Green Bay while the Packers were in training camp. He walked into the cafeteria at St. Norbert College with a camera around his neck, only to be accosted by coach Vince Lombardi.",
      "\u201cKid, what are you doing here?\u201d Lombardi asked.",
      "Kluetmeier explained that he was assigned to take pictures of Bart Starr, Paul Hornung and Jim Taylor for the AP. Lombardi turned and shouted: \u201cStarr! Taylor! Hornung! Get over here! This kid wants to take some pictures of you guys!\u201d",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my luck,\u201d Kluetmeier said. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine something like that happening today.\u201d",
      "Kluetmeier joined the Journal staff a few years later. In 1969, before he turned 30, Heinz was poached by Time Inc. to work for Life and SI.",
      "He worked countless Olympic Games beginning in 1972 \u2014 his first SI cover featured seven-time gold medalist swimmer Mark Spitz \u2014 as well as Super Bowls, World Series, Kentucky Derbies and Indy 500s. He also photographed President John F. Kennedy on the campaign trail.",
      "His most notable images came from the Olympics, though. His photo of the United States celebrating its victory against Russia in the Lake Placid Games \u2014 shot with a handheld camera from the stands \u2014 is among the most famous sports images of the 20th century. It donned the SI cover without a headline or a caption.",
      "Kluetmeier, who earned an engineering degree, was the first to experiment with an underwater camera during the world swimming championships in Perth, Australia, in 1991 and had mastered the technique by the 2008 Beijing Olympics. His expertise delivered frame-by-frame images that confirmed Phelps edged Milorad Cavic for gold in the 100-meter butterfly.",
      "\u201cIt was pretty dramatic,\" Kavanaugh recalled Wednesday. \"We were fighting for space under there. He just knew that was going to be an iconic moment. And then it turned out it was (Phelps) and Cavic that ended up in Lanes 4 and 5, so we were in perfect position for that. And then it was just kind of little bit of luck hitting the moments.\u201d",
      "Kluetmeier won the Lucy Award for lifetime achievement as a photographer in 2007. He was inducted into the Swimming Hall of Fame in 2017 as a contributor.",

      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The NASCAR team owned by Hall of Famer Dale Earnhardt Jr. will attempt to make its Cup Series debut in the Daytona 500 with a champion driver and a partnership with a Grammy Award-winning artist.",
      "JR Motorsports has entered reigning Xfinity Series champion Justin Allgaier into next month's season-opening \u201cGreat American Race\u201d in a Chevrolet sponsored by the whiskey label created by 10-time Grammy winner Chris Stapleton. Traveller Whiskey is a collaborative blend created by Buffalo Trace Distillery with Stapleton.",
      "Allgaier will have to qualify for the Daytona 500 \u2014 a race his boss has won twice \u2014 on either speed in time trials or via one of the qualifying races. It marks the first time in JRM history the team has entered a race in the Cup Series, and Earnhardt said the team will be focused on qualifying via speed powered by a Hendrick Motorsports engine.",
      "The deal came together when Stapleton, who has a friendship with Rick Hendrick, approached Hendrick about a NASCAR collaboration with Traveller Whiskey. Hendrick put Stapleton in touch with Earnhardt as he also has an ownership stake with JRM.",
      "\u201cWe had this whiskey and I always have \u201dpie in the sky\" dreams of things to do and we knocked on the door a little bit,\" Stapleton told The Associated Press. \u201cIf I'm being 100% honest, I just thought it would be cool to see whiskey on a car. And he brought up Dale Jr. and I was like \u2018Why wouldn\u2019t we do that if we can?' This is a lot of my audience, for both whiskey and country music, and what (Earnhardt) does in auto racing.\u201d",
      "The third-party introduction is helping Earnhardt and his sister, Kelley Earnhardt-Miller, attempt to make a dream come true for their race team.",
      "\u201cI shared with Rick that for a very long time that I had a dream, at one time in my life, of entering the Daytona 500 as a car owner,\u201d Earnhardt told AP. \u201cRick presented the opportunity to connect with Chris and his team, they were interested in marketing in our sport, and Rick knew that I was wanting to fulfill this opportunity. It was like two people that wanted the same thing.\u201d",
      "The Earnhardts have led JRM to 88 Xfinity Series victories with drivers Chase Elliott, William Byron, Tyler Reddick and Allgaier last November. JRM is starting its 24th year of overall competition with four cars in NASCAR's second-tier Xfinity Series.",
      "JRM has never attempted to enter a Cup race. The Earnhardts have expressed interest in moving up to Cup competition, but have balked at purchasing the eight-figure charter needed to compete.",
      "Earnhardt said there have been no discussions on future Cup ventures for JRM beyond trying to make the Daytona 500. It will be a high-pressure situation for the Greg Ives-led team as Earnhardt has warned them he and his sister will be hovering from the moment the car is unloaded at Daytona Beach International Speedway through every mile it turns on the track.",
      "Stapleton also plans to attend what will be his first Daytona 500. He and Earnhardt said the musician was intricately involved in the car design, which Stapleton saw in person for the first time Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI'm a bit of a retro guy, I like things that are kind of a throwback,\u201d Stapleton said. \u201cSo I was looking for a little bit of that flavor in the car, but also something that really blended JR Motorsports and Traveller Whiskey. It had to look like both of those things and I think we achieved it.\u201d",
      "Aside from promoting his whiskey, Stapleton is hoping the Daytona 500 turns into a core memory of his accomplished career.",
      "\u201cI wanted to build a thing \u2014 I wanted to see the car and I want to see it run. And that, for me, would be the victory,\u201d Stapleton said. \"And I want the moment of it. It's just like going to the Super Bowl and getting to stay on the sidelines. That's what I want. I want the moment, the moment of the synergy that is happening.",
      "\u201cWhatever comes of it, we still did it.\u201d",
      "Allgaier is the defending Xfinity Series champion and former Cup Series driver who ran the Daytona 500 in 2014 and 2015. His most recent time in a Cup car was last May as the substitute driver for Kyle Larson as Larson attempted to compete in both the Coca-Cola 600 and Indianapolis 500 on the same day.",
      "Allgaier started the Coke 600 for Larson and was credited with a 13th-place finish when the race was called for rain.",
      "\u201cThis is an incredible honor to be driving JR Motorsports\u2019 inaugural entry into the Cup Series,\u201d said Allgaier. \u201cEntering into the Daytona 500 has been a goal of this company for a long time and I know that we are going to have everything we need to go out and contend for the win. This is going to be special for sure.\u201d",

      "The MLB team announced Wednesday it entered into a multiyear agreement with A Parent Media Co. Inc. (APMC) to stream Rangers regional games on the Victory+ service starting this year.",
      "That is the same streaming service that took over regional broadcasts for the NHL's Dallas Stars this season. While Stars games and extra content are streamed for free, access for Rangers games will cost $100 for the full season.",
      "\u201cThe Rangers\u2019 partnership with Victory+ as our direct-to-consumer provider is a tremendous first step as the club continues to finalize our television offerings for 2025 game broadcasts,\u201d said COO Neil Leibman, the team's president of business operations. \u201cVictory+ has proven itself over the past few months as a reliable streaming home for several professional sports teams, and we feel Rangers fans will enjoy the familiarity, convenience and simplicity of this service.\u201d",
      "While the team didn't say what the additional options will be, those could include traditional cable and possibly some over-the-air broadcasts. The Rangers, who have more than 16 million households in their broadcast territory over parts of five states, said details about those options would be announced in the coming weeks.",
      "Both the Rangers and Stars previously had their regional broadcasts on Bally Sports Southwest, part of the financially troubled Diamond Sports Group that has gone through a bankruptcy reorganization. The Stars and Diamond mutually agreed last summer to end their existing rights agreement. The Rangers' deal with the group expired at the end of last season.",

    "story": [
      "The Pittsburgh Penguins could be moving on from two-time All-Star goaltender Tristan Jarry",
      "PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Penguins ran out of patience waiting for two-time All-Star goaltender Tristan Jarry to emerge from a slump, placing him on waivers Wednesday ahead of a pivotal seven-game road trip that could determine the course of the rest of their season.",
      "The 29-year-old Jarry is 8-7-4 with a 3.32 goals against average and a .886 save percentage this season for Pittsburgh, which is on the fringe of the playoff race in the Eastern Conference due in large part to subpar play in net.",
      "The Penguins have allowed an NHL-high 173 goals, with neither Jarry nor Alex Nedeljkovic establishing themselves behind a defense prone to lapses.",
      "The Penguins will call up promising rookie Joel Blomqvist to join Nedeljkovic on the road trip, which starts on Friday in Buffalo. Blomqvist went 3-5 with a 3.60 goals against average and a .904 save percentage during a stint in Pittsburgh earlier in the season.",
      "It seems unlikely a team would be willing to claim Jarry and pick up his salary, meaning Jarry will be reassigned to the Penguins' American Hockey League affiliate in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton once he clears waivers.",
      "\u201cAt this point, (I) just feel it's best in the long run for the team and for Tristan to allow Joel to come up here,\" Pittsburgh general manager Kyle Dubas said Wednesday. \u201cWe think over the past year-and-a-half, with his play in Wilkes-Barre and when he's been up here with us, he's earned the right to have a go at it.\u201d",
      "The decision comes 18 months after Dubas signed Jarry to a five-year deal with an average annual value of $5.375 million. Jarry was an All-Star in 2020 and 2022 but has struggled most of the last two seasons.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s continued to come in here, put the work in and that\u2019s not been a question at all,\u201d Dubas said. \"That just hasn\u2019t materialized the way we would like it to on the ice. At this level, you get to the point where you have to do what\u2019s right ... for him and for us.\u201d",
      "Jarry ceded the starting job to Nedeljkovic last spring. While he reclaimed his spot atop the depth chart coming out of training camp, he stumbled out of the gate and was sent to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton for a lengthy conditioning stint.",
      "While there was a brief uptick in his play after he returned, Jarry has lost five straight starts and continues to struggle early in games. He's allowed a goal on an opponent's first shot six times this season and allowed a shorthanded goal on Seattle's second shot in a 4-2 defeat to the Kraken on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWhen you lose, this is the kind of stuff that can happen,\u201d Penguins captain Sidney Crosby said Wednesday. \"A goaltender already has a ton of pressure, and it\u2019s difficult for us because we feel like as a team we\u2019re responsible if we don\u2019t give our goalies enough help sometimes. I think that\u2019s the tough part.\u201d",
      "Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan, who took his team to task for defensive letdowns in the third period against the Kraken that opened up the door for Seattle's comeback, believes there's a chance Jarry will make his way back at some point.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think you make the All-Star team twice if you don\u2019t have a certain level of talent and you\u2019re not capable of making timely saves,\u201d Sullivan said. \"So, I know that Tristan has it. I believe to my core that he\u2019s an NHL goaltender.\u201d",

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas junior quarterback Quinn Ewers declared for the NFL draft on Wednesday, ending a Longhorns career in which he led the program to a Big 12 championship and twice to the College Football Playoff but was not always embraced by a fan base eagerly waiting for Arch Manning to take over.",
      "Ewers passed for 9,128 yards and 68 touchdowns in a career that few Texas quarterbacks can match. He had hinted before the season ended that it would be his last in college.",
      "\u201cThese past three years have been some of the best years I could have imagined,\u201d Ewers said in social media post announcing his decision. \u201cThe relationships I've built between coaches and teammates will last forever.\u201d",
      "His 27 career wins rank fourth as a starting quarterback at Texas, and he led the Longhorns to their first Big 12 title in 14 years in 2023 before the program moved to the Southeastern Conference. In their first season in the SEC, the Longhorns rose to their first No. 1 ranking since 2008 and played in the league championship game.",
      "Ewers' biggest legacy will be leading the program to the playoff semifinals in consecutive years, though it fell short of the championship game. He had a fumble on a sack that led to a game-clinching touchdown for Ohio State on Jan. 10 in the Cotton Bowl.",
      "Ewers, who grew up in the Dallas suburbs, was the top-rated high school quarterback in the country when he signed with Ohio State and left school early to the join the Buckeyes for the 2021 season. But after one season spent deep on the Ohio State depth chart, Ewers transferred to Texas, which had just finished 5-7 in coach Steve Sarkisian's first season.",
      "He was the starter by the season opener in 2022 and led the team through seasons of 8-5, 12-2 and 13-3 records. But he was dogged by various shoulder, abdomen and ankle injuries and missed at least two games each season. An abdomen strain this season allowed Manning to start twice and earn the program's first SEC win, which came against Mississippi State.",
      "Ewers' departure sets the stage for Manning to take over in 2025.",
      "The son of Cooper Manning, the grandson of former NFL quarterback Archie Manning and the nephew of Super Bowl-winning QBs Peyton and Eli Manning passed for 939 yards and nine touchdowns and ran for four TDs this season but has seen only limited playing time since September.",
      "Texas fans have been eagerly awaiting his chance to be the full-time starter. Manning will get it with a rebuilt offense.",
      "Top receivers Matthew Golden and Isaiah Bond have declared for the draft and senior tight end Gunnar Helm completed his eligibility.

      "Coach Bill Fennelly took over the next season and his teams have always made at least one 3-pointer in every game he'd coached until Tuesday. The Cyclones attempted just seven 3's against the Red Raiders and missed all of them, marking the first time in nearly 30 years they didn't hit a shot from behind the arc.",
      "\u201cWe only shot seven of them, so we really didn\u2019t care,\u201d Fennelly said. \u201cIf we were really worried about (the record) we probably would have run about 15 more plays to get one.

      "CEO Ju'Riese Colon sent an email to more than 70 U.S. Olympic leaders Sunday, shortly after The Associated Press published a story about former investigator Jason Krasley's arrest on rape and sex-trafficking charges.",
      "\u201cI am angry and so disappointed,\u201d Colon wrote in the email, a copy of which was obtained by the AP. \u201cI\u2019m sad for our organization and the impact this may have on athletes. And I\u2019m sure many of you, as well as your members, are feeling a range of emotions as well. This work is so hard, and to know that someone could have not only fooled us, but also law enforcement, is just sickening.\u201d",
      "In the email to leaders at the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee and its affiliated sports organizations, Colon said the center has hired an outside party to evaluate cases Krasley had handled.",
      "\u201cWhile we do not have any reason to believe he committed any wrongdoing while at the Center, the audit may result in the Center re-opening cases,\u201d Colon said.",
      "That statement paralleled what a SafeSport employee wrote in an email to a claimant whose case was handled by Krasley and who has asked for it to be reopened.",
      "\u201cBecause we have many checks built into our investigative process, we do not anticipate that we will need to re-open many, if any, cases,\u201d the employee wrote in that email, which was seen by the AP.",
      "The center was established in 2017 to investigate and deliver sanctions in sex-abuse cases involving Olympic sports after scandals involving Larry Nassar and others framed the USOPC and its sports organizations as not up to the task of properly handling those cases.",
      "Late last year, the center had 36 people on its investigations team. At the end of 2023, the center had 2,040 people listed on its centralized disciplinary database who had either been restricted or banned from sports participation.",
      "Colon said in her email that the center fired Krasley promptly after learning he'd been arrested for allegedly stealing $5,500 from a drug bust he helped conduct while on the vice squad with the police department in Allentown, Pennsylvania.",
      "About six weeks after that arrest came Krasley's arrest on rape, involuntary sexual servitude and other related charges.",
      "\"These charges are far more serious than the last, are despicable if true, and certainly put the Center back in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons,\" Colon wrote.",
      "Krasley was released on $750,000 bond shortly after the arrest.",
      "The affidavit in the case was unsealed and, according to lehighcountylive.com, alleges another officer arrested in the case, Evan Weaver, told the victim she could avoid prison by performing a sex act on him after arresting her on a drug charge in 2011.",
      "Four years later, the affidavit says, Krasley contacted the victim as part of a prostitution sting and when she asked if she was going to jail, he allegedly replied: \u201cWhy would I take you to jail? You know what you need to do,\u201d before raping the victim.",
      "Krasley's lawyer, James Burke, told the AP his client denies the allegations and called it \u201cbizarre\u201d that these arrests were happening nearly a decade after an investigation into the episode had been completed. Burke said Krasley had been a decorated member of the police force before leaving in 2021, shortly after which he started work at the SafeSport center.",
      "None of the allegations surfaced during the SafeSport background check. In the email, Colon said the center was \u201cevaluating our screening and hiring practices.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis situation is unprecedented for the Center,\u201d Colon said. \u201cAs such, we will continue to implement and revise our response plan as necessary.\u201d",

      "The biggest rocket of all, at approximately 400 feet (123 meters), is SpaceX's Starship. Musk said the seventh test flight of the full rocket could occur later Thursday from Texas. He hopes to repeat what he pulled off in October, catching the returning booster at the launch pad with giant mechanical arms.",
      "Starship is what NASA plans to use to land astronauts on the moon later this decade. The first two moon landings under the space agency's Artemis program, which follows the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s, will see crews descending from lunar orbit to the surface in Starships.",
      "Blue Origin's lander, dubbed Blue Moon, will make its debut on the third lunar touchdown by astronauts.",
      "NASA Administrator Bill Nelson pushed for competing moon landers similar to the strategy to hire two companies to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Nelson will step down when President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Monday.",
      "Trump has tapped tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to run NASA. Isaacman, who has twice rocketed into orbit on his own privately financed SpaceX flights, must be approved by the Senate.",
      "New Glenn's debut was supposed to send twin spacecraft to Mars for NASA. But the space agency pulled them from last October's planned flight when it became clear the rocket wouldn't be ready in time. They will still fly on a New Glenn rocket, but not until spring at the earliest. The two small spacecraft, named Escapade, are meant to study the Martian atmosphere and magnetic environment while orbiting the red planet.",

      "Efforts to ban students' cellphones at school is gaining rare bipartisan consensus in Republican and Democrat-led states",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Arkansas' Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom have little in common ideologically, but the two have both been vocal supporters of an idea that's been rapidly gaining bipartisan ground in the states: Students' cellphones need to be banned during the school day.",
      "At least eight states have enacted such bans over the past two years, and proposals are being considered in several more states this year.",
      "Here is a look at the push by states for such bans.",
      "The push for cellphone bans has been driven by concerns about the impact screen time has on children\u2019s mental health and complaints from teachers that cellphones have become a constant distraction in the classroom.",
      "Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who has called on Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms about their effects on young people\u2019s lives, has said schools need to provide phone-free times.",
      "Nationally, 77% of U.S. schools say they prohibit cellphones at school for non-academic use, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. But that number is misleading. It does not mean students are following those bans or all those schools are enforcing them.",
      "Kim Whitman, co-founder of the Phone Free Schools Movement, said the issue is catching on because parents and teachers in both red and blue states are struggling with the consequences of kids on mobile devices.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't matter if you live in a big city or a rural town, urban or suburban, all children are struggling and need that seven-hour break from the pressures of phones and social media during the school day,\u201d she said.",
      "At least eight states \u2014 California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia \u2014 have enacted measures banning or restricting students\u2019 use of cellphones in schools.",
      "The policies range widely. Florida was the first state to crack down on phones in school, passing a 2023 law that requires all public schools to ban cellphone use during class time and block access to social media on district Wi-Fi.",
      "A 2024 California law requires the state\u2019s nearly 1,000 school districts to create their own cellphone policies by July 2026.",
      "Several other states haven't banned phones, but have encouraged school districts to enact such restrictions or have provided funding to store phones during the day.",
      "Sanders announced a pilot program last year providing grants to schools that adopt phone-free policies, and more than 100 schools signed on. In her state of the state address this week, Sanders proposed an outright ban.",
      "\u201cWe will ban cellphones in our schools, bell to bell, so that our kids are not distracted, in class or out of it,\u201d Sanders said.",
      "Other governors recently calling for bans include Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who was sworn in this month, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has suggested she'll seek a statewide policy, but has not offered specifics.",
      "The cellphone bans have faced opposition from some parents who say they need to be able to contact their children directly in case of emergency.",
      "Some parents have pointed to recent school shootings where having access to cellphones was the only way some students were able to communicate with loved ones for what they thought might be the last time.",
      "But supporters of the bans have noted that students' phones could pose additional dangers during an emergency by distracting students or by revealing their location during an active shooter situation.",
      "Parents opposed to the ban have also said they want their children to have access to their phones for other needs, such as coordinating transportation.",
      "Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, said she agrees about the dangers of social media on children but that the bans sought by states are taking too broad of an approach. Banning the devices during the school day is not going to solve underlying issues like bullying or the dangers of social media, she said.",
      "\u201cWe have not done our job as grown-ups to try to teach our kids the skills they need to actually navigate this technology,\u201d she said. \u201cWe've just kicked the can down the road and thrown them into the deep end of the pool when they're by themselves after school.\u201d",

      "Waltz made the comment when Fox News anchor Bret Baier asked him about a report from The Washington Post that said Trump was considering an executive order to suspend enforcement of a federal law that could ban the popular platform nationwide by Sunday.",
      "Last week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a legal challenge to the statute brought by TikTok, its China-based parent company ByteDance, and users of the app. The Justices seemed likely to uphold the law, which requires ByteDance to divest TikTok on national security grounds or face a ban in one of its biggest markets.",
      "\u201cIf the Supreme Court comes out with a ruling in favor of the law, President Trump has been very clear: Number one, TikTok is a great platform that many Americans use and has been great for his campaign and getting his message out. But number two, he\u2019s going to protect their data,\u201d Waltz said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a deal maker. I don\u2019t want to get ahead of our executive orders, but we\u2019re going to create this space to put that deal in place,\" he added.",
      "Separately on Wednesday, Pam Bondi, Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, dodged a question during a Senate hearing on whether she\u2019d uphold a TikTok ban.",
      "Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral. He pledged to \u201csave TikTok\u201d during the campaign and has credited the platform with helping him win more youth votes.",

      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery in southern Britain shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage",
      "Female family ties were at the heart of social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion, a new analysis suggests.",
      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\u201cThat was really jaw-dropping \u2013 it\u2019s never been observed before in European prehistory,\u201d said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2013 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",
      "Meanwhile \u201cit\u2019s your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife\u2019s family for land and livelihood,\u201d said Cassidy.",
      "This pattern \u2013 called matrilocality \u2013 is historically rare.",
      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2013 women leaving their homes to join their husband\u2019s family group \u2013 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",
      "In studies of pre-industrial societies from around 1800 to the present, anthropologists found that men join their wives\u2019 extended family households only 8% of the time, said Cassidy.",
      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2013 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2013 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",
      "But it does suggest that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, making Britain\u2019s Celtic society \u201cmore egalitarian than the Roman world,\u201d said study co-author and Bournemouth University archaeologist Miles Russell.",

      "A nonprofit research lab is getting attention from some wealthy tech philanthropists",
      "MONTREAL -- Peeps trickle out of a soundproof chamber as its door opens. Female zebra finches are chattering away inside the microphone-lined box. The laboratory room sounds like a chorus of squeaky toys.",
      "\u201cThey're probably talking about us a little bit,\u201d says McGill University postdoctoral fellow Logan James.",
      "It's unclear, of course, what they are saying. But James believes he is getting closer to deciphering their vocalizations through a partnership with the Earth Species Project. The nonprofit laboratory has drawn some of the technology industry's wealthiest philanthropists \u2014 and they want to see more than just scientific progress. On top of breakthroughs in animal language, they expect improved interspecies understanding will foster greater appreciation for the planet in the face of climate change.",
      "The Earth Species Project hopes to decode other creatures' communications with its pioneering artificial intelligence tools. The goal is not to build a \u201ctranslator that will allow us to speak to other species,\u201d Director of Impact Jane Lawton said. However, she added, \u201crudimentary dictionaries\u201d for other animals are not only possible but could help craft better conservation strategies and reconnect humanity with often forgotten ecosystems.",
      "\u201cWe believe that by reminding people of the beauty, the sophistication, the intelligence that is resident in other species and in nature as a whole, we can start to, kind of, almost repair that relationship,\" Lawton said.",
      "At McGill University, the technology generates specific calls during simulated conversations with live finches that help researchers isolate each unique noise. The computer processes calls in real time and responds with one of its own. Those recordings are then used to train the Berkeley, California-based research group\u2019s audio language model for animal sounds.",
      "This ad hoc collaboration is only a glimpse into what ESP says will come. By 2030, Lawton said, it expects \u201creally interesting insights into how other animals communicate.\u201d Artificial intelligence advancements are expediting the research. New grants totaling $17 million will help hire engineers and at least double the size of the research team, which currently has roughly seven members. Over the next two years, Lawton said, the nonprofit's researchers will select species that \u201cmight actually shift something\u201d in people's relationship with nature.",
      "Standing to benefit are animal groups threatened by habitat loss or human activity that could be better protected with better understandings of their languages. Existing collaborations aim to document the vocal repertoires \u2014 the distinct calls and their different contexts \u2014 of the Hawaiian crow and St. Lawrence River beluga whales.",
      "After spending more than two decades extinct in the wild, the crows have been reintroduced to their home of Maui. But some conservationists fear that critical vocabulary has faded in captivity. Lawton said the birds might need to relearn some \u201cwords\u201d before they reenter their natural habitat in droves.",
      "In Canada's St. Lawrence River, where shipping traffic imperils the marine mammals who feed there, the group's scientists are exploring whether machine learning can categorize unlabeled calls from the remaining belugas. Perhaps, Lawton suggested, authorities could alert nearby vessels if they understood that certain sounds signaled the whales were about to surface.",
      "Big donors include LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, the family charity founded by late Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen and Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019 Waverley Street Foundation. The latter aims to support \u201cbottom-up\u201d solutions to the \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d At the root of that crisis, according to Waverley Street Foundation President Jared Blumenfeld, is the idea that humans deserve \u201cdominion\u201d over the world.",
      "Blumenfeld finds that ESP's work is an important reminder that we are instead stewards of the planet.",
      "\"This is not a silver bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly part of a suite of things that can help transform how we view ourselves in relation to nature.\u201d",
      "Gail Patricelli -- an unaffiliated animal behavior professor at the University of California, Davis -- remembers when such tools were just \u201cpie in the sky.\u201d Researchers previously spent months laboring to manually comb through terabytes of recordings and annotate calls.",
      "She said she's seen an \u201cexponential takeoff\u201d the past few years in bioacoustics' use of machine learning to accelerate that process. While she finds that ESP has the promise to make finer distinctions in existing \u201cdictionaries,\u201d especially for harder-to-reach species, she cautioned observers against attributing human characteristics to these animals.",
      "Considering this research\u2019s high equipment and labor costs, Patricelli said she\u2019s happy to see big philanthropists backing it. But she said the field shouldn\u2019t rely too much on one funding source. Government support is still necessary, she noted, because ecosystem protection also requires that conservationists examine \u201cunsexy\u201d species that she expects get less attention than more charismatic ones. She also encouraged funders to consult scientists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn and it\u2019s very expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat might not be a big deal to some of these donors but it\u2019s very hard to come up with the money to do this.\u201d",
      "The current work largely involves developing baseline technologies to do all this. A separate initiative has recently described the basic elements of how sperm whales might talk. But ESP is trying to be \u201cspecies agnostic,\u201d AI Research Director Olivier Pietquin said, to provide tools that can sort out many animals\u2019 speech patterns.",
      "ESP introduced NatureLM-audio this fall, touting the system as the first large audio-language model fit for animals. The tool can identify species and distinguish characteristics such as sex or stage of life. When applied to a population \u2014 zebra finches \u2014 it had not been trained on, NatureLM-audio accurately counted the number of birds at a rate higher than random chance, according to ESP. The results were a positive sign for Pietquin that NatureLM might be able to scale across species.",
      "\u201cThat is only possible with a lot of computing, a lot of data and many, many collaborations with ecologists and biologists,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, I think, makes us, makes it, quite serious.\u201d",
      "ESP acknowledges that it isn\u2019t sure what will be discovered about animal communications and won\u2019t know when its model gets it absolutely right. But the team likens AI to the microscope: advancements that allowed scientists to see far more than previously considered possible.",
      "Zebra finches are highly social animals with large call repertoires. Whether congregating in pairs or by the hundreds, they produce hours of data \u2014 a help to the nonprofit's AI scientists given that animal sounds aren't as abundant as the pages of internet text scraped to train chatbots.",
      "James, an affiliated researcher with the Earth Species Project, struggles with the concept of decoding animal communications. Sure, he can clearly distinguish when a chick is screaming for food. But he doesn\u2019t expect to ever translate that call or any others into a human word.",
      "Still, he wonders if he can gather more hints about their interactions from aspects of the call such as its pitch or duration.",
      "\u201cSo can we find a link between a form and function is sort of our way of maybe thinking about decoding,\" James said. \u201cAs she elongates her call, is that because she\u2019s trying harder to elicit a response?\u201d",

      "The two landers rocketed away in the middle of the night from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, the latest in a stream of private spacecraft aiming for the moon. They shared the ride to save money but parted company an hour into the flight exactly as planned, taking separate roundabout routes for the monthslong journey.",
      "It\u2019s take 2 for the Tokyo-based ispace, whose first lander crashed into the moon two years ago. This time, it has a rover on board with a scoop to gather up lunar dirt for study and plans to test potential food and water sources for future explorers.",
      "Lunar newcomer Texas-based Firefly Aerospace is flying 10 experiments for NASA, including a vacuum to gather dirt, a drill to measure the temperature below the surface and a device that could be used by future moonwalkers to keep the sharp, abrasive particles off their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "Firefly\u2019s Blue Ghost \u2014 named after a species of U.S. Southeastern fireflies \u2014 should reach the moon first. The 6-foot-6-inches-tall (2-meter-tall) lander will attempt a touchdown in early March at Mare Crisium, a volcanic plain in the northern latitudes.",
      "The slightly bigger ispace lander named Resilience will take four to five months to get there, targeting a touchdown in late May or early June at Mare Frigoris, even farther north on the moon\u2019s near side.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a race. Some people say \u2018race to the moon,\u2019 but it\u2019s not about the speed,\u201d ispace\u2019s founder CEO Takeshi Hakamada said this week from Cape Canaveral.",
      "Both Hakamada and Firefly CEO Jason Kim acknowledge the challenges still ahead, given the wreckage littering the lunar landscape. Only five countries have successfully placed spacecraft on the moon since the 1960s: the former Soviet Union, the U.S., China, India and Japan.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done everything we can on the design and the engineering,\u201d Kim said. Even so, he pinned an Irish shamrock to his jacket lapel Tuesday night for good luck.",
      "The U.S. remains the only one to have landed astronauts. NASA\u2019s Artemis program, the successor to Apollo, aims to get astronauts back on the moon by the end of the decade.",
      "Before that can happen, \u201cwe\u2019re sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\u201d NASA's science mission chief Nicky Fox said on the eve of launch.",
      "If acing their respective touchdowns, both spacecraft will spend two weeks operating in constant daylight, shutting down once darkness hits.",
      "Once lowered onto the lunar surface, ispace\u2019s 11-pound (5-kilogram) rover will stay near the lander, traveling up to hundreds of yards (meters) in circles at a speed of less than one inch (a couple centimeters) per second. The rover has its own special delivery to drop off on the lunar dust: a toy-size red house designed by a Swedish artist.",
      "NASA is paying $101 million to Firefly for the mission and another $44 million for the experiments. Hakamada declined to divulge the cost of ispace\u2019s rebooted mission with six experiments, saying it's less than the first mission that topped $100 million.",
      "Coming up by the end of February is the second moonshot for NASA by Houston-based Intuitive Machines. Last year, the company achieved the first U.S. lunar touchdown in more than a half-century, landing sideways near the south pole but still managing to operate.",

      "With a possible TikTok ban just days away, many U.S. users are looking for alternative social media platforms to help them keep up with pop culture or provide the type of entertaining videos that popularized the short-form video app",
      "With a possible TikTok ban just days away, many U.S. users are looking for alternative social media platforms to help them keep up with pop culture or provide the type of entertaining videos that popularized the short-form video app.",
      "TikTok, which has been a cultural phenomenon, could be banned on Jan. 19 under a law that forces the platform to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or shut down its U.S. operation.",
      "The fate of social media platform will be decided by the Supreme Court, which last week heard oral arguments in a legal challenge to the statute and seemed likely to uphold the law. The court could rule on the case as soon as this week. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has asked the justices to put the law on hold so he can negotiate a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue after he takes office.",
      "TikTok has more than 170 million users in the U.S., and if it does get banned, it\u2019s not clear which competitors will benefit the most. Some experts think established social media platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, could see the biggest influx of users. But some users are looking for something different and could turn to other apps.",
      "Here are the different alternatives and what to know about them:",
      "Recently, some U.S. TikTok users have flocked to the Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu in protest of the looming ban. Like TikTok, Xiaohongshu, which in English means \u201cLittle Red Book,\u201d combines e-commerce and short-form videos.",
      "The app has gained traction in China and other regions with a Chinese diaspora \u2014 such as Malaysia and Taiwan \u2014 racking up 300 million monthly active users, a majority of whom are young women who use it as a de-facto search engine for product, travel and restaurant recommendations, as well as makeup and skincare tutorials.",
      "On Tuesday, the Xiaohongshu, called \u201cRedNote\u201d by American users and on some app stores, was the top downloaded free app in Apple\u2019s U.S. app store.",
      "Lemon8, also owned by TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance, is a lesser-known lifestyle app that allows users to post pictures and short-form videos. Though the platform lets users post TikTok-like videos, it leans more into pictures and has been described as a mixture of Instagram and Pinterest.",
      "In the past few weeks, many creators have hailed Lemon8 as the place to go if TikTok is banned under federal law. Some have also recommended it through paid sponsored posts tagged #lemon8partner, indicating a recent corporate push to generate more users.",
      "But the law that targets TikTok also states the divest-or-ban requirement for ByteDance applies generally to apps that are owned or operated by the two companies or any of their subsidiaries. That means even though Lemon8 is not explicitly named in the statute, its future in the U.S. is also in jeopardy.",
      "Instagram launched Reels in 2020, a TikTok-like feed of short videos users can create or scroll through. The feature has proven to be massively popular and some experts say creators are likely to set up shop there if a TikTok ban does happen. As of 2022, Instagram had 2 billion active monthly users. Meta no longer discloses user numbers for its individual platforms.",
      "But could it replace TikTok? That depends. While many creators currently post on both platforms, some experts say the youngest users are unlikely to migrate to a service made popular by their millennial parents. And while Meta\u2019s algorithm is addictive, it\u2019s still not TikTok.",
      "In the past, some TikTok users have also blamed the surge of scrutiny on the platform on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, pointing to a Washington Post report from 2022 that said the tech behemoth paid a Republican consulting firm to undermine TikTok through a nationwide media and lobbying campaign.",
      "Though TikTok dominates headlines as a driver of internet trends, Pew Research Center says YouTube is actually the most widely-used platform among teens and adults.",
      "YouTube users can scroll through Shorts just as they can on TikTok or Reels on Instagram and Facebook, allowing them to watch hours of bite-sized videos. Many of the videos featured on YouTube are from TikTok or creators who post to several platforms. That said, YouTube is still known for its longer-format videos so it may not have the variety of content that TikTok users are looking for \u2014 at least not yet.",
      "Snapchat, launched in 2011 with its infamous disappearing videos, remains popular among teens and younger adults. The platform gained so much traction that Meta designed a similar feature in Facebook and Instagram called \u201cStories\u201d that lets users post photos or videos that disappear within 24 hours. In 2020, Snapchat launched another feature that lets users \u201cshine a light on the most entertaining Snaps, no matter who created them.\u201d",
      "The platform is estimated to have roughly 692 million global monthly active users last year, according to eMarketer.",
      "For TikTok users who enjoy the \u201cTikTok Live\u201d feed that features livestreamed videos, Twitch could be a good alternative. The Amazon-owned platform is a leader in the streaming industry and allows users on the platform to watch some of the internet\u2019s most popular streamers, such as Kai Cenat. Twitch says it has 105 million monthly visitors.",
      "Clapper, a TikTok clone, has also been gaining some traction amid the looming ban. The app was launched in 2020 by Dallas-based entrepreneur Edison Chen, and focuses on Gen X and millennial users. In September of that year, the company described itself in a Facebook post as a \u201cfree speech\u201d platform that did not \u201ccensor posts and comments.\u201d But in blog post on its website from 2021, the company wrote it \u201cstopped being a \u2018Free Speech\u2019 platform\u201d in September 2020 and \u201cchanged its mission and goals\u201d to focus on \u201ccommunity\u201d.",
      "For TikTok users who want to get away from the overcrowded spots, there are lesser-known apps like Triller, which is popular for music videos, and Zigazoo, which was designed with kids in mind.",
      "If none of these apps tickle your fancy, it's also possible that other platforms could emerge in the next few months as companies attempt to attract users looking for a new place to go."

      "Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has signed a bill restricting the use of smartphones at school, following a global trend for such limitations",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva on Monday signed a bill restricting the use of smartphones at school, following a global trend for such limitations.",
      "The move will impact students at elementary and high schools across the South American nation starting in February. It provides a legal framework to ensure students only use such devices in cases of emergency and danger, for educational purposes, or if they have disabilities and require them.",
      "\"We cannot allow humanism to be replaced by algorithms,\u201d Lula said in a closed ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital, Brasilia, adding that the bill \u201cacknowledges the work of every serious person in education, everyone who wants to take care of children and teenagers in this country.\u201d",
      "In May, Fundacao Getulio Vargas, a leading think-tank and university, said Brazil had more smartphones than people, with 258 million devices for a population of 203 million Brazilians. Local market researchers said last year that Brazilians spend 9 hours and 13 minutes per day on screens, one of the world's highest figures.",
      "Education minister Camilo Santana told journalists that children are going online at early ages, making it harder for parents to keep track of what they do, and that restricting smartphones at school will help them.",
      "The bill had rare support across the political spectrum, both from allies of leftist Lula and his far-right foe, former President Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "Many parents and students also approved the move. A survey released in October by Brazilian pollster Datafolha said that almost two-thirds of respondents supported banning the use of smartphones by children and teenagers at schools. More than three-quarters said those devices do more harm than good to their children.",
      "\u201c(Restricting cell phones) is tough, but necessary. It is useful for them to do searches for school, but to use it socially isn't good,\u201d said Ricardo Martins Ramos, 43, father of two girls and the owner of a hamburger restaurant in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cKids will interact more.\u201d",
      "His 13-year-old daughter Isabela said her classmates struggled to focus during class because of their smartphones. She approved the move, but doesn't see it as enough to improve the learning environment for everyone.",
      "\"When the teacher lets you use the cell phone, it is because he wants you to do searches,\u201d she said. \u201cThere's still a lot of things that schools can't solve, such as bullying and harassment.\u201d",
      "As of 2023, about two-thirds of Brazilian schools imposed some restriction on cellphone use, while 28% banned them entirely, according to a survey released in August by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee.",
      "The Brazilian states of Rio de Janeiro, Maranhao and Goias have already passed local bills to ban such devices at schools. However, authorities have struggled to enforce these laws.",
      "Authorities in Sao Paulo, the most populous state in Brazil, are discussing whether smartphones should be banned both in public and private schools.",
      "Gabriele Alexandra Henriques Pinheiro, 25, works at a beauty parlor and is the mother of a boy diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. She also agrees with the restrictions, but says adults will continue to be a bad example of smartphone use for children.",
      "\u201cIt is tough,\u201d she said. \u201cI try to restrict the time my son watches any screens, but whenever I have a task to perform I have to use the smartphone to be able to do it all,\u201d she said.",
      "Institutions, governments, parents and others have for years associated smartphone use by children with bullying, suicidal ideation, anxiety and loss of concentration necessary for learning. China moved last year to limit children\u2019s use of smartphones, while France has in place a ban on smartphones in schools for kids aged six to 15.",
      "Cell phone bans have gained traction across the United States, where eight states have passed laws or policies that ban or restrict cellphone use to try to curb student phone access and minimize distractions in classrooms.",
      "An increasing number of parents across Europe who are concerned by evidence that smartphone use among young kids jeopardizes their safety and mental health.",
      "A report published in September by UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, said one in four countries has already restricted the use of such devices at schools.",
      "Last year in a U.S. Senate hearing, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized to parents of children exploited, bullied or driven to self harm via social media. He also noted Meta\u2019s continued investments in \u201cindustrywide\u201d efforts to protect children.",

      "Japan\u2019s Meteorological Agency initially estimated the magnitude was 6.9 but later revised it to 6.6.",
      "One man was slightly injured in Kyushu after falling down some stairs, NHK TV reported. A small landslide blocked a road, and some underground water pipes ruptured.",

      "Tsunami advisories were issued for Miyazaki prefecture, where the quake was centered, on the southwestern island of Kyushu, as well as nearby Kochi prefecture in Shikoku island, shortly after the quake struck at 9:19 p.m., JMA said. They were all lifted before midnight.",
      "Agency official Shigeki Aoki told reporters that aftershocks were possible, especially in the next two or three days.",
      "The quake, centered at a depth of 36 kilometers (22 miles), shook a wide area in Kyushu, JMA said.",
      "NHK footage showed moving traffic and well-lit streets, meaning that electric power was still working. No problems were detected at nuclear plants in the area.",

      "An international team of scientists say they\u2019ve successfully drilled one of the oldest ice cores yet, penetrating nearly 2 miles to Antarctic bedrock to reach ice that's at least 1.2 million years old",
      "An international team of scientists announced Thursday they\u2019ve successfully drilled one of the oldest ice cores yet, penetrating nearly 2 miles (2.8 kilometers) to Antarctic bedrock to reach ice they say is at least 1.2 million years old.",
      "Analysis of the ancient ice is expected to show how Earth's atmosphere and climate have evolved. That should provide insight into how Ice Age cycles have changed, and may help in understanding how atmospheric carbon changed climate, they said.",
      "\u201cThanks to the ice core we will understand what has changed in terms of greenhouse gases, chemicals and dusts in the atmosphere,\u201d said Carlo Barbante, an Italian glaciologist and coordinator of Beyond EPICA, the project to obtain the core. Barbante also directs the Polar Science Institute at Italy's National Research Council.",
      "The same team previously drilled a core about 800,000 years old. The latest drilling went 2.8 kilometers (about 1.7 miles) deep, with a team of 16 scientists and support personnel drilling each summer over four years in average temperatures of about minus-35 Celsius (minus-25.6 Fahrenheit).",
      "Italian researcher Federico Scoto was among the glaciologists and technicians who completed the drilling at the beginning of January at a location called Little Dome C, near Concordia Research Station.",
      "\u201cIt was a great a moment for us when we reached the bedrock,\u201d Scoto said. Isotope analysis gave the ice's age as at least 1.2 million years old, he said.",
      "Both Barbante and Scoto said that thanks to the analysis of the ice core of the previous Epica campaign they have assessed that concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, even during the warmest periods of the last 800,000 years, have never exceeded the levels seen since the Industrial Revolution began.",
      "\u201cToday we are seeing carbon dioxide levels that are 50% above the highest levels we\u2019ve had over the last 800,000 years,\" Barbante said.",
      "The European Union funded Beyond EPICA (European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica) with support from nations across the continent. Italy is coordinating the project.",
      "The announcement was exciting to Richard Alley, a climate scientist at Penn State who was not involved with the project and who was recently awarded the National Medal of Science for his career studying ice sheets.",
      "Alley said advancements in studying ice cores are important because they help scientists better understand the climate conditions of the past and inform their understanding of humans\u2019 contributions to climate change in the present. He added that reaching the bedrock holds added promise because scientists may learn more about Earth\u2019s history not directly related to the ice record itself.",

      "White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told \"Good Morning America\" on Thursday that Hamas is \"desperate\" for a ceasefire deal in Gaza after more than a year of intense fighting.",
      "\"Hamas is in a much weaker position now than they were in May when this deal got put on the table,\" Kirby said of the ceasefire agreement, a version of which was tabled by President Joe Biden's administration last summer.",
      "\"They're also more isolated with a ceasefire with Israel and Hezbollah -- they can't count on Hezbollah coming to their aid, Iran is weaker,\" Kirby said of Hamas. \"There have been a lot of developments that have put Hamas in a situation where they were more desperate to get to a deal. That's where we are.\"",
      "Pressure from President-elect Donald Trump and his team \"sent a strong signal to everybody in the region,\" including Hamas, the surviving hostages in Gaza and their families, Kirby acknowledged.",
      "\"This new Trump team will have to implement this deal which is why President Biden made sure we were keeping them informed and coordinating with them all the way through this process,\" Kirby said.",
      "Kirby spoke with GMA shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office accused Hamas of trying to renege on parts of the ceasefire agreement, which is yet to be ratified by the Israeli cabinet.",
      "\"We're confident that we're going to be able to start implementing it on Sunday,\" Kirby said, though added there are some \"implementing details that still need to be ironed out\" with Israel.",
      "As to the future of Gaza, Kirby said Hamas cannot be allowed to remain in control.",
      "\"Post-conflict Gaza, all the governance that needs to happen there, meeting the aspirations of the Palestinian people, all that needs to be ironed out, and it's going to have to be done regionally,\" Kirby said.",
      "A collective day-after plan will have to ensure that \"Hamas cannot return, cannot be in power, cannot threaten Israel and yet all the aspirations for safety and security of the Palestinian people can be met, as well as those of the Israeli people.\"",
      "Of the U.S. hostages slated for possible release, Kirby said the White House knows \"several that are still alive.\"",
      "\"We don't have perfect visibility on every single one, but I think we have a pretty good sense,\" he added. \"We know who is going to be coming out in this first tranche. There will be additional Americans coming out in follow-on tranches.",
      "Israeli military will stay in Philadelphi corridor, source says",
      "A senior political official confirmed to ABC News that the Israel Defense Forces will remain in the Philadelphi corridor -- the strip of land separating Gaza from Egypt -- throughout the first phase of the nascent ceasefire deal with Hamas.",
      "Israeli troops will remain in the corridor throughout the first 42 days of the ceasefire process, the official said, their footprint remaining at its current size with forces deployed in \"outposts, patrols, observations and control along the entire length of the axis.\"",
      "The official added that if peace talks fail during the first phase of the ceasefire, Israeli forces will stay in the corridor.",
      "-ABC News' Jordana Miller",
      "Hamas 'committed' to ceasefire, statement says",
      "Hamas said on Thursday they were \"committed to the ceasefire agreement announced by the mediators.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier said the organization had attempted to renege on \"parts\" of the agreement.",
      "-ABC News\u2019 Nasser Atta",
      "Israel says Hamas trying to renege on parts of deal",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Thursday that Hamas was attempting to renege \"on parts of the agreement reached with the mediators and Israel in an effort to extort last minute concessions.\"",
      "\"The Israeli cabinet will not convene until the mediators notify Israel that Hamas has accepted all elements of the agreement,\" the statement said.",
      "The Israeli cabinet is due to meet on Thursday to approve the ceasefire agreement that was announced on Wednesday. The ceasefire is due to begin on Sunday.",
      "Officials involved in the matter told ABC News the Israeli negotiating team is still in Doha, Qatar, where negotiations have been held.",

      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will not attend President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, according to her spokesperson.",
      "Pelosi notably attended Trump's inauguration in 2017, when she was the House Democratic leader.",
      "A spokesman did not disclose a reason why the California Democrat is skipping the high-profile event.",
      "While she broke her hip on an international trip to Luxembourg late last year, Pelosi returned to the Capitol for both the first day of the new Congress as well as the count of the electoral votes on Jan. 6.",

    "story": [
      "Bob Uecker, the voice of his hometown Milwaukee Brewers who after a short playing career earned the moniker \u201cMr. Baseball\u201d and honors from the Hall of Fame, has died",
      "MILWAUKEE -- Bob Uecker, the voice of his hometown Milwaukee Brewers who after a short playing career earned the moniker \"Mr. Baseball\" and honors from the Hall of Fame, has died. He was 90.",
      "The team announced Uecker died Thursday morning, calling it \"one of the most difficult days in Milwaukee Brewers history.\" In a statement released by the club, Uecker\u2019s family said he had battled small cell lung cancer since early 2023.",
      "\u201cEven in the face of this challenge, his enthusiasm for life was always present, never allowing his spirit to falter,\u201d the family said.",
      "Uecker was best known as a colorful comedian and broadcaster who earned his nickname during one of his numerous appearances on Johnny Carson\u2019s late night show.",
      "Born and raised in Milwaukee, Uecker signed his first professional contract with the Milwaukee Braves in 1956 and reached the majors in 1962. He\u2019d last six seasons in the big leagues as a backup catcher, finishing with a .200 average and 14 homers.",
      "He won a World Series ring with St. Louis in 1964 and also played for Atlanta and Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cCareer highlights? I had two,\u201d he often joked. \u201cI got an intentional walk from Sandy Koufax and I got out of a rundown against the Mets.\u201d",
      "Uecker also befriended former Brewers owner and MLB commissioner Bud Selig, who initially hired him as a scout. Selig liked to joke about how Uecker\u2019s initial scouting report was stained with mashed potatoes and gravy.",
      "Selig eventually brought Uecker to the broadcast booth. Uecker became the voice of the Brewers in 1971, in the second year after the team moved from Seattle.",
      "Uecker remained with the club from that point on and became one of the Brewers\u2019 most indelible figures. Brewers manager Craig Counsell grew up in the Milwaukee area and remembered spending summer days throwing a baseball against the roof and catching it while listening to Uecker\u2019s broadcasts.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no single person in this franchise\u2019s history who has been as iconic and as important as Bob Uecker,\u201d said Jeff Levering, a member of the Brewers\u2019 broadcast team since 2015.",
      "Even as his celebrity status grew nationwide, Uecker savored the opportunity to continue calling games to fans in his hometown.",
      "\u201cTo be able to do a game each and every day throughout the summer and talk to people every day at 6:30 for a night game, you become part of people\u2019s families,\u201d Uecker once said. \u201cI know that because I get mail from people that tell me that. That\u2019s part of the reward for being here, just to be recognized by the way you talk, the way you describe a game, whatever.\u201d",
      "Uecker was honored by the Hall of Fame with the Ford C. Frick award in 2003 and spent nearly 20 minutes keeping the Cooperstown, New York, crowd of about 18,000 in stitches.",
      "\u201cI still \u2014 and this is not sour grapes by any means \u2014 still think I should have gone in as a player,\u201d he quipped.",
      "\u201cUeck\u201d got his big break off the field after opening for Don Rickles at Al Hirt\u2019s nightclub in Atlanta in 1969. That performance caught Hirt\u2019s attention, and the musician set him up to appear on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d with Johnny Carson. He became one of Carson\u2019s favorite guests, making more than 100 appearances.",
      "Carson was the one who dubbed Uecker \u201cMr. Baseball.\u201d And the name stuck.",
      "But Uecker\u2019s comedy was just a part of his abilities. His warm storytelling and delivery made Uecker a natural to become one of the first color commentators on network TV broadcasts in the 1970s with ABC. In the \u201990s, he teamed up with Bob Costas and Joe Morgan for the World Series.",
      "From there, Uecker reached most households as one of the Miller Lite All-Stars in popular commercials for the beer brand based out of Milwaukee and Uecker later launched his TV acting career in 1985 on the ABC sitcom, \u201cMr. Belvedere.\u201d",
      "Uecker played George Owens during the successful 122-episode run of the series that lasted six years, as the head of the family and sports writer in a home that brings in a butler who struggles to adapt to an American household.",
      "In a bit of casting that kept things pretty close to home, Uecker also played a prominent role in the movies Major League (1989) and Major League II (1994) as crass announcer Harry Doyle for a down-and-out Cleveland Indians franchise that finds a way to become playoff contenders.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m part of American folklore, I guess,\u201d Uecker told The Associated Press in 2003. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a Hollywood guy. Baseball and broadcasting are in my blood.\u201d",
      "His wry description of a badly wayward pitch \u2014 \u201cJuuuust a bit outside!\u201d \u2014 in the movie is still often-repeated by announcers and fans at ballparks all over.",
      "Uecker\u2019s acting left some to believe he was more about being funny than a serious baseball announcer, but his tenure and observations with the Brewers were spot on, especially when games were tight. Equally enjoyable were games that weren\u2019t, when Uecker would tell stories about other major leaguers, his own career and his hobbies as an avid fisherman and golfer.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants to hear somebody screwing around when you got a good game going,\u201d Uecker said. \u201cI think people see \u2018Major League\u2019 and they think Harry Doyle and figure that\u2019s what Bob Uecker does. I do that sometimes, I do. But when we\u2019ve got a good game going, I don\u2019t mess around.\u201d",
      "In his later years, he took a serious approach to his health, swimming daily leading up to heart surgery in April 2010. Very soon after the procedures, doctors said Uecker returned to walking several miles and was ahead in recovery.",
      "Uecker pushed to return to the booth and began calling games again in July, saying he bribed the doctors by allowing them to throw out the first pitch.",
      "\u201cYou talk about all the things Bob has done, he never wanted to leave Milwaukee,\u201d Selig said. \u201cAbove all, he made himself into a great play-by-play announcer. That\u2019s what he did. He\u2019s everything to this franchise and loves every minute of it.\u201d",
      "Uecker\u2019s own career provided him most of his material. His former teammates said Uecker would do impressions of other broadcasters on the bus, but Uecker turned the spotlight on himself after his playing career was over.",
      "\u201cI signed with the Milwaukee Braves for $3,000. That bothered my dad at the time because he didn\u2019t have that kind of dough,\u201d he said \u201cBut he eventually scraped it up.\u201d",
      "Another classic: \u201cWhen I came up to bat with three men on and two outs in the ninth, I looked in the other team\u2019s dugout and they were already in street clothes.\u201d",
      "Uecker also presided over the stirring ceremony that closed Milwaukee County Stadium in 2000. When the Brewers\u2019 new stadium opened as Miller Park in 2001, the team began selling \u201cUecker Seats\u201d high in the upper deck and obstructed for a $1.",
      "The stadium, now known as American Family Field, has two statues in Uecker\u2019s honor. There\u2019s a statue outside the stadium and another one in the back of Section 422, a nod to the Miller Lite commercial in which he famously said \u201cI must be in the front row!\u201d while getting taken to one of the worst seats in the ballpark.",

      "Even as four wildfires continued to burn in Los Angeles County on Thursday, the blazes were already rewriting the record books.",
      "Over the last nine days, seven fires have broken out across the nation's second-largest metropolitan region, ravaging a combined area bigger than the 40 square miles that comprise the city of San Francisco and nearly twice the size of Manhattan, New York. An eighth fire ignited Monday night near Oxnard in neighboring Ventura County, but fire crews held it to 61 acres.",
      "The two biggest infernos, the Palisades and the Eaton fires, are now among the most destructive blazes in California history, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).",
      "Tune into \"Good Morning America\" on Friday, Jan. 17, as ABC News and ABC owned stations kick off \"SoCal Strong\" (#SoCalStrong) coverage in support of Los Angeles-area communities amid the devastating wildfires. Coverage continues across ABC News programs and platforms.",
      "As of Thursday morning, the Eaton Fire, which has burned 14,117 acres and destroyed more than 7,000 structures, was the second most destructive fire in state history behind the 2018 Camp Fire in Northern California's Butte County, which consumed 153,336 acres and leveled 18,804 structures, according to Cal Fire.",
      "The Palisades Fire has surged to fourth on Cal Fire's list of most destructive wildfires in the Golden State after destroying more than 5,000 structures and burning 23,713 acres of drought-parched land.",
      "The 62 square miles comprising the fire zones are just a part of the 4,083 square miles that make up all of LA County.",
      "Regarding the death toll from the fires, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner is investigating 16 deaths in connection with the Eaton Fire. That makes it the fifth deadliest wildfire in state history, leaping over three fires that each caused 15 deaths -- the Rattlesnake Fire of 1953 in Northern California, the 2003 Cedar Fire in San Diego, and the 2020 North Complex Fire in Northern California's Butte, Plumas and Yuba counties.",
      "The medical examiner is investigating nine deaths in connection with the Palisades Fire in the oceanfront community of Pacific Palisades, which ranks 14 on the list of deadliest California wildfires.",
      "The Eaton and Palisades fires combined have burned an area the equivalent of 2,324 Los Angeles Memorial Coliseums, one of the biggest football stadiums in the country.",
      "The Palisades Fire was 22% contained on Thursday, according to Cal Fire. The Eaton Fire was 55% contained.",
      "The fires are expected to cost insurers as much as $30 billion, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs estimated in a report released this week. After accounting for non-insured damages, the total costs will balloon to $40 billion, the report said.",
      "While Wednesday marked the third straight day the National Weather Service (NWS) had issued a rare \"particularly dangerous situation\" red flag alert for Los Angeles County, the winds were not as strong as expected overnight allowing residents and firefighters to breathe a sigh of relief that no new fires were reported.",
      "Offshore Santa Ana winds will continue to diminish for the majority of Southern California on Thursday, according to the NWS. However, a red flag warning continues for the San Gabriel and Santa Susana mountains until 3 p.m. local time Thursday.",
      "This morning and early afternoon, winds of 15 to 25 mph with gusts up to 40 mph will continue for the Western San Gabriel Mountains, Santa Susana Mountains and the I-5 corridor.",
      "However, a red flag warning continues for the San Gabriel Mountains, 50 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, and the Santa Susana Mountains, about 30 miles north of downtown LA, until 3 p.m. local time Thursday.",
      "A marine layer and even some clouds could bring a chance for a sprinkle to Southern California late Thursday and into Friday.",
      "Up to more than 15,000 firefighters, including crews from outside the state and nation, are taking advantage of the calmer weather to increase fire containment lines, pre-position equipment in crews in vulnerable areas and use air tankers to coat hillsides in front of the burn areas with fire retardant in advance of the next Santa Ana wind event, officials said.",
      "The NWS is forecasting a return of strong Santa Ana winds to the region next Monday and Tuesday.",
      "Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Sheila Kelliher told ABC News a big concern continues to be protecting communities where no fires have yet to emerge, saying, \"The start that hasn't happened I think is what kind of keeps us up.\"",

      "About 80,000 people remain under mandatory evacuation.",
      "Fire victims like Zaire Calvin of Altadena, whose sister Evelyn McClendon perished in a blaze that burned down their family home, shuddered to think of another blaze like the Eaton Fire igniting.",

A cafe called Fox's, open since 1955, was just down the street.",
      "Less than an hour after the fire had started, flames were ripping strong along the mountain above Eaton Canyon. I wore a KN95 mask and ski goggles. The fire was probably still three miles from our home. But the Santa Anas were blowing at a level I\u2019d never felt before.",

Meg packed up her stuff and Reese\u2019s essential items \u2014 school backpack, a few stuffed animals. I started packing wine bottles, thought, \u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d and put them back. We got passports and birth certificates. A litter box and some wet food for the cats. We loaded both cars.",
      "Did anybody else on the street need our help? I asked our neighbor. Her next-door neighbor did, so we went over and I helped Donna get her husband, Phil, from his wheelchair into their Subaru.",

      "This was our home:",
      "We first encountered Altadena when Reese attended the Summerkids camp there. I felt the city's hustle-bustle melt away each morning that I drove her past the towering pines, deodar cedars and maple trees that lined the calm streets. When Reese was 5, we found a three-bedroom, two-bath home that had a backyard view of the San Gabriel Mountains and a tree out front with thick branches perfect for hanging a swing.",
      "Built in 1958, it had been owned for years by our new next-door neighbor. Megan and I both loved the clerestory windows, hardwood floors and wood beams that crossed the ceiling; they\u2019d been painted brown, but we stripped the paint to expose the natural wood.",
      "We loved the mixture of people around us, nods and greetings from neighbors when we walked down our sidewalk-less street. Along with a deep-rooted Black community, the hush and space and trees and birds and relatively affordable homes have long drawn musicians, artists and artisans from the LA area\u2019s more-blue-collar-than-you-think creative community.",
      "When the weather was right, I walked down the driveway and hiked uphill to the trail leading up to Echo Mountain and eventually to Inspiration Point. It was so accessible, I called it \u201cmy mountain.\" On Echo Mountain you could find the remains of a resort and hotel that burned in fires in the early 1900s. Once, when I hiked up with Reese, she and a friend dug in the dirt and uncovered pieces of a pot that we carried down, cleaned up and tried to piece back together.",
      "Two years ago, a family moved in next door to us with two daughters. They all became like sisters, and the girls would climb atop our garage to watch fireworks on the Fourth of July, play ping-pong in the back yard or sit in Reese\u2019s room and play Roblox. We adopted Luke and Archie, our two orange tabby cats. The cats, with us before the pandemic, helped get us through that hard time (including a few weeks of lockdown with nearby fires on the mountain keeping us indoors for days on end). Meg envisioned eventually building a \u201ccatio\u201d for them outside.",
      "After Meg\u2019s father died, we used her inheritance to remodel. Meg modernized and styled every corner while retaining the house's midcentury character. She curated the artwork, paintings, photographs, wood sculptures and trinkets from places we\u2019d visited in the before times.",
      "One Christmas, Meg surprised me by converting the garage into a man cave/study with a TV, elliptical and spin bike and her dad\u2019s old roll-top desk. We put sheds in the back for storage: photo albums from the time before digital photos, holiday ornaments, scrapbooks with my earliest newspaper clippings and Meg\u2019s elementary school class photos and report cards. All now gone.",
      "I ended up working from home a lot and walked a three-mile loop through the neighborhood that gave me a regular view of the community's variety: yards filled with cars in various states of disrepair. People in cowboy hats riding horses down the pavement. Ultra-modern new homes with glass walls. Coyotes \u2014 and dog walkers who carried thick sticks to fend them off. Rainbow flags and \u201cIn this house ...\u201d signs and Black Lives Matter signs and Harris signs and a couple Trump signs. A cul-de-sac on a hillside with a house where a motion-activated robot voice told me I was being recorded every time I walked past.",

      "From the freeway, it resembled the scene in \u201cFury Road\u201d where there\u2019s a swirling wall of orange as the vehicles enter the sandstorm. But I drove into an all-black cloud of smoke instead.",
      "Homes were on fire just down from the always busy McDonald's. I stopped to send in live video from my iPhone because I knew I couldn\u2019t get a cell signal up by my house.",

It was fascinating to watch the center evolve: at first just people wandering in and sitting against the wall, then Red Cross volunteers arriving, paramedics pushing folks from nursing homes on hospital beds, people giving out free food from World Central Kitchen and Chick-fil-A.",
      "We interviewed evacuees for a bit. When enough time had passed, I drove back up Marengo to check on our house.",

      "I didn\u2019t even get out of my car. I just looked long enough to absorb it: Like nearly the entire community, our whole block had burned. Reese's tree swing and the backyard ping-pong table were still there, plus our chimney and fireplace, with brick painted white. Everything else \u2014 everything in this place where we had chosen to live our lives and raise our child \u2014 was simply gone, as if it had never been there in the first place. But I knew better. I had lived it.",

      "A group of Pacific Palisades residents and businesses impacted by the Palisades Fire filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles against the city's Department of Water and Power, alleging that the city and the agency were unprepared for the Palisades Fire.",
      "The suit was filed in the California Superior Court on Monday and seeks damages for the costs, repair and replacement of damaged or destroyed property; cost for alternative living expenses; loss of wages, earning capacity or profits and any other relief a court deems appropriate.",
      "\"Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the water supply system servicing areas in and around Pacific Palisades on the date of the Palisades Fire failed, and that this failure was a substantial factor in causing plaintiffs to suffer the losses alleged,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "\"Among other failures, the Santa Ynez Reservoir, a 117-million-gallon water storage complex that is part of the Los Angeles water supply system, was empty, leaving fire crews little to no water to fight the Palisades Fire,\" the complaint said.",
      "\"Further, despite dire warnings by the National Weather Service of a 'Particularly Dangerous Condition -- Red Flag Warning' of 'critical fire weather' which had the potential for rapid fire spread and extreme fire behavior, the LADWP was unprepared for the Palisades Fire,\" the suit added.",
      "The group of plaintiffs includes several families, individuals and businesses, according to the complaint.",
      "In a statement issued before the lawsuit was filed, LADWP said it \"was required to take the Santa Ynez Reservoir out of service to meet safe drinking water regulations. To commission the support and resources to implement repairs to Santa Ynez, LADWP is subject to the city charter's competitive bidding process which requires time.\"",
      "\"The water system serving the Pacific Palisades area and all of Los Angeles meets all federal and state fire codes for urban development and housing,\" the statement said. \"LADWP built the Pacific Palisades water system beyond the requirements to support the community's typical needs.\"",

      "The extent of the economic damage wrought by the unprecedented fires is not yet clear. They will cost insurers as much as $30 billion, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs estimated in a report released this week. After accounting for non-insured damages, the total costs will balloon to $40 billion, the report said.",
      "The investigation into the cause and spread of the Palisades Fire is ongoing, even as firefighters continue their effort to contain that and other wildfires blazing around the Los Angeles area.",

    "story": [
      "Louisiana authorities have begun clearing homeless encampments in New Orleans, removing people under threat of arrest and relocating many to a warehouse facility ahead of the Super Bowl hosted by the city next month",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- As New Orleans prepares to host the Super Bowl next month, Louisiana authorities cleared homeless encampments around the stadium on Wednesday and relocated many to a temporary warehouse facility that costs millions of dollars to operate.",
      "Gov. Jeff Landry framed the sweep \u2014 which city officials say undermines their efforts to address homelessness \u2014 as part of a move to secure New Orleans, especially in the aftermath of the New Year\u2019s Day attack that killed 14 people.",
      "The tough-on-crime Republican governor has talked about plans to improve Louisiana's most popular city ahead of the Super Bowl at the Superdome. That has included a new Louisiana State Police troop dedicated to New Orleans, removing homeless encampments elsewhere in the city, and ensuring highways, sidewalks and transportation lines are clean and safe.",
      "\"It is in the best interest of every citizen\u2019s safety and security to give the unhoused humane and safe shelter as we begin to welcome the world to the City of New Orleans for both Super Bowl LIX and Mardi Gras,\u201d Landry said in a Monday statement.",
      "Last week, the state\u2019s Supreme Court overturned a restraining order that had barred the state police from clearing homeless encampments in New Orleans. Days after the ruling, \"relocation notices\u201d from the state appeared at one of the city's largest homeless encampments beneath an underpass near the Superdome. The notice warned that \u201ceveryone must comply\u201d and \u201cfailure to do so may result in enforcement actions or legal proceedings.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday morning state police converged on the encampment and told people to pack their possessions into boxes and that there were buses to take them to a \u201ctransitional center\u201d miles away at a fenced-in warehouse owned by the Port of New Orleans.",
      "People at the encampment were told that they did not have to go to the transitional center, but they were not allowed to remain in the area and were under threat of arrest, Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the Governor\u2019s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, told The Associated Press.",
      "Among those at the encampment was Ray Cooper, who scoured for his social security card amid scattered clothes, bicycles and tents. Cooper, 35, has lived mostly on the streets for the past few years and declined the state\u2019s offer to bring him to the transitional center.",
      "\u201cThat just turned me off \u2014 we\u2019re going to a warehouse? I\u2019m not a UPS package or anything like that, I\u2019m a human,\u201d said Cooper.",
      "The temporary center has the capacity to house 200 people. As of Wednesday evening, 131 people were staying there, said Bart Farmer, the president of Workforce Group, a company that specializes in post-disaster assistance and is operating the site.",
      "The center includes three meals a day, bedding, showers, toilets, refrigeration for medication and veterinary care for their pets, according to the relocation notice. The site is estimated to cost the state $16.2 million to operate over a 90-day period, according to a proposal crafted by the Workforce Group and obtained by the AP.",
      "Critics argue the relocations to the center are a band-aid solution. In a letter sent to the governor from 12 community organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, the groups expressed \u201cserious reservations about the effectiveness, cost-efficiency and long-term impact of this approach.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvidence-based best practices for ending homelessness are centered on permanent housing with supportive services,\u201d said Martha Kegel, who leads UNITY, an agency which partners with the city on efforts to house and support its homeless population.",
      "Part of Landry's homeless strategy, announced on Monday, states that housing and services will be prioritized for \u201ccitizens that have jobs\" and that people \"who have means will be given bus or train tickets out of state.\u201d While details surrounding the plan are still unclear, Steele said that relocations out of state would be voluntary.",
      "Landry\u2019s approach clashes with the City of New Orleans\u2019 plans to close these same encampments by first providing long-term housing to people living in them. The city said it has requested $6 million from the state to assist in these efforts and that state-led sweeps cause \u201cdelays\u201d in providing housing and services to the approximately 1,500 homeless people in the city.",
      "Candice Allison, 63, who said she had been homeless since Hurricane Ida destroyed her trailer in 2021, sorted through a mass of clothes and other items she hoped to salvage on Wednesday, fearing authorities would return to confiscate her possessions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this all night, I haven\u2019t ate, I haven\u2019t slept, I\u2019m exhausted,\u201d Allison said.",

      "Delta, based in Atlanta, achieved an on-time rate of more than 83%, good enough to rank third worldwide behind Aeromexico and Saudia, respectively. The next-best U.S. carriers were United Airlines, at nearly 81%, and Alaska Airlines, at just over 79%, Cirium said.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump tasked a New Jersey congressman and vocal critic of offshore wind with writing an executive order he could issue to halt wind energy projects.",
      "Offshore wind is a major part of transitioning to an electric grid powered entirely by sources that don\u2019t emit carbon dioxide when generating electricity. The power sector is responsible for nearly a third of the nation's planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to end the offshore wind industry as soon as he returned to the White House. He wants to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, in order for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity of any nation in the world, he says.",
      "Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew said he spoke with Trump by phone about a month ago and urged him to act on his campaign promise.",
      "\u201cI said \u2018Mr. President, we need to move on this.\u2019 He said, \u2018Yeah, we definitely do. I agree. I\u2019m against them.\u2019\" Van Drew said. \"He said, \u2018Write an executive order, get it to my people.\u2019\u201d",
      "Van Drew told The Associated Press Wednesday night that he quickly emailed a draft order to Doug Burgum, Trump's pick to be interior secretary. Van Drew said the draft is written to halt offshore wind development from Rhode Island to Virginia for six months so the incoming interior secretary could review how leases and permits were issued. Van Drew said he believes the approvals did not fully take into account the impact on the fishing industry, tourism, whales or Americans\u2019 utility bills, and it's problematic to rely on foreign renewable energy companies building the wind farms.",
      "The Interior Department includes the agency responsible for offshore renewable energy development in federal waters, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. Burgum is due before a Senate committee Thursday for a confirmation hearing.",
      "Van Drew declined to show the AP the order, saying he doesn't expect Trump to use his draft verbatim, it's a template. He expects Trump to issue an offshore wind executive order within the first quarter of the year, possibly as early as his first day on the job. Van Drew said he views that as a first step toward an eventual moratorium on offshore wind development.",
      "Trump says wind turbines are horrible and expensive. He repeats unfounded claims about offshore wind threatening whales. His transition team didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.",
      "The Biden administration worked to propel the nascent U.S. offshore wind industry forward to address climate change as an existential threat. It set targets to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, generating enough electricity to power more than 10 million homes, and up to 15 gigawatts of electricity through floating sites by 2035, enough to power 5 million homes.",
      "The nation\u2019s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened in March, a 12-turbine wind farm called South Fork Wind 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Montauk Point, New York.",
      "The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management held first-ever lease sales off the West Coast and the Gulf of Mexico, and the first commercial sale for floating offshore wind on the Atlantic coast. It approved the nation\u2019s 11th commercial-scale offshore wind energy project in December. Combined, the 11 projects total over 19 gigawatts of clean energy, enough to power more than 6 million homes.",

      "The arrest warrant accuses Cleary of stalking an 18-year-old Gettysburg College student at a party in 2013, sneaking into her dorm and sexually assaulting her while she texted friends for help. He was a 20-year-old Gettysburg student at the time, but didn\u2019t return to campus.",
      "The accuser, Shannon Keeler, had a rape exam done the same day. She gathered witnesses and evidence and spent years urging officials to file charges. She went to authorities again in 2021 after discovering the Facebook messages that seemed to come from Cleary\u2019s account.",

      "La June Montgomery Tabron believes many Americans have a desire for racial healing. They just don\u2019t know how to start.",
      "\u201cIt may sound mysterious or challenging,\u201d said Montgomery Tabron, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation\u2019s first woman and first Black CEO. \u201cBut it\u2019s actually quite simple.\u201d",
      "It starts, she says, with a conversation \u2014 with the sharing of stories between people of different backgrounds so they can better understand each other. So when Montgomery Tabron set out to explain the foundation\u2019s \u201cTruth, Racial Healing & Transformation\u201d work and its creation of the annual National Day of Racial Healing, set for Jan. 21 this year, she realized she should do it by sharing her own story.",
      "That\u2019s what she does in a pair of books released earlier this month \u2014\u201cHow We Heal: A Journey Toward Truth, Racial Healing and Community Transformation from the Inside Out,\u201d a memoir tracing the steps from her Detroit childhood to leading one of philanthropy\u2019s most prestigious foundations, and \u201cOur Differences Make Us Stronger,\u201d a children\u2019s book about connecting with others outside our comfort zones.",
      "\u201cI wanted to use the methodology of healing that we use, which is through storytelling,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people relate through stories. And this became a book of very interconnected stories.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press recently spoke with Montgomery Tabron about her books and the Kellogg Foundation\u2019s racial healing work. The interview was edited for clarity and length.",
      "Yes. There were several places across our portfolio where we had the same reaction: Had it not been for the healing work, a situation could have escalated, particularly in Buffalo. Not only was that work about connecting people, it also was about affirming everyone as part of the process, affirming everyone\u2019s value. They felt it was a moment to show up in a very different way that honors healing. It was about the grounding in their humanity and using those principles of trust and mutual respect and shared understanding as a way to express their own grief and healing in that moment.",
      "It was a process. In many ways, it was cathartic because my own healing journey happened also during the writing of the book. I touched on moments in my life that I had not totally processed or really fully healed from. There\u2019s nothing like going through the healing journey that you\u2019re writing about. I think it brings a level of authenticity to the writing itself.",
      "It was, but that made it even more important for me to do so. I wish I had such a book at that stage of my life, so I\u2019m telling the story. But more importantly, I\u2019m sharing the power of healing with a very young audience that I believe will help them navigate the nation and the world.",
      "Teaching young people how to communicate across differences and showing them that it can result in strong relationships and shared understanding is the beginning of the work. It\u2019s work that, for those who practice, can lead to making connections and building strong and trusting relationships. I hope we also find that we (adults) can do it as well. It\u2019s not too late to have these conversations, and, particularly in this moment, is imperative that we have them.",
      "I think it is calling for this more than ever. When I think about the attacks on DEI, I attribute the attacks to a lack of understanding, a lack of shared purpose and an empathy gap. And what the book speaks about is exactly how those types of disagreements need to be reconciled and can be reconciled through a healing process and healing conversation. I believe that through dialogue we can come closer to understanding why there would be such an attack and have a conversation about whether there is shared faith underneath that would align us and take us to a different place, where you resolve the issue. So I look at that particular issue and say it needs a healing framework just as much as many of the most important conversations we\u2019re having in this nation right now.",
      "What we\u2019ve always hoped is for people to take action. And we hope that both books can be used as tools to show what action looks like. We want people to begin to not only hear and understand my story but see their story in the book and understand that part of this process is telling your story and having comfort in telling your truth, regardless of whether it may or may not align with someone else\u2019s story. We then want them to take collective action. What can we do together within our family, within our community, within our organization, across our friend groups? What can we do to help others and join in to help others see through conversation and dialogue that there are other pathways that maybe they haven\u2019t envisioned themselves?",

    "story": [
      "A Nicaraguan woman staying legally in the United States has chosen to leave because of concern over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign for mass deportations",
      "TRACY, Calif. -- Michel B\u00e9rrios left the United States a few days before the new year, giving President-elect Donald Trump's campaign for mass deportations a small victory before they even started.",
      "A former leader of a Nicaraguan student uprising, B\u00e9rrios had been in the U.S. legally, with nearly a year remaining under President Joe Biden's unprecedented use of humanitarian parole authority for citizens of certain vulnerable countries. But harsh talk during the U.S. election campaign filled her with anxious memories of hiding from authorities back home.",
      "Advocates and immigration experts who have noticed such departures say B\u00e9rrios' decision to leave the U.S., despite her legal status, shows how uncertainty and threats have led a growing number of people to leave the U.S. before Trump takes office on Monday.",
      "There isn't data on these departures, but history has seen other eras of public backlash that drove migrants \u2014 with or without legal status \u2014 out.",
      "Trump and his allies are counting on this \u201cself-deportation,\u201d the idea that life can be made unbearable enough to make people leave.",
      "\u201cBecause (the U.S.) is not a third world country like the ones many of us come from, I thought there would be a different culture here, and it was a rude awakening to realize that you and your family are not welcome,\u201d B\u00e9rrios, 31, said days before her departure.",
      "Self-deportation helps Trump to achieve his goals without the government having to spend or do anything in such cases. Trump has long said he wanted to deport millions of migrants but never deported more than 350,000 a year in his first term. Only 41,500 detention beds are funded this year, so carrying out massive deportations has significant logistical hurdles.",
      "\"If you wanna self-deport, you should self-deport because, again, we know who you are, and we\u2019re gonna come and find you,\u201d Trump\u2019s incoming border czar Tom Homan has said.",
      "B\u00e9rrios had been living legally with her cousin in California, east of San Francisco, working at the front desk of an auto repair shop with Trump supporters, but she knew it was temporary \u2014 especially once Trump was elected. Anti-immigrant comments by her colleagues increased, and her discomfort grew.",
      "In Nicaragua, \u201cI spent five years hiding. I had to change my routine. I had to completely change my life. I stopped visiting my parents, my friends,\u201d B\u00e9rrios said of President Daniel Ortega\u2019s crackdown on dissent. With Trump returning to power, \"that uncertainty has returned.\u201d",
      "Such fear is natural for anyone without permanent legal status, said Melanie Nezer, vice president for advocacy and external relations at the Women\u2019s Refugee Commission. People with temporary permission to live and work, like B\u00e9rrios, may see that status end soon.",
      "\u201cMany, many people are in this situation,\u201d she said. About 1 million people have temporary protected status and about another 500,000 like B\u00e9rrios have humanitarian parole granted to asylum-seekers from four countries: Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Trump has said he wants to end both.",
      "Until 2018, B\u00e9rrios led a fairly normal life in Nicaragua, working at a call center in Managua. She studied marketing and hoped to pursue a master\u2019s degree in dance.",
      "Then changes to Nicaragua\u2019s social security system drove retirees to protest. When they were roughed up by police and Ortega supporters, students came to their aid.",
      "Deadly clashes followed, and university campuses became strongholds of resistance in what became a referendum on the government itself. The government declared the protesters \u201cterrorists\u201d and alleged they were organized by foreign powers, especially the United States.",
      "B\u00e9rrios became a protest leader at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua\u2019s Managua campus. Then known only by a code name, she told The Associated Press from hiding in July 2018, \u201cNow, I really have no future.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of other protesters were imprisoned, many tortured and more recently expelled from the country and stripped of citizenship.",
      "\u201cThere was always the uncertainty that they could come after me, that they could take me to prison,\u201d B\u00e9rrios said last year of Nicaraguan authorities. \u201cThat\u2019s why I decided, well, maybe the United States can help me make a change for my peace of mind.\u201d",
      "A cousin, a U.S. citizen in California, offered to sponsor B\u00e9rrios last year. Under Biden's strategy to create legal pathways while severely limiting asylum to those who cross the border illegally, people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela can apply online with a financial sponsor. They must fly to a U.S. airport at their expense.",
      "About 100,000 Nicaraguans have come on two-year permits with eligibility to work since late 2022.",
      "B\u00e9rrios arrived in 2023 as the U.S. election campaigns gained momentum. But talk of mass deportations eventually unnerved her. Returning to Nicaragua was not an option, so in December she settled on Ireland, where she had a couple of friends from the student movement.",
      "\u201cI felt like Ireland was a country of opportunity,\u201d she said.",
      "Asylum systems in the European Union are largely standardized, but some differences make Ireland attractive, said Susan Fratzke, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute\u2019s International Program.",
      "The resolution of asylum cases is faster than in the U.S., Fratzke said, and Ireland has not seen the strong pushback against asylum-seekers that has occurred in some other European countries.",
      "At Dublin's airport, B\u00e9rrios handed her passport to an immigration official and said she was requesting humanitarian protection. She was quizzed on the name of Ireland\u2019s president, answering correctly, and had her photo and fingerprints taken.",
      "She got a government-issued identification card the next morning, valid for a year, and now shares a room with women from Somalia, Egypt and Pakistan in a hotel in a nearby town. They are free to come and go as they please, and the government pays for her lodging.",
      "B\u00e9rrios looks forward to enrolling in school while she waits for her work permit. An in-depth interview about her case should come in eight or nine months and a decision on her asylum request would follow.",
      "If all goes well, she could receive permanent residency in as soon as a year, she said.",
      "B\u00e9rrios was buoyant as she marveled at her journey with the self-deportation twist: \u201cYou make sacrifices and always hope that things will turn out like you think, maybe not exactly, but pretty close.\u201d",

      "Many colleges accused of tolerating antisemitism on their campuses have been settling with federal civil rights investigators in the weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who urged a tougher response to campus protests against ...",
      "WASHINGTON -- Many colleges accused of tolerating antisemitism on their campuses have been settling with federal civil rights investigators in the weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who urged a tougher response to campus protests against the war in Gaza.",
      "By settling with the Education Department, the schools close the cases against them as long as they meet the terms of the agreements, which mostly have required training, policy updates and reviews of past complaints.",
      "But many colleges at the center of the highest-profile cases \u2014 including Columbia and Cornell \u2014 face investigations that remain unresolved and could run the risk of harsher penalties after Trump takes office. Trump has not said what he would like to see come of the investigations, but he has threatened to revoke federal money for schools that fall short of his demands.",
      "\u201cColleges will and must end the antisemitic propaganda or they will lose their accreditation and federal support,\u201d Trump said in a virtual address to Jewish donors in September. \u201cNo money will go to them if they don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Settlements with the Education Department\u2019s civil rights branch have piled up in recent weeks with the University of Washington, the University of California, Johns Hopkins, Rutgers and the University of Cincinnati. Those follow other voluntary agreements signed by Brown and Temple universities, along with the University of Michigan.",
      "The flurry of recent deals has drawn outrage from Republicans in Congress who say the Biden administration is letting colleges off the hook.",
      "Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., chair of the House Education and Workforce Committee, said the settlements are \u201ctoothless\u201d and fail to hold colleges accountable for permitting antisemitism. In a statement, he said the Trump administration should \u201cexamine these agreements and explore options to impose real consequences on schools.\u201d",
      "One of the committee's priorities will be \u201ccalling out woke higher education institutions \u2014 especially those that allow antisemitism to run rampant,\u201d Walberg said at a Wednesday meeting.",
      "More than 100 U.S. colleges and school districts remain under investigation over alleged antisemitism or Islamophobia following the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel. That includes Columbia, Cornell, Yale, Princeton and other prestigious schools targeted by a Republican campaign against antisemitism.",
      "The Department of Education investigations stem from complaints that schools violated Title VI, which bars discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color and national origin at colleges and universities that receive federal funding.",
      "Several colleges facing investigations declined to comment on their status.",
      "Presidents of several universities were called before Congress last year over their handling of pro-Palestinian protests, contributing to the resignations of Claudine Gay at Harvard, Liz Magill at Penn and Minouche Shafik at Columbia.",
      "The vast majority of Education Department civil rights investigations end with voluntary deals negotiated with schools. If they can\u2019t reach a settlement, the agency can refer the case to the Justice Department or move to cut off the school\u2019s federal money \u2014 an extreme sanction that has almost never been used.",
      "Whether Trump pushes the Education Department to use the so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d is still in question. But without a deal before Jan. 20, colleges raise the risk that they could become test cases for Trump, who has been openly hostile to universities that he sees as hotbeds of liberalism.",
      "Losing access to federal money is usually seen as a death sentence for colleges, though if there\u2019s any exception it would be Harvard and its $53 billion endowment, the wealthiest college in the world. A total cutoff would also mean that students could not use federal financial aid at the university.",
      "It couldn\u2019t happen instantly, however. The Education Department can terminate federal money only if it fails to gain voluntary compliance from the school and only if it\u2019s approved by an administrative law judge. There would have to be a hearing, and there would be opportunities for the school to appeal the decision.",
      "As Republicans take control of both chambers of Congress, there\u2019s also a renewed push for legislation on the subject. A December report coordinated by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., found that colleges across the U.S. failed to stop antisemitism amid last year\u2019s demonstrations, highlighting cases at Harvard, Columbia and UCLA.",
      "The report called for new legislation \u201cto support students and ensure accountability,\u201d and it endorsed legislation to cut off federal money at schools that support divestment from Israel. It called on the executive branch to \u201caggressively enforce\u201d civil rights laws, saying universities that fail to curb antisemitism \u201care unfit stewards of taxpayer dollars should be treated accordingly.\u201d",

      "Rudy Giuliani is set to be the first witness at a trial over whether he can keep his Florida condominium and three World Series rings or must turn them over to satisfy a $148 million judgment awarded to two Georgia election workers",
      "NEW YORK -- Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani is set to be the first witness at a trial over whether he can keep his Florida condominium and three World Series rings or must turn them over to satisfy a $148 million defamation judgment awarded to two Georgia election workers.",
      "The trial, heard without a jury, begins Thursday morning at a federal court in Manhattan.",
      "Giuliani, 80, will testify before the same judge who last week found him in contempt for failing to turn over information on some of his assets to lawyers for the women. As punishment, Judge Lewis J. Liman banned Giuliani from introducing some evidence.",
      "Giuliani, who served for a time as personal attorney to President-elect Donald Trump during his first term, also was found in contempt last week in Washington, D.C. The judge there found that Giuliani continued to slander the election workers by repeating false claims that they counted votes corruptly in the 2020 presidential contest.",
      "The latest proceeding will not be to relitigate whether Giuliani defamed the women or the amount of the judgment against him, both of which are issues that have been decided, but rather to determine whether he will get to keep certain valuable assets instead of turning them over.",
      "Among them is his condominium in Palm Beach, Florida, which he can hang onto if he can prove it is his homestead. The former mayor says he established residence there in January 2024, but lawyers for the election workers say he continued to operate as if his New York apartment was his residence until it was surrendered in the fall as part of the judgement.",
      "Also at stake are three World Series rings that Giuliani says he gave to his son, Andrew, in 2018.",
      "At a recent hearing, Giuliani said he is \u201cnot impoverished\u201d but does not have access to most of his remaining assets.",
      "\"Everything I have is tied up. I don\u2019t have a car. I don\u2019t have a credit card. I don\u2019t have cash. I can\u2019t get to bank accounts that truly would be mine because they have put ... stop orders on, for example, my Social Security account, which they have no right to do,\u201d he said.",
      "Lawyers for the election workers say Giuliani listed the Manhattan apartment as his residence and the rings as his property when he filed for bankruptcy in December 2023, an application that was dismissed six months later by a judge who accused him of \u201cuncooperative conduct,\u201d self-dealing and a lack of transparency.",
      "Giuliani said during a deposition last month that George Steinbrenner, the late New York Yankees owner, gave him the rings in 2002, although he insisted on paying for them and told Steinbrenner: \u201cThese are for Andrew.\u201d He testified that he gave one to Andrew immediately and kept three others for safekeeping. He estimated their total worth at $27,000.",
      "Lawyers for the election workers say Giuliani, a lifelong Yankees fan who wore the rings sometimes, never listed them as a gift to his son in tax records even though he was meticulous about listing gifts when he reported taxes. And they say the son never obtained insurance for the rings or reported them in his own tax records.",
      "Giuliani's total assets are not expected to amount to much more than $10 million. The Palm Beach condominium is believed to be worth more than $3 million.",
      "He has already surrendered a New York apartment worth about $5 million, a 1980 Mercedes once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall, numerous luxury watches and other assets.",
      "The election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss, won the defamation judgment after saying Giiuliani's lies about the 2020 presidential election being stolen led to death threats that made them fear for their lives.",

      "Yet even with flames still leaping in two the largest fires, which have killed 25 and destroyed more than 12,000 structures, government officials talked Wednesday of the epic job that will unspool over years: clearing Altadena, Pacific Palisades and other ravaged communities of toxic ash and debris, then rebuilding homes, restaurants, schools, boutiques, banks and houses of worship \u2014 all while finding financing for it all.",
      "Because of the ongoing firefighting battle and the likelihood of dangerous refuse in burned areas, many anxious residents have yet to return to see what, if anything, is left of their homes. The losses range from multimillion-dollar ocean-view mansions to modest homes that once welcomed returning World War II GIs.",
      "While talking of rebuilding can be a comfort for those eager for a return to normalcy, much remains unknown.",
      "What will the new neighborhoods look like? Will fire-resistant materials and designs be used? Are more and wider roads needed to allow swifter evacuations and easier access for fire engines during future infernos?",
      "In the coveted seaside hills, there always is the impulse to rebuild after fires \u2014 it\u2019s happened many times. But there are inevitable questions about whether it\u2019s sensible to keep rebuilding in known high-risk areas, especially in an age of climate change.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a while before we can get in there and build anything,\u201d said Michael Hricak, an adjunct professor of architecture at the University of Southern California., referring to the dangerous chemicals and rubble left behind.",
      "As for new construction, \u201cit\u2019s not being tougher than Mother Nature. It's being somewhat respectful of Mother Nature and knowing what the challenges are.\u201d",
      "\u201cAre we just inviting another problem down the road?\u201d Hricak said.",
      "The fires struck at a challenging time, with the city in the midst of a post-pandemic transition that has reordered work life and left many downtown buildings with high vacancy rates.",
      "Meanwhile, planning is underway to host the 2028 Olympics and the region contends with perhaps the nation\u2019s worst homeless crisis \u2014 the latter had been Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass\u2019 priority before the fires broke out last week.",
      "The government has not yet released damage estimates, but private firms have expect they will climb into the tens of billions and it could become the costliest fire disaster in U.S. history.",
      "The Northern California community of Paradise, where the state's deadliest wildfire killed 85 people in 2018, offers a glimpse into how painstaking and difficult recovery and rebuilding can be.",
      "That fire destroyed about 11,000 homes \u2014 some 90% of the community's structures. Four years later, as of last November, just about 3,000 homes and apartments have been rebuilt.",
      "The town, which previously a population of 26,000, has struggled under high construction costs, expensive insurance premiums and the uncertainty over funds to be paid to people who lost homes by Pacific Gas & Electric, which was found liable for sparking the devastating blaze.",
      "In Los Angeles \u2014 a city notorious for dense layers of bureaucracy and government red tape \u2014 Bass issued an executive order this week intended to clear the way for residents to rebuild quickly.",
      "\u201cAs we prepare to make it through the rest of this emergency, we also have to start putting in place what we need to do to rebuild,\u201d the mayor said Wednesday.",
      "The federal government already has approved spending $100 million to remove paints, cleaners, asbestos, batteries and other household waste from the rubble before crews can begin clearing debris. Robert Fenton Jr., a regional administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, called the plan a first step to getting people back in homes.",
      "Elsewhere, the agency is handing out assistance to help people with short-term lodging.",
      "Peter Dolan, who lived in Santa Monica, said he and his best friend both lost their apartments on the same day. They visited the disaster recovery center together to figure out their next steps.",
      "\u201cThis is what I got,\u201d the 55-year-old said, pointing to his outfit: a leather jacket, shorts and sneakers, the clothes he had on the day the flames hit.",
      "Dolan didn\u2019t have renter\u2019s insurance, but he was able to apply for FEMA assistance and thinks he\u2019ll get $750 and possibly his stay at a hotel covered for a few months.",
      "Michele Baron and her daughter were among those who came to a recovery center in West Los Angeles to figure out how to get new birth certificates and social security cards.",
      "Baron lost nearly everything when her Pacific Palisades apartment of 21 years burned to the ground. Her daughter made her way back to the property and salvaged a ring and pottery she made as a child.",
      "Despite the trauma, the plan is to stay put.",
      "\u201cNow that I can go anywhere, I kind of don\u2019t want to,\u201d Baron said.",

    "summary": "Hawaii lawmakers are beginning a new legislative session with a vow to try to stabilize the state&rsquo;s property insurance market",
    "story": [
      "Hawaii lawmakers are beginning a new legislative session with a vow to try to stabilize the state\u2019s property insurance market",
      "HONOLULU -- Hawaii lawmakers began a new legislative session Wednesday with a vow to try to stabilize the state's property insurance market as hurricanes, wildfires and other climate change-influenced disasters at home and elsewhere prompt insurance carriers to raise rates.",
      "Hurricanes in Florida and North Carolina and wildfires in California affect the insurance business in Hawaii because insurance companies buy reinsurance \u2014 insurance for themselves \u2014 on the global market. As reinsurance rates rise in response to these disasters, some insurers want to charge more in Hawaii or stop providing insurance in the islands.",
      "Insurance companies had increasingly been viewing Hawaii as a disaster risk state even before the August 2023 wildfires on Maui, but that event only intensified the trend, Senate President Ron Kouchi told reporters at a news conference.",
      "The emergence of multiple large wildfires that have destroyed thousands of structures in and around Los Angeles over the past week have made matters worse. A preliminary estimate last week by AccuWeather, a private company that provides data on weather and its impact, put damage and economic losses from the fires between $135 billion and $150 billion, likely the costliest in U.S. history.",
      "The current situation is \u201cincredibly complicated and dynamic,\u201d said state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole, chair of the Senate Commerce and Consumer Protection Committee.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have any certainty, for example, on what the fires in Los Angeles are going to cause in the insurance market, in part because the fires are not even extinguished yet,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unclear at this point whether we\u2019re at the bottom or things could get worse,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cWhat we can expect is that these larger and larger scale disasters are going to continue to increase in frequency, and we need to be prepared for it.\u201d",
      "Senate Democrats will propose restarting programs started after Hurricane Iniki hit Kauai in 1992 and upended property insurance for years after. At the time, the state created a fund to provide hurricane insurance to residents.",
      "The Hawaii Hurricane Relief Fund created after Iniki provided hurricane coverage to 155,000 policyholders statewide for a decade until private insurers returned to the market. The state paid for the fund through policyholder premiums, assessments on licensed property and casualty insurers, a special mortgage recording fee and a surcharge on premiums on policies issued by licensed property and casualty insurers.",
      "The state authorized the director of finance to issue bonds to help the fund operate, but they were never issued.",
      "Keohokalole said the state has limited resources and he couldn't guarantee that such a program would lead to prices that homeowners are accustomed to. It's important for Hawaii homeowners to be able to buy insurance locally, he said.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t expect kupuna on fixed incomes or families that are struggling right now to be able to pay whatever the market dictates globally, when Hawaii is a tsunami risk state, a wildfire risk state and a hurricane risk state,\u201d he said, using the Hawaiian word for elders.",
      "Longer term, he said lawmakers would need to discuss resiliency and fire safety measures homeowners can adopt so they'll be better able to withstand disasters.",
      "Hawaii condominium owners have been hit particularly hard by insurance market instability.",
      "Testifiers before the Legislature last year said condo boards were increasingly choosing to reduce the amount of their insurance coverage because they couldn\u2019t afford higher premiums. But Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which buy home loans from banks and other lenders, will only buy mortgages for units in buildings insured up to full replacement value. This makes banks unwilling to lend money to buyers of these condos.",
      "One testifier said between 375 to 390 condominium buildings in Hawaii were underinsured for hurricane risk.",
      "Keohokalole said it was imperative that lawmakers \u201cdeliver something\u201d this session, which ends in May.",
      "Kouchi, also a Democrat, noted that without insurance people wouldn't be able to get a mortgage and would have to pay cash to buy a home. He said this would be a \u201ctremendous impediment\u201d to homeownership in a state where the median price of a single-family home is over $1 million in most counties.",
      "The Los Angeles wildfires are also testing California's insurance market, where major insurers have pulled back on property coverage as climate change makes wildfires, floods and windstorms more common and damaging.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 22:50:25 -0500",
    "summary": "President Joe Biden offered up a few surprises in his farewell address",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden offered up a few surprises in his farewell address",
      "WASHINGTON -- With only days left in the White House, President Joe Biden was saving a few surprises for his farewell address Wednesday evening. Instead of simply summing up his term in office, he used the opportunity to issue dire warnings about the future and call for deep changes to the country's foundational document.",
      "Biden's term ends Monday, when he'll be replaced by Donald Trump, a man he has called an existential threat to the nation. Here's a look at what was likely the last major speech of a political career spanning more than five decades:",
      "The outgoing president used the opportunity to deliver a series of warnings to the American people, much like Dwight Eisenhower did in 1961 when he expressed concerns about the \u201cmilitary industrial complex\u201d in his farewell address.",
      "Biden said \u201can oligarchy is taking shape in America\u201d as power and money become more concentrated in the hands of the few. He criticized the \u201ctech industrial complex\" and social media, where \u201cthe truth is smothered by lies told for power and for profit.\u201d He urged the country to continue confronting climate change, saying, \u201cWe must not be bullied into sacrificing the future.\"",
      "It was a stark assessment for a politician who prides himself on optimism. Still, as if to prove his point about misinformation, Trump\u2019s incoming communications director and press secretary started falsely claiming on social media that Biden's speech was prerecorded.",
      "Biden used the speech to announce one of his most ambitious proposals. He wants an amendment to the U.S. Constitution \u201cto make clear that no president \u2014 no president \u2014 is immune from crimes that he or she commits while in office.\u201d",
      "The proposal is related to a landmark Supreme Court ruling from last summer, when justices said former presidents have broad immunity for official acts while they're in the White House. The ruling had major legal consequences, significantly narrowing the case against Trump for attempting to overturn his 2020 loss. The charges were dismissed following Trump\u2019s win in November because sitting presidents can't be prosecuted.",
      "In addition to the ruling's impact on Trump's case, Biden has been deeply troubled by the possibility that it would turn presidents into unaccountable kings.",
      "Biden had other ideas, too. He said there should be higher taxes on billionaires, stricter rules on campaign contributions, 18-year term limits for Supreme Court justices and a ban on stock trading for members of Congress.",
      "The speech Wednesday evening was one of several events Biden was holding as he winds down his time in the White House. He gave a speech on foreign policy at the State Department on Monday, and he's granted a handful of interviews. He also named new national monuments, issued new rules on America\u2019s use of artificial intelligence and announced that a ceasefire had been brokered between Israel and Hamas.",
      "His final public appearance before Monday's inauguration will be on Sunday in South Carolina, where he's expected to visit the International African American Museum in Charleston. The state was a crucial part of his quest for the White House four years ago, helping him secure the Democratic nomination.",
      "Biden chose to speak from the Oval Office, the most presidential of presidential venues. He sat at the Resolute desk, photos of his family behind him. First lady Jill Biden, son Hunter and other family members, including his 4-year-old grandson, Beau, sat in the office as he delivered his speech.",
      "Not every president gives a speech in the same spot. President Barack Obama went to his home in Chicago for his farewell speech. George W. Bush spoke from the East Room. Donald Trump never conceded his election loss four years ago, but he delivered a pretaped address that was made public Jan. 19, 2021.",
      "Also in the Oval Office were Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff. Harris replaced Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket when he abandoned his reelection bid after a disastrous debate performance. Biden endorsed Harris and hoped she would be replacing him as the country's first female president.",
      "Instead, Harris was watching as Biden talked about a smooth transition to the next administration.",
      "Biden said Harris has been \u201ca great partner,\" adding that she and Emhoff had become \u201clike family.\u201d When he said that, Jill Biden reached over and squeezed Harris' hands."

      "Louisiana authorities have begun clearing homeless encampments in New Orleans, removing people under threat of arrest and relocating many to a warehouse facility ahead of the Super Bowl hosted by the city next month",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- As New Orleans prepares to host the Super Bowl next month, Louisiana authorities cleared homeless encampments around the stadium on Wednesday and relocated many to a temporary warehouse facility that costs millions of dollars to operate.",
      "Gov. Jeff Landry framed the sweep \u2014 which city officials say undermines their efforts to address homelessness \u2014 as part of a move to secure New Orleans, especially in the aftermath of the New Year\u2019s Day attack that killed 14 people.",
      "The tough-on-crime Republican governor has talked about plans to improve Louisiana's most popular city ahead of the Super Bowl at the Superdome. That has included a new Louisiana State Police troop dedicated to New Orleans, removing homeless encampments elsewhere in the city, and ensuring highways, sidewalks and transportation lines are clean and safe.",
      "\"It is in the best interest of every citizen\u2019s safety and security to give the unhoused humane and safe shelter as we begin to welcome the world to the City of New Orleans for both Super Bowl LIX and Mardi Gras,\u201d Landry said in a Monday statement.",
      "Last week, the state\u2019s Supreme Court overturned a restraining order that had barred the state police from clearing homeless encampments in New Orleans. Days after the ruling, \"relocation notices\u201d from the state appeared at one of the city's largest homeless encampments beneath an underpass near the Superdome. The notice warned that \u201ceveryone must comply\u201d and \u201cfailure to do so may result in enforcement actions or legal proceedings.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday morning state police converged on the encampment and told people to pack their possessions into boxes and that there were buses to take them to a \u201ctransitional center\u201d miles away at a fenced-in warehouse owned by the Port of New Orleans.",
      "People at the encampment were told that they did not have to go to the transitional center, but they were not allowed to remain in the area and were under threat of arrest, Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the Governor\u2019s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, told The Associated Press.",
      "Among those at the encampment was Ray Cooper, who scoured for his social security card amid scattered clothes, bicycles and tents. Cooper, 35, has lived mostly on the streets for the past few years and declined the state\u2019s offer to bring him to the transitional center.",
      "\u201cThat just turned me off \u2014 we\u2019re going to a warehouse? I\u2019m not a UPS package or anything like that, I\u2019m a human,\u201d said Cooper.",
      "The temporary center has the capacity to house 200 people. As of Wednesday evening, 131 people were staying there, said Bart Farmer, the president of Workforce Group, a company that specializes in post-disaster assistance and is operating the site.",
      "The center includes three meals a day, bedding, showers, toilets, refrigeration for medication and veterinary care for their pets, according to the relocation notice. The site is estimated to cost the state $16.2 million to operate over a 90-day period, according to a proposal crafted by the Workforce Group and obtained by the AP.",
      "Critics argue the relocations to the center are a band-aid solution. In a letter sent to the governor from 12 community organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, the groups expressed \u201cserious reservations about the effectiveness, cost-efficiency and long-term impact of this approach.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvidence-based best practices for ending homelessness are centered on permanent housing with supportive services,\u201d said Martha Kegel, who leads UNITY, an agency which partners with the city on efforts to house and support its homeless population.",
      "Part of Landry's homeless strategy, announced on Monday, states that housing and services will be prioritized for \u201ccitizens that have jobs\" and that people \"who have means will be given bus or train tickets out of state.\u201d While details surrounding the plan are still unclear, Steele said that relocations out of state would be voluntary.",
      "Landry\u2019s approach clashes with the City of New Orleans\u2019 plans to close these same encampments by first providing long-term housing to people living in them. The city said it has requested $6 million from the state to assist in these efforts and that state-led sweeps cause \u201cdelays\u201d in providing housing and services to the approximately 1,500 homeless people in the city.",
      "Candice Allison, 63, who said she had been homeless since Hurricane Ida destroyed her trailer in 2021, sorted through a mass of clothes and other items she hoped to salvage on Wednesday, fearing authorities would return to confiscate her possessions.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Trade Commission is accusing Deere & Co. of unfairly monopolizing the farm-equipment repair market",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Deere & Co. unfairly forces farmers to visit authorized dealers to repair their equipment, resulting in higher prices than if they could fix it themselves or get help from independent shops, the Federal Trade Commission claims in a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday with the attorneys general of Illinois and Minnesota.",
      "The Moline, Illinois-based manufacturer produces repair software that is available only to its dealers, making it impossible for owners to seek less-costly remedies, according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Rockford, Illinois.",
      "The action comes as the FTC has stepped up enforcement actions in the final days of President Joe Biden's administration. Deere & Co. said in a statement that the lawsuit was based on a \u201cflagrant misrepresentation of the facts and fatally flawed legal theories.\"",
      "The complaint claims that the \u201cunfair steering practice\u201d has boosted Deere's multibillion-dollar profits on agricultural equipment and parts while burdening practitioners \"who rely on affordable and timely repairs,\u201d FTC Chairperson Lina M. Khan said in a prepared statement.",
      "Khan said farmers should be \"free to repair their own equipment or use repair shops of their choice \u2014 lowering costs, preventing ruinous delays, and promoting fair competition.\u201d",
      "Farmers for decades were able to fix their tractors and combines themselves or take them to nearby repair shops. With increased computerization in the past few decades, Deere, the dominant industry player, made its high-tech repair tool available only to authorized dealers, who invariably eschew generic parts for higher-priced Deere parts, according to the FTC.",
      "The company refuses to share information with independent software developers that's necessary to build their own tools, a common practice in the automotive and trucking industries, the FTC said.",
      "Attorneys General Kwame Raoul of Illinois and Keith Ellison of Minnesota, both Democrats, joined in the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cDeere has made it virtually impossible for farmers themselves or independent repair shops to fully repair Deere equipment, which forces farmers to rely on authorized Deere dealers, which can be more expensive, slower, and for some a long distance away from farms,\u201d Ellison said in a statement.",
      "Deere & Co. asserted the FTC ignored the company's \u201clong-standing commitment to customer self-repair\u201d and announced an addition this week to its \u201csuite of digital solutions\u201d available for customers to do their own repairs.",
      "Deere Vice President Denver Caldwell said in a statement that the company was actively involved in settlement negotiations with the FTC and said it was still answering commission questions when the lawsuit hit.",
      "Those discussions \u201crevealed that the agency still lacked basic information about the industry and John Deere\u2019s business practices and confirmed that the agency was instead relying on inaccurate information and assumptions,\u201d Caldwell said.",
      "Public pressure for self-repair has grown. A 2023 \u201cright to repair\u201d law in Colorado forces manufacturers to provide manuals, software, tools and parts to farmers who want to get their tractors running again themselves.",
      "A similar law that year in Minnesota exempts farm equipment. The Minnesota Farmers Union has been pressing lawmakers to remove that exception, union president Gary Wertish said.",
      "The lawsuit, which the FTC approved on a 3-2 vote, fits a flurry of activity \u2014 issuing consumer refunds, taking enforcement actions against companies the agency accuses of deceptive practices and finalizing rules it deems necessary to make the marketplace fairer \u2014 leading up to Monday's inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Trump has named Andrew Ferguson, one of the FTC\u2019s five commissioners, to be the next chairperson. Ferguson joined Commissioner Melissa Holyoak in voting against the Deere lawsuit, saying it carries \"the stench of partisan motivation\u201d and was \u201ctaken in haste to beat President Trump into office.\u201d",

      "New York City has shuttered a sprawling tent complex erected on a remote former airport and announced the closure of other major shelters housing asylum seekers in its latest efforts to shrink an emergency housing built up in response to a surge of mig...",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City has shuttered a sprawling tent complex that housed hundreds of migrant families on a remote former airport in Brooklyn, as it shrinks the emergency shelter system built up in response to a surge from the southern border that has been steadily receding in recent months.",
      "The last of the roughly 2,000 people living on a windswept tarmac at Floyd Bennett Field, once the city\u2019s first airport, departed the gated encampment over the weekend, and crews were seen this week dismantling the hulking structure.",
      "Advocates had warned that the facility, which is built on leased federal land, could be vulnerable to immigration raids as President-elect Donald Trump takes office Monday.",
      "Jehinzo Gonzalez, a 47-year-old from Venezuela, said he, his wife and three sons were transferred to another nearby city-run shelter just a week before Christmas.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a more dignified place for the family. We have three rooms for the five of us. Comfortable beds, a private bathroom,\u201d he said in Spanish, marveling at the contrast between the hard cots they slept on in their single room in the airport tent camp since arriving in the country in October.",
      "New York City has seen more than 250,000 migrants arrive since the spring of 2022, but the numbers of new arrivals have declined for 27 straight weeks and is now at its lowest point in more than a year, Mayor Eric Adams' administration said.",
      "Roughly 50,000 migrants are currently being housed across roughly 200 temporary sites, down from nearly 70,000 migrants last January.",
      "But the steady drum of shelter closings and forced relocations have also forced many migrant families to upend their routines for work, schooling and other daily needs just as they are trying to establish a foothold in the city.",
      "Venezuelan migrant Gabriel Montillas said he now spends hours each day in transit, chaperoning his three young children to school in Brooklyn and rushing to make appointments after his family was recently moved from the now-closed Floyd Bennett Field encampment to a hotel in Queens.",
      "On Tuesday, he had just enough time after dropping off the kids to travel across Brooklyn to submit immigration paperwork at a government office.",
      "\u201cIf it were summer or something without such cold weather, it\u2019d be different,\u201d Montillas said in Spanish as bone-rattling wind whipped around the city Tuesday. \u201cBut at least for now it\u2019s too strong, very strong; it\u2019s difficult.\u201d",
      "Groups advocating for migrants also say more needs to be done to transition migrants to more permanent housing.",
      "Among the priorities should be ending controversial policies limiting the amount of time they\u2019re allowed to remain in a shelter to investing in better case management and legal assistance so migrants can secure immigration status and work permits, said Will Watts, a deputy executive director at the Coalition for the Homeless.",
      "Newly arrived migrants should also be brought into the city\u2019s traditional shelter system for the homeless so that they are no longer segregated and vulnerable to immigration enforcement, said Steph Rudolph, a staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society.",
      "Trump has promised a nationwide immigration crackdown, including mass deportations, when he officially takes office Monday.",
      "\u201cNow that the numbers are going down, the rationale for a separate system is no longer there,\u201d Rudolph said Wednesday. \u201cIt makes sense to bring everyone under the same system.\u201d",
      "Gonzalez said he worries about his family\u2019s future even as they were relieved to transfer out of the Floyd Bennett Field shelter.",
      "\u201cThey should respect the laws,\u201d he said of the incoming Trump administration, noting that he and his wife have already applied for asylum, have their working papers in order and are employed part-time at a local grocery. \u201cWe are doing everything as dictated by the laws of the country. We hope to God that everything goes well.\u201d",
      "More shelter closures are slated in the coming weeks as Adams\u2019 administration continues to shrink the shelter system. Another huge tent complex built on Randall\u2019s Island, an island park off Manhattan, has been steadily emptied of residents ahead of its scheduled closure next month.",
      "The administration on Friday also announced the closure of 10 other shelters, including one built in a complex of warehouses off a highway in Brooklyn that housed more than 3,300 single men at its peak.",
      "All told, the moves will reduce the city\u2019s migrant housing capacity by roughly 7,800 beds -- after accounting for a new, brick-and-mortar shelter being built in the Bronx to house more than 2,200 migrant men being transferred from the tent shelters earmarked for closure, according to the mayor\u2019s office.",

      "A Virginia man has pleaded not guilty in a federal case that accuses him of stockpiling the largest number of finished explosives in FBI history",
      "NORFOLK, Va. -- A Virginia man pleaded not guilty Wednesday in a federal case that accuses him of stockpiling the largest number of finished explosives in FBI history and using President Joe Biden\u2019s photo for target practice.",
      "Chained at his legs and wearing an orange jumpsuit, Brad Spafford, 36, said little beyond answering mostly \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d questions from a federal magistrate during his arraignment in U.S. District Court in Norfolk.",
      "The hearing focused mostly on setting a May 28 trial date, which is needed to give enough time to attorneys to review a vast trove of evidence.",
      "Rebecca Gantt, a federal prosecutor, told a judge that authorities are still analyzing evidence from the FBI's seizure of approximately 150 pipe bombs and other homemade devices at Spafford's home in Isle of Wight County, which is northwest of Norfolk.",
      "Most of the explosives were detonated on Spafford's property, requiring soil analyses, while some devices were taken to a lab for examination, Gantt said. She added that investigators were still going through Spafford's electronic devices, including a phone with 500,000 images on it, among other evidence.",
      "Spafford faces one count of possession of an unregistered destructive device and one count of possession of an unregistered short barrel rifle. Both are felony charges punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "One of Spafford's attorneys, Kenneth Woodward, mentioned to the judge that the National Firearms Act, under which Spafford is charged, does not define what is an explosive.",
      "Woodward declined to comment after Wednesday's hearing. But Spafford's attorneys have questioned whether the explosive devices found on his property were usable because \u201cprofessionally trained explosive technicians had to rig the devices to explode them.\"",
      "\u201cThere is not a shred of evidence in the record that Mr. Spafford ever threatened anyone and the contention that someone might be in danger because of their political views and comments is nonsensical,\u201d his defense lawyers wrote in a court filing after his arrest.",
      "The investigation into Spafford began in 2023 when an informant told authorities that Spafford was stockpiling weapons and ammunition, according to court documents. The informant, a friend and member of law enforcement, told authorities that Spafford was using pictures of the president for target practice and that \u201che believed political assassinations should be brought back,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Numerous law enforcement officers and bomb technicians searched the property on Dec. 17.",
      "Spafford stored a highly unstable explosive material in a garage freezer next to \u201cHot Pockets and frozen corn on the cob,\u201d according to court documents. Investigators also said they found explosive devices in an unsecured backpack labeled \u201c#NoLivesMatter.\u201d",
      "Spafford's attorneys had argued for his release as he awaits trial. But last week, a federal judge ruled he must stay in jail, writing that Spafford has \u201cshown the capacity for extreme danger.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Arenda L. Wright Allen noted in her ruling that Spafford lost three fingers in an accident involving homemade explosives in 2021, something she said his defense attorneys have not disputed.",
      "Defense attorneys had argued that that Spafford, who is married and a father of two young daughters, works a steady job as a machinist and has no criminal record.",
      "Defense attorney Jeffrey Swartz said at Spafford\u2019s detention hearing that investigators had gathered information on him since January 2023, during which Spafford never threatened anyone.",
      "\u201cAnd what has he done during those two years?\u201d Swartz said. \u201cHe purchased a home. He\u2019s raised his children. He\u2019s in a great marriage. He has a fantastic job, and those things all still exist for him.\u201d",
      "Investigators, however, said they had limited knowledge of the homemade bombs until an informant visited Spafford\u2019s home, federal prosecutors wrote in a filing.",

      "Zhu \u2014 who didn't testify at his trial \u2014 told the judge he'd been asked only to help locate Xu and hadn't known what was in store for the ex-official. The defendant said he'd been told Xu owed money.",

Several U.S. prosecutions have centered on China\u2019s \u201cOperation Fox Hunt,\u201d a nearly decade-old initiative that Beijing characterizes as a pursuit of fugitives abroad, including officials accused of corruption.",

      "Demetrius Terrence Frazier, 52, is scheduled to be executed Feb. 6 for the 1991 murder and rape of Pauline Brown. His attorneys in a Wednesday court filing asked a judge to block the execution unless the state makes changes to the protocol, such as giving him a sedative before the gas begins flowing. The court filing cited witness descriptions of the state\u2019s first three executions with nitrogen gas.",
      "\u201cThe data set for nitrogen hypoxia executions is small \u2014three \u2014 but provides clear results: Alabama\u2019s method does not work the way defendants claim and necessarily causes conscious suffocation, in violation of the Eighth Amendment,\u201d lawyers for Frazier wrote in the court filing.",
      "Alabama last year became the first state to carry out an execution with nitrogen gas. Three inmates were put to death using the new method last year. The method involves placing a respirator gas mask over the person\u2019s face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen.",
      "Media witnesses, including The Associated Press, described how the men shook on the gurney for the first minutes of their execution, followed by what appeared to be several minutes of periodic labored breaths with long pauses in between.",
      "The Alabama attorney general\u2019s office has not yet filed a response to the request to block the execution. The state previously asked a federal judge to dismiss Frazier\u2019s lawsuit over the execution method, arguing the movements exhibited by the inmates were not a sign of suffering.",

Frazier was among inmates who selected nitrogen gas as their preferred execution method, but at the time the state had not developed procedures for using the gas to carry out an execution.",
      "Frazier was convicted of killing Brown in her Birmingham apartment. Prosecutors said Frazier, while in police custody in Detroit on an unrelated charge, confessed to raping and shooting Brown after stealing about $80 from her purse.

      "Cobb County Superior Court Judge Jason D. Marbutt said in his February order that neither Jackson's niece and nephew nor their attorneys rebutted Jackson\u2019s claims or participated in the case after a May 2023 hearing, when they consented to a temporary protective order. The judge found the Andersons to be in default, accepting as true all of Jackson\u2019s allegations.",
      "After that ruling was issued, a new lawyer for the Andersons filed a motion in March to set aside that judgment and to dismiss the lawsuit, according to court filings. In a filing Tuesday, Jackson and the Andersons jointly asked the judge to throw out February's order, withdraw the Andersons' pending motions and enter a consent judgment.",
      "\u201cIn the meantime, the Parties have conducted two mediations and have reached a private agreement resolving this dispute,\u201d the filing says.",
      "Marbutt on Wednesday issued an order vacating his February ruling at the request of Jackson and his niece and nephew.",
      "That consent judgment finds in Jackson's favor on several counts and dismisses others, awards no damages either to Jackson or his niece and nephew and says the parties shall pay their own attorneys' fees. It also says the Andersons must not harass or intimidate Jackson and his wife and children and stay 500 yards (meters) away from them, except in certain circumstances, including court appearances, sporting events and family functions. The Andersons are also not to have any contact with Jackson and his wife and children.",
      "Jackson, 62, had alleged that the harassment began in 2022 and included threatening social media posts and messages, public allegations that put him in a false light. He also alleged that public disclosure of private information was intended to cause him severe emotional distress. With the help of an attorney, the Andersons demanded $20 million to stop. He said he feared for his own safety and that of his family."

      "Vought faced questions at his confirmation hearing over his tenure as director of the Office and Management and Budget during Trump's first term. He stressed that he would follow the law, even as he emphasized Trump\u2019s desire to overturn the 1974 Impoundment Control Act that requires congressional approval to rescind spending.",
      "Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., accused him of withholding $214 million in military aid for Ukraine in 2019, an event that led to Trump\u2019s first impeachment.",

      "As the hearings continued, Vought's answer changed somewhat when Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asked if he would approve the distribution of $3.8 billion in aid for Ukraine for its ongoing war against Russia.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to get ahead of the policy response of the incoming administration,\u201d said Vought, who in 2021 founded the Center for Renewing America, a conservative think tank.",
      "Blumenthal responded: \u201cI am astonished and aghast that someone in this responsible position would, in effect, say that the president is above the law.\u201d",
      "Still, in response to questions from Republican lawmakers, Vought did preview possible budget proposals by suggesting that spending cuts would be necessary to address persistent budget deficits that have pushed the publicly held national debt above $28 trillion.",
      "Vought, an architect of Project 2025, said the debt would leave future generations poorer as more and more tax dollars went to repayment.",
      "\u201cThe president ran on the issue of fiscal accountability, dealing with our inflation situation,\" he said, indicating that discretionary social programs could be targeted for cuts and that money could be saved if more people had jobs.",
      "In June, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog, evaluated increases in debt during the presidencies of Trump and President Joe Biden. The analysis found that Trump's policies had increased the debt by $8.4 trillion, while Biden's policies pushed up the debt by $4.3 trillion. Much of the additional debt was the consequence of responding to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.",

      "A North Carolina appeals court says the mother of a student killed while on a ride-along in a Highway Patrol cruiser can continue suing for gross negligence against the trooper who was driving",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- The mother of a North Carolina university student killed while on a ride-along in a Highway Patrol cruiser can continue suing for gross negligence the trooper who drove off the road during a high-speed chase, a state appeals court ruled Wednesday.",
      "By a 2-1 decision, judges on the intermediate-level state Court of Appeals reversed a trial court\u2019s ruling that dismissed the lawsuit filed on behalf of the late Michael Higgins seeking damages from Trooper Omar Romero Mendoza.",
      "One night in August 2020, Mendoza \u2014 known as Romero in patrol documents \u2014 drove through a curve on a Pitt County road after having been traveling over 110 mph (177 kph), striking a utility pole and two trees. Higgins, 22, an East Carolina University criminal justice major enrolled in a patrol internship program and inside the cruiser with Romero, died from his injuries.",
      "Lisa Higgins, the administrator of her son\u2019s estate, sued in 2022 both Romero and Trooper Brandon Cesar Cruz, who had suggested to her son that he ride with Romero when Cruz lacked the time to do so. Superior Court Judge William Wolfe dismissed in 2023 the lawsuit against both troopers. Cruz was removed from Lisa Higgins\u2019 appeal last year.",
      "Higgins had previously participated in two successful ride-alongs with other patrol officers. But neither Romero nor Cruz held the rank or the title to complete one \u2014 something that Higgins was apparently unaware of at the time, the majority opinion said.",
      "Romero and Higgins responded to the scene of where a car had driven off the road into a ditch. Cruz also responded to the scene and encouraged Romero to pursue in a high-speed chase an unidentified driver in the area observed with an alcohol odor on her breath, according to trooper statements.",
      "Romero activated his emergency lights and siren and with Higgins as a passenger accelerated the vehicle quickly to attempt to catch the driver. Romero stated at a deposition that he saw the suspect breaking to the left but believed the two-lane road that he was traveling on was straight. A patrol report determined Romero had violated patrol policy in how he initiated the \u201ctraffic enforcement response.\u201d",
      "Romero\u2019s lawyer argued that as a government official Romero was exempt from personal civil liability while pursuing a criminal suspect, and that the state Industrial Commission was where claims against a state employee's actions could be brought. Commission awards are capped.",
      "In the majority opinion, Court of Appeals Judge John Arrowood wrote that the speed limit exemption in a police pursuit did not protect an officer from the \u201cconsequence of a reckless disregard of the safety of others.\u201d And the evidence and testimony suggest there is a genuine issue of material fact that the trooper\u2019s action rose to the level of gross negligence, he added.",
      "\u201cIt should be for the jury to determine whether defendant Romero\u2019s actions were needless or manifested a reckless indifference to the rights of Michael,\u201d Arrowood wrote.",
      "Court of Appeals Judge Allegra Collins agreed with Arrowood. In a dissenting opinion, Court of Appeals Chief Judge Chris Dillon wrote that in the most favorable light for the plaintiff, the evidence doesn\u2019t show Romero acted with gross negligence.",
      "Though how Romero \u201cexercised his discretion in his pursuit of the suspected drunk driver may have been negligent, it did not rise to the level of \u2018wanton conduct,\u2019 done with \u2018corruption or malice,\u2019 \u201d Dillon added.",
      "The state Supreme Court could hear the case if requested.",
      "A lawyer representing Romero didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Jim White, an attorney representing Lisa Higgins, was pleased with Wednesday\u2019s ruling, saying too many legal cases had given extreme deference to officers for their actions while wearing a uniform and traveling with blue lights on.",
      "A jury trial would provide \u201cvindication\u201d to the Higgins family, White said, leading to an acknowledgement that \u201che never should have been in that car.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The UK economy returned to growth for the first time in three months, but the expansion was less than expected.",
      "The 0.1% uptick in November was driven by trade for pubs, restaurants and the construction industry, after it shrank in October and September.",
      "The figures come after recent turbulence in financial markets sent the UK's borrowing costs to the highest level for several years and the value of the pound down.",
      "But with tax rises coming into effect in April, the sluggish figures have fuelled further concerns that stagnant growth could persist in the UK for some time.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has been under pressure after the market turmoil threatened her economic plans, admitted the government had to \"do more to grow our economy\" as she reiterated her pledge to go \"further and faster\" to improve growth in order to boost living standards.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer added that growing the economy was \"always going to take time\", but said the return to growth in November was a \"step in the right direction\".",
      "November's economic figures were the first following Reeves's first Budget, in which she announced \u00a340bn worth of tax rises with hikes in the National Insurance rate and a reduction to the threshold for employers.",
      "How fast is the UK's economy growing?",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "Ahead of tax increases taking effect in April, businesses have repeatedly warned the extra costs they face, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could impact the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.",
      "In the three months to November, the economy is estimated to have shown no growth, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. It has only grown twice in the five months since Labour took office.",
      "Danni Hewson, AJ Bell head of financial analysis, said the bigger economic picture was one of an \"economy still stuck in the muck\", while Ben Jones, lead economist at the CBI business group which claims to represent 170,000 firms, said a \"mood of caution seems to have settled over UK businesses\".",
      "\"We've had a pretty gloomy start to this year,\" said Liz Martins, senior economist at HSBC. \"We're not in recession, but we're not doing much growing either.\"",
      "In a bid to turn the tide, Reeves will meet representatives from some of the country's biggest regulators later, including energy watchdog Ofgem and the Competitions and Markets Authority, to get ideas for growing the economy.",
      "Reeves is understood to have decided to meet them in-person rather than wait to read submissions, with a Treasury source describing the meeting as \"a kick up the backside\".",
      "The ONS said the construction and services sectors drove the marginal growth in November.",
      "Construction was led by new commercial developments, but Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at ONS, said production continued to decline across several manufacturing industries and oil and gas extraction companies.",
      "\"Services grew a little, with wholesaling, pubs and restaurants and IT companies all doing well, partially offset by falls in accountancy and business rental and leasing,\" she added.",
      "The ONS publishes figures on the economy every month. However, quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are considered more important.",
      "The pound fell following the data release, trading at $1.221, down 0.2% on the day. Long-term government borrowing costs remained stable.",
      "'Put the handbrake on'",
      "Adrian Haller, who runs the UK arm of Bruderer, a Swiss manufacturer that makes high speed presses, is preparing to open a new factory in Telford, Shropshire, after 10 years of planning.",
      "But he said the Budget \"put a dampener\" on the business, with some of his biggest customers more cautious after the rise in employer National Insurance contributions was announced.",
      "\"Consequently, they've reduced their interest in placing orders with companies like ours,\" he added.",
      "\"Everybody seems to have put the handbrake on,\" he said. \"All that I ask, is that the government listen to what we are trying to say, and the fact they've done too many changes too quickly - and it's making it difficult for us to survive.\"",
      "A growing economy usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises.",
      "When the economy is shrinking, it can lead to businesses cutting back on investment and jobs.",
      "Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said tax hikes announced in the chancellor's October Budget and \"global uncertainty\" around Donald Trump's potential tariffs on trade with the US had \"dragged the economy into stagnation\".",
      "The weaker-than-expected growth figures fuelled further expectations that the Bank of England will cut interest rates at its next meeting in February from 4.75% to 4.5%, especially after UK inflation unexpectedly dipped in December.",
      "But Mr Wood said the outlook for 2025 was brighter than the figures were showing for 2024.",
      "He said despite the tax rises on businesses coming in April, the economy should get a boost from Reeves \"recycling increased taxes into even more spending\" in 2025."

    "summary": "The Nordic nation doesn't require staff to work long hours and has a generous welfare system.",
    "story": [
      "Gabriel Hoces repeats a word seven times when he discusses what it's like to work in Denmark - \"trust\".",
      "\"No one is trying to micromanage you, or look over your shoulder,\" says Mr Hoces, who works for a tech firm in Copenhagen. \"Bosses aren't coming in to check if you put in eight or nine hours a day, as they mainly only care if you completed your projects.",
      "\"There's a lot of trust in Denmark in that way, and I don't feel a hierarchy at my job. It's all very democratic.\"",
      "It is no surprise to Mr Hoces, a married father of two young daughters, that Denmark is consistently among the top-five countries in the world for work-life balance rankings.",
      "Only 1.1% of Danes have to work 50 or more hours a week, according to the most recent global figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). That's a significantly lower proportion than the world average of 10.2%.",
      "By contrast, the figure for the UK is 10.8% and the US is 10.4%.",
      "Meik Wiking, author of the book The Art of Danish Living, has long regarded his home country as a shining example of what other countries should aspire to mimic with their workplace policies.",
      "\"Danes are actually happy at work,\" he tells the BBC. \"Almost 60% of Danes say they would continue to work if they won the lottery and became financially independent.\"",
      "Mr Wiking, who is also the boss of Danish think tank The Happiness Research Institute, shares several policies that help generate a strong work-life balance in Denmark.",
      "These include the right to a minimum five weeks of paid vacation per year, in addition to public holidays. In the UK most workers are entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid leave, but in the US it can be as low as  just 11 days.",
      "Denmark also offers a very generous six months of paid maternity and paternity leave. In the UK the father, or non-birthing partner, typically gets one to two weeks of paid leave.",
      "In the US there is only a federal guarantee of unpaid parental leave, although some states, such as California, now offer paid time away from work after the birth of a child. And federal employees can get 12-weeks of paid leave.",
      "Mr Wiking is another Dane who cites the concept of bosses trusting their employees to do the right thing. He uses the example of staff at the Tivoli Gardens amusement park in Copenhagen, where they follow the three-metre rule.",
      "The idea is that you are CEO of everything within a radius of three metres. \"If you see garbage within your three-metre radius you pick it up, and if you see a guest looking for something, you stop and ask them if you can help,\" says Mr Wiking.",
      "He adds that when staff take ownership of their own space it can help them feel empowered and appreciated, which goes a long way to contributing to a healthy sentiment about their workplace.",
      "Janine Leschke, a professor in the department of management, society and communication at the Copenhagen Business School, says Denmark is definitely \"not a work culture where you have to show up and be available all day, all evening, to show that you're working hard all the time\".",
      "Instead, she says flexibility during the workday gives employees the time they need to, say, pick up their children from school or day care. \"The day doesn't have to officially end at five or six, and that's appealing to a lot of Danes with kids.\"",
      "Mr Hoces has noticed how some employers in the US may expect their staff to be available over weekends, to answer the odd email or message. That kind of overtime doesn't fit with his outlook on a positive work-life balance.",
      "\"If I was expected to take calls on the weekend, that would be a huge red flag to me, and I would likely change jobs,\" he says. \"But so far that hasn't happened to me or anyone I know.\"",
      "Casper Rouchmann, a Copenhagen-based CEO and founder of tech firm SparkForce, says his relaxed leadership policy would be familiar to most Danes. \"You don't need to ask me to leave early,\" he says. \"No one takes advantage of my kindness.\"",
      "Mr Rouchmann adds that the element of trust is so ingrained in Danish culture, visitors to Denmark are often aghast at how far it can go. He also highlights Denmark's generous welfare state, and the fact that firms have to give financial compensation to staff who are made redundant.",
      "\"If you lose your job, the government is there to help,\" adds Mr Rouchmann.",
      "As much as other countries can learn from Denmark's work-life balance, he says it has some downsides. \"Some people can rely too much on that safety net, and it might say to them that they don't have to take real risks, which is why we can be less entrepreneurial compared to the US.\"",
      "Samantha Saxby, an American human resources expert, says Denmark has such a good work-life balance because the country \"prioritises collective well-being\".",
      "By contrast, she says the US \"has long emphasised individual achievement and ambition, which has driven tremendous innovation, but often at the cost of work-life balance\".",
      "Yet Ms Saxby, who is director of marketing for the US National Human Resources Association, says that companies in the US and elsewhere around the world may be finally following the lead of Denmark and the other equally happy Nordic nations.",
      "\"Progressive organisations are introducing benefits like unlimited paid time off, mental health days, and wellness programs, to encourage employees to prioritise self-care,\" she says. \"These measures not only alleviate pressure, but also demonstrate that employers value their workforce's overall well-being.",
      "\"More companies are recognising that well-rested and balanced employees bring fresh ideas, better problem-solving skills, and greater engagement.  Employees are beginning to feel empowered to take the time they need without sacrificing career growth.\"",

    "summary": "The marginal dip in UK inflation is unusually important and offers some respite to the chancellor.",
    "story": [
      "A marginal dip in the headline rate of inflation would not normally determine much, if anything.",
      "Inflation rising at 2.5% rather than 2.6% does not change much in big economics, nor in the cost of living squeeze felt by households. The fall is entirely accounted for by falls in hotel prices and a smaller-than-usual rise in airfares in December.",
      "But this unusually important 0.1% drop signals relief, and some respite for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, because of what underpins it.",
      "The underlying inflation numbers, which show where price pressures are going over the year, are what is most keenly watched by the Bank of England in terms of interest rate cuts.",
      "Core inflation, which strips out the direct impact of volatile energy and food prices is now at a four-year low, having dropped to 3.2% in December from 3.5%. Services inflation is at a two-year low of 4.4% after a chunky fall from 5%. This is the real positive news.",
      "For the real nerds, inflation in supply chains, including in services, also indicates muted inflationary pressures.",
      "So the inflationary picture in the UK can be cast in a rather different light. While no-one can predict exactly how the Bank of England will react, it clears away objections to an interest rate cut next month. The markets scrambled this morning to keep up, now back forecasting further rate cuts after February this year.",
      "UK inflation unexpectedly dips to 2.5% in December",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "However, there are two big uncertainties \u2013 whether President-elect Trump will bring in tariffs at the scale he has threatened, and how companies in the UK react to the forthcoming increase in National Insurance Contributions (NICs) in April and the rise in the minimum wage. A rise in energy prices which will hit bills is also predicted for April.",
      "Both tariffs and the forthcoming changes to NICs and the minimum wage may not end up being as problematic for the UK economy as some are warning.",
      "While some are expecting firms to raise prices as a result of the Budget changes, some companies may also choose to squeeze wages with lower-than-expected annual wage increases. The overall inflationary impact depends on how firms react and the truth is we don't know yet.",
      "Similarly Trump's tariffs are likely to be inflationary for the US and therefore affect US interest rates. But some at the Bank of England can see a scenario where cheaper tariff imports, for example from China, are diverted to the UK helping to rein in UK inflation.",
      "What actually happens is again uncertain but the outcome may be counterintuitive to what people expect.",
      "So the marginal fall in UK inflation can be seen as something of a firebreak, for now, popping something of the frothy hysteria seen over the past few weeks. Those shorting the UK on international markets will see that there is another side to this bet. UK inflation is in the middle of the G7 pack.",
      "That said, what has been called a global \"bond market tantrum\" remains in place, sensitive to every new piece of data. The UK government still has to convince on the detail of growth plans. It will mean fast-tracking infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies.",
      "Market borrowing rates remain at levels where the chancellor will probably need to course-correct spending plans with new cuts before Easter, in order to meet her self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "The shadow cast over inflationary prospects and so all markets by Donald Trump's unconventional trade policies looms large.",
      "The turbulence has not gone away. Inflation is likely to tick up again in the coming months. But right now headline and underlying inflation numbers in the UK all point in the right direction. It is a welcome safe harbour for now, but the seas remain choppy."

      "Currently only those who lose a child or a baby after 24 weeks are entitled to two weeks of paid leave. But a group of MPs is calling for the upcoming Employment Rights Bill to extend this to all pregnancy loss.",
      "A Department for Business spokesperson said losing a baby was \"incredibly difficult and we know many employers will show compassion and understanding in these circumstances.\"",
      "But Anna Malnutt said she went back to work three days after miscarrying: \"I just didn't really know how long was OK to take, and I felt like I needed to go back.\"",

      "Despite her boss being very supportive, she decided to go back to work three days after her first miscarriage, and it was recorded as sick leave.",

      "Even when an appointment is secured, the rising workload faced by doctors means those meetings can be shorter than either the doctor or patient would like.",
      "But Dr Deepali Misra-Sharp, a GP partner in Birmingham, has found that AI has alleviated a chunk of the administration from her job, meaning she can focus more on patients.",
      "Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference.",
      "\u201cUsually when I\u2019m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.\u201d",
      "She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her \u201ctwo to three minutes per consultation, if not more\u201d. She reels off other benefits: \u201cIt reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.\"",
      "With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure.",
      "A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015, according to the British Medical Association (BMA).",
      "Could AI be the solution to help GP\u2019s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout?",
      "Some research suggests it could. A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time.",
      "Meanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.",
      "One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.",
      "Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.",
      "\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.",
      "\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.",
      "\u201cI imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It\u2019s giving that colleague advice.\u201d",
      "He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. \u201cIt could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?\u201d",
      "But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?",
      "Mr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.",
      "\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d",
      "Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.",
      "\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.",
      "The AI is trained on published medical research papers.",
      "\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d",
      "She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.",
      "An AI report published by the BMA this year found that \u201cAI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency\u201d.",
      "In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.",
      "\"Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.\u201d",

      "The new drug has yet to be approved, but in small clinical trials has shown impressive efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",
      "It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery.",
      "\"We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,\" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. \"But we may be the furthest along the path.\"",
      "Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists.",
      "That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.",
      "Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.",
      "Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.",
      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",
      "\"That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,\" says Dr Meier. The next \u2013 and \"even bigger milestone\" \u2013 will be when they start to come out the other end.",
      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",

      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",
      "Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.",
      "To help to do that, last year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.",
      "It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.",
      "It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.",
      "Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.",
      "When that happens, says Dr Gibson, \"it'll be obvious to the world that this is the way to go\"."

      "New Mario Kart?",
      "No price or release date was revealed, but the company will release further details during a showcase on 2 April.",
      "The company also repeated one of the few pieces of official information known prior to the reveal - that the new console will be backwards-compatible.",

      "Sales of the Switch marked a massive turnaround in Nintendo's hardware fortunes.",
      "The Wii U - its follow-up to the enormously successful Wii - was widely seen as a flop, and some analysts even predicted the company could follow former rival Sega into becoming a software publisher at the time.",

      "Although the console was less powerful than the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, Nintendo produced a number of \"must-have\" games in-house, including new entries in the Mario and Legend of Zelda franchises.",
      "And, like other games companies, it got a boost during the Covid-19 pandemic, with cosy, escapist life sim Animal Crossing: New Horizons proving a runaway hit.",
      "Is Switch 2 a guaranteed hit?",
      "Nintendo suffered from \"second album syndrome\" with the 2012 Wii U, where its smash hit console was followed by a comparative failure.",
      "BBC Newsbeat previously spoke to George Osborn, consultant and author of the Video Games Industry Memo newsletter about his predictions for the Switch 2.",
      "He said plenty of keen gamers would rush out to buy the console as soon as it launched.",
      "But, he said: \"Nintendo has managed to establish a very strong audience of families buying consoles.\"",
      "If the Switch 2 wasn't seen as a significant technological step up, George said, the challenge will be convincing the more casual audience to upgrade from the original.",
      "\"I think there'll be a lot of families who are going, 'Well, I'm perfectly happy with this family device, it serves my needs, I can keep up on this,\" he said.",

      "Valve, owner of the huge PC game Steam store, has sold millions of its \"handheld PC\" Steam Deck, and Sony and Microsoft are also reported to be looking into releasing portable gaming devices.",
      "Analyst George says there is more competition for the core gaming audience than there was in 2017.",
      "\"So there is that question about whether the Switch 2 can be enough of a step up to convince people who've maybe dipped into a Steam Deck as well to go, 'yes, I want to buy a Switch 2 to go alongside it',\" said George.",
      "Matching the sales of the original Switch will be a tall order, but it's fairly safe to assume demand will be high when it's released.",
      "The launches of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles - during a global microchip shortage - were marred by scalpers hoovering up the few consoles that were available.",

    "title": "BBC hopes new Match of the Day hosts are a winning team",
    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:56:14 GMT",
    "summary": "Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan have been announced as the three new presenters of the show.",
    "story": [
      "After 60 years, Match of the Day is abandoning its sole presenter format and taking on three people who will, in turn, host the show. It is a departure, but it is far from a new strategy in TV.",
      "Match of the Day has, extraordinarily, had just five main presenters in its history - with Gary Lineker being in the hot seat for the past 26 years.",
      "His replacements, who will take over the BBC One football highlights show next season, are all broadcasters rather than sports stars who have taken up broadcasting as a second career.",
      "Lineker and, before him in the 70s and 80s, Jimmy Hill, were examples of former players who were comfortable taking the lead in the studio, but they were more an exception than a rule when it comes to hosting sports programmes.",
      "New Match of the Day presenters announced",
      "New Match of the Day presenters announced",
      "There was speculation that footballer-turned-broadcaster Alex Scott would take over the show - but in the end, the names in the press release are all stalwarts of decades of live broadcasting.",
      "The person who might be less familiar to the BBC TV audience is Kelly Cates. But the daughter of Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish has 26 years' experience of live TV and radio on Sky and 5 Live. She knows football and she knows television.",
      "Likewise, Gabby Logan has been presenting for 30 years. And Mark Chapman has 29 years under his belt and is already the face of Match of the Day 2 on Sundays.",
      "By choosing three new hosts, the BBC is following a pattern in TV where a brand or format becomes less associated with a single name.",
      "When Richard Osman decided to leave Pointless, six people were named as his replacements for the daily show (and another eight for the series after that).",
      "Angus Deayton's presenting role on Have I Got News For You became an ever-changing roster of weekly visitors to the presenting chair.",
      "The One Show may have a core of four main presenters, but the list of people who have over the years done a stint on the green sofa is a long one.",
      "Match of the Day has now been handed over to some very safe hands.",
      "And based on their track records, none of them look likely to attract the sorts of headlines that Lineker has had in recent years.",
      "There is good reason to be careful. At a time when TV ratings have been falling year after year, Match of the Day has been holding steady.",
      "In an era when every Premier League match is televised somewhere and social media is awash with clips of goals as soon as they happen, there was always a question about whether anyone would still want to watch a highlights show.",
      "However, over the past five years, Match of the Day's audience of just under 3.5 million has remained almost unchanged. Over a season, the BBC says 33 million people will tune in at some time to one of the Match of the Day programmes.",
      "The resilience of Match of the Day has not gone unnoticed, and with the current rights deal due to continue until the 2028/29 season, this is a brand the BBC hopes to grow.",
      "There have been reports that the corporation will use the shake-up as an opportunity to use the MOTD name more widely on its online platforms.",
      "Given that the BBC has struggled to compete in an era of rapidly escalating costs for sports rights, it dearly wants to hang on to an audience that may not consume at lot of the rest of the BBC's output.",
      "There is also a good reason the Premier League wants the highlights programme to succeed - about half of the league's domestic TV audience see their football only on the BBC.",
      "It is a shop window that helps keep top flight football central to the national conversation.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:09:20 GMT",
    "summary": "The turbulent life of one of the globally famous Nolan Sisters singing group.",
    "story": [
      "Linda Nolan and her singing sisters lived in the spotlight after their career-defining hit I'm In The Mood For Dancing in 1979 - meaning both their highs and lows were played out in public.",
      "The close-knit group, the original sisters - Linda, Anne, Denise, Maureen and Bernie (Coleen was initially too young) - had been on the music scene since 1974 and went on to become one of the biggest British groups of the late 70s and early 80s.",
      "The Nolans scored seven UK top 20 hits, including their most famous song, which reached number three in 1980.",
      "They also built up a big international following - particularly in Japan. And they went on tour with Frank Sinatra.",
      "Singer Linda Nolan dies aged 65",
      "Singer Linda Nolan dies aged 65",
      "All this came with a sugary disco image and catchy bubblegum songs, also including Spirit, Body and Soul, Don't Make Waves and Don't Love Me Too Hard.",
      "\"For all its formulaic superficial corniness, I'm In The Mood For Dancing is a definite uplifting shiny-minded pop song,\" music journalist Paul Morley told BBC News.",
      "\"[It was] efficiently custom built for parties, Top of the Pops and weddings, and with a longevity you would not have seen coming at the time.\"",
      "'Importance of hard work'",
      "After some line-up changes, Linda left the group in 1983 to pursue a solo career, mainly in musical theatre - and with a good degree of success.",
      "Her most memorable role was in the West End production of Blood Brothers. Then there were regular TV appearances, including a notorious turn on 2014's Celebrity Big Brother, where she came face-to-face with her long-time adversary, comedian Jim Davidson.",
      "But, as the years went on, showbusiness seemed to be overshadowed for Linda and her siblings by a personal and family life marked by turmoil, tragedy and the breakdown of sisterly bonds.",
      "Linda was born in Ireland before her parents Tommy and Maureen Nolan, a husband-and-wife singing duo, moved the family to Blackpool in 1962 in search of work. There were eight Nolan offspring - six girls and two boys. All the girls sang and were performing from an early age.",
      "The Nolan girls found themselves on a treadmill of performances in nightclubs, on TV and on tours. Their fees paid the family bills.",
      "Their father doubled as their manager and would wait in the bar before taking them home in the early hours of a school day.",
      "\"The importance of hard work was drummed into us at an early age,\" Linda told The Telegraph in 2018. \"My attitude has always been that unless I'm on a stretcher, the show must go on.\"",
      "But, as it emerged much later, their father, an alcoholic and womaniser, was sexually abusing his eldest daughter, Anne. He was frequently violent, too. Tommy Nolan died aged 78 in 1998. Anne unloaded her secret in her 2008 autobiography.",
      "\"It must have been difficult for Anne all those years because everybody loved our father, absolutely loved him,\" Linda said in an interview with The Guardian.",
      "\"She must have been seething. People say it was probably cathartic for her to write the book, and I'm sure it was.\"",
      "The girls were \"spotted\" at a Blackpool gig in 1973 and signed a recording contract, but their big break came in 1978 when they got a deal with Epic Sony-CBS.",
      "So began the hits, world tours and regular appearances on TV shows from Top of the Pops to Morecambe and Wise.",
      "The Nolans sold 25 million albums globally but very little of the profits ended up in the girls' pockets, their father having failed to appreciate he could negotiate a bigger pay deal.",
      "In 1979, Linda met Brian Hudson, a former musician, and they married in 1981 despite the reservations of her parents over the 13-year age gap and Brian's history of two divorces. Brian also became The Nolans' tour manager.",
      "\"But when the other girls decided that my husband Brian wasn't right as their tour manager, I was devastated and opted to launch a solo career instead,\" Linda told The Telegraph later.",
      "She left with a cheque for \u00a313,000 - but then a tax bill came in for the same amount.",
      "Linda's solo career, managed by Brian, first saw her make guest appearances on TV and on the tours of such diverse names as Gene Pitney and Cannon and Ball.",
      "She also did her fair share of pantomimes before her musical theatre career kicked off with a part alongside Paul O'Grady in Prisoner Cell Block H: The Musical.",
      "The financial blows flared up again in 1995 when she and Brian were declared bankrupt. They were saved when a newspaper then paid Linda \u00a317,000 to tell her story.",
      "She put their money problems down to the \"feast or famine\" nature of showbiz.",
      "'Stabbed in the back'",
      "In 2000, Linda landed her most successful role, in Willy Russell's Blood Brothers, taking over as Mrs Johnstone from her younger sister Bernie.",
      "But it was also at the start of the 2000s that Linda's world, and that of her family, began to fall apart.",
      "First Anne was told she had breast cancer, then Brian was diagnosed with cancer of the skin. A year later, Linda was told she too had breast cancer.",
      "Anne recovered, and it was while Linda was undergoing treatment that she lost her husband of 26 years, a blow that left her contemplating suicide.",
      "\"He was the love of my life... I lost hope of ever being happy again and started thinking, as people do when they reach a certain point in depression, it would be better for everybody if I wasn't here and I would be doing them a favour,\" she revealed in early 2018.",
      "She was given the all-clear from cancer in 2006 but, too depressed to work, she started claiming benefits.",
      "Then in 2009 came a financial lifeline when Maureen, Linda, Bernie and Coleen were offered the chance of a reunion tour to celebrate the 30th anniversary of I'm In The Mood For Dancing.",
      "The tour went well but, on the family front, things turned decidedly sour. Anne declared she had been \"stabbed in the back\" by her siblings.",
      "\"No-one asked me. No-one involved me at all until it was too late. Now they've made it clear I am not wanted,\" she told The Daily Mail.",
      "The sisters claimed the decision had been the record company's and out of their hands. It caused a further rupture in the already fractured family relationship.",
      "Financial blows",
      "But the next year, the sisters attempted to come together to support Bernie, who was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a mastectomy and chemotherapy and was given the all-clear. But in 2012 the cancer returned, leading to her death aged 52.",
      "The sisters' truce came to an end soon afterwards.",
      "In 2014, Linda's financial problems returned when she was investigated by Blackpool council and the Department for Work and Pensions for claiming benefits to the tune of \u00a312,000 while working.",
      "\"I thought I'd stuck to the rules religiously, but some of the things they thought of as 'work' just hadn't occurred to me. I thought working meant doing a stage show, not quick television interviews,\" she told The Telegraph.",
      "She came up with a repayment plan and eventually was issued with a caution.",
      "That same year, Linda went into the Celebrity Big Brother house (reportedly because she needed the money), an experience that led to her telling torrid tales about her sex life and coming to verbal blows with Davidson.",
      "The two had been enemies since the 90s, when Brian had been caught stealing money from Davidson's friend and fellow comedian Frank Carson.",
      "As sister Coleen became a panellist on ITV's Loose Women, Linda also became a regular guest.",
      "And it was on that show in 2017 that a tearful Coleen told viewers her sister's cancer had returned, and this time was terminal.",
      "Linda had resumed her stage work but then, with the second diagnosis, she stopped. In March 2023, she confirmed that the cancer had spread to her brain.",
      "But as she made clear in her autobiography From My Heart - released in 2018 - she refused to spend the time she had left to live \"constantly stressing about cancer\".",
      "She added: \"I've chosen to enjoy the little things. I've chosen to laugh. And I've chosen to look back on my life and thank God for it.\""

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 02:02:26 GMT",
    "summary": "The world-famous street artist taught art lessons with local children in the 1990s.",
    "story": [
      "For years people have tried - and failed - to uncover details about Bristol's most famous, yet anonymous, graffiti artist Banksy.",
      "Photos of him and stories of people who have met him are incredibly rare. But now a man who got the secretive artist to work with children at a youth club in the late 1990s has given the BBC an exclusive insight into the man behind the murals, just as he was about to become famous.",
      "Banksy is one of the world's most famous graffiti artists. His work has sold for millions of pounds and his exhibitions seen by hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "But behind layers of paint, lost in time at a Bristol youth club, there's a Banksy very few people know about.",
      "On the cusp of international fame, the artist was leaving his mark - not only on the streets of his city, but on young people in Lawrence Weston.",
      "Here, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural.",
      "\"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building.",
      "\"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\"",
      "When Banksy came to Lawrence Weston youth centre",
      "Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous.",
      "The artist would return to the club several times to create new works, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds \u2013 oblivious to who the artist would eventually become.",
      "It was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol.",
      "His friend had a suggestion \u2013 someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself. That person was Banksy.",
      "\"I got his phone number, so I used to call him up and ask if he'd come and do some art projects. He was really keen,\" Peter said.",
      "This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police.",
      "What do we know about Banksy?",
      "Campaign to save building home to early Banksy art",
      "Banksy's Girl with Balloon print sells for \u00a380,000",
      "Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids.",
      "The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub.",
      "\"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society.",
      "\"It was always very vibrant.\"",
      "Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \"nobody thought twice about who he was\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston.",
      "He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said.",
      "\"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego. He was doing art with them, rather than doing art for them,\" he said.",
      "\"In the morning, he sat around a table with the children, talking about their ideas.",
      "\"Then they would all just muck in and spray these things that were invented.",
      "\"It wasn't more Banksy than the young people, it was definitely a kind of 50/50 thing.\"",
      "And how much did it cost to bring in Banksy?",
      "\"For the first one [workshop], I think we paid him \u00a350. Probably only covered the cost of the spray paints back then,\" Peter said.",
      "\"I don't think he's ever been in it for the money. It shows what a deep, kind and caring person he is.\"",
      "The murals Banksy created with the children were fun and vivid in colour \u2013 but with meaning.",
      "Cows looking up as bombs are dropped above them, which Peter believes was a nod to climate anxiety, while another was more obscure - a circus overrun by robots.",
      "'I painted over a Banksy'",
      "But what happened to these murals? They were painted over. Again and again.",
      "\"I personally painted over a Banksy. I threw a Banksy stencil away when I was clearing up,\" Peter said.",
      "But he is not one to get sentimental about preserving street art.",
      "\"I have no regrets at all [covering them up]. Back then, it was much more about working with and engaging young people.",
      "\"And it was just another art project back then.\"",
      "For Peter, the value of Banky's time at the club is not monetary, but based on what these murals did for the community.",
      "He wonders if the children remember creating pieces with a man who is now one of the most famous artists in the world.",
      "\"I'm very proud he came here,\" he said.",
      "\"There will be [those who were] young people in the local community who are parents now who worked with Banksy, and they may not know that.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:59:47 GMT",
    "summary": "As Love Island All Stars returns, we find out if reality stars can still have a lucrative social media career.",
    "story": [
      "The cast of this year's Love Island All Stars, a spin-off featuring former contestants, has been described as \"dating royalty\" by its makers.",
      "More than half of the 12 islanders heading to the South African villa were finalists on their respective series, while 2022 winner Ekin-Su C\u00fclc\u00fclo\u011flu is also rumoured to be entering later on.",
      "Appearing on Love Island was once seen as a route to independent fame and success.",
      "But could the return of names from some of the show\u2019s most popular series be a sign that the once-profitable pipeline from Islander to influencer or TV star is coming to an end?",
      "Becoming an influencer is a well-worn career path for those leaving Love Island, and past contestants have been paid by brands to sell everything from cosmetics to cars to social media users.",
      "Perhaps the highest achiever in this role has been 2019 series runner-up Molly-Mae Hague, who went on to work as a creative director for fast fashion brand Pretty Little Thing, and has recently launched her own fashion company.",
      "But Molly-Mae appeared on Love Island at the peak of its popularity. The episode in which she and Tommy Fury lost out to winners Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea is still the show's most watched ever, attracting over six million viewers.",
      "Hitting these heights isn't possible for every former cast member, something more recent contestant Tanyel Revan believes aspiring influencers need to be aware of.",
      "\"One thing about this industry that people have to remember is that if you don't maintain it 24/7, which is very hard because it is a bit of a fake lifestyle, you can easily be forgotten,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"I think a lot of influencers go back on All Stars because they need to keep up and have that boost,\" she adds.",
      "Tanyel, 28, appeared on a winter series of the show in 2023, when interest was still high (its final was watched by over a million people), but not at the levels Molly-Mae experienced in 2019.",
      "The hairdresser says while she has earned some \"extra income\" from social media influencing, the haircare company she started before entering the villa is what gives her \"stability\".",
      "\"I am a businesswoman who has got my own salon,\" Tanyel adds.",
      "'It's very saturated'",
      "A lot has changed since Love Island first aired in its current form in 2015. More than 300 people have now appeared on the UK edition of the show - being an ex-Islander is no longer an exclusive club.",
      "For a while, finalists enjoyed rumoured six-figure brand deals with fast fashion companies and sponsored Instagram posts that could earn them thousands.",
      "But according to social media expert and co-founder of Sloane House Marketing, Bryleigh Flack, the appetite for this type of content no longer exists.",
      "\"The way we digest content is completely different to how we did even five years ago,\" she says.",
      "\"There are so many adverts, not even just influencer ads but when you are scrolling, even through your friends' [Instagram] stories, you're hit with them, it's very saturated,\" she says.",
      "Bryleigh says big-brand partnerships used to be the best way to make money, but \"appealing to the masses\" is no longer the best strategy for influencers, thanks to newer platforms like TikTok, which use a different algorithm to choose content for users.",
      "She says there is a new type of content creator in 2025 - the \"micro influencer\" - who may not have loads of followers, but has a really engaged and specific audience.",
      "These creators \"really hone in on their audience and know them\", she adds. \"For example, mums with young families or girls that love to go out every weekend, they're completely different people so trying to market to them both won't work.\"",
      "'Just being good looking is not going to get you much'",
      "Billy Brown, who appeared on series eight of Love Island in 2022, says many of the people he was on the show with saw it as an easy route to becoming an influencer.",
      "\"I know a lot of people who came out, quit their job and thought that's it now, but it's not.",
      "\"You can earn a lot of money from that show but if you don't do well, it's not the case,\" says the 25-year-old, who entered the main villa after impressing fellow contestant Tasha Ghouri in second villa Casa Amor.",
      "Billy, who owns businesses in construction and property development, says that days after leaving the show, he was \"getting up at half four in the morning [for work] and then going to a movie premiere at night\".",
      "\"I didn't let it get to my head, I think I was one of the only people who could say 'look, it's not all glitz and glam',\" he adds.",
      "Billy has maintained a social media presence in the years since, featuring content on his construction work alongside more lifestyle and sports-focused material.",
      "He says he still earns some money from influencing but thinks that's due to his personality, rather than his follower count, a relatively modest 115,000. In contrast, Molly-Mae has over eight million.",
      "\"People [who go on the show] need to focus on what they like, instead of just being known for being on Love Island.",
      "\"You have to have something about you, just being good looking is not going to get you much,\" he adds.",
      "'People would do adverts for every single company'",
      "Love Island's cultural relevance has become a topic of conversation in recent years due to falling viewing figures.",
      "At the show's peak in 2019, it achieved an average of nearly six million viewers, with more recent series in 2023 and 2024 attracting around one to two million.",
      "With the reality TV dating genre's recent boost from Netflix shows such as Love is Blind, The Ultimatum and Too Hot to Handle, audiences now have more options than ever at their disposal.",
      "Jake Lee, who runs Alpha Talent Group, represents stars from across sport, entertainment and social media.",
      "He manages boxer Tommy Fury and sports presenter Mac Griffiths (known as Michael on Love Island), who both appeared on the aforementioned 2019 series of the show.",
      "\"People would come off a show and do adverts for every single company, because these companies would want to take advantage of the quick exposure they could get,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"But four or five months down the line you'd be harming your own career, because you'd used your platform the wrong way and there'd be no credibility there,\" he adds.",
      "Jake says more recent reality TV contestants have learnt a lot from the mistakes of their predecessors, who were leaving shows with no real strategy.",

      "Pop star Chappell Roan has won BBC Radio 1's Sound of 2025 \u2013 the station's annual poll to identify music's biggest rising stars.",
      "Her win caps a wild 12 months in which she rocketed from relative obscurity to the top of the charts, thanks to her colourful, 80s-influenced brand of synth-pop.",
      "She was named winner by a panel of more than 180 musicians and experts, including Sir Elton John, Dua Lipa and Sound of 2014 winner Sam Smith.",
      "Jack Saunders, who hosts Radio 1's New Music show, said: \"No one deserves this accolade more than Chappell Roan. She was the most exciting artist of the last 12 months and is now set to be the artist of the next 12 months.\"",
      "An exclusive interview with the singer will be published by Radio 1 and BBC News in the coming weeks.",
      "The 26-year-old has had a long path to success.",
      "Born Kayleigh Amstutz, she was brought up in the conservative city of Willard, Missouri, where she attended church three times a week and was taught that being gay was a sin.",
      "She signed her first record deal in 2017, based on the strength of a song she had uploaded to YouTube called Die Young.",
      "Cast as a singer-songwriter in mould of Lorde and Lana Del Rey, she failed to make much of an impact, and was dropped by her label during the pandemic.",
      "But by that stage, she had already recorded a song that would become her calling card.",
      "Titled Pink Pony Club, it was inspired by a visit to an LA gay club, and helped her define a new sound - camp, liberated and packed with singalong choruses.",
      "The experience also spawned her campy stage persona, which she has described as a \"larger-than-life, drag queen version of myself\".",
      "After finding a new record label, she released her debut album, The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess, in September 2023.",
      "A slow-burning success, it only sold a few thousand copies in its first week of release. But word began to spread - and when she played California's Coachella Festival last April, the crowd that turned up for her mid-afternoon set was huge.",
      "More importantly, the show was broadcast on YouTube - going viral after Roan  leaned into the TV cameras and declared: \"I'm your favourite artist's favourite artist.\" The performance has subsequently been watched more than a million times.",
      "Around the same time, she released a stand-alone single called Good Luck, Babe, that talked about her experience of falling in love with her best friend.",
      "\"It's a pop song with a sad element to it,\" she told BBC News last year.",
      "\"It's very common in queer relationships, when someone is still coming to terms with their queerness, [that] they'll kiss 100 boys to 'stop the feeling', as the song says.",
      "\"And it's like, 'Sure, OK. Your time will come.'\"",
      "The single eventually reached number two in the UK charts, and The Rise And Fall Of The Midwest Princess became a number one album after it was re-released on vinyl last summer.",
      "Since then, Roan has been nominated for six Grammy awards, including album of the year, and won best new artist at the Billboard Music Awards in December.",
      "She has also experienced the downside of her sudden fame, and spoke out about the \"creepy behaviour\" of certain fans who \"yelled\" and \"harassed\" her at private moments; and who had approached her family and friends.",

    "story": [
      "Thousands of people braved sub-zero temperatures to watch an open-air spectacle starring magician Steven Frayne, formerly known as Dynamo, a 10-year-old rapper and a dozen aerial dancers to launch Bradford's year as UK City of Culture.",
      "Frayne told the audience he started his career performing street magic in City Park, where the opening ceremony was held, and that his home city was \"going to make its mark on the world\" in 2025.",
      "Organisers said about 10,000 people turned out to watch the show, which took place in temperatures of -3C (26.6F).",
      "Bradford is the fourth UK City of Culture, a title that is awarded every four years.",
      "The scheme is designed to boost the chosen city's visitor numbers, economies and reputations, and Bradford's year has received \u00a315m government funding.",
      "Other events will include the Turner Prize, a national drawing project inspired by Bradford-born artist David Hockney, and an exhibition about the parallels between boxing and calligraphy.",
      "Frayne said headlining Friday's opening ceremony \"means more than I could ever put into words\".",
      "\"To be in a place where there's a massive stage put right in the centre for people to come and share in some amazement, that's a dream come true, it genuinely is,\" he told BBC News beforehand.",
      "\"I'm super proud to be from Bradford. It wasn't necessarily the easiest place to grow up... so to be a small, tiny part of this [celebration], it's just incredible.\"",
      "The opening show, titled Rise, involved a cast of 200 including 10-year-old rapper Cruzy T plus poets, musicians and dancers alongside Frayne, with a theme of warts-and-all pride, unity, diversity and overcoming adversity.",
      "On the two stages, scaffold towers formed stacks of boxes containing the performers, as slogans and visuals of the city and its people were projected onto the front.",
      "Projections were also used to transform the towers into Frayne's childhood home, with a young actor playing Frayne as a boy before the real magician enlisted the crowd to take part in a series of tricks.",
      "The show will be staged again on Saturday.",
      "As it happened: Relive the opening ceremony",
      "As it happened: Relive the opening ceremony",
      "Bradford 2025 creative director Shanaz Gulzar said the opening event was intended to show that Bradford and the UK were \"incredibly diverse, representative, resilient and strong, and capable of doing magical, impossible things\".",
      "She hopes this year will give pride to Bradfordians, bring in more investment and show a new side to the city.",
      "\"There's particular press and a particular image of Bradford, which isn't true,\" she said.",
      "\"Every city in the UK has flashpoints, has challenges, and you need to give places space and time in order to navigate and come through them,\" she said.",
      "\"We are more than one flashpoint, we are more than one moment in time, we are more than our challenges - we are also our opportunities.\"",
      "Gulzar said being City of Culture had attracted funding to allow the National Science and Media Museum to have a \u00a36m refurbishment.",
      "It reopened this week after 18 months and is staging an exhibition of a selection of Hockney's video and photography works. Meanwhile, the Hockney-inspired drawing project will run throughout the year.",
      "Other highlights will include a tribute to Bradford playwright Andrea Dunbar, a season of films by working-class northern women, the installation of a new 15m (50ft) sculpture in the city centre, and an exhibition of striking surrealist photos by Ethiopian photographer Aida Muluneh.",
      "That exhibition will then tour to Cardiff, Belfast and Glasgow, the first time a City of Culture event has travelled to all four nations of the UK.",
      "Gulzar said winning the City of Culture title had also been instrumental in attracting a new Brit School, which has trained stars including Adele and Tom Holland. It is expected to open in 2027.",
      "However, the title has not worked its magic on everything in Bradford's cultural scene.",
      "The former Bradford Odeon, next to the site of Friday's launch event, had been due to reopen as a music venue for the City of Culture year after a \u00a350m refurbishment.",

    "title": "Rise of vaccine distrust - why more of us are questioning jabs",
    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 00:01:55 GMT",
    "summary": "Confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a hit. The question is why, and what can be done about it?",
    "story": [
      "Covid vaccines saved lives. Lots of them. Research by the World Health Organization (WHO) now puts the number at 475,000 in the UK with many more kept out of hospital or off a ventilator.",
      "The jabs were a \"scientific miracle\" we were told at the time, our best hope of life returning to normal after months of lockdown restrictions. But something has happened in the years since. Research suggests confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a significant hit.",
      "\"It's the great paradox of the pandemic,\" says Dr Simon Williams, a public health researcher at Swansea University.",
      "\"One of the most successful innovations in public health history, the rapid development of Covid vaccines, has actually had the effect of reducing public confidence in vaccination.\"",
      "In 2023 around 70% of UK adults said that vaccinations were safe and effective, down sharply from 90% in 2018, according to research from the Vaccine Confidence Project, run by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).",
      "This is very much part of a worldwide trend with 52 of the 55 countries polled seeing a drop in confidence since 2019.",
      "And regular polling carried out by YouGov suggests adults are increasingly likely to say that vaccines have harmful side effects that are not being disclosed to the public. The proportion saying that statement is \"probably\" or \"definitely\" true rose to 30% in 2024 from 19% in 2019.",
      "At the same time, childhood vaccination rates have fallen further below recommended levels over the last five years, continuing a longer-term trend.",
      "\"Vaccines are always our best defence against infectious, communicable diseases,\" adds Dr Williams. \"A few percentage drops in the proportion of children covered can make a real difference.\"",
      "So why is there increased distrust in vaccination - and can anything be done to change that?",
      "The sudden 'sea change' in attitudes",
      "The long-running Covid inquiry has already looked at pandemic planning and the impact on the NHS. This week, though, it opened hearings into the vaccine rollout across the UK, from take-up of the jabs, to their safety, to the way they were marketed to the public.",
      "Dr Helen Wall, a GP from Bolton, saw the shift in vaccines attitudes over the pandemic first-hand.",
      "In May 2021 the town became the centre of national attention; Covid infections  more than quadrupled in three weeks driven by the new Delta variant. A huge vaccine drive was ordered with army medics staffing mobile units. Dr Wall led the rollout, as clinical director of the local NHS commissioning board.",
      "\"People were coming out and making tea and coffee for people in the line,\" she says. \"There was this real feeling of camaraderie.\"",
      "But around the middle of 2021, she noticed a sudden \"sea change\" in attitudes.",
      "\"Patients would start to say to me, 'why should I trust you, you work for them, you're being paid by them, you're part of the government'.",
      "\"We very quickly went from being lifesavers to just another part of the system that no-one trusted in some spheres.\"",
      "Before long, protestors appeared outside local clinics with placards trying to convince people not get jabbed, and Dr Wall says that she received death threats.",
      "Nearly four years on, she reflects: \"I think what Covid has done is amplified a confidence issue that was already there and ramped up some of the doubts and question-marks for people.\"",
      "From smallpox to MMR",
      "But vaccine hesitancy certainly did not start with the pandemic. The current wave of scepticism is the latest rekindling of an angry debate going back to the dawn of vaccination in 1796 when Edward Jenner created the smallpox vaccine.",
      "In the 1890s huge crowds protested in Leicester against mandatory smallpox vaccinations. Then in the 1970s the diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough jab was linked to brain injury in children, before later being found safe.",
      "In 1998 British doctor Andrew Wakefield published his now infamous research paper falsely claiming the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was responsible for rising rates of autism in children.",
      "Wakefield's research, described as the most damaging scientific fraud of all time, has since been thoroughly discredited and he was struck off the doctors' register.",
      "But the damage was done. The number of measles cases in England and Wales jumped to 2,032 in 2012 from just 56 in 1998. It took more than a decade for MMR uptake to return to anything like normal and that debunked link with autism still gets repeated today.",
      "It was the first serious medical scandal of the internet era and also a sign of things to come.",
      "Internet age and misinformation",
      "Since the birth of social media in the early 2000s, with sites like Friendster and MySpace, there have been growing concerns about the spread of health rumours and misinformation.",
      "Research from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found 20% of parents surveyed in 2023 said they had come across information online that made them worried about vaccines, a sharp jump from just 6% the year before.",
      "As social media sites have gone from niche start-ups to established parts of the media landscape, so the risk of misinformation has changed.",
      "\"Now somebody in one corner of the world can post something and suddenly millions of people in another part of the world can see it within seconds,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"It's not just the speed but the reach of misinformation which puts us in completely uncharted territory.\"",
      "Where young people stand",
      "Research has consistently shown that younger adults are the group most likely to use social media to make decisions about their personal health, and the most vulnerable to misinformation.",
      "Lockdowns and other restrictions also meant many of those in their late teens and twenties lost out on education, on early job opportunities and on full social lives in the pandemic. At the same time they were far less likely than older groups to fall seriously ill after catching the virus.",
      "\"They were the ones who felt like they paid the price for what was primarily an older person's problem,\" says Prof Heidi Larson, a former head of global immunisation communication at UNICEF and the director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at LSHTM.",
      "The data suggests younger groups have also seen the biggest falls in vaccine confidence over the last four years, something she says is the \"most concerning\" part of her research.",
      "The proportion of 18-24-year-olds, for example, who say that vaccines are safe and effective has fallen to under 60% in 2023 from 80% in 2019.",
      "\"They should really be the priority, because these are potential young parents and if they are questioning the importance of vaccines, then we are in trouble,\" says Prof Larson, who is giving expert evidence to the Covid inquiry this week.",
      "\"We have to recognise that this is about the whole experience of Covid, and all the controls and pressures. It's like, 'Enough of being told what to do, I just don't want your vaccines anymore'.\"",
      "Speed and safety concerns",
      "The speed at which new Covid vaccines had to be developed has also been at the centre of some of the rumour, concern and distrust there is online.",
      "The data now shows the jabs did their main job \u2013 helping our bodies clear the virus and cutting the risk of severe disease, hospitalisation and death.",
      "In early clinical trials though the vaccines were also said to be effective \u2013 90% so in the case of the Pfizer jab \u2013 at preventing Covid in the first place. In real world use, that protection against infection and transmission faded within months, as immunity \"waned \" and the virus mutated into different variants.",
      "Crucially though protection against severe disease has proved far more long-lasting.",
      "Then there were safety concerns.",
      "The AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were linked to a rare, but serious, blood clot in the brain and their use was restricted to certain groups.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna jabs, meanwhile, have been linked to rare cases of heart inflammation, which usually clear up without long-term damage.",
      "The reality is every vaccine, like any medical treatment, always carries a small level of risk, some more than others.",
      "\"The science and public health perspective is quite clear: not only were Covid vaccines safe and effective, but we would have been in a very different world if they hadn't been rolled out so quickly,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"[But] we're in this complicated, murky world with public attitudes where some people thought they weren't what was promised.\"",
      "Vaccine fatigue and 'complacency'",
      "Many people in the UK no longer have direct experience of how dangerous viruses such as measles can be.",
      "The UKHSA says it's been seriously concerned for some time about falling childhood vaccination rates.",
      "The organisation's director of public health programmes, Dr Mary Ramsay, believes that trend, which started in the decade before Covid, is more likely to be driven by complacency than a drop in confidence in the childhood vaccination programme.",
      "Modern lives are also busy and finding time to take a child to a GP for a series of jabs is not always straightforward, she suggests.",
      "In 2024 the number of children receiving a first dose of the MMR vaccine fell to 88.9% in England, the lowest level for 14 years and over the last year we've seen significant measles outbreaks in London, Birmingham and Bristol.",
      "A high level of measles vaccination is vital as it prevents transmission of the virus and protects not just those who receive the jab, but those who can't \u2013 young babies and children with weakened immune systems, for example.",
      "Dr Wall, now clinical director of population health in Greater Manchester, also thinks there might be an element of \"vaccine fatigue\" creeping in since the pandemic, with even some NHS staff left \"tired, jaded and fed-up\" after years of vaccines, boosters, rules and restrictions.",
      "Figures from NHS England, for example, show the number of frontline healthcare workers getting their flu vaccine fell to 35% in November 2024 from 62% in the same month in 2019.",
      "In late 2021, the government brought in a policy of mandatory Covid vaccines for care home staff in England, and later tried to extend that to NHS workers. At times the public were also told they needed Covid jabs (or a recent negative test) to travel abroad, to enter nightclubs and to visit cinemas in parts of the UK.",
      "Those kinds of strict health policies might force up vaccination rates in the short-term, argues Prof Larson at LSHTM, but there's a danger we are now starting to pay a \"long term price\".",
      "The worry is if people feel forced or coerced into taking a vaccine at certain times, wider vaccine confidence and uptake may experience a backlash.",
      "Personal liberty versus state control",
      "For 200 years vaccination has been entangled with personal liberty, state control and other political issues. That's increasingly playing out online where the wider debate also takes in global warming, gun control and immigration, for example.",
      "\"It's 'the people' versus the political and financial elites, with medical and scientific experts seen as among those deemed elitist, speaking a different language and entwined with big business and pharma,\" says Prof Larson.",
      "Meanwhile, President Trump's controversial pick for US health secretary, Robert Kennedy Jr, has once again put vaccines firmly on the political agenda.",
      "In the past he has repeated the false claim that vaccines cause autism, urged parents not to jab their children, and had to apologise after claiming the number injured by vaccines was \"a holocaust\".",
      "He has denied on several occasions that he is anti-vaccination, instead saying he is \"pro-safety\".",
      "'We need to be more assertive'",
      "Dr Simon Williams at Swansea University now thinks health authorities have to be clearer about the dangers of some infectious diseases, in the face of online misinformation which often exaggerates the small risk of vaccines.",
      "\"Part of the reason tobacco control campaigns have been so effective since the 1980s was because they were so clear about how dangerous smoking is, and I think we can learn from that,\" he says.",
      "\"We need to be far more assertive about the potential risks of not getting vaccinated.\"",
      "Inside story of Biden's undoing: 'Infighting, frustration and an insular inner circle'",
      "Why wildfires are becoming faster and more furious",
      "How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate",
      "Another idea is \"pre-bunking\" - that is teaching people to expect and recognise misinformation online before they encounter it in real life, instead of relying on fact-checking and dull public health videos after the event.",
      "Prof Heidi Larson also thinks now is the time to target and better engage with those most at-risk of rejecting vaccines - in particular the younger groups that her data shows are most affected.",
      "\"I would start in schools, I would start in science classes, I think we are losing the plot if we only focus on disinformation, and don't start to build an appreciation of how vaccines work and their benefits,\" she says.",
      "\"Vaccine confidence across Europe is now really struggling and we can't just assume it's going to bounce back without a concerted effort.\"",

      "Calling people obese is medically \"flawed\" - and the definition should be split into two, a report from global experts says.",
      "The term \"clinical obesity\" should be used for patients with a medical condition caused by their weight, while \"pre-clinically obese\" should be applied to those remaining fat but fit, although at risk of disease.",
      "This is better for patients than relying only on body mass index (BMI) - which measures whether they are a healthy weight for their height - to determine obesity.",
      "More than a billion people are estimated to be living with obesity worldwide and prescription weight-loss drugs are in high demand.",
      "The report, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, is supported by more than 50 medical experts around the world.",
      "\"Some individuals with obesity can maintain normal organ function and overall health, even long term, whereas others display signs and symptoms of severe illness here and now,\" Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, who chaired the expert group, said.",
      "\"Obesity is a spectrum,\" he added.",
      "The current, blanket definition means too many people are being diagnosed as obese but not receiving the most appropriate care, the report says.",
      "'I feel blessed to get weight-loss jab' - but can the NHS afford it for all?",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "Natalie, from Crewe, goes to the gym four times a week and has a healthy diet, but is still overweight.",
      "\"I would consider myself on the larger side, but I'm fit,\" she told the BBC 5 Live phone-in with Nicky Campbell.",
      "\"If you look at my BMI I'm obese, but if I speak to my doctor they say that I'm fit, healthy and there's nothing wrong with me.",

      "\"All these skinny jabs make me laugh, if you want to lose weight stop eating - it's easy.\"",
      "Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as having a BMI over 30 - a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight.",
      "How is BMI calculated?",
      "It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared.",

      "The report says BMI is useful on a large scale, to work out the proportion of a population who are a healthy weight, overweight or obese.",
      "But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs.",
      "Measuring a patient's waist or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says.",
      "\"Obesity is a health risk - the difference is it's also an illness for some,\" Prof Rubino said.",
      "What are the two groups?",
      "Clinically obese",
      "When obesity is a disease, there will be signs of it affecting organs in the body - through heart disease, breathlessness, type 2 diabetes or joint pain - and a person's day-to-day activities. Treatment with drugs or surgery is likely.",
      "Pre-clinically obese",
      "When obesity is a risk to health - but not yet causing any illnesses, people should be offered weight-loss advice, counselling and monitoring, to reduce the chances of health problems developing.",
      "Doctors should also pay close attention to a patient's family history to see if they are at risk of particular diseases.",
      "At a time when drugs that reduce body weight by up to 20% are being prescribed on a large scale, the report says redefining obesity \"is all the more relevant\" because it \"improves the accuracy of diagnosis\".",
      "Access to weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro is often restricted to patients with a BMI over 30 and a weight-related health condition.",
      "Children's obesity expert Prof Louise Baur, from the University of Sydney, who contributed to the report, said the new approach would allow adults and children with obesity \"to receive more appropriate care\", while reducing the numbers being over-diagnosed and given unnecessary treatment.",
      "The Royal College of Physicians said the report laid a strong foundation \"for treating obesity with the same medical rigour and compassion as other chronic illnesses\".",

      "Sir Ed also warned that Trump could not be relied on to \"play by the rules\" or to stick to international agreements.",

      "The Lib Dem leader's speech was highly critical of Trump, who will be sworn in for his second term in the White House on Monday, describing him as \"the first convicted criminal\" to take the oath of office.",
      "Sir Ed noted that Trump had praised President Putin's invasion of Ukraine as \"genius\", said \"trade wars are good\", and called himself \"tariff man\".",

      "But \"The Donald\" could not be ignored and had to be dealt with, he added.",

      "The Conservatives have been approached for their response.",

      "'Not ideological'",
      "Sir Ed's speech was his first to focus on relations with Brussels since he became Liberal Democrat leader following the 2019 general election, when the party's campaign to stop Brexit saw it slump to just 11 MPs.",
      "At last year's general election, the party gained a record 72 seats on the back of a campaign that barely mentioned the EU at all, even though rejoining the bloc remains the party's long-term aim.",

      "Sir Ed attacked the government for rejecting a new customs union with the EU, saying it would be the best way to tear down trade barriers and \"turbocharge our economy in the medium and long term\".",
      "He urged ministers to negotiate a deal with the EU this year, with the aim of forming a fresh customs union by 2030, arguing this would allow the UK to deal with Trump \"from a position of strength, not weakness\".",
      "There are no tariffs or other barriers to trade between countries in the EU customs union - which the UK left in January 2021 when Brexit took effect.",
      "But member countries impose common tariffs on all goods entering the union from outside.",
      "Official figures released on Thursday indicate the UK economy grew in November for the first time in three months - after shrinking in September and October.",
      "But the 0.1% increase in the size of the economy was smaller than most economists had predicted.",

      "It was passed in 2023, but was opposed by victims' groups and all the main political parties in Northern Ireland.",
      "The act created a new legacy body known as the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) to take over all Troubles-era cases from 1 May 2024, including those on the desk of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).",
      "It also shut down all historical inquests.",
      "The act's most controversial element, the offer of conditional immunity to suspects, was disapplied following legal action by bereaved families.",
      "The court ruled this part of the act was incompatible with human rights' legislation and the Windsor Framework.",
      "Labour pledged to repeal the Legacy Act if they won the general election in July and formally began that process in December.",
      "Why could Gerry Adams seek compensation?",
      "A Supreme Court judgement in 2020 paved the way for Mr Adams to receive damages after it quashed his convictions over two attempted prison break-outs.",
      "It ruled his detention was unlawful because the interim custody order (ICO) had not been \"considered personally\" by the then Northern Ireland Secretary Willie Whitelaw.",
      "At the time, the Conservative government argued the ICOs were lawful due to a convention known as the Carltona principle, where officials and junior ministers routinely act in the name of a secretary of state.",

      "It is unclear if Trump's administration would have any objection. The incoming president has not publicly commented on the deal.",
      "But the incoming US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said it poses a \"serious threat\", arguing it gives the islands to a country aligned with China. Mauritius has a trade agreement with China.",
      "Reform UK leader and Trump ally Nigel Farage said he believed the agreement would damage Sir Keir's relations with the US president-elect.",
      "\"When the Americans realise that... Diego Garcia, their most important military base in the world, may effectively be rendered pretty useless, I think the special relationship will be fractured in a way that will not be mended during the course of this government,\" he told the BBC.",
      "But on Wednesday at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir defended the deal, pointing out the negotiations had started under the last Tory government. He insisted the deal was the best way to safeguard the military base.",
      "Reports had suggested Mauritian Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam would sign off an agreement on Wednesday as he attended a cabinet meeting, but it was later announced his attorney general was travelling to London to continue talks.",
      "The UK took control of the Chagos Islands, or British Indian Ocean Territory, from its then colony, Mauritius, in 1965 and went on to evict its population of more than 1,000 people to make way for the Diego Garcia base.",
      "Mauritius, which won independence from the UK in 1968, has maintained that the islands are its own, and the UN's highest court has ruled, in an advisory opinion, that the UK's administration of the territory is \"unlawful\".",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the prime minister was \"negotiating a secret deal to surrender British territory and taxpayers in this country will pay for the humiliation\".",

      "Under the proposed deal, Mauritius will be able to begin a programme of resettlement on the Chagos Islands, but not on Diego Garcia.",
      "UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has previously played down the criticism, saying it is a \"very good deal\" for \"our national security\" because it secured the legal basis of the Diego Garcia military base.",
      "On Wednesday, diplomats said the decision to put the deal on hold until it was considered by the Trump administration made sense as the UK would not want its first engagement to be a row over islands deep in the Indian Ocean.",

      "The government has confirmed plans to reintroduce a piece of legislation aimed at protecting free speech on university campuses.",

      "But its implementation was stopped shortly after Labour's election win last summer over concerns the law was potentially damaging to student welfare.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told Parliament the government would be progressing with the legislation but with significant changes.",
      "The act said universities had a duty to \"secure\" and \"promote the importance\" of freedom of speech and academic expression.",
      "It included controversial new powers in which the regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), would have been able to fine or sanction higher education providers and student unions in England.",

      "Tenants who were \"perfectly able to afford the monthly rent\" were being asked to give landlords \"ever larger sums\" in advance, he said, or \"risk being locked out of renting altogether\".",

      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has met survivors of grooming gangs in Oldham and Rotherham, describing the meeting as \"quite shocking\".",
      "Speaking to GB News, she said it was \"extraordinary\" hearing victims describe going \"to the authorities multiple times... and in one particular case the police actually handed her, a 12-year-old, into the hands of her abusers\".",
      "Badenoch has been demanding a national inquiry into grooming gangs, but has faced criticism after reports she had so far failed to meet any victims.",
      "On Monday, the Labour MP for Rotherham, Sarah Champion, joined calls for a public inquiry, saying it was required to \"restore faith in our safeguarding systems\".",
      "What is Starmer's record on prosecuting grooming gangs?",
      "Rotherham MP Champion backs national grooming inquiry",
      "MPs vote against Tory call for new grooming gangs inquiry",
      "Speaking to GB News on Monday evening, Badenoch said she was \"going to do everything, and the Conservative Party is going to do everything, to make sure that you [survivors] get justice\".",
      "Pressed on why the previous Conservative government had not commissioned an inquiry into grooming gangs, she said: \"I think we thought that the inquiries that we'd started would be enough.\"",
      "\"I thought 'oh, there's an inquiry taking place, let's see what it comes out with,' and what we've seen is that we've had multiple non-national inquiries. They are not enough. Let's do more,\" she said.",
      "Badenoch said she believed a new national inquiry should look at a \"systematic pattern of behaviour\" among certain communities in the country.",
      "It is \"people very, very poor, sort of peasant background \u2013 very, very rural, almost cut off from even the home origin countries that they might have been in,\" she said. \"They're not necessarily first generation,\" she added.",
      "She said a \"culture of silence\" in the state needed to be addressed.",
      "Between 1997 and 2013, several areas of the country - including Oldham and Rotherham - were blighted by gangs of men, predominantly of Pakistani descent, who raped and trafficked children as young as 11.",
      "An independent report, published by Prof Alexis Jay in 2014, estimated 1,400 girls had been abused in Rotherham.",
      "She would later go on to lead a national review into child sexual abuse, which lasted seven years and made 20 recommendations when it was published in 2022.",
      "Prof Jay has previously said victims want to see action on her recommendations, rejecting the calls for a fresh probe.",
      "There have also been a series of local reviews into child sex abuse in Manchester, Rochdale and Oldham, which were published between 2020 and 2024 and found authorities had failed to protect children from sexual exploitation by gangs of predominantly Asian men.",
      "In recent weeks, the Conservatives and Reform UK have been calling for a new national inquiry into grooming gangs.",
      "Earlier this month, the Tories failed in a bid to force a fresh national investigation by amending a government education bill.",
      "When asked whether the reason that a national inquiry had not been called was because politicians could be implicated in a cover-up, and whether the Labour Party was resisting an investigation, Badenoch said that it was \"certainly something that we have to look at\".",
      "\"I am not afraid, the Conservative Party is under new leadership. What we did before to tackle it is clearly not enough, we need to do a lot more, and Labour needs to get on board with that.\"",
      "Champion has called for a national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs, with councils leading the investigations.",
      "Under the model suggested by Champion, the Home Office would act as a central \"hub,\" setting terms and empowering councils to compel testimony, while local \"spokes\" would lead inquiries and send findings for a national report.",
      "Champion, who has been campaigning on child protection for over a decade, said: \"I have long believed that we need to fully understand the nature of this crime and the failures in the response of public bodies if we are to truly protect children.\"",
      "Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she argued locally-run investigations had uncovered child sexual abuse, but have \"been missing\" the power to compel witnesses to testify and hold offenders accountable.",
      "'Range of views'",
      "Two other Labour figures from places affected - Rochdale MP Paul Waugh and Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham - have also called for limited new inquiries.",
      "But Downing Street has said its priority is to implement the recommendations of Prof Jay's national review in 2022.",
      "Last week, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said one of the key proposals from the report - for workers in certain roles to face mandatory requirements to report abuse - would be added to the Crime and Policing Bill.",
      "Number 10 said on Monday that there would be a \"range of views\" on the issue of a new inquiry, and the government would be \"guided and led by the victims and survivors\".",
      "Security Minister Dan Jarvis said he understood why colleagues were calling for a new national inquiry, but argued the government's priority was \"delivering the justice that these victims deserve\".",
      "He told BBC Breakfast: \"We think the best and most timely way to do that is to do the work that the previous government were not able to do of implementing the findings of Prof Alexis Jay's report.\""

    "summary": "The BBC's political editor explains the headaches the Treasury is giving Sir Keir Starmer.",
    "story": [
      "If you were to produce a political heat map of the government right now, there is one big bit that would be bright red, and probably flashing: the Treasury.",
      "Firstly, there have been all of the headlines about the now former Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Tulip Siddiq.",
      "For all of the complexities and subtleties of this story, and there are plenty, the inescapable crux of it was something even the most polished public relations executive would struggle to add much gloss to.",
      "The minister responsible for the government's anti-corruption drive was named in a corruption investigation.",
      "Awkward.",
      "It is vital to stress Tulip Siddiq has always insisted she has done nothing wrong and the prime minister's independent adviser on ministerial standards concluded she had not broken the ministerial code.",
      "The investigation, by Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission, is looking into claims Tulip Siddiq's family embezzled up to \u00a33.9bn.",
      "The now former minister's aunt Sheikh Hasina was the country's prime minister until she was deposed last year.",
      "In an interview with the Sunday Times at the weekend, her replacement, Muhammad Yunus, said that homes used by Tulip Siddiq in the UK should be handed back to his government if they had been gained through \"plain robbery.\"",
      "And what are the responsibilities of the economic secretary to the Treasury?",
      "Well, tackling economic crime, money laundering and illicit finance among other things.",
      "And remember, politics isn't a court of law, but a court of perceptions \u2013 where unanswered questions are dangerous because they amount to more headlines, however fair or otherwise that might be.",
      "The independent adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, concluded that \"given the nature of Ms Siddiq's ministerial responsibilities... it is regrettable that she was not more alert to the potential reputational risks.\"",
      "And, he added: \"I would not advise that this shortcoming should be taken as a breach of the ministerial code, but you will want to consider her ongoing responsibilities in the light of this.\"",
      "Oh dear.",
      "And she is out, but this was a resignation with warmth on both sides with the prime minister suggesting publicly she could well serve as a minister again.",
      "Contrast that, incidentally, with the three-sentence missive he rattled off to Louise Haigh, when she resigned as transport secretary in November.",
      "Let's turn next to the Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has also struggled to get herself out of the headlines.",
      "The prime minister has heaped praise on her and expressed a parliament's worth of confidence in her.",
      "The dip in inflation in the latest figures just published are better than the alternative for Rachel Reeves - albeit the rate at which prices are rising is still higher than the target the Bank of England aims for.",
      "But the soaring cost of government borrowing is a symptom of the markets collectively sounding unconvinced by the government's economic strategy.",
      "The chancellor has said \"the economic headwinds we face are a reminder that we must go further and faster to kick start economic growth that plunged under the last government\".",
      "What does that mean?",
      "They'll crack on with what they call their \"industrial strategy\" \u2013 there will be more announcements like the one about artificial intelligence on Monday.",
      "The Conservatives say business confidence has fallen through the floor and say ministers have talked down the economy.",
      "From the prime minister's perspective, the aspirin of resignation eases the Tulip Siddiq headache he has had to endure.",
      "Shaking off the persistent and painful government migraine of sluggish economic growth could take a lot longer and doing so, or not, is likely to have far greater and long-lasting political consequence.",
      "Tulip Siddiq resigns as Treasury minister",

      "When Labour won power in July, she was appointed economic secretary to the Treasury and City minister, responsible for the UK's financial services sector.",
      "But she resigned on 14 January after growing pressure over an anti-corruption investigation in Bangladesh.",
      "It centred around claims her family embezzled nearly \u00a34bn from the country's infrastructure projects.",
      "Siddiq is a niece of Bangladesh's longest-serving prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, who was overthrown by a pro-democracy uprising earlier this year.",
      "Siddiq also came under scrutiny over her use of properties in London linked to her aunt's allies.",
      "Siddiq says that she acted openly and with the advice of officials, but left government because she risked becoming a distraction.",
      "The PM's standards adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, found Siddiq had not breached the Ministerial Code and had found no evidence of financial impropriety, but he said it was \"regrettable\" that Siddiq \"was not more alert to the potential reputational risks\" of her close family's association with Bangladesh.",

      "As a child, she met Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton and Mother Teresa, and her family were invited to the White House.",
      "Her maternal grandfather was Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's first president. He and most of his family were assassinated when soldiers stormed their home in Dhaka in a military coup in 1975.",
      "Siddiq's mother and aunt survived because they were abroad.",
      "Siddiq joined the Labour Party at the age of 16, later giving the NHS and the care her disabled father as the main reason.",
      "She named former cabinet minister Barbara Castle as her political heroine, and has described her mother and maternal aunt as \"two very strong feminists\".",
      "Pre-politics, she worked for Amnesty International, Save The Children and the Greater London Authority, among others.",
      "By 2010, she was working with Ed Miliband's successful campaign for the Labour leadership, also spending time as a special adviser to former cabinet minister Tessa Jowell.",
      "She had also been elected to Camden council in north London. After former Oscar-winning actress Glenda Jackson announced she was standing down as an MP, Siddiq was selected as Labour's parliamentary candidate for the Hampstead and Kilburn seat.",
      "Elected to Parliament in the 2015 general election, Siddiq was one of 36 Labour MPs who nominated Jeremy Corbyn for the party leadership, but she backed Andy Burnham in that election.",
      "She would be re-elected in 2017, 2019 and 2024 with much larger majorities.",
      "Appointed a shadow education minister in 2016, she resigned from the front bench three months later to vote against triggering Brexit.",
      "Siddiq is probably best known for campaigning for the release of her constituent, British-Iranian citizen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was detained in Iran for nearly six years.",
      "In 2017, while campaigning for Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release, Siddiq was asked in a Channel 4 News interview why she had not challenged her aunt, who had been accused of leading an authoritarian government in Bangladesh guilty of human rights abuses.",
      "A row ensued, the programme's editor complained her behaviour to a pregnant producer had been \"threatening\", and Siddiq apologised.",
      "She married in 2013. Two days before she gave birth to her second child in 2019, she attended the Commons in a wheelchair for an important Brexit vote. Later that month, after a rule change, she became the first MP to vote by proxy."

      "Even by the standards of the Reform UK party, it has been an interesting few weeks.",
      "In December, its leader Nigel Farage flew to Florida to meet Elon Musk, the multi-billionaire, where they discussed a possible donation.",
      "On Boxing Day, it announced its membership figures had surpassed those of the Conservatives. There was then a spat with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch over whether those numbers were correct.",
      "Last Sunday in a post on his social media site X, Musk unexpectedly appeared to withdraw support from Farage saying he \"doesn't have what it takes\" to lead the party.",

      "Reform UK members gathering on an icily cold Friday evening at Sandown Racecourse for the party's South East conference weren't disheartened by the possible loss of a rich and influential backer.",

      "\"He is destructive, he could destroy Reform.\"",
      "There are about 850 attendees at Sandown, according to the organisers, who say it was a sold out event.",
      "Among them is Howard Ward from Winchester, who has switched to Reform from the Conservatives.",
      "Like many here he is not bothered about Musk. \"Let him talk away,\" he says.",
      "Kevin Burrell doesn't think Musk is \"being serious\" and even if he is, it doesn't matter. \"We've got Candy... he is going to do wonders.\"",

      "Musk hasn't explained his reasoning, but Farage said the pair had a disagreement because Musk wanted Reform to \"come out strongly in support\" of Tommy Robinson.",
      "Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is currently serving an 18-month prison sentence for contempt of court.",
      "The former head of the far-right English Defence League admitted in court to breaching an injunction against repeating claims about a Syrian refugee schoolboy after losing a 2021 libel case.",
      "Farage left his former party UKIP in 2018 saying its association with Robinson had brought \"scuffles\" and \"violence\" to the party.",
      "He has ruled out Robinson being allowed to join Reform UK.",
      "Party members at the event at Sandown talk seriously about electoral success, and while many express sympathy for Robinson, they understand why he might be politically unpalatable.",
      "\"Whatever happens with Tommy, his heart is in the right place but he will never be forgiven by the mainstream media,\" says Kevin Burrell.",
      "\"Much as I admire what he's doing I can understand why Reform don't support him.",

      "She says she is a realist and acknowledges that Reform might \"disappear into the wilderness\" but for now she says it is \"the only party that gives me hope to go out in the morning\".",
      "As the evening progresses, news emerges about the 10 Reform UK councillors in Derbyshire who resigned, arguing the party was being run in an \"increasingly autocratic manner\" and had \"lost its sense of direction\" since Farage took over.",

      "There is no mention of the resignations at the conference, instead members are invited to cheer two councillor defections from the Conservatives to Reform.",
      "And there is little public sign of discontent with Farage, although one member whispers his unease.",

      "The big themes include opposition to net-zero policies, support for a national inquiry into grooming gangs, the economy and the possible postponement of local elections in May.",

      "They are new members, new to politics and Caroline says she puts the chances of Farage being prime minister after the next election at 10 out of 10.",
      "The party has prospered because of dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and disappointment with the early signs from Labour, says Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common, with ratings up from around 15 to 20%. But a general election is years away.",
      "Whether the party can go from five MPs in 2024 to government remains to be seen, but whatever happens, it's clear there are party members still enthused by Reform's offer."

      "Government borrowing costs have been steadily rising in recent months, and have now hit their highest levels for several years.",
      "Why is this happening and how does it affect you?",
      "What's happening in the bond markets?",
      "A bond is a bit like an IOU that can be traded in the financial markets.",
      "Governments generally spend more than they raise in tax so they borrow money to fill the gap, usually by selling bonds to investors.",
      "As well as eventually paying back the value of the bond, governments pay interest at regular intervals so investors receive a stream of future payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. They are mainly bought by financial institutions, such as pension funds.",
      "Interest rates - known as the yield -  on government bonds have been going up since around August.",
      "The yield on a 10-year bond has surged to its highest level since 2008, while the yield on a 30-year bond is at its highest since 1998, meaning it costs the government more to borrow over the long term.",
      "The pound has also fallen in value against the dollar over the past few days. On 7 January it was worth $1.25 but it has now fallen to just above $1.21.",
      "Why are bond yields rising?",

      "There is a great deal of uncertainty around what will happen when President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House later this month. He has pledged to bring in tariffs on goods entering the US and to cut taxes.",
      "Investors worry that this will lead to inflation being more persistent than previously thought and therefore interest rates will not come down as quickly as they had expected.",
      "But in the UK there are also concerns about the economy underperforming.",
      "Inflation is at its highest for eight months - hitting 2.6% in November - above the Bank of England's 2% target - while the economy has shrunk for two months in a row.",
      "Analysts say it is these wider concerns about the strength of the economy that is driving down the pound, which typically rises when borrowing costs increase.",
      "However, the dollar is also rising against all currencies - not just the pound.",
      "The US economy created more jobs than forecast last month which has added to expectations that US rates will remain higher than previously forecast, and this has helped to push up the value of the dollar.",
      "How does it affect me?",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged that all day-to-day spending should be  funded from taxes, not from borrowing.",
      "But if she needs more money to pay back higher borrowing costs, that uses up more tax revenue, leaving less money to spend on other things.",
      "Economists have warned that this could mean spending cuts which would affect public services, and tax rises that could hit people's pay or businesses' ability to grow and hire more people.",
      "The government has committed to having only one fiscal event a year, where it can raise taxes, and this is not expected until the autumn.",
      "So if higher borrowing costs persist, we may be more likely to see cuts to spending before that or at least lower spending increases than would otherwise happen.",
      "Some people may be wondering about the impact of higher gilt yields on the mortgage market, particularly after what happened after Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022.",
      "Although yields are higher now than they were then, they have been creeping up slowly over a period of months, whereas in 2022 they shot up over a couple of days.",
      "That speedy rise led to lenders quickly pulling deals while they tried to work out what interest rate to charge.",
      "Analysts and brokers say the current unease in the markets is having some effect on the pricing of mortgages. Many were expecting to see some falls in rates at the start of the year but instead lenders are holding off from cuts to see what happens.",
      "However, the market is favourable to anyone currently buying an annuity - a product from an insurance company that gives a retirement income for the rest of their life, bought only once.",
      "One annuity expert told the BBC many people would get a better deal now than at any time since 2008, because annuity rates usually move in line with gilt yields.",

      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "What happens next?",
      "The Treasury has said there is no need for an emergency intervention in the financial markets.",
      "It has said it will not make any spending or tax announcements ahead of the official borrowing forecast from its independent watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), due on 26 March.",
      "If the OBR says the chancellor is still on track to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules then that might settle the markets.",

    "summary": "Why Rachel Reeves needs a more detailed growth strategy - and soon.",
    "story": [
      "It has not been a good week for Chancellor Rachel Reeves.",
      "Government borrowing costs have hit their highest level in 16 years and the pound has fallen to a 14-month low against the dollar.",
      "She has gone on a planned trip to China amid accusations from opposition parties that she is leaving at a moment of economic peril.",
      "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is accompanying her on the trip. The 12-hour flight to Beijing is probably the length of the meeting she might have wanted to have with him.",
      "So how serious are the recent movements on the markets and what could happen as a result?",
      "Budget plans need to be tweaked",
      "While the markets stabilised from Thursday lunchtime, the move against UK government debt is already enough to cause a problem for the chancellor's Budget maths.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament. The Treasury has said these fiscal rules, set out in the Budget, are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "At times over the past week the markets have looked pretty fragile for Britain, with both government borrowing costs going up and sterling falling back at the same time. That is a key marker.",
      "While it's true that the overall direction for the markets over the past month has been set by an assessment of the inflationary consequences of President-elect Trump's trade and economic policies, the UK has been getting some special attention in addition.",
      "It risks being tarred with both the inflationary stickiness of the US, and the stagnant growth of the eurozone - the worst of both worlds.",
      "That said, it is important to be precise about the extent of the problem. The extra cost of servicing the national debt at these interest rates would be several billion pounds a year - i.e. material enough to require some sort of correction in the Budget maths, but doable, and the clear message this week is that \"it will be done\".",
      "No impact on mortgages so far",
      "The impact on budgetary maths is real, but the wider impact that might be expected - of higher borrowing costs for companies and for households - has not yet materialised.",
      "The mortgage market has yet to see an increase in rates for fixed-term mortgages, as occurred rapidly in the panic after the 2022 mini-Budget. There is a curious calm.",
      "One explanation lies in what is not happening. This time last year the major lenders greatly discounted mortgages in a battle for market share ahead of the key moments for house buying. This has not happened this year, and may yet have a consequence in the property market.",
      "The Bank of England has indicated it will continue with interest rate cuts this year. The markets think there may be far fewer than previously expected, perhaps only one, leaving base interest rates at 4.5%.",
      "Many economists say this is the wrong call, and believe rates will be cut multiple times. There's quite a lot of uncertainty here, and the key Bank of England committee is split. The Bank's words will be very carefully watched.",
      "More positively for the economy, despite a lot of rhetoric from retailers, many have delivered strong results and have not lowered their profits expectations. Are consumers a bit more robust than had been assumed, and could this drive some growth in 2025?",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Growth strategy needs a reboot",
      "The problem of servicing higher interest payments on the national debt increases the likelihood of the Treasury making plans for an adjustment, based on a squeeze on spending. A \u00a310bn cut will hurt, but with a majority of 170 MPs in the House of Commons, and an ongoing spending review already in train, it can be done.",
      "In these circumstances, with the credible threat of a global trade war, for example, it should be noted that Rachel Reeves' new fiscal rules do have an escape hatch.",
      "In the event of \"an emergency or a significant negative economic shock to the economy\" the chancellor may \"temporarily suspend the fiscal mandate\".",
      "While a global trade war could qualify, it would be difficult optics to suspend a \"non-negotiable\" and \"iron-clad\" set of rules before they had really bitten. The rules have not yet formally passed into law yet either, and remain a \"draft\" until the Commons votes to approve them.",
      "It seems very unlikely that this route will be taken unless there is a very clear economic shock in the coming weeks.",
      "The bigger point here is what matters in the markets, which is whether the UK is pursuing a credible set of policies, a convincing overall strategy.",
      "Labour's focus on stability at all costs was understandable after the humiliation of Liz Truss's mini-Budget. But \"stability\" is not a growth strategy.",
      "Pursuing green growth by borrowing for long-term capital investment is a potential strategy, and it underpinned \"Bidenomics\" in the US. The incoming government embraced the rhetoric of US policy under the outgoing president, without the same firepower. \"Bidenomics without the money\", you might say.",
      "But now the new Trump administration is jettisoning this approach, rightly or wrongly, and the markets are less convinced that such a strategy will pay for itself. It will cost more to fund such a strategy, and require harsher trade-offs than expected.",
      "Bidenomics without the money and without Biden is much too thin. A more detailed strategy for sustained growth is needed, and in short order.",

    "story": [
      "Women in Britain 2,000 years ago appear to have passed on land and wealth to daughters not sons as communities were built around women's blood lines, according to new research.",
      "Skeletons unearthed in Dorset contained DNA evidence that Celtic men moved to live with their wives' families and communities.",
      "Scientists found evidence of a whole community built around the female line of a family over generations, probably originating with one woman.",
      "\"This points to an Iron Age society in Britain where women wielded quite a lot of influence and could shape its trajectory in many ways,\" says Dr Lara Cassidy at Trinity College, Dublin, lead author of the research.",
      "It is the first time this evidence of communities being built around women has been documented in ancient European history.",
      "The scientists believe that the communities also invested a lot in their daughters as they would probably inherit their mother's status.",
      "\"It's relatively rare in modern societies, but this might not always have been the case,\" says Dr Cassidy.",
      "The team found evidence that it happened in numerous places in Britain, suggesting it was widespread.",
      "The communities analysed lived around the same time as Boudica, the warrior Queen who led a rebellion against Roman invaders in East Anglia around AD 61.",
      "Dr Cassidy sequenced DNA taken from the bones of 57 individuals from a tribe called the Durotriges. The people lived in Winterborne Kingston, Dorset around 100 BC to AD 100.",
      "The skeletons were dug up from a cemetery by a team of archaeologists at Bournemouth University.",
      "By tracing mitochondrial DNA, which is only passed on by women, Dr Cassidy found that most women in the community were related by blood dating back generations.",
      "By contrast, there was a lot of diversity in the Y chromosomes, which is passed from father to son, indicating that men from lots of different families married into the community.",
      "The DNA analysis also indicates that most of the ancestral line could be traced back to a single woman.",
      "The work indicates that this society was what is known as matrilocal - meaning that a married man moved to live in his wife's community.",
      "\"The most sort of obvious benefit to a woman is that if you don't leave home, you don't leave your support network. Your parents, siblings, family members are all still around you,\" says Dr Cassidy.",
      "\"It's your husband who's coming in, he's the relative stranger to the community, and he's dependent on your family for his livelihood and land,\" she adds.",
      "The researchers found the same matrilocality evidence in bones from other cemeteries including in Cornwall and Yorkshire.",
      "She says that evidence of powerful women in ancient communities has often been dismissed an a one-off, not the norm, but these findings challenge that thinking.",
      "Archaeologists Prof Miles Russell and Prof Martin Smith found other evidence that women had high status.",
      "\"We find quite elaborately furnished graves with high status objects of wealth. Every time we find that, it occurs in women's graves, so we think wealth was being transferred down the female line,\" says Prof Martin Smith at Bournemouth university.",
      "The findings also back up Roman writings at the time which suggested that women in Britain were quite powerful, more so than in Rome.",
      "But Romans like Julius Caeser viewed that as a sign of backwardness.",
      "\"Women in Britain had power and it was a more egalitarian place. That was the biggest problem that Romans had with the Britons because Rome was a deeply patriarchal society. To them, it marked Britons as the ultimate Barbarians,\" says Professor Miles Russell at Bournemouth University.",
      "The majority of societies today are patrilocal, meaning women move to their husband's communities.",
      "But some matrilocal communities exist today or in the recent past, including the Akans in Ghana, West Africa and Cherokee in North America.",
      "The scientists say that Iron Age Britain may have been matrilocal because men were frequently away fighting.",

      "Matrilocal societies are also less likely to experience internal conflict, she says.",

      "In a gleaming laboratory in Edinburgh, robotic machines whirr and mix. The final product that they are creating will be a pine-smelling chemical that can be used as an ingredient in perfumes. But the starting point is very different: a brown, gloopy, fat mixture, recently fished out from below ground - fatbergs.",
      "Fatbergs are the foul phenomenon found lurking in (and blocking up) sewers. The development of the technology used to perform this apparent alchemy is being described by some as a new industrial revolution.",
      "This is the fast-moving field of bioengineering. The good news is that Britain is currently strong in the science compared with other countries.",
      "It is potentially great news for the environment too because it can recycle waste and make things more sustainably. Plus the government is keen because it may mean new industries and new jobs.",
      "But the British lead has slipped away recently because of a lack of investment, poor regulation and the wrong policies. The question now is, can it be recovered?",
      "And if it can, at what cost? Because some experts are concerned that certain potential risks are being overlooked amid the enthusiasm to reap the benefits - and to win back the lead.",
      "A crazy idea 'that works'",
      "Prof Stephen Wallace from the University of Edinburgh is among those turning the fatbergs into perfumes. \"It's a crazy idea,\" he admits to me, \"but it works.\"",
      "Fatbergs are accumulated lumps of fat from cooking oils, toilet and other food waste that people put down their drains. Prof Wallace gets his from a company that specialises in fishing them out of sewers and turning them into biofuels. They arrive at the lab in a tube.",
      "The first step is to sterilise the material in a steamer. Prof Wallace then adds the specially modified bacteria to the remnants of the fatberg. The bacteria have a short section of DNA inserted, to give the bacteria their particular properties.",
      "The fatberg gradually disappears, as the bacteria eat it, producing the chemical with the pine-like smell - this can be used as an ingredient in perfumes.",
      "Prof Wallace says that while the UK has taken a lead role in establishing the technology, it now needs to show it can go to the next step. \"We are at this nervous point where the core technology that enables a huge range of sustainable industrial technologies is established and we are now progressing to the stage of scaling up to manufacturing.",
      "\"But there is a challenge in the UK to create infrastructure... and progress to commercialisation at a rate that is comparable to investment in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Tech advances at break-neck speed",
      "If the UK can scale up, the appetite for investment appears to be there. Prof Wallace is working with two perfume companies that are interested in the process because it is more sustainable than the method they currently use, which involves making the fragrance from chemicals extracted from fossil fuels.",
      "But while the basic technology exists, it is advancing at break-neck speed, meaning the UK's leading role is insecure.",
      "One of Stephen's colleagues, Dr Joanna Sadler, has created microbes that turn used plastic, that would otherwise damage the environment, into vanilla essence and other useful and expensive chemicals.",
      "\"Since I first published the work four or five years ago, the field has absolutely exploded, not just in the UK but across the world,\" she tells me. \"It's an extremely fast-moving field.\"",
      "One member of the University of Edinburgh's hub has created bugs that extract important metals from burnt-out batteries, which would otherwise leak noxious chemicals into landfill. Another is turning waste water from whisky distillation into a plant-based alternative to fish-oil health supplements.",
      "The possibilities are endless, and innovation has accelerated because of the development of cheap and accurate ways of manipulating DNA. It means it is now much easier to harness and adapt the power of nature to create all sorts of things.",
      "However all those possibilities require funding.",
      "A national priority?",
      "The technology was set as a national priority by the previous government in December 2023 with the publication of a policy document called the National Vision for Engineering Biology and an allocation of \u00a32bn over 10 years. The Labour government has indicated that it too regards it as a priority but has made no firm spending commitment.",
      "On the face of it, engineering biology could help Labour achieve two of its five big priorities in government: growth and sustainability. But at present the funding remains uncertain.",
      "The chief scientific advisor Prof Angela McLean, whom the Prime Minister turns to for matters scientific, has been looking into this.",
      "\"We are looking for products like this handbag,\" Prof McLean explained, while stroking a faux leather handbag made by one of the many new start-up engineering biology companies spinning out of university research.",
      "Modern Synthesis based south London made the bag from material grown from a non-genetically engineered microbe.",
      "\"They will be much less polluting, much more sustainable than their current equivalents, as well as generate great jobs, good environment and prosperity,\" she continues.",
      "\"Engineering biology is something the UK is really good at and the world is going to need. It is in its infancy and we need to keep on investing in it as a country.\"",
      "Losing out to Korea and the US",
      "In the 20th Century, the UK led the way in the basic sciences of electronics, computing and the biosciences. But, with some notable exceptions, scientific excellence in these sectors was not translated into truly large world-leading businesses.",
      "In all these cases, there was initial government enthusiasm and funding, but no follow-through. That meant that the science and ideas were bought up by mostly US companies, generating wealth and jobs overseas.",
      "The fear that the UK is losing its way is highlighted in a new House of Lords report, which was out on the 14 January, that says that engineering biology risks going down the same path for exactly the same reasons.",
      "It states that \"other countries are beginning to overtake the UK, and we are at severe risk of losing the prospective benefits of a world-leading engineering biology sector\".",
      "How Biden tarnished his own legacy",
      "Why wildfires are becoming faster and more furious",
      "How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate",
      "The report also says that there is a \"small but closing window\" to make some small policy tweaks that could make a huge difference, such as recommitting to the target set out in the National Vision for at least \u00a32 billion of funding over the next decade.",
      "Professor Susan Rosser, co-director of the Edinburgh Genome Foundry, told the Lords Science and Technology committee, which produced the report, \"we were ahead of the game, but we have lost that leadership because of substantial investments in the US and Korea\".",
      "She said: \"We are losing trained people overseas. People from Edinburgh have moved to Singapore, the States, Germany and Austria.",
      "\"If this is genuinely going to be a key part of our economy, we need the skill set trained, and as soon as possible.\"",
      "Brain drain",
      "Dr Carolina Grandellis, a biofoundry manager at the Earlham Institute research park in Norwich, added that it was hard to replenish the brain drain by attracting scientists from overseas because of a tightening of the visa system by both the previous and current government.",
      "\"The government intends to increase restrictions on legal skilled migration. That will have a cost for our field.\"",
      "According to Baroness Brown of Cambridge, who chairs the Lords committee, the heart of the problem is that there is no clear plan to increase the number of skilled scientists or to have the right policies and regulations in place to enable engineering biology to flourish in the UK.",
      "\"All too often we hear that when companies reach a certain size, they move abroad for better investment and development prospects, taking most of the economic benefit with them,\" she says. \"This requires urgent action\".",
      "Another issue is that the UK biofoundries, like the one at Edinburgh University, are not properly funded, according to Prof Paul Freemont, who is a co-director of a biofoundry at Imperial College, London.",
      "\"The scale of investment in biofoundries internationally is enormous. In Korea, it just announced $100m (\u00a382m) for a K-Biofoundry. In Shenzhen in China, about $750m (\u00a3614m) has gone into a building in which each floor [studies] an organism.",
      "\"Our biofoundry in London had \u00a37m of public investment in infrastructure and we have had no funding for staff. We are constantly scrabbling for cash\".",
      "Not all funding can come from government. But the Lords' report found that enough private investment was not forthcoming either. Unlike in the US, UK investors expect returns in a few years, rather than the tens of years that innovative companies need for their ideas to really start making money.",
      "'Living pollution' that could spread",
      "A further barrier for the field is its regulation by government, especially for applications for producing novel foods, according to Will Milligan CEO of Extracellular, which provides products to firms making lab-grown meat.",
      "\"Singapore, on the other hand, has a very clear framework for the approval process in bringing products to market, and the recommended timelines are about half what they are in the UK.\"",
      "In response to criticisms, the government has set up a body to cut through the red tape, the Regulatory Innovation Office.",
      "But \"streamlining does mean deregulation, in many circumstances\", argues Dr Helen Wallace, director of the campaign group Gene Watch. She worries that the risks of engineering biology are being overlooked by the government in its enthusiasm to reap the claimed benefits.",
      "Many applications of the technology involve creating entirely new organisms which are contained inside large vats in the production process. Even if they were to escape, they are unlikely to survive as they have been engineered to thrive in the very specific, artificial conditions they were designed for.",
      "But Dr Wallace is concerned about some applications that are designed to be released into the environment. \"There is one in the US which is made to survive and reproduce in the soil to boost nitrogen levels, which is very worrying because even very small changes in their DNA could make them more harmful to people, animals and plants.",
      "\"This could create a new kind of living pollution that could spread in rivers, the sea, the air, in rain and you would not be able to reverse any adverse consequences\".",
      "Inadvertent creation of superbugs",
      "Scientists and industrialists agree that without public trust, this shining new industry is going nowhere. And to win trust, the advocates of engineering biology must be open and honest about the risks.",
      "Most worrisome is the inadvertent creation of superbugs that could spread disease or create environmental problems by disrupting delicately balanced ecosystems.",
      "A group of 38 leading scientists recently expressed concern about the creation of \"mirror life\", which would be artificially created organisms whose DNA is the mirror image of their naturally occurring counterparts.",
      "Writing in the journal Science, they said that these mirror organisms could pose serious risks and rip through the immune systems of plants and animals. The scientists have called for a moratorium on their creation until more is known about them and what steps can be taken to minimise risks.",
      "But the problem is that the technology has become so cheap and widely available that such a moratorium would be hard to police. And while the creation of mirror life is a highly specialised skill, bad actors could make simpler changes, increasing the risk of bioterrorism.",
      "Government and manufacturers think that there are considerable environmental and economic benefits to this technology. But if the public won't accept it, there's no point to all this increased investment: it won't be used; no one will buy the products. And there are real risks: scientists and campaigners want the public to be fully informed, in an open and transparent way.",
      "Prof Freemont admits that in their enthusiasm for the good that engineering biology can bring. \"We've taken our eye off the ball a little bit in engaging with the public.",
      "\"The sector needs to ensure that the general consumer and citizen can begin to understand this technology\".",

      "Some horses came solo, others in trailers packed with fellow animals. Many had their owners, but others arrived alone, brought in by their rescuers or animal control. Pigs, donkeys and miniature horses followed.",
      "Within 24 hours, the Los Angeles Equestrian Center had been transformed into a modern-day Noah's Ark. Over the last week, it has sheltered hundreds of animals from the disaster as part of its official role as one of the city's large animal shelters.",
      "The facility, tucked in the shadow of Griffith Park, has taken in more than 200 horses, on top of the roughly 500 already living there.",
      "Last Tuesday and Wednesday were \"chaos\", said Jennie Nevin, a spokeswoman for the equestrian centre. The facility catalogued every horse that arrived, making sure they could be reunited. Sheltering the animals came at no cost for the owners, thanks to the support of public donations and frequent drop-offs of free hay, feed and other supplies.",
      "Sergio Marcial was one of dozens of people who brought animals here after their own facilities were destroyed or threatened.",
      "A week ago, he and his girlfriend Jenny Bacon raced to help rescue more than 70 animals from the Eaton Dam Stables while battling flames so intense that his face mask caught fire and his eyeglasses shattered and warped.",
      "His efforts landed him in the hospital, his lungs and throat burned after inhaling the torched air.",
      "One week later, Mr Marcial, 29, and Ms Bacon, 30, walked Arthur and Playboy - two miniature horses he helped save that night - around their new home. Here, they were safe from the fires, and they seemed calm and friendly despite everything they had endured.",
      "\"It still hurts to swallow,\" Mr Marcial said, pointing to a face mask he's required to wear to prevent infections. \"I'd do it all again - no question.\"",
      "Most of the sheltered animals' owners have been identified, and several owners spent Tuesday afternoon walking their horses around the stables.",
      "Dozens of volunteers cared for the other animals staying at the centre. Some had become local celebrities.",
      "Two donkeys, Morris and Mika, frequently poked their heads out of their stables to demand attention. They had fled down the mountain with their owner as the Palisades fire drew near, and were reunited because he had spray-painted his number on to their sides.",
      "\"They love for you to sing to them,\" said volunteer Lucena Herrera. \"We've all just been adopting them and taking care of them.\"",
      "But a handful of animals still have not been claimed. A miniature horse named Izzy had still not found her owner a week after the fires. The volunteers had collectively adopted her until she could find a new, permanent home.",
      "So many volunteers showed up to help the animals that the staff had to turn some away, Ms Nevin said. Between 50-100 volunteers now raked stalls, fed the animals, fluffed hay and serenaded Morris and Mika when they grew antsy.",
      "Watching owners reunite with their horses was one of the most valuable experiences for volunteers, said London Scott, founder of the local Cali Cowboy Club.",
      "\"It's a really beautiful process to go through,\" Ms Scott said, \"To be able to see that at first hand, and know that you had a small part in someone having a little peace of mind in a tragic moment in time.\"",
      "Those here describe a deep bond to their animals and say the farms that burned down are a place of peace in this bustling metropolitan area.",
      "\"They are my safe place,\" Catherine Armenta, 42, said. \"It's like a bond, a connection that I don't really have with anything else on this planet.\"",
      "Many of those here don't know what happens next, where they might take their animals after the chaos of the ongoing fires burning around the Los Angeles region ends.",

      "Norway is the world leader when it comes to the take up of electric cars, which last year accounted for nine out of 10 new vehicles sold in the country. Can other nations learn from it?",
      "For more than 75 years Oslo-based car dealership Harald A M\u00f8ller has been importing Volkswagens, but early in 2024 it bid farewell to fossil fuel cars.",
      "Now all the passenger vehicles for sale in its showroom are electric (EV).",
      "\"We think it's wrong to advise a customer coming in here today to buy an ICE [internal combustion engine] car, because the future is electric,\" says chief executive Ulf Tore Hekneby, as he walks around the cars on display. \"Long-range, high-charging speed. It's hard to go back.\"",
      "On the streets of Norway's capital, Oslo, battery-powered cars aren't a novelty, they're the norm. Take a look around and you'll soon notice that almost every other car has an \"E\" for \"electric\" on its licence plate.",
      "The Nordic nation of 5.5 million people has adopted EVs faster than any other country, and is on the cusp of becoming the first to phase out the sale of new fossil fuel cars.",
      "Last year, the number of electric cars on Norway's roads outnumbered those powered by petrol for the first time. When diesel vehicles are included, electric cars account for almost a third of all on Norwegian roads.",
      "And 88.9% of new cars sold in the country last year were EVs, up from 82.4% in 2023, data from the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) showed.",
      "In some months sales of fully electric cars were as high as 98%, as new petrol or diesel car purchases almost fizzled out.",
      "By contrast, in the UK electric cars made up only 20% of new car registrations in 2024. Although this was a record high, and up from 16.5% in 2023.",
      "In the US, the figure was just 8% last year, up from 7.6%.",
      "Norway is undoubtedly an EV pioneer, but this electric revolution has been three decades in the making.",
      "\"It started already in the early 1990s,\" says Christina Bu, the secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association, as she took me for a spin around Oslo in an electric minivan.",
      "\"Little by little taxing petrol and diesel engine cars more, so they have become a lot more expensive to purchase, whereas electric cars have been exempted from taxes.\"",
      "The support for electric vehicles was first introduced to help two Norwegian manufacturers of early EVs, the Buddy (previously Kewet) and TH!NK City. While they went out of business, the incentives for greener vehicles remained.",
      "\"It's our goal to see that it's always a good and viable choice, to choose zero emission,\" says Norway's Deputy Transport Minister, Cecilie Knibe Kroglund.",
      "Even though it's a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\", starting at some point in 2025. A non-binding goal was set back in 2017, and that milestone now lies within reach.",
      "\"We are closing up on the target, and I think that we will reach that goal,\" adds Kroglund. \"I think we have already made the transition for passengers cars.\"",
      "Key to Norway's success has been long-term and predictable policies, she explains.",
      "Rather than banning combustion engine vehicles, the government has steered consumer choices. In addition to penalising fuel fossil vehicles with higher taxes and registration fees, VAT and import duties were scrapped for low-emission cars.",
      "A string of perks, like free parking, discounted road tolls and access to bus lanes, then followed.",
      "By comparison, the European Union plans to ban sales of new fossil-fuel cars by 2035, and the UK's current government wants to prohibit their sale in 2030.",
      "Petrol and diesel car sales are still permitted in Norway. But few are choosing to buy them.",
      "For many locals, like St\u00e5le Fyen, who bought his first EV 15 months ago, going electric made economic sense.",
      "\"With all the incentives we have in Norway, with no taxes on EVs, that was quite important to us money wise,\" he says while plugging in his car at a charging station in the capital.",
      "\"In the cold, the range is maybe 20% shorter, but still, with the expansive charging network we have here in Norway, that isn't a big issue really,\" Mr Fyen adds. \"You just have to change your mindset and charge when you can, not when you need to.\"",
      "Another driver, Merete Eggesb\u00f8, says that back in 2014 she was one of the first people in Norway to own a Tesla. \"I really wanted a car that didn't pollute. It gave me a better conscience driving.\"",
      "At Norwegian petrol stations many fuel pumps have been replaced by fast-charging points, and across Norway there are now more than 27,000 public chargers.",
      "This compares with 73,699 in the UK - a country 12 times bigger in terms of population.",
      "That means that, per 100,000 people, Norway has 447 chargers while the UK has just 89, according to a recent report.",
      "Tesla, VW and Toyota, were Norway's top-selling EV brands last year. Meanwhile, Chinese-owned marques - such as MG, BYD, Polestar and XPeng - now make up a combined 10% of the market, according to the Norwegian Road Federation.",
      "Norway, unlike the US and EU, has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EV imports.",
      "Ms Bu says there's \"not really any reason why other countries can not copy Norway\". However, she adds that it is \"all about doing it in a way that can work in each country or market\".",
      "Norwegians aren't more environmentally-minded than people elsewhere, she reckons. \"I don't think a green mindset has much to do with it. It has to do with strong policies, and people gradually understanding that driving an electric car is possible.\"",
      "Yet Norway is also a very wealthy nation, which thanks to its huge oil and gas exports, has a sovereign wealth fund worth more than $1.7tn (\u00a31.3tn). This means it can more easily afford big infrastructure-build projects, and absorb the loss of tax revenue from the sale of petrol and diesel cars and their fuel.",
      "The country also has an abundance of renewable hydro electricity, which accounts for 88% of its production capacity.",
      "\"A third of cars are now electric, and it will pass 50% in a few years,\" says Kjell Werner Johansen from the Norwegian Centre for Transport Research. \"I think the government accepts that a few new petrol or hybrid cars will still be on the market, but I don't know anybody who wants to buy a diesel car these days.\"",

      "TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew will certainly hope so - the BBC's US partner CBS is reporting he will attend Trump's inauguration alongside former presidents and family members on 20 January.",
      "And whatever happens to the social media platform, who stands to benefit from the uncertainty clouding its future?",
      "Can people still use TikTok even if it's banned?",
      "The most likely way the US would ban TikTok is to order app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, to make it unavailable for download in that region.",
      "US lawmakers have already told  tech firms to be ready to remove the app from their stores if a ban comes into force.",
      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?",
      "Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "That would mean people could no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok - though it would also mean people who've already got it would still have it on their phones.",
      "Because the app would not be publicly available anymore, new updates could no longer be delivered to users in the US - which would make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable.",
      "Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target.",
      "Of course, there are ways around such a ban.",
      "There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region.",
      "The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements.",
      "It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks. However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app.",
      "So if the ban took this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to.",
      "How else could TikTok be banned?",
      "There are still other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether.",
      "And even if people did use a VPN, there are still ways TikTok could theoretically judge whether a person is based in the US - and then simply present them with a screen saying the app is not available in their country.",
      "It remains to be seen whether TikTok would decide to assist the government in its own ban - but it is being reported by Reuters that it plans to do so.",
      "TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US unless it rules in its favour.",
      "The complexity of the issue means even the experts are unclear about what happens next.",
      "Professor Milton L. Mueller of the Georgia Institute of Technology - who filed a legal brief in support of TikTok - said a lack of clarity around how far the US could extend its authority to enforce the law makes knowing what technically happens if a ban goes ahead difficult to determine.",
      "But he said what was clear was the impact it would have on users and the internet itself.",
      "\"It would totally legitimise the fragmentation of the internet along national or jurisdictional boundaries,\" he said.",
      "Will Trump still be able to intervene?",
      "Trump has been clear he is against the law - which would come into force the day before he returns to office - asking the Supreme Court to delay its implementation while he seeks a \"political solution.\"",
      "His incoming national security advised Mike Waltz told Fox News the president-elect was looking for ways to \"preserve\" TikTok regardless of the court's ruling, saying Americans' access to the platform and their data would be preserved.",
      "The precise mechanism for doing that is unclear, though - according to the Washington Post - one option under consideration is for Trump to sign an executive order which would suspend the enforcement the law.",
      "\"I don't want to get ahead of our executive orders, but we're going to create the space to put that deal in place,\" Mr Waltz said.",
      "Another option would be for Trump to allow the law to stand but tell the Department of Justice not to enforce it.",
      "The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google that they won't be punished for continuing to allow access to TikTok, meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant.",
      "Obviously, the firms might be uncomfortable about breaking the law even if they've been told it's fine - as it would be effectively requiring them to take the president's word for it that they won't face punishment.",
      "Could a new buyer still emerge?",
      "Up until now, ByteDance has been resolute that no sale of its prize asset in the US is on the table.",
      "But could that change if it is actually banned - and when a president who prides himself on \"the art of the deal\" returns to the White House?",
      "Potential buyers continue to line up - with Bloomberg News reporting on Tuesday that the firm was looking at a sale to billionaire Elon Musk, though TikTok has since described this as \"pure fiction\".",
      "Trump's former treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt are among those who have previously expressed an interest in  buying it.",
      "Mr McCourt, a former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, said he had secured $20 billion in verbal commitments from a consortium of investors to bid for TikTok.",
      "There is an even more leftfield - and considerably less serious - proposed owner.",
      "The biggest YouTuber in the world MrBeast has claimed he's now in the running to make a deal after he had billionaires reaching out to him about it.",
      "Though it may seem like a joke, he has a significant financial incentive to try and save the app - MrBeast has more than 100m followers on TikTok.",
      "What platforms could people turn to instead?",
      "TikTok says it has 170 million users in the US who, on average, spent 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024.",
      "Ban TikTok or make it less usable and that creates a huge opportunity for its big tech rivals says Jasmine Enberg, analyst at Insider Intelligence.",
      "\"Meta-owned Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, owned by Google, are the most natural fits for displaced users, creators, and advertisers,\" she says.",
      "Facebook could benefit too, though Ms Enberg says, in common with all Meta platforms, the controversial policy changes announced by boss Mark Zuckerberg could potentially lessen its appeal.",
      "Users bring advertisers - so a ban could be a big financial boost to those platforms.",
      "\"Chief Marketing Officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok - this is the same behaviour we saw in India when they banned TikTok in 2020\", said Forrester principal analyst Kelsey Chickering.",
      "Lemon8, which is also owned by ByteDance, would have been an obvious place for people to go following a ban - but the law stipulates it also applies to other apps owned or operated by the firm. This means Lemon8 is probably also going to face being made inaccessible in the US.",
      "Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name on hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though it continues to grow with other content.",
      "Other Chinese-owned platforms, such as Xiaohongshu - known as RedNote among its US users - have seen rapid growth in the US and the UK.",
      "Still, some suggest no existing app can truly replace TikTok, in particular its feature TikTok Shop, which lets users purchase products directly from videos, and makes a lot of money for US creators.",
      "Craig Atkinson, CEO of digital marketing agency Code3, said there was no direct competitor that people could easily switch to - and notes his agency was signing new contracts with clients to build TikTok Shop campaigns as late as December."

      "On Saturday, Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life at 14 after seeing harmful content online, said the UK was \"going backwards\" on the issue.",
      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",
      "The Conservative government had originally included in the legislation plans to compel social media companies to remove some \"legal-but-harmful\" content, such as posts promoting eating disorders.",
      "However the proposal triggered a backlash from critics, including the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who were concerned it could lead to censorship.",

      "The plan was dropped for adult social media users and instead companies were required to give users more control to filter out content they did not want to see. The law still expects companies to protect children from legal-but-harmful content.",
      "Kyle said the section on legal-but-harmful content had been taken out of the bill adding: \"So I inherited a landscape where we have a very uneven, unsatisfactory legislative settlement.\"",
      "He did not commit to making changes to the current legislation but said he was \"very open-minded\" on the subject.",

      "He said Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Meta which owns Facebook and Instagram, and Elon Musk, owner of the social media site X, were \"at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry\".",
      "He accused Zuckerberg of moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\" and \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to\".",
      "Earlier this week, Zuckerberg said Meta would be getting rid of fact checkers, and instead adopt a system \u2013 already introduced by X - of allowing users to add \"community notes\" to social media posts they deemed to be untrue.",
      "This marked a change from Meta's previous approach, introduced in 2016, whereby third party moderators would check posts on Facebook and Instagram that appeared to be false or misleading.",
      "Content flagged as inaccurate would be moved lower in users' feeds and accompanied by labels offering viewers more information on the subject.",
      "Defending the new system, Zuckerberg said moderators were \"too politically biased\" and it was \"time to get back to our roots around free expression\".",
      "The step comes as Meta seeks to improve relations with incoming US President Donald Trump who has previously accused the company of censoring right-wing voices.",
      "Zuckerberg said the change - which only applies in the US - would mean content moderators would \"catch less bad stuff\" but would also reduce the number of \"innocent\" posts being removed.",
      "Responding to Russell's criticism, a Meta spokesperson told the BBC there was \"no change to how we treat content that encourages suicide, self-injury, and eating disorders\" and said the company would \"continue to use our automated systems to scan for that high-severity content\".",
      "Asked about the change, Kyle said the announcement was \"an American statement for American service users\" adding: \"There is one thing that has not changed and that is the law of this land.\"",
      "\"If you come and operate in this country you abide by the law, and the law says illegal content must be taken down,\" he said.",
      "Rules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force later this year, compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide.",
      "The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography, material promoting self-harm, bullying and content encouraging dangerous stunts.",
      "Platforms will be expected to adopt \"age assurance technologies\" to prevent children from seeing harmful content.",
      "The law also requires companies to take action against illegal, state-sponsored disinformation. If their services are likely to be accessed by children they should also take steps to protect users against misinformation."

      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",
      "\"That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,\" says Dr Meier. The next \u2013 and \"even bigger milestone\" \u2013 will be when they start to come out the other end.",
      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",
      "Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.",
      "To help to do that, last year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.",
      "It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.",
      "It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.",
      "Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.",
      "When that happens, says Dr Gibson, \"it'll be obvious to the world that this is the way to go\"."

    "story": [
      "Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has told Donald Trump that it is up to Greenland to decide its own future.",
      "The US president-elect sparked turmoil in Copenhagen and Nuuk, Greenland's capital, last week when he signalled that the US wanted to acquire the huge arctic island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.",
      "In a 45-minute phone call on Wednesday, Frederiksen told Trump that Denmark was prepared to increase its responsibility for security in the Arctic.",
      "She also reiterated the statements of the Greenland PM, Mute Egede, who recently said that Greenland was not for sale.",
      "Trump did not react to the call publicly. However, he reposted on his TruthSocial account a 2019 poll that indicated 68% of Greenlanders supported independence from Denmark.",
      "A referendum on independence is thought to be on the cards and Denmark has said it would respect any result.",
      "When he was last president, Trump said he wanted to buy Greenland. When Frederiksen called the proposal \"absurd\", he abruptly cancelled a trip to Denmark.",
      "The Danish government said that in her phone call with Trump, Frederiksen also emphasised that \"Danish companies contribute to growth and jobs in the US, and that the EU and the US have a common interest in strengthened trade.\"",
      "Last week, Trump threatened Denmark with high tariffs if the country did not give up Greenland.",
      "The suggestion set off alarm bells among Danish industry leaders, as the US is Denmark's second largest export market and any targeted tariffs would have a significant impact on the Danish economy.",

      "On Thursday, Frederiksen will hold what Danish media dubbed a \"crisis meeting\" with business leaders, including the CEOs of beer giant Carlsberg and drugmaker Novo Nordisk, which produces obesity and diabetes drugs popular in the US.",
      "She is also due to host an extraordinary Foreign Policy Council meeting with members from across parliament.",
      "Greenlandic member of parliament Aaja Chemnitz said she was satisfied with Frederiksen's line that any decision about Greenland should be taken by Greenlanders.",
      "\"I have great confidence in the prime minister's task, and I also have great confidence in Egede. I think it is important that they have a close dialogue,\" she said.",
      "Earlier this week, Egede said his government was ready to start a dialogue with the incoming Trump administration.",
      "But opposition MP Rasmus Jarlov said that he disapproved of Frederiksen's approach.",
      "Writing on X, he said: \"It is completely unacceptable that [Frederiksen] renounces Denmark's rights in Greenland and places sovereignty solely with the [Greenlander] self-government when she talks to the President of the United States.\"",
      "Trump's comments and his son's visit to Greenland last week sparked huge concern in Denmark. Faced with the prospect of angering what she repeatedly called \"Denmark's closest ally\", Frederiksen measured her words while emphasising Greenland's right to self-determination.",
      "Hans Redder, TV2's political editor, said the fact that Trump had set aside 45 minutes for a phone call with Frederiksen indicated that \"this Greenland thing is really something that is on Trump's mind - it's not just a passing thought\".",

      "On Sunday, Isro said scientists had managed to reduce the distance between the Chaser and the Target first to 15metres and then to 3metres. They said after the trial attempt, the spacecraft were \"moved back to safe distance\" and that they were analysing data.",

      "To begin with, the two spacecraft had to be in the same orbit so that the Chaser could start to approach the Target.",
      "On Thursday morning, scientists began by gradually reducing the speed of the two spacecraft - bringing them ever closer until they were just 3 metres apart. Then their connectors were latched together.",
      "In the next step, the two spacecraft were screwed on perfectly, creating an airtight passage for safe transfer of material or crew, completing space docking.",
      "An Isro official told the BBC that over the next two-three days, the mission will carry out what is being billed as one of its most important experiments - it will transfer electrical power from the Chaser to Target.",
      "This, Ms Mitra, says is to demonstrate that a spacecraft can be sent to service another in space.",
      "The experiment will then demonstrate \"undocking and separation of the two satellites\".",
      "Ms Mitra says the mission will also test India's capabilities for inter-satellite communication as during the docking and undocking, the spacecraft will have to communicate with the Earth station and also with each other so that they know each other's position and velocity.",
      "The spacecraft are also carrying scientific instruments and cameras which will then be deployed. Over the next two years, they will measure radiation in space and monitor natural resources on Earth.",

    "story": [
      "Yoon Suk Yeol has become South Korea's first sitting president to be arrested after investigators scaled barricades and cut through barbed wire to take him into custody.",
      "Yoon, 64, is being investigated on charges of insurrection for a failed martial law order on 3 December that plunged the country into turmoil.",
      "He has also been impeached by parliament and suspended - but will only be removed from office if the Constitutional Court upholds the impeachment.",
      "However, Yoon's dramatic arrest on Wednesday brings to an end a weeks-long standoff between investigators and his presidential security team.",
      "Investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) failed to arrest him on 3 January after being locked in a six-hour stand-off with his security detail.",
      "But just before dawn on Wednesday, a much larger team of investigators and police arrived at his residence in central Seoul, armed with ladders to climb over buses blocking its entrance and bolt cutters to remove barbed wire.",
      "Other officers in the arrest team, which numbered around 1,000, scaled walls and hiked up nearby trails to reach the presidential residence.",
      "After several hours, authorities announced that Yoon had been arrested.",
      "In a three-minute video released just before his arrest, the 64-year-old leader said he would co-operate with the investigators, while repeating previous claims that the warrant was not legally valid.",
      "\"I decided to appear before the CIO, even though it is an illegal investigation, in order to prevent any unsavoury bloodshed,\" he said, adding that he witnessed officials \"invade\" his home's security perimeter with fire equipment.",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, investigators said Yoon had remained silent throughout questioning.",
      "Yoon's lawyers have said his arrest was \"illegal\" because the CIO, as an anti-corruption agency, has no power to investigate the insurrection allegations against Yoon. They also claim the warrant was issued by the wrong jurisdiction.",
      "The same court later dismissed an injunction filed by President Yoon to invalidate the arrest warrant, which the authorities maintain is lawful.",
      "The opposition Democratic Party's floor leader, Park Chan-dae, said Wednesday's arrest showed that \"justice in South Korea is alive\".",
      "This arrest \"is the first step toward restoring constitutional order, democracy and the rule of law\", he said during a party meeting.",
      "The country is currently being led by Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok as acting president. He was thrust into power after the first acting president, Han Duck-soo, was also impeached by parliament, where the opposition has a sizeable majority.",
      "What's next for Yoon?",
      "The clock has started ticking for investigators.",
      "Under the current warrant, they can hold Yoon for up to 48 hours from the point of arrest, after which they need a new warrant to detain him while he continues to be investigated.",
      "If that warrant is granted, they can detain him for up to 20 days before he is brought to trial. Without a new warrant, Yoon must be released.",
      "Late on Wednesday, local media reported Yoon was questioned in the CIO's office until 21:40 before being taken to Seoul Detention Centre, approximately 5km (3 miles) away in Uiwang, Gyeonggi Province.",
      "Pro-Yoon supporters continued to protest against the arrest outside the CIO's office.",
      "They had gathered outside his house since before dawn on Wednesday, along with those opposing him.",
      "The anti-Yoon crowd blasted out a \"congratulations and celebrations\" song when his arrest was announced, cheering and clapping at what they see as a success for law enforcement.",
      "Yoon's supporters, however, were dismayed. \"We are very upset and angry. The rule of law has broken down,\" one of them told the BBC.",

      "As Yoon faces questioning over the charges, the nation remains gripped by uncertainty, with no clear resolution to the widening political divide.",
      "How things got to this point",
      "South Korea has been gripped by political turmoil since Yoon's stunning but short-lived martial law declaration on 3 December, which saw many MPs climb fences and break barricades to enter the National Assembly to vote down the order.",
      "The president said he was protecting the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea, but it soon became clear that he was spurred by his own political troubles.",
      "Yoon has been a lame duck president since the opposition won the general election last April by a landslide - his government has been reduced to vetoing bills proposed by the opposition.",
      "An unprecedented few weeks followed, with parliament voting to impeach Yoon, his subsequent suspension and authorities launching a criminal investigation over the attempt.",
      "Several of the country's top leaders - including former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who reportedly suggested the martial law declaration - and Yoon's political aides have since also resigned.",
      "Tens of thousands of South Koreans have also braved freezing temperatures and taken to the streets in recent weeks, with some showing their support for Yoon and others calling for him to be removed from office.",
      "All this while Yoon has remained holed up in his residence, refusing to comply with multiple summonses to appear for questioning, a defiant stance that led the authorities to arrest him.",
      "Separately, the Constitutional Court has begun a trial to decide if he should be permanently removed from office, with observers saying it could deliver a ruling as early as February. Its next hearing is due to take place on Thursday.",

      "\"But with Trump, we're going to do it correctly.\"",
      "The region is separated from Mexico only by the dark, shallow, narrow waters of the river and patches of dense vegetation and mesquite - locals say that the day-to-day realities of living on the border have increasingly opened their eyes to what many see as the dangers of illegal immigration.",
      "\"I've had families [of migrants] come knocking on my backdoor, asking for water, for shelter,\" said Amanda Garcia, a resident of Starr County, where nearly 97% of residents identify as Latino, making it the most Latino county in the US outside of Puerto Rico.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 00:08:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The Nordic nation doesn't require staff to work long hours and has a generous welfare system.",
    "story": [
      "Gabriel Hoces repeats a word seven times when he discusses what it's like to work in Denmark - \"trust\".",
      "\"No one is trying to micromanage you, or look over your shoulder,\" says Mr Hoces, who works for a tech firm in Copenhagen. \"Bosses aren't coming in to check if you put in eight or nine hours a day, as they mainly only care if you completed your projects.",
      "\"There's a lot of trust in Denmark in that way, and I don't feel a hierarchy at my job. It's all very democratic.\"",
      "It is no surprise to Mr Hoces, a married father of two young daughters, that Denmark is consistently among the top-five countries in the world for work-life balance rankings.",
      "Only 1.1% of Danes have to work 50 or more hours a week, according to the most recent global figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). That's a significantly lower proportion than the world average of 10.2%.",
      "By contrast, the figure for the UK is 10.8% and the US is 10.4%.",
      "Meik Wiking, author of the book The Art of Danish Living, has long regarded his home country as a shining example of what other countries should aspire to mimic with their workplace policies.",
      "\"Danes are actually happy at work,\" he tells the BBC. \"Almost 60% of Danes say they would continue to work if they won the lottery and became financially independent.\"",
      "Mr Wiking, who is also the boss of Danish think tank The Happiness Research Institute, shares several policies that help generate a strong work-life balance in Denmark.",
      "These include the right to a minimum five weeks of paid vacation per year, in addition to public holidays. In the UK most workers are entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid leave, but in the US it can be as low as  just 11 days.",
      "Denmark also offers a very generous six months of paid maternity and paternity leave. In the UK the father, or non-birthing partner, typically gets one to two weeks of paid leave.",
      "In the US there is only a federal guarantee of unpaid parental leave, although some states, such as California, now offer paid time away from work after the birth of a child. And federal employees can get 12-weeks of paid leave.",
      "Mr Wiking is another Dane who cites the concept of bosses trusting their employees to do the right thing. He uses the example of staff at the Tivoli Gardens amusement park in Copenhagen, where they follow the three-metre rule.",
      "The idea is that you are CEO of everything within a radius of three metres. \"If you see garbage within your three-metre radius you pick it up, and if you see a guest looking for something, you stop and ask them if you can help,\" says Mr Wiking.",
      "He adds that when staff take ownership of their own space it can help them feel empowered and appreciated, which goes a long way to contributing to a healthy sentiment about their workplace.",
      "Janine Leschke, a professor in the department of management, society and communication at the Copenhagen Business School, says Denmark is definitely \"not a work culture where you have to show up and be available all day, all evening, to show that you're working hard all the time\".",
      "Instead, she says flexibility during the workday gives employees the time they need to, say, pick up their children from school or day care. \"The day doesn't have to officially end at five or six, and that's appealing to a lot of Danes with kids.\"",
      "Mr Hoces has noticed how some employers in the US may expect their staff to be available over weekends, to answer the odd email or message. That kind of overtime doesn't fit with his outlook on a positive work-life balance.",
      "\"If I was expected to take calls on the weekend, that would be a huge red flag to me, and I would likely change jobs,\" he says. \"But so far that hasn't happened to me or anyone I know.\"",
      "Casper Rouchmann, a Copenhagen-based CEO and founder of tech firm SparkForce, says his relaxed leadership policy would be familiar to most Danes. \"You don't need to ask me to leave early,\" he says. \"No one takes advantage of my kindness.\"",
      "Mr Rouchmann adds that the element of trust is so ingrained in Danish culture, visitors to Denmark are often aghast at how far it can go. He also highlights Denmark's generous welfare state, and the fact that firms have to give financial compensation to staff who are made redundant.",
      "\"If you lose your job, the government is there to help,\" adds Mr Rouchmann.",
      "As much as other countries can learn from Denmark's work-life balance, he says it has some downsides. \"Some people can rely too much on that safety net, and it might say to them that they don't have to take real risks, which is why we can be less entrepreneurial compared to the US.\"",
      "Samantha Saxby, an American human resources expert, says Denmark has such a good work-life balance because the country \"prioritises collective well-being\".",
      "By contrast, she says the US \"has long emphasised individual achievement and ambition, which has driven tremendous innovation, but often at the cost of work-life balance\".",
      "Yet Ms Saxby, who is director of marketing for the US National Human Resources Association, says that companies in the US and elsewhere around the world may be finally following the lead of Denmark and the other equally happy Nordic nations.",
      "\"Progressive organisations are introducing benefits like unlimited paid time off, mental health days, and wellness programs, to encourage employees to prioritise self-care,\" she says. \"These measures not only alleviate pressure, but also demonstrate that employers value their workforce's overall well-being.",
      "\"More companies are recognising that well-rested and balanced employees bring fresh ideas, better problem-solving skills, and greater engagement.  Employees are beginning to feel empowered to take the time they need without sacrificing career growth.\"",

    "story": [
      "Many people in Somaliland are convinced that the United States, under the incoming presidency of Donald Trump, is poised to become the world's first country to recognise the self-declared republic.",
      "The territory declared independence 33 years ago after Somalia descended into civil war -  and in many ways has functioned as a de facto nation-state ever since.",
      "\"Donald is our saviour. He is a wise and practical man. God bless America,\" says university student Aisha Ismail, whose voice trembles with delight at the prospect.",
      "She is speaking to me from Hargeisa, Somaliland's capital  - a city 850km (530 miles) north of  Mogadishu, the seat of Somalia's government.",
      "For those in Mogadishu, Somaliland is an indivisible part of Somalia.",
      "\"I doubt Donald Trump knows what Somaliland is, never mind where it is,\" says Abdi Mohamud, a data analyst in Mogadishu, whose voice starts to shake.",
      "\"I am spitting fire.\"",
      "He is so angry because Ms Ismail's great expectation is not necessarily a pipe dream, at least in the long term.",
      "Powerful and influential Republicans are pushing for the same thing, including Congressman Scott Perry who last month introduced a bill proposing formal US recognition for Somaliland.",
      "It followed the publication in April 2023 of Project 2025, a roadmap for the second Trump presidency compiled by the prominent right-wing Heritage Foundation and more than 100 other conservative organisations",
      "The document mentions only two African territories in its sub-Saharan Africa section - Somaliland and Djibouti  - and proposes \"the recognition of Somaliland statehood as a hedge against the US's deteriorating position in Djibouti\".",
      "However, the fact that sub-Saharan Africa takes up less than two pages in the 900-plus page plan suggests the continent is very low on the priority list.",
      "Also, there is no guarantee the incoming administration will follow the blueprint, some of which Trump has already disavowed.",
      "But one thing is clear. The US has already started to change its stance on Somaliland, moving away from its Mogadishu-focused approach, known as the \"one-track\" Somalia policy.",
      "Somalia has cost the US dearly in financial, resource and human terms since the early 1990s when the bodies of 18 American servicemen were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu after US helicopters were shot down by Somali clan fighters.",
      "The battle, known as \"Black Hawk Down\", was America's worst in terms of casualties since the Vietnam War.",
      "\"Any move towards recognising Somaliland's independence would not only contravene Somalia's sovereignty but also destabilise the region by setting a dangerous precedent,\" says Somali State Minister for Foreign Affairs Ali Mohamed Omar.",
      "The African Union and other global powers believe territorial integrity is paramount. Recognising Somaliland could set off a chain reaction with separatists across the world demanding recognition for the territories they claim.",
      "Omar also highlighted concerns about a possible repeat of the first Trump administration's decision to withdraw from Somalia most American troops who have been fighting al-Shabab, regularly described as al-Qaeda's most successful affiliate.",
      "Under Joe Biden's presidency about 500 US troops have been stationed in Somalia - carrying out special operations and training an elite Somali force, Danab, which means \"Lightning\" and has proved more effective than the regular Somali army at rooting out al-Shabab.",
      "The Americans have an airbase at Baledogle, north-west of Mogadishu, and conduct regular airstrikes against Islamist insurgents.",
      "\"A withdrawal would create a significant security vacuum, emboldening terrorist groups and threatening the stability of not only Somalia but the broader Horn of Africa,\" Omar warned.",
      "The minister's remarks are in a similar vein but more measured than Somalia's response to a deal between Somaliland and Ethiopia whereby recognition would reportedly be granted in exchange for sea access.",
      "I received late-night calls from Somalis who said they were unable to sleep over the controversial proposal.",
      "Somalia's then-Environment Minister Aden Ibrahim Aw Hirsi told me at the time: \"You are always going on about 'political bombshells' in your reporting.",
      "\"People here are talking about a political earthquake. This is far more serious. It is a tsunami.\"",
      "Turkey has since mediated an end to the feud but the fact that Somalia recently signed a $600,000 (\u00a3492,000) a year deal with top Washington lobbying firm, the BGR Group, suggests it is worried about relations with the incoming Trump administration.",
      "The US last month abstained from voting on a UN Security Council resolution to fund the latest incarnation of the African Union intervention force in Somalia.",
      "A key architect of Republican Africa thinking, especially when it comes to Somali issues, is Joshua Meservey, who recently moved from the Heritage Foundation to the right-leaning Hudson Institute.",
      "\"The case for Somaliland in US terms is very compelling,\" he argues. \"I think the question of recognition will definitely be discussed, although the guiding north star is what is best for US national interests in practical terms.\"",
      "Senior Africa officials under Trump mark one, including the former Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Tibor Nagy, and Africa envoy, Peter Pham, are energetic supporters of Somaliland's independence.",
      "Like many American Republicans, Somaliland's Foreign Minister Abdirahman Dahir Adan sees the relationship in transactional terms.",
      "\"If the deal is good for us, we will take it. If the US wants a military base here we will give it to them.\"",
      "Recognition sympathisers argue that Somaliland is located at the site of several converging US interests - economic, military and strategic.",
      "Mr Meservey adds that the territory should be \"rewarded\" for adhering to democratic principles, not relying on foreign aid and having a small government.",
      "Its long coastline runs along one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.",
      "Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels may have replaced Somali pirates as the main disruptor of traffic in the area but the attacks remain a major threat to global trade and draw the region closer to the war in the Middle East.",
      "The scramble for foreign bases along the Horn of Africa's coast is of concern to the US, which established its largest military facility on the continent in Djibouti in 2002.",
      "Russia has its eyes on Port Sudan; the United Arab Emirates (UAE) used Eritrea's Assab to fight the Houthis and Djibouti is chock-a-block with foreign forces, including the Chinese, who not only have a well-placed military facility but also run the huge port.",
      "Turkey's largest base on foreign soil stretches along Somalia's coastline just south of Mogadishu.",
      "Dealing with a rising China is a top Trump priority.",
      "The US has accused the Chinese of interfering with its activities in Djibouti by shining lasers into the eyes of its air force pilots and is keen to move elsewhere.",
      "It also wants to disrupt China's Belt and Road Initiative, which is taking over much of Africa.",
      "The Red Sea port of Berbera, whether you see it as part of Somaliland or Somalia, has much to offer as an alternative.",
      "China is not there; indeed it is outraged that Taiwan in 2020 established diplomatic relations with the breakaway republic.",
      "The UAE, a key US ally, runs the recently expanded port and hopes it will rival Djibouti.",
      "During the Biden administration, top American officials, including the chief of US Africa Command (Africom), conducted site visits of Berbera, which has a 4km  runway ironically constructed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.",
      "This was later identified by the US as an emergency landing site for space shuttles - interesting given Trump's ally Elon Musk's obsession with space.",
      "In 2022, the US National Defence Authorisation Act was amended to include Somaliland, enhancing security co-operation and potentially paving the way for stronger diplomatic and economic ties.",
      "Pro-recognition Republicans have presented Somaliland as a good business case, hoping to appeal to Trump's deal-making approach. Project 2025 used the term \"hedge\".",
      "A US-based Somaliland diplomat said: \"It depends how they sell it to him. They have to make it attractive; they have to seduce him.\"",
      "Whether he means it or not, bringing up the explosive issue of recognition would likely suit Trump the disruptor.",
      "It would certainly bring him attention and he could boast about being first.",

    "summary": "The country is deeply polarised by the president's attempt to impose martial law.",
    "story": [
      "Tears, dismayed cries and shocked faces: that was the reaction among the supporters of South Korea's suspended president Yoon Suk Yeol outside his home on hearing that he had been arrested.",
      "It was a moment that had been in the making for weeks - ever since the last attempt to arrest Yoon on 3 January had failed after a dramatic standoff.",
      "Yet, when the news of his arrest came on Wednesday morning, it only seemed to create more uncertainty \u2013 and highlight the divide in a country that has already been deeply polarised by Yoon's short-lived martial law order and impeachment by parliament.",
      "\"This country is in crisis,\" said one pro-Yoon woman, tears streaming down her face. \"I've been praying since last night for a stable and peaceful South Korea.\"",
      "It's what both sides say they want but they cannot agree on how to get there.",
      "For the past month, a defiant 64-year-old Yoon was holed up inside his presidential compound in central Seoul, as his supporters and detractors rallied outside. They had turned Yongsan in central Seoul into an epicentre of protest, with tensions often running high.",
      "Hundreds of them had camped out overnight on Tuesday, as the arrest appeared imminent, in temperatures that plummeted to -8C. The only thing they shared was the food trucks keeping them warm with steaming drinks and instant noodles.",
      "Yoon's supporters jostled with the police officers - numbering 3,000 \u2013 who assembled to take him into custody. \"Don't call us stupid far-rights,\" one protester shouted, reflecting the frustration in the Yoon camp.",
      "A starkly different scene unfolded on the other side of the street. Opponents of Yoon, who had long called for his arrest, celebrated with chants and cheers.",
      "Their jubilation only made the pro-Yoon camp angrier, with some yelling: \"Don't taunt us - this is not funny.\"",
      "The gulf is not restricted to this corner of Yongsan. It has loomed over the whole country for more than a month.",
      "Yoon's shock announcement of martial law on 3 December almost instantly divided public opinion into two camps.",
      "While some believed his claims the country was under threat, a larger group viewed the move as an opportunistic abuse of power. This sentiment was reflected even within Yoon's own party, as several of its lawmakers voted to impeach him.",
      "Why has it been so hard to arrest S Korea's impeached president?",
      "A dawn stand-off, a human wall and a failed arrest: South Korea enters uncharted territory",
      "Who is Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's arrested president?",
      "The growing opposition to Yoon's actions has cast a pall over the nation.",
      "The year-end season in South Korea is usually vibrant. But this year has been noticeably different. The political turmoil \u2013 along with the devastating Jeju Air crash on 29 December \u2013 has created a subdued and sombre atmosphere.",
      "Yoon himself had largely avoided the public since he was impeached by parliament in mid-December.",
      "He never stepped out of his residence to meet his supporters. On New Year's Day, he sent them a note, saying he was \"closely watching [them] via a YouTube livestream\". He skipped the first hearing of his impeachment trial on 14 January, delaying the proceedings.",
      "Before that he had refused to comply with multiple summonses as part of the criminal investigation on insurrection charges, which led to the arrest warrant.",
      "On Wednesday, he released a video statement saying he would co-operate with the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) to avoid \"bloodshed\", while claiming their arrest warrant was not legally valid.",
      "It was a massive operation, which followed a warning from the CIO that the presidential security team could also be arrested if they tried to block Yoon's arrest again. Unlike last time, the CIO and police were successful in detaining Yoon, although it still took hours to negotiate.",
      "Once he left the presidential compound, the streets surrounding it began to empty. Protesters dispersed and the police barricades were removed.",
      "Some of Yoon's supporters moved to the CIO office where he is being questioned. They need another warrant to detain him for more than 48 hours.",
      "While Yoon's arrest has concluded the security standoff, it has not ended the rift that exists well beyond it in South Korea, which in recent decades has emerged as a leading global economy and beacon of democracy in Asia.",

    "story": [
      "The area in Gaza which Israel's military has told people to go to \"for their safety\" has been hit by 97 strikes since May, BBC Verify analysis has revealed.",
      "The findings come as negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appear to be nearing a breakthrough. Mediators in Qatar say talks are in their final stages, raising hopes that an agreement could be reached soon.",
      "The \"humanitarian zone\" was first established by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in October 2023 to protect civilians and keep them out of harms way.",
      "On 6 May 2024, the IDF significantly expanded the zone to include the cities of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah.",
      "The area - much of which is a strip of land along the Mediterranean sea - is densely populated and is estimated to have over a million people living there according to international humanitarian organisations. Many people are living in tents, with limited infrastructure and limited access to aid.",
      "Local media reports indicate more than 550 people have been killed in the 97 strikes mapped by BBC Verify.",
      "In a statement to BBC Verify, the IDF said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating in the \"humanitarian zone\" and accused the group of violating international law while \"exploiting\" civilians as human shields and launching rockets from the area.",
      "Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's 7 October 2023 attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",
      "The conflict has caused widespread damage to infrastructure across Gaza, with satellite images showing areas flattened by Israeli strikes. The Hamas-run health ministry also says more than 46,600 people have been killed within the enclave since the start of the war.",
      "BBC Verify analysis suggests that attacks within the \"humanitarian zone\" have intensified since May 2024, with at least 22 strikes already recorded so far this month.",
      "We also cannot confirm that all incidents are the result of IDF attacks. Locations of strikes documented by BBC Verify were provided to the IDF but they did not confirm or deny their involvement. Israeli military officials have only publicly acknowledged 28 attacks since 6 May.",
      "Israel historically has not publicly acknowledged every strike it has carried out in Gaza.",
      "Gavin Kelleher, an access manager in Gaza for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said there were \"near daily\" strikes within the zone, including from Israeli ships and quadcopters, or small drones.",
      "He added that \"heavy fire is recurrent in this area despite its [Israel's] unilateral 'humanitarian' designation.\"",
      "\"The Israeli military appears keen to maintain the illusion of a Humanitarian Zone that remains a certain size, yet that zone can be subject to 'evacuation orders' at any time and be targeted,\" Mr Kelleher said.",
      "One resident who lives within the zone, Khaled Abdel Rahman, told the BBC that residents were being subjected to daily bombardments, frequently resulting in injuries and casualties.",
      "\"We were displaced to Khan Younis because it was designated as a safe zone, but in fact we find nothing here but insecurity,\" Mr Rahman said. \"We have been denied the true sense of security, with fear dominating our lives.\"",
      "As Israel does not allow foreign reporters access to Gaza - apart from highly controlled, escorted trips with its military - international media, including the BBC, is reliant on imagery gathered by Palestinian journalists and Gaza residents.",
      "To track attacks within the IDF's \"humanitarian area\", BBC Verify monitored Palestinian social media channels and official IDF channels on Instagram, Telegram and X. Reports of strikes that included verified imagery from within the boundaries of the zone were then cross-referenced with local media reports to determine a reported death toll.",
      "It's important to note that death tolls cannot be verified based solely on videos and social media reports. BBC Verify analysis excluded reports of fatalities where there wasn't verifiable imagery which confirmed the incident happened within the IDF-defined boundaries of the \"humanitarian area\".",
      "BBC Verify reviewed more than 300 videos and photos posted since May in the \"humanitarian zone\". While it is not always possible to distinguish between fighters and civilians, the footage shows scores of people, including women and children, being pulled from rubble. Some appeared lifeless, while others were severely burned or had significant limb injuries, alongside collapsed buildings, destroyed tents and burnt-out cars.",
      "Seven of the documented strikes are reported to have killed 20 or more people each, with the most deadly on 13 July resulting in more than 90 deaths, according to the Gaza health ministry, first responders and medics.",
      "The IDF later said Hamas military chief, Mohammed Deif, was among the dead. Deif is accused of being one of the figures responsible for planning the 7 October attacks.",
      "Nine strikes occurred within 100m of buildings belonging to Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah, and four within 150m of the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.",
      "The IDF told BBC Verify the strikes were conducted \"against terrorists and terror infrastructures including rocket launchers, weapons warehouse and manufacturing sites, operational apartments, underground infrastructure, operational headquarters, and terrorists hideout.\"",
      "They also included links to six of their previously published statements about Hamas fighters operating in the \"humanitarian zone\".",
      "Residents in the zone also live under constant uncertainty. Including evacuation notices, the boundary of the \"humanitarian area\" has changed 20 times - and it has varied in size from around 7 km sq (2.7 sq miles) when it was first introduced to 72 km sq (27.8 sq miles) at its largest.",
      "The IDF said evacuation notices \"do not constitute as a reduction of the humanitarian zone. Once the danger has passed, the residents return\". But it's unclear how residents know it's safe to return, and the IDF has only twice posted to social media to explicitly say so. BBC Verify did not include strikes inside areas where evacuation notices were issued in our tally.",
      "While Israel's military has avoided using the term \"safe zone\", its statements have led civilians to interpret the \"humanitarian zone\" as such. IDF evacuation notices include language that tells civilians - like this one which was issued in mid-December - \"for your own safety, move immediately west to the humanitarian area\".",
      "It has also described the zone as being \"designated for humanitarian aid and shelters as part of the IDF's consistent efforts to protect the uninvolved population.\"",
      "But the UN and international humanitarian organisations operating in Gaza have said there's no such thing as a \"safe zone\" that is unilaterally enforced.",
      "Juliette Touma of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said: \"We have said it so so many times. There is no safe zone in Gaza. No place is safe. No-one is safe. No place is spared.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 12:26:22 GMT",
    "summary": "Could there be ways to bypass the ban - and could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop the law?",
    "story": [
      "TikTok will be banned in the US on 19 January - unless the Supreme Court accepts a last ditch legal bid from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, that to do so would be unconstitutional.",
      "But even if the country's highest judicial authority agrees with the lower courts - and Congress - that the platform is a threat to national security will that actually stop Americans using it?",
      "Will there be ways to bypass the ban - or could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop a law he says he is opposed to, even if the courts uphold it?",
      "TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew will certainly hope so - the BBC's US partner CBS is reporting he will attend Trump's inauguration alongside former presidents and family members on 20 January.",
      "And whatever happens to the social media platform, who stands to benefit from the uncertainty clouding its future?",
      "Can people still use TikTok even if it's banned?",
      "The most likely way the US would ban TikTok is to order app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, to make it unavailable for download in that region.",
      "US lawmakers have already told  tech firms to be ready to remove the app from their stores if a ban comes into force.",
      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?",
      "Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "That would mean people could no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok - though it would also mean people who've already got it would still have it on their phones.",
      "Because the app would not be publicly available anymore, new updates could no longer be delivered to users in the US - which would make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable.",
      "Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target.",
      "Of course, there are ways around such a ban.",
      "There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region.",
      "The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements.",
      "It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks. However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app.",
      "So if the ban took this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to.",
      "How else could TikTok be banned?",
      "There are still other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether.",
      "And even if people did use a VPN, there are still ways TikTok could theoretically judge whether a person is based in the US - and then simply present them with a screen saying the app is not available in their country.",
      "It remains to be seen whether TikTok would decide to assist the government in its own ban - but it is being reported by Reuters that it plans to do so.",
      "TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US unless it rules in its favour.",
      "The complexity of the issue means even the experts are unclear about what happens next.",
      "Professor Milton L. Mueller of the Georgia Institute of Technology - who filed a legal brief in support of TikTok - said a lack of clarity around how far the US could extend its authority to enforce the law makes knowing what technically happens if a ban goes ahead difficult to determine.",
      "But he said what was clear was the impact it would have on users and the internet itself.",
      "\"It would totally legitimise the fragmentation of the internet along national or jurisdictional boundaries,\" he said.",
      "Will Trump still be able to intervene?",
      "Trump has been clear he is against the law - which would come into force the day before he returns to office - asking the Supreme Court to delay its implementation while he seeks a \"political solution.\"",
      "His incoming national security advised Mike Waltz told Fox News the president-elect was looking for ways to \"preserve\" TikTok regardless of the court's ruling, saying Americans' access to the platform and their data would be preserved.",
      "The precise mechanism for doing that is unclear, though - according to the Washington Post - one option under consideration is for Trump to sign an executive order which would suspend the enforcement the law.",
      "\"I don't want to get ahead of our executive orders, but we're going to create the space to put that deal in place,\" Mr Waltz said.",
      "Another option would be for Trump to allow the law to stand but tell the Department of Justice not to enforce it.",
      "The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google that they won't be punished for continuing to allow access to TikTok, meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant.",
      "Obviously, the firms might be uncomfortable about breaking the law even if they've been told it's fine - as it would be effectively requiring them to take the president's word for it that they won't face punishment.",
      "Could a new buyer still emerge?",
      "Up until now, ByteDance has been resolute that no sale of its prize asset in the US is on the table.",
      "But could that change if it is actually banned - and when a president who prides himself on \"the art of the deal\" returns to the White House?",
      "Potential buyers continue to line up - with Bloomberg News reporting on Tuesday that the firm was looking at a sale to billionaire Elon Musk, though TikTok has since described this as \"pure fiction\".",
      "Trump's former treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt are among those who have previously expressed an interest in  buying it.",
      "Mr McCourt, a former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, said he had secured $20 billion in verbal commitments from a consortium of investors to bid for TikTok.",
      "There is an even more leftfield - and considerably less serious - proposed owner.",
      "The biggest YouTuber in the world MrBeast has claimed he's now in the running to make a deal after he had billionaires reaching out to him about it.",
      "Though it may seem like a joke, he has a significant financial incentive to try and save the app - MrBeast has more than 100m followers on TikTok.",
      "What platforms could people turn to instead?",
      "TikTok says it has 170 million users in the US who, on average, spent 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024.",
      "Ban TikTok or make it less usable and that creates a huge opportunity for its big tech rivals says Jasmine Enberg, analyst at Insider Intelligence.",
      "\"Meta-owned Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, owned by Google, are the most natural fits for displaced users, creators, and advertisers,\" she says.",
      "Facebook could benefit too, though Ms Enberg says, in common with all Meta platforms, the controversial policy changes announced by boss Mark Zuckerberg could potentially lessen its appeal.",
      "Users bring advertisers - so a ban could be a big financial boost to those platforms.",
      "\"Chief Marketing Officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok - this is the same behaviour we saw in India when they banned TikTok in 2020\", said Forrester principal analyst Kelsey Chickering.",
      "Lemon8, which is also owned by ByteDance, would have been an obvious place for people to go following a ban - but the law stipulates it also applies to other apps owned or operated by the firm. This means Lemon8 is probably also going to face being made inaccessible in the US.",
      "Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name on hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though it continues to grow with other content.",
      "Other Chinese-owned platforms, such as Xiaohongshu - known as RedNote among its US users - have seen rapid growth in the US and the UK.",
      "Still, some suggest no existing app can truly replace TikTok, in particular its feature TikTok Shop, which lets users purchase products directly from videos, and makes a lot of money for US creators.",
      "Craig Atkinson, CEO of digital marketing agency Code3, said there was no direct competitor that people could easily switch to - and notes his agency was signing new contracts with clients to build TikTok Shop campaigns as late as December."

      "Neither the Egyptian government nor the boat operators - Dive Pro Liveaboard, based in Hurghada - have responded to our questions.",
      "On Tuesday, the BBC revealed multiple accusations from survivors of safety failings on board the vessel. A leading oceanographer who analysed weather data also said it was not plausible that a huge wave had hit the vessel.",
      "'Interrogated' from hospital beds",
      "Within hours of being brought ashore, survivors say they were subjected to what one described as \"an interrogation\", some from their hospital beds, by people they were told were judges.",

      "Last Tuesday and Wednesday were \"chaos\", said Jennie Nevin, a spokeswoman for the equestrian centre. The facility catalogued every horse that arrived, making sure they could be reunited. Sheltering the animals came at no cost for the owners, thanks to the support of public donations and frequent drop-offs of free hay, feed and other supplies.",
      "Sergio Marcial was one of dozens of people who brought animals here after their own facilities were destroyed or threatened.",
      "A week ago, he and his girlfriend Jenny Bacon raced to help rescue more than 70 animals from the Eaton Dam Stables while battling flames so intense that his face mask caught fire and his eyeglasses shattered and warped.",
      "His efforts landed him in the hospital, his lungs and throat burned after inhaling the torched air.",
      "One week later, Mr Marcial, 29, and Ms Bacon, 30, walked Arthur and Playboy - two miniature horses he helped save that night - around their new home. Here, they were safe from the fires, and they seemed calm and friendly despite everything they had endured.",

    "summary": "What we know so far about the ceasefire deal agreed between Israel and Hamas.",
    "story": [
      "Israel and Hamas have agreed a deal which would halt the war in Gaza and see the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, the US and mediators Qatar have said.",
      "It is the most significant breakthrough in 15 months of war, which began when the armed Palestinian group Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023.",
      "What is in the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas?",
      "Details of the deal reportedly approved by both sides have not yet been officially announced.",
      "As it stands, a completed deal would see the war in Gaza stop, an exchange of hostages and prisoners, the withdrawal of Israeli troops and return of displaced Palestinians.",
      "Hamas seized 251 hostages when it attacked Israel in October 2023. It is still holding 94 captive, although Israel believes that only 60 are still alive.",
      "Israel is expected to release about 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, some jailed for years, in return for the hostages.",

      "Why is there a war in Gaza?",
      "Follow live updates on this story",
      "How would the ceasefire work?",
      "This ceasefire is expected to happen in three stages.",
      "And while both sides are now said to have agreed to it, Israel's security cabinet and government will need to approve the deal before it can be implemented.",
      "Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani said the agreement would come into effect on Sunday should it be approved.",
      "Here is what is understood to be in the deal.",
      "First stage",
      "The first stage would last six weeks and see \"a full and complete ceasefire\", US President Joe Biden said as he confirmed a deal had been reached on Wednesday.",
      "Hostages in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners in Israel would be freed, and Gazans who have been displaced allowed to start returning home.",
      "\"A number of hostages\" held by Hamas, including women, the elderly and the sick, would be released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, Biden said.",
      "He did not specify how many hostages would be released during this first stage - but Qatar's Al Thani told a news conference on Wednesday that it would be 33.",
      "Israeli government spokesman David Mencer previously said most but not all of the 33 - which include children - were thought to still be alive.",
      "Three hostages would be released straight away, a Palestinian official previously told the BBC, with the rest of the exchange taking place over the six weeks.",
      "During this stage, Israeli troops would pull out of \"all\" populated areas of Gaza, Biden said, while \"the Palestinians [could] also return to their neighbourhoods in all the areas of Gaza\".",
      "Almost all of Gaza's 2.3 million people have had to leave their homes as Israel has carried out continuous strikes across the territory and issued mass evacuation orders for large residential areas.",
      "There would also be a surge in humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza, with hundreds of lorries allowed in each day.",
      "The Palestinian official previously said detailed negotiations for the second and third stages would begin on the 16th day of the ceasefire.",
      "Biden said the ceasefire would persist \"as long as the negotiations continue\".",
      "Second stage",
      "Stage two would be \"a permanent end to the war,\" according to Biden.",
      "The remaining living hostages, including men, would be released in return for more Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Of the 1,000 Palestinian prisoners Israel is thought to have agreed to release overall, about 190 are serving sentences of 15 years or more.",
      "An Israeli official previously told the BBC that those convicted of murder would not be released into the occupied West Bank.",
      "There would also be a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.",
      "Third stage",
      "The third and final stage would involve the reconstruction of Gaza - something which could take years \u2013 and the return of any remaining hostages' bodies.",
      "Palestinians and Israelis dare to hope as Gaza deal reportedly close",
      "Three things that could make a Gaza hostage deal more likely",
      "Israel and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explained",
      "What are the unanswered questions about the deal?",
      "Getting to this point has taken months of painstaking indirect negotiations, not least because Israel and Hamas completely distrust each other.",
      "Hamas wanted a complete end to the war before it would release the hostages, something which was unacceptable to Israel.",
      "The ceasefire will in effect pause the war while its terms are carried out.",
      "However, it is unclear whether it will mean the war is over for good.",
      "One of Israel's key war aims has been to destroy Hamas's military and governing capabilities. Although Israel has severely damaged it, Hamas still has some capacity to operate and regroup.",
      "It is also unclear which hostages are alive or dead or whether Hamas knows the whereabouts of all those who remain unaccounted for.",
      "For its part, Hamas has demanded the release of some prisoners which Israel says it will not free. This is believed to include those who were involved in the 7 October attacks.",
      "It is also not known whether Israel will agree to pull out of the buffer zone by a certain date, or whether its presence there will be open-ended.",
      "Any ceasefire is likely to be fragile.",
      "Ceasefires between Israel and Hamas which have halted previous wars have been shaken by skirmishes and eventually broken down.",
      "The timetable and complexity of this ceasefire means even a small incident could turn into a major threat.",
      "What happened on 7 October 2023 and what has happened in Gaza?",
      "Hundreds of Hamas-led gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on southern Israel, bursting through the border fence and targeting communities, police stations and army bases.",
      "About 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 hostages were taken back to Gaza. Hamas also fired thousands of rockets into Israel.",
      "Israel responded with a massive military campaign, first by air and then a ground invasion. Since then, Israel has attacked targets across Gaza by land, sea and air, while Hamas has attacked Israel with rockets.",
      "Israel's offensive has devastated Gaza and led to severe food shortages, with aid struggling to reach those most in need. More than 46,700 people - the majority of them civilians - have been killed by Israel's attacks, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry."

      "Introduction",
      "The first time it hit me that I had reached \"a certain age\" was while strolling through the streets of downtown New York with my daughters. They are, if I may be so bold, stunning girls. Rowan is a strawberry blonde with curves to die for; Grier is six feet tall, all legs, and towers over me. They're also funny, fiercely intelligent, thoughtful, and kind, though I guess those traits are less obvious to the casual observer.",
      "On this particular day, we were walking side by side, me in the middle, and it was impossible not to notice the admiring looks from various passersby. Over the years I've become used to being recognized on the street, but this time was different: the looks weren't cast in my direction, but at the two beauties by my side. I had every single feeling, all at once. What are you doing ogling my babies I will cut you but also aren't they gorgeous but also, wait, no one's gazing at me? When did that happen? Am I over? Protectiveness, pride, melancholy\u2014it all smacked me upside the head in one quintessential New York minute.",
      "There was also the time I was doing a photo shoot, and after a couple shots I took a peek at the monitor. \"I think there's some dust on the camera lens,\" I said to the photographer, pointing to a weird line on my cheek. His response was something to the effect of a pitying \"Awww, you're cute.\" There was no dust. That \"something\" was a wrinkle.",
      "I didn't have my first child until I was thirty-seven. I went through a hard time after I had Rowan, suffering from postpartum depression, which I wrote about in my first book, Down Came the Rain. But with the help of good medical professionals and the right medication, I felt like myself again, more or less, by her first birthday. I had Grier when I was forty, and the ensuing decade felt, in a word, playful. That was a brand-new feeling for me. I remember thinking in my forties, This isn't old at all! This is fun! Keep in mind, I'd been treated like an adult (and was expected to behave like one) since I was a kid. At forty, it was as though my biological age finally aligned with the age I'd felt for decades. I felt mature yet still playful. I was firing on all cylinders, and at the risk of sounding like Maria von Trapp, the world seemed full of possibilities. I felt like I was being primed for a moment when I could finally pat myself on the back and say \"You've earned it!\" if I chose to take a break. Plus, I'd arrived at a place of self-acceptance. I actually liked my body and no longer compared it to the runway models. (I never did runway and believed those girls were \"skinny,\" whereas I was considered \"athletic\"\u2014in my modeling days, a euphemism for \"not skinny.\") At forty, relieving myself of being compared to others felt like freedom. Mine was a body to be proud of. This body gave me babies! This body could dance! I had curves and was okay with that! It wasn't exactly \"I am woman, hear me roar,\" but I certainly felt like, \"I am woman, hear me more.\"",
      "And yet, as my forties progressed into my fifties, I began to notice that external perceptions didn't seem to match up with my internal sense of self. My industry no longer received me with the same enthusiasm I had come to expect. The vibe from casting agents and producers, but also my fans, was more: you need to stop time ... and maybe even reverse it. Case in point: at a routine dermatological appointment (to get a mole checked out), the doctor, unsolicited, waved his hand around my face and said, \"We could fix all that ...\"",
      "\"All what?\" I asked.",
      "\"You know, all the\"\u2014cue more hand waving\u2014\"you know.\"",
      "What the hell? Who asked for your opinion? I thought as I heard myself say, \"Thank you, but not yet.\"",
      "Maybe it took seeing myself through the eyes of other people to fully understand that, in fact, I was entering a new era of life. I mean, I was aware that some things were changing. I get tired now in a way I never did before. I literally can't read the fine print, and I hate it. I used to get mad at my mom for always misplacing her reading glasses, and now it's me saying \"Grier, honey, have you seen my readers?\" I like doing needlepoint and puzzles, which admittedly feels a bit geriatric. Am I in my mahjongg era?? I need 2.5s for these granny activities!",
      "And yes, sometimes I put on a pair of pants that once fit, and think, God, this used to be so much easier. Or I watch my kids, who can sleep until noon without stirring at the garbage trucks or sirens outside, and think, Ah, youth. There was a time when I could go to bed without taking a pill or being up for hours in the middle of the night, what was that like? And though these shockingly beautiful young women spend hours in front of the very mirrors I try to avoid, they still don't realize how fresh and perky and unaffected by gravity their bodies are\u2014just like we didn't at their age. (I mean, the butt and the boobs! How did I not appreciate that when I had it?) They complain that they hate their legs, whereas my knees are now practically lower than my calves. How is that even a thing? We are always chasing, never appreciating, and what runs through my mind is, Ugh, where is the justice?? Why are we forever criticizing ourselves and our bodies while seeking ridiculous perfection? Why do we never see how unique and special we are? And why, when we finally take the pressure off or count our blessings or just enjoy who we are, is it practically too late?",
      "But while I don't feel as invincible as I did in my youth, I also don't feel fifty-nine. When I was a kid, fifty-nine seemed so OLD, but it sure doesn't feel old to me now! When I say my age out loud, I know it may sound old to some people, but I truly don't feel, in any way, aged. Aging is a journey full of contradictions, especially in America. It's humbling and surprising and empowering and daunting and liberating. In plenty of cultures, older people are revered. In Korea, the sixtieth and seventieth birthdays are considered major life events, marked by parties and feasts. In Native American communities, elders are often referred to as \"wisdom-keepers\"\u2014they're considered community leaders. In India, elders have the final word in family disputes. In the Henchy-Shields household, on the other hand, this elder is constantly told, \"Mom, you just don't get it!\"",
      "In fact, a March 2023 cover story of the American Psychological Association's Monitor on Psychology described ageism in America as \"one of the last socially acceptable prejudices.\" Brands trip over themselves to capture the coveted eighteen-to-thirty-four demographic, even though surveys have found it's women over forty who have the most purchasing power: we have accumulated wealth, and we're making 85 percent of the household-buying decisions. The numbers for women over fifty are even more staggering: We control a net worth of $19 trillion, and spend 2.5 times that of the average person. Women in their forties and fifties are treated like we're invisible, even though we're one of the fastest-growing demographics in the country. (One in four Americans is a woman over forty.) We are ignored by brands, and when we are targeted, it's for wrinkle cream or menopause supplements. Talk about shortsighted.",
      "This notion of invisibility is so widespread, so pervasive, that it has become the namesake of a social phenomenon, aptly dubbed \"invisible woman syndrome.\" The gist? When we are no longer deemed sexy or able to contribute to society by birthing and raising young children, our value diminishes. We are overlooked, ignored, or worse, not seen at all.",
      "And the older we get, the more extreme it gets. An analysis of nearly eleven thousand ads featuring over twenty thousand people in 2021 and 2022 found that those featuring women over sixty years old amounted to a whopping 0.93 percent of all advertisements. You read that right: less than one percent of all advertisements feature women over sixty, even though the 2020 census found that one in six people in America is over sixty-five.",
      "According to a survey of women over forty by the advertising agency Fancy (which is specifically focused on marketing to a female audience), most women over forty feel that brands \"underestimate their spending power and intelligence while overestimating their preoccupation with appearance.\" We are, it turns out, more than just a demographic obsessed with looking younger. We embody vitality. We are smart and vibrant and powerful and ambitious. We are experienced, confident, capable, and complicated. We are running s**t.",
      "The truth is, I still can't quite get over that I'm using words like \"aging\" and \"elder\" in the same breath as I talk about myself and my friends. I'm not even sixty! I may not be playing the ing\u00e9nue or the girl next door or even the first love, but I'm not exactly the grandmother in Titanic.",
      "And yet, no one knows what to do with me. After all, Brooke Shields is not allowed to get old. The sixteen-year-old Calvin Klein model? Time magazine's face of the '80s? It's sacrilegious! I remember seeing a picture of what Marilyn Monroe would look like if she were still alive today, and it was truly impossible to wrap my head around. But she died looking like Marilyn Monroe. For me, as my body and face change in all the ways they should (don't get me started on my thinning, graying eyebrows), there is this sense of How dare you? That was never the plan, young lady! And, to be totally honest, there have been times when it's made me feel like a disappointment. Maybe you've felt this way, too\u2014maybe you were an athlete in your youth, singled out for your form and speed, and now you can still swim or run or play tennis or whatever, but not at the same level. You're still strong, but you had the audacity to grow older, to change, to slow down a bit, to not die young or stop aging entirely. You survived, and it should be celebrated, and yet there's a sense that you're not as valuable or exceptional as you once were, and therefore you're letting people down. And these reactions can cause us to feel disappointed in ourselves, too. I look back sometimes and feel like I've done something wrong because I no longer have the body or the face that I used to have. And yet, if I did anything drastic to hold on to my looks from my youth or to stop aging, I'd be judged or chastised for that, too.",
      "Generally speaking, at fifty-nine, I feel more confident than I ever have. I'm more comfortable in my skin and have stopped comparing myself to this ideal or worrying about that expectation. But I'll admit that even as I'm experiencing this newfound sense of satisfaction, I have to remind myself, sometimes daily, that I am good enough. The old negative tapes are lying in wait in the Walkman (remember those!?), ready for me to press play at any moment. But I also realize that if I don't wear makeup or the \"right-sized jeans and someone has a problem with it, that's on them. And yes, I continue to exercise and take care of my skin, but I think of it now as a privilege, because it makes me feel better. Do I sometimes wish that all my bits had remained higher and perkier? Or that I had the same skin that appeared on the cover of Life magazine in 1983? Of course I do! Who doesn't miss the gifts of youth? But this is a body\u2014and soul\u2014that has carried me through a lot, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I think I deserve some credit for this life well lived. We do all this work and get through hard times and suddenly you have a line on your face, and that one little wrinkle carries more weight than decades of accomplishments.",
      "I'll tell you, it took me a long time to have the guts to say that I deserved a bit more respect. Something began to shift in me around age forty. I started to own myself and my narrative in a new way. I'm not sure what it was that finally clicked, though becoming a mother probably had something to do with it. What I do know is that gaining that deeper sense of identity allowed me to speak up when others tried to diminish me. It's allowed me to look within and identify patterns and break cycles. It's allowed me to take on new risks and challenges. I know who I am and what I have to offer, and I've stopped hoping or trying to be different, or something that I'm not.",
      "Of course, as proud as I am of how far I've come ... there is still so much that I want to do. I want to pile into a camper with my daughters and my husband and take a cross-country road trip (although we'd probably end up killing each other, and the romance of the Porta Potti would surely wear off quickly). I want to learn to play an instrument. I want to get back to being fluent in French (it was my college major, after all). I want to travel to places I haven't been. The list goes on.",
      "All of this is doable, because there's a lot of freedom that comes with age. It's more fun to take a dance class when you can truly let yourself dance like no one is watching. It's more fun to go out with friends when you aren't worrying if you said the wrong thing or if people are talking about you behind your back. It's more fun to go to a restaurant alone when you realize that no one is wondering why you don't have a companion ... that no one is looking at you at all, because they're all dealing with their own s**t. And while, yes, my body is a little creakier than it once was, and it's not as easy to lose weight, the truth is I can still do almost everything I used to do. And the things I can't, well, I don't really want to. I don't want to surf ... I don't want to ski, unless it's somewhere sunny and the trail is long and relatively flat\u2014I just don't feel like exposing myself to freezing temperatures, fighting scary moguls, and navigating with the gear. But I don't feel limited. I'm happy that, at least for me, the moment for more intense, competitive activities has passed, and the moment for new emotional beginnings has arrived. I don't have to prove myself anymore. This is it. This is me! And if there is something I want to change, then I can make the decision to do so.",
      "What I've come to realize\u2014not only from my own lived experience but also from conversations with other women my age\u2014is that these \"later\" years are all about coming into your own and pivoting in the directions you've always wanted to go. You can finally live the life you intended to, because you no longer have to act in accordance with external timelines, something that is part and parcel of being a woman. I don't have to get married by this date or have kids by this age or get a certain job before that milestone. My time is my own.",
      "And yet\u2014 this newfound gift has come as a bit of a surprise. After all, the narrative we've been served for years is that it's all downhill for women after a certain age. As I hit my midfifties, I grew increasingly curious about the disconnect between how this age feels and how it's portrayed in our culture and society. I talked to other women my age who felt the same tension I did\u2014 both personally empowered and systemically dismissed. And this idea of being collectively ignored ... it irked me. I started connecting even more with women over forty, online and on social media, because I wanted to dig into what makes aging hard and what makes it great. What began as an online community to discuss health, aging, sexuality, relationships, and just plain living\u2014to dish about all those things you can't say to anyone except your closest girlfriends\u2014evolved into a hair-care brand, Commence, and a new business. So here I am, a first-time CEO in my fifties, inspired to start a business\u2014and write a book!\u2014all because of society's most uninspiring take on women my age.",
      "My first two memoirs, Down Came the Rain and There Was a Little Girl, were at their core about overcoming obstacles: first, postpartum depression, and second, losing my mom. But there is nothing to \"overcome\" about aging. That's the whole point! This time of our lives is something to enjoy and revel in, not something to merely survive. So if those books were about how I persevered through tough moments, this one is about how I took ownership and agency of a moment I'd been told would be tough, but really is rich and complex. But come on, life is complex. This book is about embracing an era that has been billed as an obstacle when, in reality, it's a stimulus. Yes, it has new and difficult challenges, but it doesn't have to be viewed as torture or a time to throw in the towel. I'm not trying to stave off this period, or deny it, or pretend I'm not in it. I'm taking the whole mess of it and reminding myself, and hopefully other women, that we have the elements we need to thrive. The story we've been told is, in a word, bulls**t. We are the narrators of our next chapters.",
      "For too long, women have talked about aging only in whispers and behind closed doors. Maybe it's because we've been embarrassed or ashamed. Maybe it's because we don't think anyone would want to hear what we have to say. These are understandable responses to our treatment by society, but they only serve to keep us isolated and disempowered. Recently, I had the pleasure of attending an intimate \"couch conversation\" with Gloria Steinem where she was talking about the challenges of being a woman today. The younger women in the room were eagerly asking her, \"But how can we fix it? How can we be a force for change?\" And she reminded us that \"every important movement started in a room like this\u2014in a basement, or a living room.\" When we step out from behind those closed doors and use our voices to talk about the misunderstandings, the underestimations, we're already starting to change them. Maybe even fix them.",
      "As far as I can tell, these decades in our lives are a time to be celebrated. Sure, there will be some hot flashes (been there!), but we can wear layers. (Or take hormones, which I have done, but more on that later.) I can tell you that the discomfort of those moments is far outweighed by the delight that comes from making intentional friendships, pursuing new interests, discovering our peak confidence, and giving ourselves permission to make changes to our lives.",
      "In 2023, my dear friend Ali Wentworth produced a documentary, Pretty Baby, about my life. Watching it, and seeing just how much I've been through, I couldn't help but feel proud. I'm not saying everyone should make a documentary about their lives, but I hope you can look back at how far you've come, how much life you've lived in order to get to this moment, and give yourself credit for the feat that it is. And then I hope it gives you the jump start you need to figure out how to enjoy this new stage of your life. Because the time is now! If there is something you want to change, now's the time to change it. If there's something you want to stop, now's the time to stop it. If there's something you want to do, now's the time to do it.",
      "Being relegated to the sidelines, as misguided as it is, also offers us more room to fully be ourselves. There's less pressure. We can push boundaries when we're moving through the world without the watchful eyes of, well, everyone. In Why We Can't Sleep: Women's New Midlife Crisis, author Ada Calhoun reconsiders all the so-called negatives of getting older. \"Could we see ... our newfound midlife invisibility as a source of power?\" she writes. \"There are great advantages to being underestimated. Two of the best reporters I know are women in their fifties. They look so friendly and nonthreatening, if you notice them at all. They can lurk in any room without usually wary people remembering to keep their guard up. Then they write devastating whistle-blowing articles. The world ignores middle-aged women at its peril.\"",
      "At fifty-nine, I'm the one making the calls in my life\u2014not my mother or the media or Hollywood or my family\u2014which is something I've never felt before. And this should be true for all of us. It doesn't matter what you've done, or what you think you've done (good or bad), or even what you always wanted to do. This is a new time. The same rules don't apply. Is that disorienting? Maybe, but I like to give it a different spin: We can make our own rules.",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 10:08:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Now nearly 60, the model and actress was recently elected president of Actors' Equity, and launched Commence, her beauty brand for women over 40. She's also written her fourth book, \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old,\"",
    "story": [
      "Last Sunday, Demi Moore accepted her first major acting award at the Golden Globes. Watching from home was Brooke Shields \"My kids'll be like, 'Oh, it's Golden Globe night. Get the bottle of wine for Mom! Get the tequila!'\" Shields laughed. \"It's so interesting, these award shows, right? They can be torturous if you sit there and you go like, Why am I not valid enough to get that, do that, whatever?\"",
      "I asked, \"You've felt that?\"",
      "\"I've felt it my entire life.\"",
      "It can be surprising to hear that a veteran actress like Shields yearns for acceptance. Turns out she's totally human. \"I was listening to Demi, 'We've weren't the ones that ever got awards.' Like, no. I got People's Choice Awards! The people loved me.\"",
      "\"So, you get the People's Choice Award, but you wanted the Emmy, the Oscar?\"",
      "\"You just wanted, like, to be part of the group, the cool kids,\" said Shields. \"That's where the little insecure girl comes out.\"",
      "At this point in her career of six decades, the comedienne has earned the right to laugh at herself.",
      "Currently 59, Shields said she feels 38. \"I definitely feel a youthfulness that I didn't feel in my younger years,\" she said.",
      "She started modeling while wearing diapers. Later, she turned heads wearing Calvin Klein jeans. Shields was expected to sell products and say her lines, all while looking gorgeous. She delivered.",
      "But as she approaches 60, she's found a cultural script she's powerfully rejecting.",
      "\"By the time you get to 50, they've just completely written you off,\" she said. \"You are out to pasture. Society says, 'Oh, if you're not the hot twenty-something at the bar, you're an old lady.' There's this whole demo in the middle that gets just overlooked.\"",
      "It's those overlooked women for whom Shields has written her fourth book: \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old\" (to be published Tuesday by Flatiron). \"When you are someone that has been noted for looking a certain way, by virtue of just growing older, you become a disappointment, in a way,\" she said. \"I've watched people get sort of personally affronted that I dare to be 60!\"",
      "\"And what do you say to them?\"",
      "\"I just sort of feel bad for them,\" Shields said. \"And I'm a part of the problem, because I was that symbol, you know, maybe unwittingly. But I didn't set out to do that.\"",
      "Nearly 44 years after being named the face of a decade, Shields hopes to be a voice for her generation \u2013 empowering women by sharing her personal and at times vulnerable experiences.",
      "In her book, she reveals that a doctor performed a surgery on her that she did not consent to. \"I was asked by my gynecologist if I experienced discomfort, and I said yes.\"",
      "In the late 2000s, Shields went to a surgeon to help reduce some labia discomfort. But after the operation, she says she found out he performed an extra procedure: an unwanted vaginal rejuvenation. \"He literally looked at me and said, like, 'I tightened you up a bit,'\" Shields said. \"And I was like, 'What?' And he just sort of was, like, boasting that he 'threw in a little bonus' for me. And I was in such shock that I just, I became numb. I didn't even know what to do.\"",
      "\"What did you say?\"",
      "\"I didn't say it, I didn't say a thing. because it sounded like he wanted me to thank him,\" Shields replied. \"I didn't say anything then, and this is the first time I've said anything.\"",
      "That so-called bonus surgery has had lasting side effects. The actress and model says sex can be painful.",
      "\"This was, you know, a long time ago. We didn't know what we could fight or complain. I finally had a life and kids, and it was like, 'Dear God, I don't want that kind of attention,'\" she said.",
      "So, why is she speaking out now? \"Because I have daughters. And there's no shame around it. And the more we have those conversations with them, conversations that I never had, the more progress I think we will have as women.\"",
      "Shields is looking to make progress in other ways, too. In May, she was elected president of Actors' Equity Association, the union representing 51,000 actors and stage managers around the country. As a five-time Broadway star, she felt a responsibility to give back to a community that's embraced her.",
      "She's already taken her fight to Washington for more funding and to change tax policy. \u00a0\"It's been a learning curve,\" she said. \"It's trial by fire. I'd never gone on the Hill and met with Congressmen and Senators. But you know, producers need to take care of the people that bleed for them on a daily basis.\"",
      "Besides being a union boss, Shields is now a CEO. She'd founded the beauty brand Commence, after hearing concerns from aging women about their hair. \"They have felt overlooked, and that's just the truth,\" she said. \"They're not being marketed to.\"",
      "Asked what the hardest part of being a CEO is, Shields replied, \"Money raising. Keeping the money flowing, because you have to put it right back into the company. And you know, nobody's getting salaries yet. Least I'm not!\" she laughed.",
      "Don't ask Brooke Shields if she's ready to slow down. Age has brought wisdom, and she's just getting started.",
      "\"I'm, you know, going to be 60 years old,\" she said. \"I'm still here. I feel like I'm at the beginning of a new, really exciting stage. The more confident you get \u2013 isn't it interesting \u2013 the more opportunity you get. And yet, you couldn't have arrived at said confidence without going through all the time to get here.\"",

    "title": "Wendell Pierce: An actor's journey",
    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:40:16 -0500",
    "summary": "With standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Death of a Salesman,\" and the CBS drama \"Elsbeth,\" the acclaimed actor talks about his childhood in New Orleans, training at New York's Juilliard School, and tackling the character of Willy Loman.",
    "story": [
      "It's been a few years since Wendell Pierce attended a drama class at the Juilliard School in Manhattan. Forty years, to be exact. \"I remember it well. High windows and gray floors!\" he laughed.",
      "He's said that nothing in his career gave him as much anxiety as training at Juilliard: \"Yes, the anxiety of, you know, am I doing the right thing? I'm going into an unknown world. Will I have what it takes to be just a working actor? And so, I was reminded looking in that class, it was very touching to see these young people at a point in the journey that I recall with fondness \u2013 and with a lot of anxiety, too! But I knew I was exactly where I wanted to be.\"",
      "And it's where he belongs. At 61, Pierce is among the most prolific and respected actors of his generation, with standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Treme,\" \"Suits,\" \"Selma,\" and now, the quirky CBS drama, \"Elsbeth.\" Later this year, he'll play editor-in-chief Perry White in the newest Superman movie. He'll also take on Othello at the Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington, D.C.",
      "No matter the part, Pierce brings his own humanity to it. He said, \"In every role, there's a little part of Wendell in it. At the end of the run, I turn the lights down low in the dressing room and I just see the silhouette in the mirror. And I have a good cry and say goodbye. Right? I say, 'Man, you taught me so much about myself. I've learned so much from you. I hope I see you again. And I know there'll be times where I will see you again.'\"",
      "That sense of self-discovery began in his hometown of New Orleans, and the historical Black neighborhood of Pontchatrain Park. \"It was like a Black Mayberry,\" he said. \"The first Black mayor came out of there, the first Black DA. Lawyers, doctors, postal workers, maintenance men. That was the community I grew up in. It was absolutely wonderful. And it was totally destroyed. We were destroyed by Katrina. We were part of the deepest flooding. And we brought it back, and now we're on the National Register of Historic Places.\"",
      "His mother, Althea, was a beloved schoolteacher. \"She taught everybody in the neighborhood. And I just remember how, everywhere I went, I knew that I had to live up to being her son,\" Pierce said.",
      "His father, Amos Pierce, Jr., was a World War II veteran. \"He was Army unit attached to the 3rd Marines in the invasion of Saipan. And after that, his unit received medals of commendation. And because he was there with the Black unit, the officer didn't believe him when he told him. He said, 'Listen, I think we received medals.' And it was a woman who said, 'Yeah, right. You? You didn't receive anything.'\"",
      "It would take 65 years for the injustice to be corrected. \"We gave him his medals on Veteran's Day 2010,\" Pierce said. \"I tell that story to say that he was a man who loved this country even when the country didn't love him back. And even after receiving the medals, there was a great pride. He didn't let the anger destroy him. And that was a great lesson.\"",
      "Pierce sees his own life as a series of lessons \u2013 and acting is part of that journey. He said, \"Every audition for me is an opening and closing night, where you get to perform: This is what I would do with this material. You do whatever you like from this point on. And then you leave the room.\"",
      "And he says his best work \u2013 be it as Detective Bunk Moreland on \"The Wire,\" or in Spike Lee's \"Malcolm X,\" comes from the writing. He said, \"The really good material is the thing that will define it, you know, and make it classic. Something that speaks to people across time and place no matter where you are, that's gonna speak to people years from now.\"",
      "A career highlight was in 2022, when Pierce became the first Black actor to play Willy Loman on Broadway, in Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman.\"",
      "Why does he think it took so long? \"The ignorance of biases and bigotry, and when people just don't have the ability to see others' humanity,\" Pierce said. \"And it's something that people are very conscious of at times, and then sometimes they're not very conscious of it.\"",
      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",
      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",
      "And it's Pierce's own compassion that draws people towards him, like Carrie Preston, his co-star on \"Elsbeth.\" She said, \"This kind of connection isn't always guaranteed. We've got it here. I'm grateful for it.\"",
      "And it's what his fellow Juilliard classmate Bradley Whitford recalled when he surprised Pierce with a message during our interview: \"Wendell, I miss you. I love you. I am so proud of you, not only for the great actor that you are and the dear friend, but what an amazing citizen you are. I love you!\"",
      "\"That's very special,\" said Pierce. \"Brad and I, we're part of a very special group here at Juilliard, our class. You know, when you go through the fire together, you're connected forever.\"",
      "Pierce has said he wants to make his mark. I asked, \"Do you think that you have? And what is that mark? What do you want to leave for people?\"",
      "\"I was afraid that I may not have the opportunity to leave my mark, that my best days were behind me,\" he replied. \"I had that fear, and I tapped into that fear when I did 'Death of a Salesman.' And while I still have the fear, now I have courage.",
      "\"I hope I can have an impact on someone else that way, the way they have an impact on me.\"",

    "summary": "Sam Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
    "story": [
      "Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as \"Soul Man\" and \"Hold On, I'm Comin,'\" has died. He was 89.",
      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \"call and response\" of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music's most enduring hits, which also included \"You Don't Know Like I Know,\" \"When Something is Wrong With My Baby\" and \"I Thank You.\"",
      "Most of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music's most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called \"Play it, Steve\" midway through \"Soul Man.\"",
      "Like many '60s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \"Soul Man\" hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \"Saturday Night Live\" stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \"Soul Men\" depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning that, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",
      "\"Two thousand dollars for my lifetime?\" Moore said then. \"If you're making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don't give me cornbread and tell me it's biscuits.\"",
      "Moore wrote the song \"Dole Man,\" modeled on \"Soul Man,\" for Republican Bob Dole's presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump's inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's campaign used the song \"Hold On, I'm Comin'.\"",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s but didn't meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label's Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band's troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",
      "He married his wife, Joyce, in 1982, and she helped him get treatment for his addiction which he credited with saving his life.",
      "\"I did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,\" during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.",
      "\"That's funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,\" he said. \"But you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I'm laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\"",
      "Moore kept recording and singing. He was a frequent performer at the Kennedy Center Honors and performed for presidents, including Obama.",

    "story": [
      "A year after the American Academy of Pediatrics flagged what it described as \"questionable marketing practices\" by makers of formulas for older infants and toddlers, Abbott Laboratories is being sued over how it pitches such products.",
      "Abbott, a health care products conglomerate based in Illinois, is misleading parents and other caregivers about the nutritional value of its sugar-laden toddler milks, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday by the Public Health Advocacy Institute (PHAI) against the maker of Similac formulas.",
      "Marketed for consumption by children ages 12 to 36 months, toddler milk is portrayed as the next step for little ones after they have outgrown infant formulas approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Yet unlike baby formula, the toddler milk products are not regulated by the FDA and are potentially harmful, according to\u00a0PHAI, a nonprofit legal research center located at Northeastern University School of Law.",
      "Abbott dismissed the allegations as \"without merit.\"",
      "\"Abbott's representations of its toddler nutrition products are accurate, and our claims are well-supported,\" the company said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "\"More than just unnecessary, toddler milk products can actually be harmful to a child's nutritional health,\" said George Fuchs, a medical doctor and professor of pediatric gastroenterology at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine Department of Pediatrics. \"The added sugars can increase a toddler's preference for sweetened foods, contributing to obesity and other health risks throughout their lives,\" noted Fuchs, who led the AAP report on toddler milks.",
      "Labeled similarly to FDA-regulated infant formulas and sold on the same store shelves, Abbott's \"Go & Grow Toddler Drink by Similac\" and \"Pure Bliss Toddler Drink by Similac\" are labeled \"Stage 3,\" implying they are the next nutritionally recommended product after \"Stage 1\" infant formula and \"Stage 2\" transitional formula, the suit alleges.",
      "\"Common toddler milk marketing practices, including unsubstantiated nutrition-related claims and packages that look like infant formulas, mislead parents and other caregivers to believe that toddler milks provide nutritional benefits for their young children,\" said Dr. Jennifer Harris, senior research adviser, marketing initiatives at the UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health.",

    "title": "FDA to cut nicotine from cigarettes, in plan first floated under Trump",
    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 12:14:24 -0500",
    "summary": "It will be up to the returning Trump administration to decide whether to finalize the rule.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is moving to cut out addictive nicotine from cigarettes, according to a long-awaited proposed regulation released Wednesday.",
      "The rule aims to force the nearly 12% of Americans still using combustible tobacco products to switch to less dangerous alternatives, like vaping electronic cigarettes or using nicotine lozenges, or quit altogether while ending rates of youth starting to smoke traditional cigarettes.",
      "\"The proposed product standard would limit the addictiveness of the most toxic and widely used tobacco products, which would have significant public health benefits for all age groups,\" the agency wrote in the\u00a0proposed rule.",
      "Though vaping rates have climbed in recent years, fewer adults vape than smoke traditional cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 6% of adults use e-cigarettes.",
      "It will now be up to the returning Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize this measure, which was first floated during President-elect Donald Trump's first term. At the time, the head of the FDA called it \"one of the most important actions I could take to advance public health.\"",
      "\"If there is a goal to Make America Healthy Again, I can't imagine anything more important to get done than this,\" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "A related effort to ban menthol-flavored cigarettes stalled out last year under the Biden administration, amid political blowback over the measure.",
      "The FDA says the proposed rule will apply to traditional cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, cigars and pipe tobacco. Cigarette manufacturers will have two years to come into compliance with the rule, after it is finalized.",
      "Agency officials stressed that they were not seeking to ban cigarettes or other tobacco products outright. They acknowledged the rule may result in some illegal imports of high nicotine cigarettes, but not enough to outweigh those switching or quitting. Half of smokers are expected to switch within the first years, they estimate.",
      "\"Even if some amount of illicit trade develops, we will still have a significantly greater magnitude of benefits that would outweigh any impacts of potential illicit markets,\" said Brian King, head of FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.",
      "Tobacco companies will need to cut nicotine levels to 0.7 milligrams per gram of tobacco, a fraction of the 17.2 milligrams per gram that most cigarette brands have on average.",
      "Why didn't the FDA ban nicotine earlier?",
      "Progress during the Trump administration halted after then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb stepped down from the agency, according to a former top-ranking official.",
      "\"We had no champion. And the day came when I was told by political appointees at FDA to stop talking about menthol and nicotine in my speeches. And we were basically told to stop working on them,\" said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products from 2013 to 2022.",
      "The FDA's tobacco arm turned to other priorities in those years, Zeller said. The agency was facing a surge in youth e-cigarette use that began around 2018.",
      "Zeller credited Gottlieb for advocating for the nicotine regulation within the Trump White House, after the Obama administration had fallen short. Obama officials had promised Zeller they would back rules to curb nicotine and menthol.",
      "\"If you look back on the record, you'll see that the Obama administration did absolutely nothing. It was a very frustrating four years,\" Zeller said.",
      "Under President Biden, Zeller said the White House asked him to lay out a timeline for how a nicotine rule could be finalized by the end of 2024. Zeller said he delivered the plan in one of his last acts before retiring, and was not sure why the Biden administration failed to finalize the rule.",
      "\"I would not be forwarding this timeline to you, if I didn't believe in good conscience that it could be met, as long as clearance times could be sped up,\" Zeller recalled telling White House officials.",
      "Califf defended the agency's delay in comments to media Wednesday, saying that the FDA needed to lay the groundwork for steep legal fights over the rule. He pointed to ongoing court battles \"fighting us tooth and nail\" over graphic warnings on cigarettes, saying \"we will be sued, on anything that comes into action.\"",
      "\"The research has to be airtight to survive the challenges that we know we'll get in court,\" he said.",
      "How can nicotine be removed from cigarettes?",
      "Zeller said agency officials carefully studied whether it was possible to require the industry to make cigarettes without addictive levels of nicotine.",
      "\"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Philip Morris sold a very low-nicotine cigarette called Next. Now, it was not commercially successful. But I believe that Philip Morris more than 30 years ago answered the technical feasibility question for themselves and for the rest of us,\" he said.",
      "The Philip Morris cigarette had been produced with a similar process to decaffeinating coffee. At the time, the company had owned Kraft Foods and its decaf coffee production lines.",
      "A major study from the National Institutes of Health in 2015\u00a0that used reduced-nicotine cigarettes that the NIH contracted to manufacture showed reducing nicotine in cigarettes could substantially curb addiction, proving an idea first outlined in the 1990s.",
      "\"That study and a number of confirmatory studies that followed I think provide a very compelling scientific basis for this could be done,\" Zeller said.",
      "Other companies have found different ways to cut nicotine levels. Cigarette company 22nd Century Group earned the FDA's authorization in 2021 using tobacco that is genetically engineered to have 96% lower nicotine.",
      "While feasible to implement, Zeller predicted that finalizing the rule could face steep opposition from the industry.",
      "If successful, the rule would be an \"existential threat,\" he said, eliminating the main reason that smokers continue to use their products.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:31:07 -0500",
    "summary": "The red food dye is used in products ranging from candies to vegetarian meats.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday it had decided to revoke Red 3's authorization to be added to foods, over concerns about how the food coloring dye has been linked to cancer in laboratory animals.",
      "FDA officials have telegraphed the decision for months. While the agency has long said that it did not think evidence of Red 3 causing cancer applied to humans, officials said their hand was forced by a law requiring the agency to pull additives that are cancerous in animals.",
      "\"The Delaney Clause is clear; the FDA cannot authorize a food additive or color additive if it has been found to cause cancer in humans or animals. Evidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No. 3,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, referring to the law.",
      "A post on the FDA's website states that Red 3's use in food or drugs \"puts people at risk are not supported by the available scientific information.\"",
      "Hundreds of food brands, including products ranging from candy and fruit cups to snack chips and tomato sauce, have contained Red 3 at some point, according to databases maintained by the\u00a0U.S. Department of Agriculture\u00a0and the nonprofit\u00a0Environmental Working Group, as well as nutrition labels disclosed by food companies.",
      "Wednesday's decision stems from a petition filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a number of other groups in 2022, calling for the additive to be pulled from the market. Food brands will have until January 2027 to stop using the dye.",
      "The group has also championed a move by California in 2023 to ban the food dye, which is already banned from use in cosmetics.",
      "\"The primary purpose of food dyes is to make candy, drinks, and other processed foods more attractive. When the function is purely aesthetic, why accept any cancer risk?\" said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, in a statement.",
      "While the group has highlighted Red 3's link to cancer in pushes to ban the additive, it is concerns over a different health concern \u2014 the possibility that artificial food dyes could be causing hyperactivity in children \u2014 that has fueled opposition to this and another dye called Red 40 used in many U.S. food products.",
      "An influential review by California''s Environmental Protection Agency of studies on synthetic food dyes, including Red 3, concluded in 2021 that colorants \"can impact neurobehavior in some children.\"",
      "What foods and drinks contain Red 3?",
      "Red 3 has been authorized for use in at least some foods by countries around the world, according to the International Association of Color Manufacturers, under other names like erythrosine or E 127. In Europe, Red 3 is only permitted for use in cocktail cherries and candied cherries.",
      "In the U.S., Red 3 is used in some candies, including Jelly Belly's Candy Corn, Tootsie's Dubble Bubble ball gum and Ring Pop's strawberry and berry blast flavors. Other foods also use Red 3, like Del Monte cherry mixed fruit cups, MorningStar Farms vegetarian Bacon Strips and Pillsbury's birthday cake cookie dough.",
      "Several drinks rely on Red 3 as well, among them Ensure's creamy peach nutrition shake and Nesquik's strawberry lowfat milk.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, the candy industry pledged to comply with the FDA's guidance and safety standards. Industry groups have been calling on the agency to step up its regulation of food additives, citing concerns that a vacuum left by FDA inaction could lead to a frustrating patchwork of state laws for national food brands.",
      "\"Our consumers and everyone in the food industry want and expect a strong FDA, and a consistent, science-based national regulatory framework. We have been saying for years that FDA is the rightful national regulatory decision maker and leader in food safety,\" said the National Confections Association's statement.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the federal department that will oversee the FDA, has been critical of the agency for not moving to curb use of certain food additives.",
      "Kennedy and his allies have\u00a0also called for\u00a0tightening the FDA's approach to regulating food additives, which critics have derided as a \"loophole\" allowing in concerning ingredients. That process is separate from artificial colors like Red 3 and Red 40, which must jump through steep hurdles to gain the FDA's authorization and are carefully tested for purity before being used in the market.",

    "story": [
      "Consuming more than one drink a day results in a steep increase of the risk of premature death, a new federal review has concluded. The draft report was published Tuesday ahead of a major update to influential federal guidelines on how much alcohol Americans should drink.",
      "\"In the United States, males and females have a 1 in 1000 risk of dying from alcohol use if they consume more than 7 drinks per week. This risk increases to 1 in 100 if they consume more than 9 drinks per week,\" the report's authors concluded, in a final draft published by the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "The review is one of two written by committees of outside experts to inform this year's update to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The other was published last month by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.",
      "The upcoming guidelines are important because the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies often rely on the recommendations to justify new rules, like on how to label food and drinks. Men are currently recommended to limit intake to no more than two drinks per day and women are recommended to limit to one drink per day.",
      "\"Once you're over a drink a day, your risk of dying from alcohol is already above one percent. Some people may think that doesn't sound like a lot, but in terms of a public health guideline, that would be really, really high,\" said Dr. Timothy Naimi, director of the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research and one of the authors of the report.",
      "Naimi was careful to say that the report was \"not endorsing any level of risk\" caused by drinking, but pointed to other countries and health regulations that have used 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 death risks as thresholds to set rules.",
      "It is unclear whether the incoming Trump administration will incorporate the findings of the latest report into any updated guidelines. In 2020, the Trump administration rejected a call by its outside expert panel to recommend limiting drinking for all Americans to no more than once per day, saying the \"emerging evidence\" did not support the move.",
      "The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade coalition that represents spirits producers, called in a statement co-signed by other industry groups on the federal government to reject the findings of the panel.",

      "\"Congress never authorized or appropriated money for the panel or its work, and numerous letters from Congress and industry have voiced serious concerns over the process,\" the statement said.",
      "Alcohol linked to deaths from cancer, injuries, other causes",
      "The report was designed to weigh all of the data on a range of diseases and injuries, and boiled down a complex web of studies that have looked at alcohol's health risks and benefits into \"alcohol-attributable death\" estimates.",
      "This modeling is likely underestimating the true health risks of alcohol, Naimi said, given limits in how researchers can study its health impacts.",
      "Risks can also vary widely from person to person, the report cautions, meaning some harms can be very small for some even if they add up to substantial risks at the public health level.",
      "\"The overall effect of alcohol consumption on all-cause mortality is dependent upon the risk of diseases and injuries that are causally related to alcohol. These risks are affected by numerous factors, including smoking, diet, physical activity, obesity, hepatitis infection, and genetics,\" the report states.",
      "At one drink a day, the report estimated that injuries and cancer added up to the biggest contributors of the risk for a premature death.",
      "For men, injuries made up a substantial portion of the risk of dying. This includes a variety of accidents, road injuries and intentional harm, like suicide and violence linked to drinking.",
      "Cancer, which was next largest factor, made up a third of the additional risk of death for men.",
      "For women consuming one drink a day, the risk of death from cancer was statistically similar or larger compared to the increased risk of fatal injuries.",
      "Increased risk of a number of cancers \u2014 colorectal, female breast cancer, and cancers of the liver, mouth, throat and esophagus \u2014 \"begins with any alcohol use and increases with higher levels of use,\" the report states.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration released on Tuesday its long-awaited proposal to require food manufacturers to put some nutrition facts on the front of packages, in a bid to nudge Americans and food companies towards healthier diets in line with similar pushes in other countries.",
      "FDA's new \"nutrition info box\" focuses on telling people whether levels of saturated fat, sodium and added sugar are \"high\" or \"medium\" or \"low\" as well as the percentage for each serving.",
      "The proposal will be open for public comment for 120 days. It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize the rule.",
      "After that, the FDA says that large food companies earning more than $10 million annually will have three years to comply with the rule. Smaller food brands will have an additional year.",
      "Up to $154 million will be spent by the food industry over the next decade to relabel their products with the new box, the FDA estimates.",
      "The agency also estimates many food brands may also spend millions more dollars to try to rework their products, changing their recipes to avoid being called out as having too much of an unhealthy nutrient.",
      "\"We assume there may be manufacturers who would want to reformulate to maybe move from the high category into the medium category, or the medium category into the low category,\" Rebecca Buckner, the associate deputy director for human food policy at the FDA, told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Trump's pick to head the federal department that oversees the FDA, has been sharply critical of federal nutrition officials for not doing enough to help Americans eat healthier diets and crack down on the food industry.",
      "Kennedy has not specifically addressed the proposal. A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Why only saturated fat, sodium and added sugars?",
      "The FDA said it will require the box to only call out saturated fat, sodium and added sugars. Food manufacturers would not be able to put other nutrients inside the FDA's information box.",

      "The FDA said it is still weighing whether calories should be incorporated into the label and acknowledged that some food brands are already voluntarily listing the information on the front.",
      "What determines \"high,\" \"medium\" and \"low\" levels?",
      "FDA officials said Tuesday that levels of saturated fat, sodium or added sugars will be deemed as \"high\" if they are above 20% in the daily value, a measurement of how much Americans eat each day in the \"reference\" diet. Medium was set at between 6% and 19% of the daily value. And low is 5% and below.",
      "Agency officials have used these benchmarks for \"high\" and \"low\" for decades, dating back to the formulation of the nutrition facts label back in the 1990s.",
      "At the time, officials decided against including the \"interpretive descriptions\" in the nutrition facts label. But the agency said recent data shows many Americans do not understand the percentages.",
      "\"It's really based on longstanding usage,\" McKinnon said.",
      "What will it look like?",
      "The FDA says food makers will be required to put the labels \"somewhere in the top third\" of the front of the box.",
      "The box also uses the same Helvetica font used in the nutrition facts on the back of the package and must comply with a range of more detailed rules to avoid it from being too small or obscured by other designs on the package.",
      "Some other design decisions were also abandoned during the focus group testing process, the FDA said.",
      "For example, previous mockups using the colors red, yellow and green to call out different levels did not make a statistically significant difference in helping people interpret the box.",

      "\"I competed in Olympic weightlifting, I did powerlifting, bodybuilding, so I've been very active pretty much my entire life,\" Heath said.",
      "Access to special prosthetics",
      "Heath needed special prosthetics to remain active after his amputation, and he was able to get them through the Veterans Administration.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 09:50:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Officials have blamed a new strain for this winter's surge in norovirus cases.",
    "story": [
      "This winter's wave of norovirus infections has reached levels that are now more than double last season's peak, in figures published Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracking the notorious stomach bug.",
      "Nearly 28% of norovirus tests run over the week of the New Year's holiday came back positive for the highly contagious virus, which is the leading cause of foodborne illness like vomiting and diarrhea in the U.S.",
      "That is more than double the 13.52% of tests coming back positive reached during the peak of last season's wave in March, according to data from public health laboratories around the country tallied by the CDC.",
      "Labs usually test samples of sick people's stool for the virus, which can be diagnosed up to 10 days after symptoms begin. The virus can also be found in other samples, including contaminated food or drinks that can spread the virus.",
      "Rates of norovirus in that CDC system have reached levels at or above last season's peak in all regions of the country. Norovirus test positivity rates look to be the worst in the Midwest, in a grouping of states spanning Kansas through Michigan.",
      "Since most people sick with norovirus get better without needing to go to the doctor, a majority of cases go unreported in the U.S. Instead, health authorities and experts use other measurements, such as the rate of positive tests, to track trends of the virus.",
      "Data from WastewaterSCAN's sewer sampling also suggests norovirus rates in recent weeks have been highest in the Midwest as well as the Northeast. Figures published by private testing company BioFire Diagnostics are also above previous seasonal peaks for norovirus.",
      "Why are norovirus cases so high in 2025?",
      "While norovirus rates always worsen during the colder months, in recent years most trends tracking norovirus did not reach their peak until March or April.",
      "That's different from seasons leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, which scrambled many usual seasonal patterns of germs. During that time, norovirus outbreaks often reached peak levels as early as December and January.",
      "Experts say this year's early and steep surge of cases is being driven by a new strain of norovirus called GII.17[P17], which has displaced a previous strain that had dominated previous waves of the virus in the U.S. for a decade.",
      "That new strain has been spotted everywhere around the country, including in many cruise ship outbreaks, a CDC official told CBS News. Lower population immunity to GII.17[P17] could explain this year's unusual wave of the virus.",
      "More than 7 in 10 outbreaks have been linked to this new norovirus strain this season, according to the latest CDC figures.",

      "More than 20 million egg-laying chickens in the U.S. died last quarter because of bird flu, data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows, marking the worst toll inflicted on America's egg supply since the outbreak began.",
      "The record number of chicken deaths, which includes those birds culled when infection is discovered in a flock, come as figures show egg prices have soared to the highest they have been in years, driven in large part by the virus.",
      "\"Unlike in past years, in 2024, all major production systems experienced significant losses including conventional caged, cage-free, and certified organic types,\" a USDA report said this month.",
      "Taxpayers will pick up the tab for the lost birds. To incentivize farmers to quickly report and stomp out the virus, a USDA program pays producers for the eggs and poultry they cull.",
      "Last year, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said it had spent $1.25 billion on payments to farmers since the outbreak started in 2022.",
      "Why are bird flu cases high right now in poultry?",
      "U.S. officials brace every winter for upticks in bird flu because migrating wild birds that spread the virus fly south during the colder months.",
      "It's also easier for the virus to spread in the winter. Heat and sunlight degrade the virus on surfaces, the USDA says.",
      "This winter has been different because a strain of the bird flu virus has spilled over into dairy herds too, leading to hundreds of infected herds.",
      "Authorities suspect the virus has been hitching a ride in droplets of contaminated raw milk. Those are ferried between farms by workers' clothing, equipment and animals shared between farms.",
      "California has been hit especially hard in recent months, forcing the state to declare a state of emergency to try to respond to the bird flu outbreak.",
      "This winter's surge of bird flu is from a different virus than the uptick of seasonal flu infections that also drives humans to emergency rooms every winter.",
      "While bird flu led to millions of dead poultry over the past year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied only 66 confirmed human cases in the U.S. from bird flu viruses.",
      "Most American cases of bird flu have been mild. A majority were farm workers who were infected after close contact with animals infected by a bird flu strain that spilled over into dairy cows in late 2023.",
      "Researchers think\u00a0this bird flu strain mutated to be milder to humans than other variants spreading in the wild. Those other strains usually cause more severe disease when they jump into humans.",
      "Can animals be vaccinated for bird flu?",
      "The USDA announced this week it is drawing up a new stockpile of poultry vaccines. That vaccine will target the D1.1 strain of the virus, which has been spreading in wild birds and was recently to blame for a fatal human case in Louisiana.",
      "But officials said it's unlikely the vaccine will be used. The Biden administration has been weighing the possibility of vaccinating poultry for bird flu for years.",
      "That is different from plans to potentially vaccinate cows for bird flu, which the USDA says appears \"more feasible and more likely to be successful\" in battling the virus. Seven potential vaccines are now being tested in field safety trials, the department said.",
      "One major hurdle has been the fear that vaccines will only hide the symptoms of the otherwise highly lethal disease in birds. That could result in export restrictions from countries afraid the virus could spread to them through poultry products.",
      "In 2023, the USDA banned imports of some products from Europe after authorities announced they would start vaccinating some poultry for bird flu.",
      "Spread of the virus through contaminated meat in the U.S. has already happened during this year's outbreak at least twice: raw pet food made from sick animals was linked to an outbreak that killed cats in California and Oregon.",
      "A Food and Drug Administration spokesperson told CBS News that the agency is now urging the animal food supply chain to take steps to curb the threat of the virus spreading, including heat treatment to kill off the virus and avoiding using infected animals.",
      "\"All recent detections of H5N1 in cats had these things in common: the infected cats ate wild birds, unpasteurized milk, raw poultry, and/or raw poultry pet food,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "summary": "Abortion bans enacted since Roe v. Wade was overturned may be driving Americans to leave restrictive states, researchers find.",
    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the majority of justices decided that the right to an abortion should be left up to individual states. Two years later, thousands of Americans in parts of the U.S. with strict abortion bans are deciding to leave those states, new research finds.",
      "Following the Dobbs decision, the 13 states with strict abortion bans, from Alabama to West Virginia, collectively lost a net 36,000 residents per quarter, meaning the difference between the number of people leaving the states versus those migrating in, according to the analysis from economists at Georgia Institute of Technology and The College of Wooster and published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The analysis, which is based on change-of-address data from the U.S. Postal Service, found that the state impact is larger among single-person households, which may suggest that younger people are moving out of abortion-banning states at a higher rate than families. That could be due to the greater challenges for families in trying to move, given the need to change schools or uproot careers for parents.",
      "A problem for states that ban abortion?",
      "While often framed as a cultural or religious issue, access to abortion also has far-reaching economic implications both for individuals and society at large. For instance, the financial toll on women without access to abortion services has been well documented, with the Turnaround Study finding that those denied the procedure had higher rates of financial problems and were more likely to rely on government aid like food stamps.",
      "The new research indicates that states with abortion bans could face long-term economic consequences if they lose significant numbers of residents \u2014 especially younger workers who are typically vital to a state's workforce.",
      "\"In terms of the implications for states' economies, our results suggest that employers in states with bans may face challenges in attracting and retaining workers, especially younger workers, which could impact economic growth and development,\" the researchers, Georgia Institute of Technology's Daniel L. Dench, Jason M. Lindo and Kelly Lifchez and The College of Wooster's Jancy Ling Liu, wrote in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The study didn't discern whether those moving out of states with abortion bans were men or women, or where they landed, including in states that have protected abortion. But the impact is significant enough that, over a five-year period, abortion-banning states could lose almost 1% of their population, the researchers said.",
      "Abortion bans and a weak safety net",
      "Separately, many of the states with strict abortion bans are failing to provide adequate safety nets, an analysis by the Associated Press found. These range from difficulty accessing programs such as food stamps to a lack of access to doctors due to maternal care deserts.",
      "Republican state leaders in Tennessee \u2014 one of the 13 states with a total abortion ban \u2014 argue that they are bolstering services for families. For instance, Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which enabled an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.",
      "But Tennessee fared poorly at enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, Medicaid, and in having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, according to an October study\u00a0published in the American Journal of Public Health. Other states with abortion bans, including Alabama, Georgia and Missouri, also ranked poorly on a number of measures, the analysis found.",
      "Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to obtain social services, according to a\u00a0survey\u00a0by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it's difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.",
      "\"People who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,\" said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the\u00a0study. But weakness in the safety net shows \"the hypocrisy of that argument.\"",
      "Meanwhile, many younger Americans are paying attention to a state's access to reproductive care. In a 2022 Axios poll, about 6 in 10 people 18- to 29-years-old said a state's abortion laws would sway their decision on where to live from \"somewhat\" to \"a lot.\"",
      "To be sure, there are many reasons why people opt to move out of a particular state, the Georgia Institute of Technology and College of Wooster researchers noted. \"And abortion-ban states are different from states protecting or maintaining abortion access in other ways besides their policies on abortion,\" they added.",
      "But a lack of access to reproductive choice, social services and medical care may make abortion-strict states less attractive to some residents, particularly young Americans, the study concluded.",

      "That reference has not put off the many American users who've turned to the app to share their experiences as so-called \"TikTok refugees\" ahead of the U.S. ban. Videos including a use of the \"TikTok refugee\" term on RedNote have racked up millions of views and impressions this week.",
      "\"This is for my fellow TikTok refugees and Americans, behave on this app! You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",

A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",

      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",
      "Content on RedNote appears to be much more heavily censored than posts on TikTok. A CBS News analysis found that any search for \"Xi Jinping,\" China's autocratic president, on RedNote yielded no results whatsoever.",
      "The term \"Free Hong Kong\" also brought back no results. A search for \"Taiwan\" will turn up several memes welcoming Americans to the platform, but noting that users must recognize the Beijing-imposed narrative that the democratically governed island just off China's coast, which the U.S. is legally bound to help defend from invasion, is an inseparable part of China.",
      "A similar search for those terms on TikTok turns up a wide range of political opinions from users, including posts heavily critical of Chinese censorship.",
      "RedNote even appears to be scaling up operations to monitor content given the vast number of Americans signing onto the app. CBS News found local job listings posted by the company online in mainland China advertising jobs to review English content and promising a monthly salary of between $950 and $1,200.",
      "\"Users are not going to a place with more freedom. RedNote is moderated differently, and the algorithm is different from TikTok,\" Warmenhoven told CBS News. \"You will not get traction or it will not spread politically sensitive issues, or maybe social sensitive issues \u2014 especially issues that are socially sensitive in China.\"",

    "summary": "Insurance companies are canceling homeowner policies across the U.S. \u2014 even in regions that aren't considered climate hot spots.",
    "story": [
      "As disasters linked to climate change become more frequent in the U.S., homeowners across the country are paying the price through skyrocketing insurance costs \u2014 and not only in states like Florida and California that are considered most vulnerable to global warming.",
      "The Los Angeles wildfires, which have decimated neighborhoods such as Pacific Palisades and Altadena, are focusing attention on a mounting insurance crisis that is particularly acute in states at greatest risk of wildfires, such as California, Colorado, Texas and Oregon. But the problem is reaching into almost every region of the U.S., including the Midwest, the Northeast and the Mountain states, according to analyses of insurance data.",
      "Research shows that climate change is heightening the conditions that lead to fire-conducive weather, including drying out vegetation and constraining water supplies. Such conditions are in turn prolonging wildfire season as well magnifying the size and intensity of blazes.",
      "In 2024, there were 27 weather and climate disasters causing at least $1 billion in damages, ranging from hurricanes, floods and tornadoes to wildfires, drought and hail, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Between 2020 and 2024, the average annual cost of those events topped $149 billion \u2014 more than double the annual average cost of roughly $65 billion between 1980 and 2024.",
      "\"Serious pocketbook issue\"",
      "The average homeowners insurance premium jumped 33% from 2020 to 2023, rising from $1,902 per year to $2,530, according to 2024\u00a0research\u00a0from economists at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and the University of Wisconsin. By comparison, inflation rose about 18% during that same time period.",
      "Such costs have surged even more in parts of the U.S. prone to the kind of natural disasters that experts link to climate change. Homeowners in these states have seen their insurance premiums soar by about 50% over that three-year period, according to Benjamin Keys, a professor real estate and finance at Wharton and a co-author of the 2024 study.",
      "Yet even property owners in states considered less vulnerable to climate disasters are now grappling with increased insurance costs and dropped policies \u2014 issues that threaten to undermine property values.",
      "\"We're seeing it now for five years in a row \u2014 the increases in insurance costs \u2014 and they are correlated with increased severity of climate events,\" Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications research at First Street, a non-profit research firm that models climate risks, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"One thing that is surprising is that Kansas and Nebraska and these places in the middle of the country are also seeing these huge increases in insurance.\"",
      "While the average U.S. homeowners insurance cost is now about $2,300 per year, Nebraskans pay an average of $5,700, while Oklahomans are shelling out about $4,800 annually \u2014 not far from Florida's $5,500 average annual rate, Bankrate data shows.",
      "Insurers are responding to the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires, hurricanes and flooding by hiking premiums to recoup their payouts, researchers have found. In 2000, homeowners' insurance costs represented about 7.5% of the typical mortgage; that figure had soared to 22% as of 2023, according to First Street's research.",
      "\"That is a serious pocketbook issue,\" said Wharton's Keys in a Jan. 10 webcast to discuss the Los Angeles wildfires and insurance, about the rise in policy premiums. \"That is the kind of thing that gets you around the kitchen table and say, do we need to move?\"",
      "Dropped policies from coast to coast",
      "In some cases, homeowners aren't only facing higher insurance costs, but also difficulties in even securing coverage.",
      "Non-renewal rates have climbed sharply in California and Florida, where the so-called insurer of last resort \u2014 the states' Fair Access to Insurance Requirements, or FAIR, plans \u2014 has seen a jump in enrollment. Thousands of homeowners in Los Angeles were dropped by their insurers last year, just months before the wildfires hit.",
      "\"It's the fire hazard. It's a fire danger, you know? We were in an area that they couldn't provide insurance to any longer,\" Jeff Cohen, whose Altadena, California, home was burned in this month's fires, told CBS News about being dropped by his insurer prior to the disaster. He and his wife eventually found pricier coverage through the state's FAIR Plan.",
      "But it's not only homeowners in states like California, Florida and Louisiana who are getting dropped by their insurers, according to a Senate Budget Committee report published last month. While most of the top 10 states for non-renewals by insurers were either coastal states or those prone to wildfire, Oklahoma also ranked high, likely due to \"increasing winds and hail from severe convective storms,\" the report found.",
      "The next 15 states with rates of home coverage non-renewal include Midwestern states such as Nebraska and Ohio, as well as Mountain states including South Dakota and Montana, the analysis found. While non-renewal rates have more than tripled in Florida between 2018 to 203, Oklahoma isn't far behind, with the rate of dropped policies nearly doubling over that time, the data shows.",
      "\"With a more volatile atmosphere, there is more latent energy in the climate, and we end up with more intense thunderstorms that produce heavy precipitation,\" First Street's Porter noted. \"They are tied back to climate change, and the fact that the air temperatures are warmer and the sea is warmer, winds are impacted in a way that's more volatile.\"",
      "Heavy rains in Vermont that led to damaging\u00a0flooding in July 2024, as well as Hurricane Helene's devastation in parts of North Carolina last year, are illustrative of these more damaging weather events, Porter noted.",
      "\"Notably, the data make clear that insurance non-renewals are not only a problem for communities typically seen as being on the front lines of climate change,\" the Senate report said. \"Florida, California, and Louisiana have been seen as the canaries in the coal mine.\"",
      "The ressearchers added, \"[P]laces such as southern New England, parts of Montana, New Mexico, coastal and inland North Carolina, and South Carolina, among others, are not far behind.\"",
      "Property values at risk?",
      "Most Americans in the U.S. who own a home also have property insurance because such coverage is required by mortgage lenders, which mandate the policies to secure their investments against damage from theft or accidents like storms or falling trees.",
      "But as climate-related disasters proliferate, insurers are readjusting their risk models and boosting premiums to cover their need for increased capital reserves as well as to buy more reinsurance \u2014 basically, insurance provided to insurers by other carriers,\u00a0according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other weather events become more intense due to human-caused climate change, it's likely that insurance access and affordability will also worsen, the Senate report predicted. In some extreme examples, property values could plummet if those areas become uninsurable, an issue that's already hit some communities vulnerable to wildfires and other weather disasters.",
      "U.S. homeowners burdened by heavy insurance costs are unlikely to see any relief anytime soon, according to experts.",
      "\"We're in the middle of insurance price corrections \u2014 they will continue until insurance companies are able to be profitable,\" Porter said. \"Really no matter where you are across the country, there is some climate hazard that you are exposed to.\"",

    "story": [
      "Starbucks is reversing its open-door policy after almost seven years, now requiring that people make a purchase if they want to hang out at its coffee shops or use its restrooms.",
      "The coffee giant said on Monday that a new code of conduct \u2013 which will be posted in all company-owned North American stores \u2013 will also ban discrimination or harassment, consumption of outside alcohol, smoking, vaping, drug use and panhandling.",
      "The new rules reverse an open-door policy put in place in 2018, after two Black men were arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks where they had gone for a business meeting. The incident at that individual store, which had a policy of asking non-paying customers to leave, was caught on video and was a major embarrassment for the company.",
      "The change also comes under the new leadership of Brian Niccol, who was hired from Chipotle last year to revitalize the struggling coffee chain. Niccol has vowed to make Starbucks' locations \"inviting places to linger,\" with the goal of reestablishing the chain as the nation's \"community coffeehouse.\"",
      "Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson said the new rules are designed to help prioritize paying customers. Anderson said most other retailers already have similar rules.",
      "\"We want everyone to feel welcome and comfortable in our stores,\" Anderson said. \"By setting clear expectations for behavior and use of our spaces, we can create a better environment for everyone.\"",
      "According to a company statement emailed to CBS News, the coffee chain understands that visitors might need to use the restroom or log into Wi-Fi before making a purchase at the counter. The goal of the new rules is to make its locations more appealing by prioritizing customers, Starbucks said.",
      "Starbucks said it will also start offering free refills of hot or iced coffee on Jan. 27 for customers who decide to stay in a store to drink their beverages. It added that customers must order their drink \"for here\" to get the free refill, with the coffee served either in a ceramic mug, glass or clean personal cup that's brought by the customer.",
      "Stores may call law enforcement",
      "The code of conduct warns that violators will be asked to leave, and says the store may call law enforcement, if necessary. Starbucks said employees would receive training on enforcing the new policy.",
      "At the time of the 2018 incident, Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz said he didn't want people to feel \"less than\" if they were refused access.",
      "\"We don't want to become a public bathroom, but we're going to make the right decision a hundred percent of the time and give people the key,\" Schultz said.",
      "Since then, though, employees and customers have struggled with unruly and even dangerous behavior in stores. In 2022, Starbucks closed 16 stores around the country \u2014 including six in Los Angeles and six in its hometown of Seattle \u2014 for repeated safety issues, including drug use and other disruptive behaviors that threatened staff.",
      "Since the pandemic shuttered the economy in early 2020, mental health issues as well as misuse of drugs have increased, as well as homelessness.",

    "story": [
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk, alleging the X owner misled shareholders about his Twitter stock purchases in 2022.",
      "The suit alleges Musk violated federal securities laws, enabling him to purchase shares of Twitter at artificially low prices before his $44 billion takeover of the social media site. Musk has called the SEC \"just another weaponized institution doing political dirty work.\"",
      "Musk started buying shares of Twitter, which he later renamed X, in early 2022. By mid-March, he'd acquired ownership of more than 5% of the company's outstanding stock, according to the SEC filing. He was required to file a report with the SEC disclosing his purchases, but the lawsuit alleges he failed to do so in a \"timely\" manner, allowing him to underpay other investors by at least $150 million for shares they bought during that period.",
      "Musk waited until April 4, 2022, 11 days after the report was due, to publicly disclose his beneficial ownership in an SEC report, the commission says.",
      "\"Investors who sold Twitter common stock during this period did so at artificially low prices and thus suffered substantial economic harm,\" the SEC alleges in its suit.",
      "The SEC says it wants the court to order Musk to pay \"disgorgement of unjust enrichment as a result of his violation.\" The SEC is also seeking civil penalties.",
      "Musk responded to news of the suit on X on Tuesday night, calling the SEC a \"totally broken organization.\"",
      "\"They spend their time on s--- like this when there are so many actual crimes that go unpunished,\" Musk wrote.",
      "In a statement late Tuesday night, Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, told CBS News that \"today's action is an admission by the SEC that\u2026they cannot bring an actual case - because Mr musk has done nothing wrong and Everyone sees this sham for what it is.\"",
      "In July 2022, Musk\u00a0tried to pull out of the deal to buy Twitter, but the company sued to hold him to their agreement, and\u00a0he completed the takeover in October of that year.",
      "Musk has tangled with the SEC before. The SEC in 2018 filed a complaint alleging that Musk had misled Tesla investors. In 2023, the SEC said it was seeking a court order to compel Musk to testify as part of its investigation into his purchase of X. He later testified for the investigation.",
      "The SEC lawsuit comes shortly before chairman Gary Gensler's planned resignation from the commission. It's not clear if the new administration will continue the suit. President-elect Donald Trump has selected Paul Atkins as the new SEC head.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 18:45:42 -0500",
    "summary": "The CFPB is suing Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts.",
    "story": [
      "Capital One was sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts. As a result, customers lost more than $2 billion in potential interest payments, the lawsuit claims.",
      "In a complaint filed Tuesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took aim at Capital One's promises and handling of its \"360 Savings\" accounts, which were promoted as accounts providing one of the highest interest rates in the nation. But instead, the CFPB alleges, Capital One froze its rate at a low level for at least several years, even as rates rose nationally.",
      "At the same time, the CFPB adds, the bank created \"360 Performance Savings,\" which had a much higher rate \u2014 at one point, more than 14 times higher than the original \"360 Savings\" accounts. The lawsuit comes at a time when savers have benefitted from the Federal Reserve's decision to ratchet interest rates, part of its effort to fight soaring inflation. As a result, some banks have rolled out high-interest savings accounts to attract savers.",
      "But at the same time, some banks haven't boosted rates on their savings accounts, creating a gap between low-and top-paying accounts, similar to that of Capital One's two offerings. According to the CFPB, Capital One marketed the products similarly to obscure their distinction and forbade employees \"from proactively telling\" those with 360 Savings accounts about the higher-paying 360 Performance Savings, the agency said.",
      "\"Capital One did not specifically notify 360 Savings account holders about the new product, and instead worked to keep them in the dark about these better-paying accounts,\" the CFPB said in a statement. The lawsuit comes at a time when savers have benefitted from the Federal Reserve's decision to ratchet interest rates to fight soaring inflation, which allowed banks to roll out high-interest savings accounts after years of meager rates.",
      "In response, Capital One said that it strongly disagreed with the CFPB's allegations and plans to \"vigorously defend\" itself in court. The banking giant added that it was \"deeply disappointed to see the CFPB continue its recent pattern of filing eleventh-hour lawsuits ahead of a change in administration.\"",
      "Capital One also maintained that all of its 360 banking products \"offer great rates\" \u2014 and have \"always been available in just minutes to all new and existing customers without any of the usual industry restrictions.\"",
      "Billions in lost interest",
      "These actions mean Capital One \"illegally avoided paying billions in interest to millions of consumers,\" the CFPB wrote in its Tuesday complaint. The agency says it's seeking to impose civil penalties and provide financial relief to those impacted.",
      "\"Banks should not be baiting people with promises they can't live up to,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a prepared statement.",
      "According to disclosures on the Capital One's website, 360 Savings accounts currently carry an interest rate of just under 0.50%. 360 Performance Savings accounts have an interest rate of about 3.74%.",
      "That means the rate for 360 Performance Savings is nearly 7.5 times higher than that of 360 Savings today. But the CFPB says they've been farther apart in the past. In July 2024, the agency notes in Tuesday's complaint, the 360 Performance Savings rate was more than 14 times that of 360 Savings.",
      "The CFPB alleges that Capital One kept the rate for its 360 Savings accounts at 0.30% between December 2020 through at least August 2024. The rate for 360 Performance Savings, by contrast, climbed from 0.40% in April 2022 to as high as 4.35% at the start of 2024 \u2014 falling slightly to 4.25% by August, the agency noted Tuesday.",
      "The CFPB's complaint against Capital One comes less than one week before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Despite the change in administration, some say this litigation could still survive.",
      "Analyst commentary from TD Cowen on Tuesday noted that the CFPB still brought enforcement actions under Trump's first term, for example, although such litigation may also be easier to settle under the incoming administration.",

      "As wildfires continue to burn across Los Angeles counties, a solicitation on social media for firefighters ignited fury. It also put a spotlight on a lesser-known labor force that's working hard to extinguish the blaze: private firefighting crews.",

      "\"Need to act fast here. All neighbors houses burning. Will pay any amount,\" he added.",
      "City and county fire departments have been stretched thin, as they continue to battle the wind-fueled fires across Los Angeles that as of Monday have scorched more than 60 square miles\u00a0of land, killing at least 24 people and displacing tens of thousands. Municipal resources, like fire hydrants, have run dry in some areas.",
      "Those who can afford to do so are reaching out to private firefighting crews in hopes of saving their homes from the furious wildfires.",
      "All Risk Shield, a California company providing professional wildfire protection services to homeowners throughout the state, told CBS MoneyWatch that it has responded to more than 120 calls to residences in Los Angeles counties that are at risk from the wildfires.",
      "\"And just like municipal firefighters, we didn't have enough resources to answer everyone's call,\" company spokesperson Jose Torres told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But we have had some saves,\" he added, referring to homes the company has spared from destruction.",
      "How much do private firefighters cost?",
      "Some of the company's firefighters also work for county fire departments. Others are retired from active duty, according to the company, which offers different levels of protective services ranging in price from $2,500 to $14,000.",
      "Clients called on All Risk Shield before the fires reached their properties to try and protect their homes from encroaching flames.",
      "\"We deployed our teams to these high-risk properties we knew the fire was going to possibly reach, and we were on the ground before the fire even made it to that area,\" Torres said. That included fighting fires from homeowners' properties, using residents' resources like pools, spas, rainwater tanks and water tanks to extinguish flames, in addition to the company's own fire retardants. Torres noted that the company never relies on municipal resources, like fire hydrants, to serve private clients.",
      "He added that the company operates completely independently from Los Angeles County Fire Department, but that \"indirectly, we are helping each other.\"",
      "\"Our teams have been working alongside municipal firefighters in this event,\" he said.",
      "The National Wildfire Suppression Association (NWSA), which represents private firefighter services, said that contractors often join forces with local, state and federal firefighting efforts. Contracts with private home and land owners account for a small share of business for these types of companies; the bulk of contracts comes from providing supplemental personnel and equipment to local, state and federal firefighting efforts, according to the NWSA.",
      "Fire prevention and mitigation contractors also do work for insurance companies performing tasks to reduce fire risks, such as clearing undergrowth, trimming or removing trees near homes, and applying fire retardants. A growing segment of the industry, this work typically occurs during the off-season and not in response to active fires.",
      "An \"all hands on deck\" situation",
      "The association, which represents 369 private firefighting companies across the country, confirmed that its members have directed personnel and other resources toward containing the Los Angeles wildfires. Combined, its member organizations can pool up to 11,000 professionally trained wildland firefighters.",
      "\"The size and scale of these fires and the devastation left in their wake require an all-hands-on-deck approach to suppression, restoration and future prevention, including state, federal and private resources,\" the NWSA said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",

That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Edgar cautioned that more sophisticated VPNs require time, money and effort to set up.",
      "\"It's not something Americans are used to doing because we haven't experienced our government filtering the internet,\" he said.",
      "What are some TikTok alternatives?",
      "Users looking for a TikTok replacement app do have alternatives, such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.",
      "\"Short-form video content is something people want and they'll continue to find ways to get it,\" Edgar said.",
      "Another substitute is Lemon8, a social media app owned by ByteDance that launched in 2020, although experts note it could be subject to the same law that threatens to ban TikTok in the U.S.",
      "RedNote, a Shanghai-based Chinese language social media app also bears many similarities to TikTok. Called \"Xiaohongshu\" in China, meaning \"little red book\" in Mandarin, it's available for download in app stores in the U.S., and is currently the top social app in Apple's store.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:00:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk claims the U.S. needs a pipeline of foreign employees working on H-1B visas because the country lacks skilled engineers. Here's what the data shows.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk sparked fierce online debate recently when the billionaire said on social media that the U.S. lacks enough top engineers, pointing to immigration as the solution to what he characterized as a dearth of technical expertise.",
      "\"There is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America,\" Musk posted on his social media platform, X, comparing tech companies to a pro sports team scouting players. \"If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE.\"",
      "The claims are at the center of a divide between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, who tend to take a hard line against immigration, and technology entrepreneurs like Musk, who along with X runs exploration company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, both of which employ many foreign workers hired with H-1B visas.",
      "Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers.",
      "Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71.",
      "Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years.",
      "Companies with the most H-1B workers",
      "Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position.",
      "\"The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes,\" said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. \"If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor.\"",
      "Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages.",
      "Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills.",
      "In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract.",
      "These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said.",
      "\"Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs.\"",
      "A boost to innovation?",
      "Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One\u00a0study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers.",
      "The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed.",
      "\"Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters,\" said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, \"There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent.\"",
      "Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow.",
      "But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers.",
      "When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable.",
      "Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe.",
      "More firing than hiring",
      "Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023.",
      "The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform.",
      "How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed \"Buy American and Hire American,\" aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",
      "But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a \"great program.\" Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would \"go to war on this issue\" in one X post.",
      "\"I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas,\" Trump said. \"That's why we have them.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 08:13:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposal is raising concerns with the chip industry, with artificial intelligence leader Nvidia calling it \"misguided.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that would limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, part of an effort to preserve America's six- to 18-month advantage on AI over rivals such as China.",
      "Proposed Monday, the framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict in 120 countries the chips used for data centers and AI products. Mexico, Portugal, Israel and Switzerland are among the nations that could have limited access.",
      "Chip giant Nvidia on Monday called\u00a0the proposal \"misguided,\" and said that it \"threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\"",
      "On a call with reporters previewing the framework, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that it's \"critical\" to preserve America's leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips. The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.",
      "\"As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense,\" Raimondo said. The framework \"is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.\"",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.",
      "Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve U.S. companies' advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains.",
      "AI-enhanced technology is forecast to help fuel growth and boost corporate productivity, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling the tech developments a \"once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution\" in a recent research note.",
      "Risks to AI leadership?",
      "A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\"While we share the U.S. government's commitment to national and economic security, the rule's potential risks to U.S. global leadership in AI cannot be emphasized enough,\" said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group's senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry.",
      "One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.",
      "Nvidia bashes proposal",
      "Because the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration of President-elect Donald Trump could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips. This sets up a scenario in which Trump will have to balance economic interests with the need to keep the United States and its allies safe.",
      "Ned Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI's development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.",
      "\"While cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,\" he said. \"The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\"",
      "Under the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.",
      "Nations without restrictions",
      "The allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.",
      "Users outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the U.S.",
      "Institutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.",
      "Also, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.",

    "summary": "The first congestion pricing plan in the U.S. has begun, charging most drivers $9 a day to enter the lower half of Manhattan. The long-debated plan is projected to raise up to $800 million a year for the city's aging public transit system. Will it work?",
    "story": [
      "By some measures, New York City's traffic is more congested than it's ever been. Enter: Congestion pricing. Since last Sunday, during most hours, cars crossing into the lower half of Manhattan are charged nine dollars. There's a higher toll for trucks.",
      "Fourteen hundred cameras keep tabs on the roughly 150,000 commuters entering the zone by car.",
      "\"If we can just impact on a proportion of those people, we can make a difference and make it a much better place for everybody,\" said Janno Lieber, who heads the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs New York's sprawling subway, bus and commuter rail systems. \"We're wasting a ton of money, literally billions of dollars, according to our business leaders, having people stuck in traffic.\"",
      "The haul from congestion pricing will go largely to the MTA, to improve mass transit. According to Lieber, it will raise between $500 and $800 million a year.",
      "The pricing idea began in 1952, and gained traction in the early 2000s. But there've been a lot of bumps in the road. There were lawsuits and protests, for and against.",
      "New Jersey drivers were none too happy; they already pay more than $15 in bridge and tunnel tolls to get into the city.",
      "Singapore began congestion pricing in 1975, and Stockholm in 2006. But New York based its plan on London's, which rolled out in 2003.",
      "Opponents in New York say this is just a cash grab \u2013 another tax that will hurt mainly working people.",

      "\"Congestion Pricing\" passes in New York as other states consider the plan for themselves",
      "John McDonagh has driven a cab for more than 40 years. He's also a playwright and radio host, and is not a fan of the plan. \"It will not reduce congestion here,\" McDonagh said. \"The street designs of New York now, we have a bus lane on one side, we got a bike lane on the other, concrete barriers. So, 10 cars gives you congestion.\"",
      "But with the money going to improve public transport, that will help everybody, right?",
      "McDonagh replied, \"Oh, it does? We had a woman that was burned on the subway. We had people being pushed onto the tracks. There's robberies. And if you take the subway in New York, jumping the turnstile now is an Olympic sport.\"",
      "It's called turnstile jumping \u2013 or more politely, \"fare evasion\" \u2013 and the MTA projects it will lose $800 million a year because of it, around the same figure congestion pricing may bring in.",
      "And then there is fare evasion on buses. According to the MTA, 47 percent of riders aren't paying.",
      "\"The MTA has now installed cameras so that they can catch people,\" said Kathy Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, which mobilizes business leaders to help the city thrive. \"They are providing police, even the National Guard is in our system to make sure the people pay their fare.\"",
      "Wylde is a longtime advocate for congestion pricing, and has advice for other American cities: \"You have to explain the benefits clearly,\" she said. \"You have to have transit options in most cases. Otherwise, it's just another tax, because if somebody has no choice, they're gonna resist.",
      "\"The lesson from London [is], they put in 200 new bus routes before they turned on congestion pricing,\" Wylde said. \"And that was how they got the public to accept it. They had a choice.\"",
      "It's hard to tell how it's working in New York City after a week, but according to Wylde, \"We're very excited that, in just a few days of congestion pricing, we're seeing a significant reduction in traffic already.\"",
      "Yet, the battle may not be over in New York. Among its opponents: once and future president Donald Trump. Wylde isn't worried, though. \"President Trump has property in New York,\" she said. \"He, I'm sure, has been stuck in traffic more than a few times here.

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:21:39 -0500",
    "summary": "The chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase explains why he's referred to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme; his bank's efforts to improve the lives of lower-income Americans; and his recent near-death experience.",
    "story": [
      "Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, says he was not surprised that Donald Trump won the election: \"People were angry at whatever they called the state \u2013 the 'swamp.' Ineffective government. That people wanted kind of more pro-growth and pro-business policies, that they didn't want to be lectured to on social policies continuously. I think it's the lecturing part of it. It's social superiority, it's the 'My way or the highway.' I traveled all over the country; I felt it wherever I went.\"",
      "I asked, \"There's a sense of gloom out there about the economy. Do you understand that?\"",
      "\"I do understand it, 'cause I think there are a lot of legitimate concerns that Americans have. For example, ineffective government, they're angry about it. They're angry about immigration. There're people with legitimate issues.\"",
      "Despite lower unemployment, a calming of inflation, and a soaring stock marker, even he says he's \"cautiously pessimistic\" about the economy. And as head of the largest bank in America, it matters what Dimon has to say about things.",
      "Listen to him on Bitcoin, which he's referred to as \"a Ponzi scheme\" and \"as useless as a pet rock\": \"We are going to have some kind of digital currency at some point. I'm not against crypto. You know, Bitcoin itself has no intrinsic value. It's used heavily by sex traffickers, money launderers, ransomware. I just don't feel great about Bitcoin. I applaud your ability to wanna buy or sell it. Just like I think you have the right to smoke, but I don't think you should smoke!\"",
      "Since he took charge of the bank 20 years ago, the company has doubled its number of employees to 320,000, and grown its assets by nearly $3 trillion. Which probably would surprise his grandparents, who came to the U.S. from Greece with little money in the early 1900s.",
      "Dimon spent much of his childhood in an apartment building in a middle-class neighborhood in Queens, New York, sharing a room with his two brothers. Revisiting the street where he grew up, Dimon noted, \"I broke my arm on those monkey bars over there.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did you ever dream when you were growing up, in a million years that you'd be running one of the biggest banks in the world?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"My dad was a stockbroker. So, I was sometimes conscious of that part of the world. But I had never met a CEO until I was in college or something like that.\"",
      "He grew up to be one of most successful CEOs in the country, processing $10 trillion a day.",
      "His bank is thriving and healthy, but Dimon, now 68, has had two major health scares. The first was throat cancer a decade ago.",
      "He says it's in remission: \"But I know a little bit more,\" he said. \"People who have been told they have cancer know a little bit more than other people. That's staring you right in the face and it may actually happen. You become a little more deliberate, a little more thoughtful. You don't want to have regrets.\"",
      "He also had a heart scare in March 2020, at the beginning of COVID. \"My heart, I just, I mean, the pain was extraordinary. I thought I heard it rip. It was an aortic dissection. I had a tear in the aorta.\" He was told he might not make it.",
      "I asked, \"Going in for surgery, you know, at least you think in your mind, 'I've lived the life I should've lived so far'?\"",
      "\"Yeah. Not enough of it, but yeah,\" Dimon laughed.",
      "He woke up after seven or eight hours on the operating table: \"The doctor told me I was one of the only people he's ever seen wake up immediately after surgery like that. I waved at my kids, who had been sitting there the whole time. And then, I was back asleep in the ICU.",
      "\"Waking up in the ICU, I mean, like, when you're a man who's never had to rely on other people really, and all of a sudden you have tubes everywhere and you can't do anything yourself, and you know, you got tubes in your heart and tubes in your lungs and tubes down your jugular\u2026\"",
      "He was in the hospital for a week, back at work a month later, and soon traveling the world, which he does, he says, 40 percent of his time.",
      "We met him in the executive suite on the 43rd floor of the bank's Manhattan headquarters. From there, he can see where he grew up \u2013 and to the left, the nearly-twice-as-high, dazzling new JPMorgan headquarters going up next door, which he says will be taller than the Empire State Building.",
      "With all the big things he deals with, it's interesting that one of the things Dimon is most proud of is opening branches in lower-income and underserved communities around the country. Visiting one branch in Harlem, he noted, \"Mortgage documentation is really hard to do. So, in one of these community branches, a guy stood up and he said he finally bought a home that he'd lived in for 30 years. He said there's no way he could have gotten that mortgage if one of our mortgage loan officers didn't call him every day for months, taking him through it, making him feel comfortable, getting the forms. He got our homeowner's grant. And it works.\"",
      "This isn't a not-for-profit; these local branches make money for the bank.",
      "But what about the other end of the spectrum? Asked about the increasing wealth of the very rich and what might be \"out of whack\" with the system, Dimon replied, \"I think you have to be very careful to say, 'What's outta whack?' You want a healthy economy, and a really healthy economy lifts up all citizens. You want to help all Americans? Grow the economy. You can wail at the moon. That's not going to grow the economy. And if there are unfair things that created some of that wealth, they should be fixed.\"",
      "\"But I'm not hearing you say, 'There's something wrong here that there are these billionaires growing like poppy.' I mean, what is it? The tax laws?\"",
      "\"If I was king for a day, I would probably change a bunch of the tax laws, too, which I'm not gonna give you specifics on. It won't reduce it as much as you seem to think it should be reduced.\"",
      "\"No. But I'm interested that you're not saying, 'This is wrong. This is not working.'\"",
      "\"I think the wrong part is that the bottom 30% didn't do better, not that the top 0.1% did so well.\"",
      "\"Why not?\"",
      "\"They may be unrelated. What we need to do to fix it for everybody \u2026\"",
      "\"But you haven't said what's wrong at the other end?\"",
      "\"I don't know what's wrong at the other end,\" Dimon replied.",
      "Dimon himself is a billionaire. We asked him about the richest person in the world, Elon Musk. \"He's clearly an extraordinary talent,\" Dimon said. \"I mean, to look at Tesla and SpaceX, yeah, well, we should make government more efficient. Is this the way to do it? I don't know. Do I want them to succeed? Absolutely.\"",
      "\"But it's odd to have a man who's so wealthy, with so many important companies that matter to our economy and even to our national security, now sort of insinuating that he can influence right-wing politics in Europe. It doesn't sound right, does it?\"",
      "Dimon said, \"I'm not responsible for his behavior, so let him do it. But when you say it's odd, it's not that odd. It's been going on in this country for a long time. If you go back to Lindbergh, there's been more interfering in cross-Atlantic politics than you would think.\"",
      "\"Are you distressed by it?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"Take it in stride?\"",
      "\"Take it in stride.\"",
      "\"Somebody called him an oligarch, an American oligarch.\"",
      "\"Yeah, that's name-calling.\"",
      "Dimon has been in banking for more than 40 years, which leads to the inevitable question: When will he retire? \"Last time I was asked, I said, less than five years. But when you say retire, I'm not going to retire like that. I may write a book. I may teach. I may work with my kids, if they want. I would never pressure them to work with me.\"",
      "\"I didn't hear you say, 'I might become chairman and, you know, just give up the CEO part.'\"",
      "\"Oh, that's likely. That's likely to happen. Again, that is up to the board, not up to me. But if it makes sense, I may be chairing for a couple years.\"",
      "He says he does not know whom his successor might be. But one thing he does know: \"I love my job. I love what it does. I like our people. It motivates me. Like a lotta people, by Friday I'm exhausted. I want to go home, I want to have my martini and go to sleep! But I do love my job. I think it's great to have a purpose in life.

      "\"These are always significant appointments, but I think right now appointments like these are more significant than ever,\" DeSantis said. \"This is a time for action and a time for Washington, D.C., to deliver results for the American people.\"",
      "DeSantis called Trump's victory in the 2024 election \"remarkable,\" saying he earned a \"mandate for change.\"",
      "\"No more business as usual in Washington, D.C.,\" DeSantis added.",
      "The Florida governor emphasized border security as part of that mandate, saying Florida would be working with the Trump administration to make sure immigration laws are enforced.",
      "DeSantis outlined his criteria for the Senate appointment Thursday, saying he wanted someone who would deliver on Trump's agenda, commit to cutting spending, understand that federal bureaucracy has \"run amok\" and understand \"the fight against illegal immigration.\"",
      "Moody, 49, has served as Florida's attorney general since 2019. DeSantis touted Moody's \"impressive resume\" as a commercial litigator and federal prosecutor, noting that she became Florida's youngest circuit court judge in 2007. The Florida governor said Moody has been someone who \"has acted time and time again to support the values that we all share,\" from addressing the opioid and fentanyl crisis to illegal immigration and human trafficking.",
      "DeSantis also pointed to Moody's track record of supporting the president-elect, noting that she signed on to lawsuits to \"take on the weaponization of law enforcement that targeted then-candidate Donald Trump,\" took on special counsel Jack Smith and fought back against New York Attorney General Letitia James. He also noted that Moody led the state investigation into the second assassination attempt against Trump in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "Moody, speaking after DeSantis on Thursday, said she would \"bring the same persistence and passion and tenacity as a United States senator that I have brought as Florida's attorney general.\"",
      "\"I'm ready to show up and fight for this nation and fight for President Trump to deliver the America first agenda on day one,\" Moody said, while pledging to rein in \"out of control federal agencies\" and bring down spending.",
      "Senate vacancies in Florida are filled by an appointment by the governor, who selects a replacement to serve until the next statewide election. DeSantis' appointment means Moody will be expected to hold the seat until a special election can be held in 2026. The winner of the 2026 election would serve the remainder of Rubio's term, meaning that person would have to run for election again in 2028.",
      "The announcement comes after months of speculation about who could fill the seat. A number of possibilities have emerged for DeSantis to appoint, including Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who until recently was the co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Last month, she said she was removing herself from consideration.",
      "DeSantis' chief of staff James Uthmeier and Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez had also been floated, as had former Florida House Speaker Jose Olivia. DeSantis said Thursday that he also thinks highly of Reps. Kat Cammack and Cory Mills, whom he said had also been in the mix, but he didn't want to jeopardize the narrow House Republican majority. He noted that Uthmeier would become Florida's new attorney general.",
      "Trump tapped Rubio, who has represented Florida in the Senate since 2011, for the Cabinet post in November. The 53-year-old China hawk has extensive foreign policy experience and is expected to have among the smoothest paths to confirmation in the Senate. He appeared at his confirmation hearing this week, and is expected to resign from the Senate when Trump is sworn in next week.",

    "summary": "Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee say Attorney General Merrick Garland should \"take all necessary steps\" to ensure the rest of the special counsel's report is released before Trump takes office.",
    "story": [
      "Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee are urging Attorney General Merrick Garland to consider dropping the federal charges against Donald Trump's former co-defendants in the classified documents case, Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira, to ensure that the Justice Department can release the rest of special counsel Jack Smith's final report about Trump's alleged crimes.",
      "Nauta, an aide to Trump, and de Oliveira, a former property manager at Mar-a-Lago, are accused of obstructing the investigation into Trump's handling of sensitive government documents after he lost reelection in 2020. Both have pleaded not guilty.",
      "Garland previously said he would not publicly release the second part of Smith's report, which details the allegations in the documents case, because the proceedings involving Nauta and de Oliveira were ongoing.",
      "In a letter to Garland Thursday morning, the committee Democrats, including Ranking Member Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Rep. Dan Goldman of New York, say the public needs to see the second half of Smith's findings.",
      "They write in the letter:",
      "\"The American people now deserve the opportunity to read Volume 2 of Special Counsel Smith's report, which explains how President Trump knowingly retained hundreds of presidential and highly classified records at his Mar-a-Lago club and then deliberately defied subpoenas, obstructed law enforcement, hid evidence, and lied about his continuing retention of these records. It is in the very nature of American democracy that the people have a right to know of the public actions of their public officials, and it is essential to the rule of law that Justice Department special counsel reports continue to be available and accessible to the public. As Attorney General, it is incumbent upon you to take all necessary steps to ensure the report is released before the end of your tenure, including, if necessary, by simply dismissing the remaining criminal charges against Mr. Trump's co-conspirators, Waltine Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Garland released the first volume of Smith's findings, which covered allegations that Trump conspired in an effort to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "Trump slammed the report and Smith, referring to him in a social media post as \"deranged\" and \"a lamebrain prosecutor who was unable to get his case tried before the Election, which I won in a landslide.\"",

      "Nauta, de Oliveira and Trump have sought to block the release of Smith's report on the classified records case amid proceedings in Nauta and de Oliveira's criminal cases.",
      "The letter from committee Democrats also said, \"To the extent that such a decision to dismiss these cases might encourage these defendants to keep enabling the corruption of their superiors, those concerns are outweighed by the many indications that Mr. Trump will simply end the prosecutions against his co-conspirators upon taking office anyway and then instruct his DOJ to permanently bury this report.

    "summary": "President Biden delivered his fifth and final address from the Oval Office five days before the end of his single term in office.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden, in his farewell address to the nation Wednesday, spent little time dwelling on the accomplishments of his single term in office, instead telling Americans he wanted to use his final address \"to warn the country of some things that give me great concern.\"",
      "Calling to mind President Dwight Eisenhower's 1961 farewell address, he warned of the potential dangers of a \"tech industrial complex.\" He noted that Eisenhower \"spoke of the dangers of the military industrial complex\" and \"the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power.\"",
      "Now, \"six decades later, I'm equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech industrial complex,\" Mr. Biden said.",
      "\"Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation enabling the abuse of power,\" the president warned. \"The free press is crumbling. Errors are disappearing. Social media is giving up on fact checking. The truth is smothered by lies told for power and for profit.\" And meanwhile, he added, \"artificial intelligence is most consequential technology of our time, perhaps of all time.\"",
      "Mr. Biden also expanded on the critical role of democracy in the U.S., which he has said in the past motivated him to run for the presidency four years ago. He talked about respecting the institutions that govern a free society \u2014 the presidency, the Congress, the judiciary and a free press.",
      "\"In the past four years, our democracy has held strong, and everyday, I've kept my commitment to be president for all Americans in one of the toughest periods of our nation's history,\" Mr. Biden said.",
      "He said he was worried about \"a dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very few ultra-wealthy people, the dangerous consequences if their abuse of power is left unchecked.\"",
      "\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" Mr. Biden said. He added that the consequences could be seen across the country. It was, he said, something that had happened over a century earlier, but \"the American people stood up to the robber barons back then.\"",
      "Mr. Biden delivered his fifth and final formal Oval Office address five days before he'll pass the mantle of the presidency to the man who is both his predecessor and successor, President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "His speech also came hours after he announced a\u00a0ceasefire and hostage release deal\u00a0between Israel and Hamas, a deal the U.S. was heavily involved in negotiating. The deal was the first issue the president mentioned in his speech Wednesday night, and he noted that his administration kept in touch with Trump officials during the negotiations.",
      "\"This plan was developed and negotiated by my team, and it will be largely implemented by the incoming administration. That's why I told my team to keep the incoming administration fully informed \u2014 because that's how it should be \u2014 working together as Americans.\"",
      "\"This will be my final address to you, the American people, from the Oval Office, from this desk as president,\" he said. \"And I've been thinking a lot about who we are, and maybe more importantly, who we should be.\"",
      "Wednesday night's speech wraps up not only Mr. Biden's time as president, but his time in elected office. Apart from the four years following his vice presidency, Mr. Biden has held elected office every year since 1973.",
      "In his address Wednesday, Mr. Biden for the first time took a position on term limits for the Supreme Court. He proposed a term limit of 18 years for justices. And he also called on Congress to amend the Constitution to \"make clear that no president, no president is immune from crimes that he or she commits while in office.\" Neither is likely to happen.",
      "On the foreign policy front, the president said his administration \"strengthened\" NATO, noted Ukraine remains free and said the U.S. has pulled ahead in its competition with China. He emphasized the critical role artificial intelligence will play in the future, and said the U.S. \u2014 not China \u2014 must lead the way in this field.",
      "The president highlighted his domestic policy work as well, including the enactment of the bipartisan gun control law, a measure that helps veterans exposed to toxic material, as well as job creation policies.",
      "\"I'm so proud of how much we've accomplished together for the American people. And I wish the incoming administration success, because I want America to succeed,\" he said.",
      "As he leaves public office, Mr. Biden told Americans it's \"your turn to stand guard.\"",
      "\"May you all be the keeper of the flame,\" he said. \"May you keep the faith. I love America. You love it, too. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.\"",
      "Mr. Biden has been on an informal farewell tour in recent days. He delivered his final foreign policy speech at the State Department Monday and a speech on his conservation legacy Tuesday. He's also expected to speak Thursday at a Pentagon commander-in-chief farewell ceremony.",

      "That's because more than four years after the Capitol riot, a new dispute is emerging over a plaque to honor the heroes and victims of the assault. A 2022 law passed by Congress, and signed by President Biden, required a plaque to be placed on the west front of the Capitol complex by March 2023. Republican House leaders, all of whom are closely aligned with Trump, have yet to erect the plaque, nor have they offered any timetable to do so.",
      "In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday, a group of nearly 60 House Democrats wrote, \"As Members of Congress, we owe a debt of gratitude to these brave officers who defended the Capitol and allowed us to get to safety. We request an update from you regarding your timeline for following the law and placing this plaque.\"",
      "Among the House Democrats pressing for the plaque is Rep. Jason Crow, a Democrat from Colorado who was among those trapped in the upper level of the House Chamber as rioters laid siege to the Capitol. Crow and colleagues wrote to Johnson, \"Every day Congress fails to live up to our promised actions, we do a disservice to our men and women in uniform who help protect members of Congress, congressional staff, our constituents, and the American people.\"",
      "Other Democrats who have signed the letter to Johnson include former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, some members of the House Jan. 6 select committee and other Democrats who were trapped in close proximity to the violent mob.",
      "Johnson's office did not respond to CBS News' requests for comment or updates about the plaque or its timetable. He also declined to answer questions last week about the status of the project.",
      "The letter from House Democrats said a House administrator had testified that the \"plaque was complete,\" and said its placement \"continues to await action from Speaker Johnson.\"",
      "More than 140 police officers were injured during the Capitol attack. Several others died by suicide in the days after the riot.",
      "Several Democrats and staffers who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6 have accused Republicans of bowing to Trump by downplaying or ignoring the violence of the siege. Former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who unsuccessfully ran for a U.S. House seat in Maryland as a Democrat last year, told CBS News, \"Speaker Johnson has not and cannot provide any reason.\"",
      "\"At this point he is doing nothing but obstructing,\" Dunn said.",
      "Democrats have been pressing House leaders about the plaque delay for months without success. In May, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who was on the House Jan. 6 select committee investigating the assault, wrote to Johnson for answers about the \"failure to install the plaque.\"",
      "Lofgren told CBS News, \"I sent Speaker Johnson a polite letter inquiring about the delay last May, and he never answered. My office followed up, and we were first referred to a vague press answer. Then, crickets\"",
      "Rep. Joe Morelle, a New York Democrat who is the ranking member of the Committee on House Administration, told CBS News, \"The plaque should be installed as required by law. Refusing to display the Jan. 6 plaque is part of the denialism that Republicans have made a central part of their being: deny Jan. 6 happened and the harm it caused to the U.S. Capitol Police force and our American democracy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney general, vowed to end the \"weaponization\" of the Justice Department at her confirmation hearing on Wednesday, saying her focus will be on reducing crime and upholding the law.",
      "The former Florida attorney general, who represented Trump during his first impeachment, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday to testify about her nomination, which is all but certain to be approved in the GOP-controlled Senate.",
      "She spent much of the hearing seeking to allay concerns from skeptical Democrats that Trump would use the Justice Department to target his political enemies once in office.",
      "\"There will never be an enemies list within the Department of Justice,\" Bondi said, adding that she believes prosecutors under President Biden unfairly targeted Trump for the last four years.",
      "\"I will fight every day to restore confidence and integrity to the Department of Justice and each of its components,\" she said. \"The partisanship, the weaponization, will be gone. America will have one tier of justice for all.\"",
      "Democrats did not seem convinced, repeatedly pressing Bondi on whether she'd investigate and prosecute figures ranging from former Rep. Liz Cheney and former special counsel Jack Smith to journalists and Trump critics.",
      "Bondi's confirmation hearing",
      "Trump selected Bondi to be his nominee for U.S. attorney general after his first pick, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration. Bondi made history in 2010 when she became the first woman to serve as Florida's attorney general, a role she held for two terms.",
      "\"If confirmed as the next attorney general of the United States, my overriding objective will be to return the Department of Justice to its core mission of keeping Americans safe and vigorously prosecuting criminals,\" Bondi said in her opening statement.",
      "Bondi said her time as a local prosecutor framed her goals for the Justice Department, which she described as \"getting back to the basics\" of combating crime and reducing recidivism.",
      "Republicans on the committee largely focused on Bondi's decades of crimefighting experience as a local prosecutor, and later as Florida attorney general. They claimed the Justice Department has been \"weaponized\" in recent years for political reasons, pointing to the prosecutions of Trump that have been dropped since the election.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the committee's top Democrat, noted Bondi's experience, but said it is Trump who has vowed to use the Justice Department to target his political enemies. Durbin said he wants assurances that Bondi would keep the Justice Department independent, and would be willing to say \"no\" to Trump. Trump clashed with his two attorneys general, Jeff Sessions and William Barr, over decisions they made in his first term.",
      "Durbin asked Bondi if she accepted that Trump lost the election in 2020, a fact that he and many of his prominent supporters have not publicly acknowledged. Bondi stopped short of doing so Wednesday.",
      "\"There was a peaceful transition of power. President Trump left office and was overwhelmingly elected in 2024,\" Bondi said. Bondi told Durbin that she \"accept[s] the results\" of the 2020 election but declined to say outright that Mr. Biden won.",
      "Durbin asked if Bondi would support pardons for people convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Bondi said, if asked, she would review potential pardons on a \"case by case basis,\" adding: \"I condemn any violence on a law enforcement officer in this country.\"",
      "Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, asked Bondi if she would \"be willing to resign if ordered to do something improper.\"",
      "\"Senator, I wouldn't work at a law firm, I wouldn't be a prosecutor, I wouldn't be attorney general if anyone asked me to do something improper and I felt I had to carry that out, of course I would not do that,\" Bondi said. \"That's one of the main things you learn as a young prosecutor, is to do the right thing.\"",
      "Later, she told Coons she and the president-elect have not discussed appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Mr. Biden \u2014 a threat Trump has made. Throughout the hearing, she argued she would keep the Justice Department independent from the White House, including by upholding a department policy limiting contacts with White House officials.",
      "Bondi was repeatedly pressed by Democrats about whether she would target perceived Trump foes, including Cheney and Smith, who led the dual federal investigations against Trump. During one particularly heated exchange, she declined to say if she knew of any factual predicate for investigating Cheney, and told California Sen. Adam Schiff his concerns are misplaced.",
      "\"You're all so worried about Liz Cheney, senator, you know what we should be worried about? The crime rate in California right now is through the roof,\" she said.",
      "Bondi was also asked by Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, about the reauthorization of Section 702, a government intelligence collection tool that has come under fire from some Republicans in Congress. She said she would take a look at the issue and called Section 702 a \"very important tool.\"",
      "Bondi's nomination",
      "Bondi's confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee was one of several taking place before GOP-led panels this week as Trump prepares to begin his second term in office. Republicans have indicated they plan to give substantial deference to Trump as he fills out the top ranks of his administration and are aiming to install key Cabinet officials to their posts soon after the president-elect is inaugurated Monday.",
      "Bondi spent the weeks leading up to her confirmation hearing meeting with senators on Capitol Hill, and she is not expected to face significant hurdles in the Republican-led Senate.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, Durbin accused Trump of using the Justice Department as his personal law firm and said he was concerned Bondi will prioritize fealty to Trump over loyalty to the Constitution. He met with Bondi last week.",
      "Bondi was term-limited in her position as Florida's attorney general and left office in 2019. While in office, she spearheaded lawsuits against the Obama administration, challenging the Affordable Care Act \u2014 known as Obamacare \u2014 and then-President Barack Obama's immigration policies.",
      "She went on to serve as an attorney and lobbyist at the firm Ballard Partners. There, she represented large corporations like General Motors, Amazon, Uber and the American Institute Against Human Trafficking, according to Open Secrets, a nonprofit that tracks lobbying. And she submitted a registration with the federal government to lobby on behalf of Qatar \"regarding Qatari relations with U.S. government officials, U.S. business entities, and non-governmental audiences, in dealing with matters pertaining to combating human trafficking.\"",
      "At her hearing on Wednesday, Bondi said she was \"very proud of the work that I did\" with Qatar, telling Durbin her work was focused on \"anti-human trafficking efforts related to the World Cup.\"",
      "\"I was registered as FARA along with many members of my firm. That was the sole portion of my representation for Qatar,\" she said, referencing a federal law that requires lobbyists who work for foreign countries to register with the government.",
      "During Trump's first term, Bondi briefly left her lobbying position to serve as a member of his defense team during the first set of impeachment proceedings pursued by congressional Democrats. She defended Trump's July 2019 call with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, in which Trump pressured Zelenskyy to investigate Mr. Biden.",
      "The Democratic-led House voted to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstructing a congressional investigation, making him just the third U.S. president to ever be impeached. The Republican-led Senate then acquitted him following a trial, where Bondi was part of the team representing Trump.",
      "In the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, Bondi spearheaded legal efforts to challenge the results in Pennsylvania and pushed the false claim that Trump won the state. She was asked about that work in Wednesday's hearing.",
      "\"I was an advocate for the campaign, and I was on the ground in Pennsylvania and I saw many things there. But do I accept the results? Of course I do. Do I agree with what happened?\" Bondi said. \"No one from either side of the aisle should want there to be any issues with election integrity in our country. We should all want our elections to be free and fair, and the rules and the law to be followed.\"",
      "Bondi was also among the Trump allies who traveled to New York and spoke out in defense of the president-elect early last year during his \"hush money\" criminal trial. A jury convicted Trump on 34 state felony counts of falsifying business records in May and he was sentenced last week.",
      "After the Justice Department brought criminal charges against Trump in 2023, Bondi told Fox News, \"The Department of Justice, the prosecutors will be prosecuted, the bad ones. The investigators will be investigated because the deep state last term for President Trump, they were hiding in the shadows. But now they have a spotlight on them.\"",
      "If confirmed, she will now lead that department and will have the power to look into various aspects of the investigations into Trump that were led by Smith. She will also oversee the numerous law enforcement components under the Justice Department, including the FBI and the ATF, two organizations that have been targets of the president-elect and his allies.",
      "Bondi will also oversee implementation of aspects of Trump's agency and lead the department that will defend the president-elect's actions in federal court.",

      "The federal government is withdrawing a proposal that would\u00a0require more ships to slow down\u00a0in East Coast waters to try to save a vanishing species of whale, officials said Wednesday.",
      "The move in the waning days of the Biden administration will leave the endangered North Atlantic right whale vulnerable to extinction as the Trump administration is signaling a shift from environmental conservation to support for marine industries, conservation groups said. But federal authorities said there's no way to implement the rules before\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump\u00a0takes office on Monday.",
      "The new vessel speed rules proposed by the National Marine Fisheries Service more than two years ago have been the topic of much debate among shippers, commercial fishermen and wildlife conservationists, who all have a stake in the whale's fate. The whale, which is vulnerable to collisions with ships, numbers less than 380 and\u00a0its population has plummeted\u00a0in recent years.",
      "The Trump administration is likely to be less enthusiastic about new restrictions on shipping, said Gib Brogan, a campaign director with conservation group Oceana.",
      "\"While we've been waiting and watching the proposed rule move forward, and ultimately stall, we've watched on the water outcomes of the current insufficient protections,\" Brogan said. \"And we've watched whales be killed by speeding boats.\"",

      "The final rule to modify North Atlantic right whale vessel speed regulations had been with the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which reviews new regulations before they are implemented, said Katherine Silverstein, a spokesperson for the National Marine Fisheries Service. She confirmed the fisheries service withdrew the rule on Wednesday.",
      "Conservation groups have\u00a0long argued that\u00a0tighter ship speed rules are necessary to protect the whales, in part because warm ocean waters appear to be causing the animals to stray from protected zones. The federal government first announced the proposal in summer 2022 and a coalition of environmental groups\u00a0sued to try to speed up\u00a0the finalization of the rules last year.",
      "Some shippers, however, have argued that the rules could be economically devastating to boating and shipping industries.",
      "\"This is a huge step forward for American boat manufacturers, coastal economies, and outdoor enthusiasts across the U.S.,\" said Frank Hugelmeyer, president and CEO of the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the largest trade association in North America for the recreational boating industry. \"The way this rule was drafted gave rulemaking a bad name and created an entirely preventable dynamic.\"",
      "What to know about North Atlantic right whales",
      "Right whales are massive creatures that grow to be between 45 and 52 feet in length. Adults can weigh up to 70 tons, according to NOAA. They're identified by signature white calluses on the head.",
      "They were once numerous off the East Coast, but their numbers were devastated during the commercial whaling era. They have been a protected species for many years but have been slow to recover.",
      "The whales migrate from their calving grounds off Florida and Georgia to feeding grounds off New England and Canada. The journey has become increasingly perilous as the tiny organisms they eat seek colder waters, causing the whales to leave established protected areas, scientists have said.",
      "Earlier this year, scientists were concerned after seeing nearly a quarter of the world's population of the critically endangered North Atlantic\u00a0right whales\u00a0in an unusual and potentially dangerous spot for them, CBS News Boston reported.",
      "The New England Aquarium said at least 82 whales were observed in late July and August during research flights south of New York's Long Island \u2014 hundreds of miles away from\u00a0New England\u00a0and Canadian waters where they are typically seen in the summer.",
      "Aquarium scientist Katherine McKenna told the station that scientists didn't know for sure why the whales were in that area, but they seemed to be following food.",
      "\"They're kind of becoming more unpredictable with what they're doing in response to how the ocean conditions are changing,\" she said.",
      "Why these whales are important",
      "Whales are at the top of the ocean's food chain and they help capture carbon from the atmosphere, according to the international nonprofit World Wildlife Fund.",
      "The right whale is among six out of the 13 great whale species that are classified as endangered or vulnerable.",
      "They numbered more than 480 in 2010, but that fell by more than 25% over the following decade. It has\u00a0ticked up slightly\u00a0more recently, but the animal remains critically endangered. Vessel strikes are \"a leading cause of the species' decline,\" the National Marine Fisheries Service said in documents.",
      "Conservation groups that have pushed for the finalization of slower ship speed rules said they were motivated in part by documented collision deaths of right whales in recent years. In one much-publicized case last year, a calf stranded off the state of Georgia\u00a0had head injuries\u00a0consistent with a vessel strike, according to government investigators.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 15:19:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Sen. Marco Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the State Department as secretary of state, answered questions Wednesday from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Marco Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the State Department as secretary of state, called China \"the most potent and dangerous near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted\" during his confirmation hearing Wednesday that largely focused on U.S. relations with the nation.",
      "\"The 21st Century will be defined by what happens between the United States and China,\" Rubio told his Senate colleagues, reiterating his long-held belief that the U.S. must push back on China's influence more forcefully.",
      "\"They have elements that the Soviet Union never possessed,\" Rubio said. \"They are a technological adversary and competitor, an industrial competitor, an economic competitor, a geopolitical competitor, a scientific competitor now \u2014 in every realm. It is an extraordinary challenge.\"",
      "Rubio is likely to sail through the confirmation process to become the nation's top diplomat. He received a warm reception from members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is a member, who praised his extensive foreign policy experience.",
      "The confirmation hearing occurred as Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire and hostage release deal, U.S. officials said. Senate Foreign Relations chair Jim Risch, an Idaho Republican, announced at the hearing that he had been advised that a deal had been reached, with Rubio commenting that all those involved \"deserve credit for the deal.\"",
      "At times throughout the hearing, Rubio defended the decisions of his former rival, Trump, as he faced questions about the incoming president's potential conflicts of interest abroad and offered a strong defense of NATO despite Trump's past criticism of the defense alliance.",
      "\"Under President Trump, the top priority of the United States Department of State will be the United States,\" Rubio said.",
      "Like during and after the first World War, Rubio declared that the U.S. is once again \"called to create a free world out of the chaos.\"",
      "\"And this will not be easy,\" Rubio continued. \"And it will be impossible without a strong and a confident America that engages in the world, putting our core national interests, once again, above all else.\"",
      "Rubio, who has taken hardline positions on China, Iran, Venezuela and Cuba, will inherit the position facing a number of global challenges, including Russia's war in Ukraine, persistent violence in the Middle East, China's aggression against Taiwan and its tense relationship with the U.S. Trump has also suggested using military force or coercion to gain control of Greenland and the Panama Canal. He's floated annexing Canada as the 51st state and has threatened trade wars with U.S. allies.",
      "Rubio on China",
      "In the Senate, Rubio has been among the most outspoken on China, saying the nation is the \"threat that will define this century.\" Members of both parties have since adopted his positions on China.",
      "As well as warning about the national security risks, Rubio has also sought to hold China accountable for human rights abuses. In 2020, Beijing responded to Rubio's criticisms by banning him from the country. It's unclear what will become of that ban once he takes office and is tasked with carrying out Trump's foreign policy goals.",
      "Rubio told senators that much of China's growth has come at the expense of the U.S. and \"in less than 10 years, virtually everything that matters to us in life will depend on whether China will allow us to have it or not.\"",
      "\"Indeed, I've been strongly worded in my views of China. Let me just point out they've said mean things about me, too,\" Rubio said Wednesday. \"My role now as a secretary of state is to lead the diplomatic wing of the country and that will involve engaging them.\"",
      "Rubio said it was in the interest of both countries to be able to communicate to avoid an armed conflict.",
      "\"Never in the history of mankind have two powers like the United States and China ever faced off in a global conflict, and the outcome would be catastrophic, and we should want to avoid it, and so should they,\" he said.",
      "Rubio on Ukraine and NATO",
      "The Florida Republican called for an end to the war in Ukraine, which has carried on for nearly three years since Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022.",
      "\"This war has to end,\" he said, adding that there should be a \"ceasefire.\"",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the committee, asked Rubio about his seeming shift in what was once full-throated support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia. Rubio voted against a foreign aid package last April that included assistance for Ukraine, despite his earlier support for the country. During the 2024 campaign, Trump criticized the Biden administration for sending billions to Ukraine in aid.",
      "\"I voted against that bill because I said I would not vote for a bill unless it addressed the crisis at our southern border as part of the overall arrangement,\" Rubio said. \"That was not done, and so I voted against it. That said, here's my view of the situation: Once this war became what we now know it is, and that is, a war of attrition, a stalemate, a protracted conflict, the dynamic on that situation has changed. It has.\"",
      "Rubio says Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism",
      "Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, whose father fled Cuba, asked Rubio whether he believes Cuba is a state sponsor of terrorism.",
      "\"Without a question,\" Rubio responded.",
      "A day before Rubio's confirmation hearing, the Biden administration announced it is moving to remove Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism and ease economic restrictions as part of a deal for the release of political prisoners.",
      "Rubio, a supporter of strong sanctions on Havana's Communist regime, said it has been friendly towards Hamas and Hezbollah, hosts espionage stations for two countries hostile to the U.S., has strong ties to Iran and harbors fugitives from the American justice system.",
      "\"So there is zero doubt in my mind that they meet all the qualifications for being a state sponsor of terrorism,\" he said.",
      "Asked whether he would reverse the Biden administration's determination, Rubio said that was ultimately Trump's call but said \"nothing that was agreed to is irreversible or binding on the new administration.\"",
      "Panama Canal and Greenland",
      "The Panama Canal and Greenland, which have both received recent attention from Trump, were also topics of interest during the hearing.",
      "\"President Trump is not inventing this,\" Rubio said of questions about whether the canal remains neutral. \"This is something that's existed now for at least a decade.\"",
      "During a trip to Panama in 2017, Rubio said Chinese companies' control of port facilities on either end of the canal was \"the central issue\" discussed.",
      "\"This is a legitimate issue that needs to be confronted,\" he said.",
      "On Greenland, Rubio said the Denmark-owned territory has been \"strategically important\" to the U.S. for decades.",
      "Trump's potential foreign conflicts of interest",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut grilled Rubio on the potential foreign conflicts of interest that may arise between the United States' national interests and the Trump Organization's foreign business dealings.",
      "Murphy said Trump and his family have become \"more deeply dependent on revenue from governments in the Middle East,\" pointing to specific business deals.",
      "\"The Trump Organization is going to be signing new business deals in the Middle East with private companies that have connections to foreign governments at the very moment that you are going to be conducting sensitive diplomacy in these countries. That's just extraordinary,\" Murphy said. \"Never before in the history of this country has a president been, I mean literally, receiving cash from foreign governments and from foreign companies that are backed by foreign governments in the middle of their term. If you or I had done this as senators, we would be in violent violation of Senate ethics rules. That's not permitted on the Foreign Relations Committee.\"",
      "Murphy asked Rubio if he views profiting from Middle East deals as a potential conflict of interest, and whether he will bring that up with Trump. Rubio said he isn't a participant of or very familiar with Trump's overseas business deals, saying Trump's family members who are private citizens are running those companies.",
      "\"All I can tell you is that what I've said from the very beginning from the opening statement, and that is our foreign policy is going to be driven, as the president's made abundantly clear, by whether some action is in the good of the United States and our national security,\" Rubio said.",
      "Pressed further, Rubio specifically said Trump's family members have a right to conduct business deals abroad, and he doesn't believe Trump will allow personal business deals to adversely affect U.S. interests.",
      "\"The president doesn't manage that company,\" Rubio responded. \"His family members do, and they have a right to be in the business. I mean, that's the business that they're in. They're in the real estate business, they've been for a very long time, both domestically and abroad. They have properties in multiple countries. So, at the end of the day, his family is entitled to continue to operate their business.\"",
      "\"The fundamental question is not whether his family is involved in business. The fundamental question is whether that is in any way impacting the conduct of our foreign policy in a way that's counter to our national interest. And the president's made it abundantly clear that every decision he makes and every decision we are to make at the State Department should be driven by whether or not it serves the core national interests of the United States,\" he said.",
      "Who is Marco Rubio?",
      "Rubio, 53, was born in Miami to Cuban immigrants who arrived in the U.S. in May 1956. His father was a banquet bartender and his mother worked as a hotel maid. According to his Senate website, Rubio \"was drawn to public service in large part because of his grandfather, who saw his homeland destroyed by communism.\"",
      "Rubio's long political career began when he served as city commissioner in West Miami after he earned degrees from the University of Florida and the University of Miami Law School. He was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2000, where he served until 2008, including two years as speaker.",
      "The Florida Republican was first elected to the Senate in 2010 and won his third six-year term in 2022. He has served on both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and as vice chair on the Senate Intelligence Committee.",
      "Rubio was among a crowded field of GOP candidates running for president in 2016. He ended his campaign after losing the primary to Trump in his home state of Florida. The two verbally sparred during the campaign, with Rubio calling Trump \"a con artist\" who was hijacking the Republican Party and \"the most vulgar person\" to ever run for president. Trump sought to diminish his rival by nicknaming him \"Little Marco.\"",
      "Still, Rubio endorsed Trump for president after dropping out of the race and the two formed a pragmatic relationship in the years since. Trump eyed Rubio as a possible running mate in the 2024 race, but settled on Sen. JD Vance of Ohio instead.",
      "Does Marco Rubio have the votes to be confirmed?",
      "Rubio is all but certain to be confirmed, even with some Democratic support. A number of Senate Democrats have praised Trump's choice and have pledged to support his nomination on the floor, giving him many more than the 50 votes he needs for confirmation, barring something unforeseen.",
      "At Wednesday's hearing, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia was among the Democrats to compliment Rubio, saying he was \"extremely well-prepared.\"",
      "\"He's not talking out of a briefing book. He's not having to thumb through a binder to decide how to answer a particular question,\" Kaine said.",
      "Others spoke about their personal relationships with Rubio. Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois recalled how Rubio helped push for Senate rules to be amended so that she could bring her newborn daughter with her on the floor to votes.",
      "\"What's the big deal? This place is already full of babies,\" Rubio remembered saying.",
      "Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who met with Rubio on Monday, called the Florida Republican \"a good choice\" and said he \"has a thorough understanding of the United States' role on an international scale.\"",
      "\"I plan to vote yes on his nomination when it comes before the Senate,\" Durbin, a top Senate Democrat, said in a statement.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:45:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Texas and 18 other states have recently enacted laws requiring pornography websites to verify the ages of their visitors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday grappled with states' efforts to require pornography websites to verify their visitors' ages amid a surge of laws that proponents say are aimed at protecting children from accessing sexual content on the internet.",
      "The requirement at the center of the case was enacted by Texas in 2023 as part of a wave of similar measures that have been passed in 18 other states. Under Texas' law, a website must use \"reasonable age verification methods\" to confirm visitors are at least 18 years old.",
      "Entities must comply with the law if more than one-third of its web content is \"sexual material harmful to minors,\" which is considered to be content that is prurient, offensive and without value to minors. Covered companies have to verify users' ages through digital identification or a government-issued ID.",
      "Violators of the age-verification requirement face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day, or fines of up to $250,000 if a violation leads to a minor accessing sexual material. Internet service providers, search engines and social media companies are effectively exempt from the law.",
      "During more than two hours of arguments, the justices seemed to agree that the government has an interest in restricting minors' access to harmful sexual material. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who has young children, acknowledged that advancements in technology have made it easier for kids to access pornography through gaming systems, tablets and smart phones. Chief Justice John Roberts, too, said technological access to pornography has \"exploded,\" and there has been a \"dramatic change\" in how it can be accessed.",
      "But the justices also expressed concern that age-verification laws like those enacted in 19 states burden adults' access to content they are legally allowed to consume and could lead to more regulations based on content.",
      "Derek Shaffer, who argued on behalf of a trade group representing the adult entertainment industry, said Texas' law is the worst among those that have been passed in recent years and called the state a \"hostile regulator.\"",
      "The case arrived at the Supreme Court after a federal district court granted a preliminary injunction blocking Texas' age-verification requirement. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit then froze that decision, allowing the law to take effect. The Supreme Court in April declined to temporarily block enforcement of the law, but\u00a0agreed to take up\u00a0the legal battle months later.",
      "Challengers to the age-verification measure \u2014 a group of companies that operate pornography website and the Free Speech Coalition, the trade group \u2014 are asking the Supreme Court to toss out the 5th Circuit's ruling and restore the district court's injunction. They argued the measure violates the First Amendment because it burdens adults' access to protected speech.",
      "The posture of the case was an issue raised by several members of the court, and particularly what would happen if they wiped clean the 5th Circuit's decision. The question before the high court is whether the 5th Circuit applied the correct standard of judicial review when it evaluated Texas' age-verification law.",
      "The appeals court applied the least-stringent level of review, known as rational-basis review. Using that standard, the 5th Circuit said the law survives because of evidence showing \"the sort of damage that access to pornography does to children.\" But the law's challengers and the Biden administration argue that the appeals court should've applied the most demanding level, strict scrutiny, because it impedes adults' access to constitutionally protected speech.",
      "Rational-basis review requires laws to serve a legitimate governmental purpose and be reasonably related to that purpose. Under scrutiny scrutiny, however, the government bears the burden of showing that a law is narrowly tailored to serve a \"compelling government interest.\"",
      "\"This case matters because it's about how the government can treat speech it doesn't like, and pornography is often the canary in the coal mine for free speech. And it also matters because it's about the future of free speech online,\" Vera Eidelman, a lawyer with the ACLU, said in a press call.",
      "Opponents of the Texas law argue that if it is allowed to stand, it could have a chilling effect on adult visitors to regulated websites. Additionally, it could open users' to privacy and security risks like data breaches, which don't arise when having an ID checked in-person, they argued in court filings.",
      "Already, Pornhub, one of the largest adult content websites, blocked access in Texas last year and did the same in Florida at the start of this year after its own age-verification law took effect.",
      "\"When an adult site tries to do age verification, most people coming to that site refuse to do a face scan, biometrics, ID upload, whatever it is. There's a huge chilling effect. People don't want to do it,\" said Mike Stabile, director of public policy for the Free Speech Coalition.",
      "The trade group argued in court papers that Texas could have employed a less-restrictive way of protecting children from sexual material: content-filtering software, which the Supreme Court backed in a 2004 decision blocking the federal Child Online Protection Act. Additionally, they said the law regulates more speech than is necessary, since it applies to an entire website if more than one-third of its content is considered sexual material harmful to minors, and sweeps in material like romance novels and R-rated movies.",
      "For example, they said, \"a website that contains 65% core political speech and 35% sexually suggestive content would be 100% subject to H.B. 1181's restrictions. That is paradigmatic overinclusivity.\"",
      "But the law is also underinclusive since search engines and social media sites do not have to comply with age-verification requirements, even though minors can access the content there that Texas is trying to shield them from, the Free Speech Coalition argued.",
      "But conservative members of the court said the landscape has changed considerably since the court's 2004 decision and content-filtering has become less effective at keeping minors from accessing sexual material.",
      "\"We're in an entirely different world,\" Justice Clarence Thomas said.",
      "The Biden administration argued the law is subject to the most demanding form of judicial scrutiny and urged the Supreme Court to toss out the 5th Circuit's decision and send the case back to the appeals court to apply strict scrutiny.",
      "But in doing so, the Supreme Court should clarify that Congress and states can adopt appropriately tailored measures to keep children from accessing harmful sexual content online, Brian Fletcher, principal deputy solicitor general, told the justices.",
      "Meanwhile, Texas Solicitor General Aaron Nielson, who argued for the state, said its age-verification requirement is \"simple\" and \"safe.\"",
      "He wrote in a filing that state officials were responding to a public health crisis sparked by kids' easy access to \"hardcore pornography\" through smartphones and other devices when they enacted the restriction.",
      "The age-veritification requirements, he said, \"protects children from that which is obscene by [adults'] standards, by requiring the purveyors to check whether their viewers are children \u2014 leaving adults able to access pornography by engaging in a process that they must complete potentially only once and that applies equally to viewing pornography, buying wine, or renting a car.\"",
      "Backing Texas in the dispute is a group of 24 states, officials from which are urging the Supreme Court to uphold the lower court's decision.",
      "The states wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief that age-verification laws are a routine exercise of their authority to protect children from being exposed to sexual violence and explicit images. They noted that most online pornography is not constitutionally protected, as it is considered obscene to minors and adults under a Supreme Court standard set in 1973.",
      "\"Texas's age-verification law effectuates the state's deeply important interest in protecting minors from the psychological, physical, and social harms wrought by the hardcore internet pornography petitioners purvey \u2014 an interest all agree is compelling, and that this court should hesitate to override,\" the states, led by the attorneys general of Ohio and Indiana, wrote.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June 2025.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:16:01 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump's pick to be CIA director promised in his confirmation hearing to hone in on setting strong intelligence collection priorities and \"demanding relentless execution.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 John Ratcliffe, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be CIA director, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that if he's confirmed, the CIA would be rededicated to its intelligence-gathering mission.",
      "\"We will collect intelligence \u2014 especially human intelligence \u2014 in every corner of the globe, no matter how dark or difficult,\" Ratcliffe said during his confirmation hearing Wednesday. \"We will produce insightful, objective, all-source analysis, never allowing political or personal biases to cloud our judgment or infect our products.\"",
      "\"To the brave CIA officers listening around the world, if all of this sounds like what you signed up for, then buckle up and get ready to make a difference,\" Ratcliffe said. \"If it doesn't, then it's time to find a new line of work.\"",
      "He told the committee the U.S. faces \"what may be the most challenging national security environment in our nation's history,\" and these challenges \"increase the necessity of confirming a CIA director who is prepared on Day One to take them head-on.\"",
      "The two-hour hearing was one of about a\u00a0dozen hearings\u00a0scheduled for Trump's top administration picks this week ahead of his return to the White House next week. Though some of the president-elect's designated nominees have been subject to aggressive questioning and tense exchanges, the open portion of Ratcliffe's hearing remained notably civil. None of the Democrats on the committee expressed opposition to his formal nomination and Senate confirmation, though it's not yet clear how many Senate Democrats will vote to confirm him.",
      "Ratcliffe, a former Texas congressman, served as director of national intelligence in the final months of President-elect Donald Trump's first term. At that time, Trump initially picked Ratcliffe to lead the nation's spy agencies earlier in his first term, but withdrew his name amid questions about his qualifications for the role. Months later, Trump again nominated Ratcliffe, and the Senate confirmed him as director of national intelligence without any support from Democrats.",
      "Ratcliffe said in his opening remarks Wednesday that \"for roughly a quarter of a century, I have devoted my professional life to U.S. national security.\" And he promised that if confirmed, he would focus on \"setting and communicating priorities and demanding relentless execution.\"",
      "Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton kicked off the hearing by listing the ways in which the CIA must \"get back to its roots,\" adding that it \"must overcome several challenges to do so.\" He argued the CIA has become too bureaucratic, and its analysis and priorities have become politicized, among other obstacles.",
      "\"Mr. Ratcliffe, you have a big job ahead of you,\" Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, said. \"The nation needs a strong capable and aggressive CIA.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, agreed with Ratcliffe that the CIA faces an \"unprecedented number of challenges,\" and he mentioned the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, competition with China and the persistent threat of terrorism, which he said requires a \"great deal of leadership.\"",
      "Warner also outlined the importance of ensuring the intelligence community feels \"respected and valued,\" amid what he called \"underserved attacks\" by President-elect Donald Trump. He told Ratcliffe he has an opportunity at his confirmation hearing to \"reassure the men and women of the CIA that they not fear reprisal for being willing to speak truth to power.\"",
      "In Congress, Ratcliffe served on the House Intelligence Committee and House Judiciary Committee and was a staunch defender of Trump through his first impeachment and investigations into Russian election interference.",
      "In his\u00a0confirmation hearing\u00a0in 2020 to be DNI, Ratcliffe vowed to deliver \"objective and timely\" intelligence to senior policymakers and to ensure that it was \"collected, analyzed and reported without bias, prejudice or political influence.\" He also disagreed with Trump about whether Russia meddled in the 2016 election, but declined to take a stance on what Russia's desired outcome was.",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, Ratcliffe faced a slew of questions about politicization of the CIA, pledging not to bow to political pressure from the administration or elsewhere or take action for political purposes.",
      "Ratcliffe also responded to questions about how he would resist efforts to force out career civil servants due to their perceived political views or loyalty to Trump, noting that during his time as director of national intelligence \"that never took place\" and is something he \"would never do.\"",
      "He vowed to work on the development of tools \"to go on offense\" against cyber adversaries, warning of the threat to the nation's digital borders \"from half a world away.\"",
      "The committee is proceeding with its questioning in a closed-door session. Cotton said the committee plans to vote on advancing Ratcliffe's nomination as soon as possible, as soon as Monday afternoon, after the inauguration.",
      "Ratcliffe's nomination",
      "Ratcliffe is considered to be a more traditional choice than some of Trump's picks for other roles, since he has served in a Senate-confirmed position once already and was also a member of Congress.",

    "title": "Pentagon watchdog: Austin's hospitalization \"unnecessarily\" increased risks",
    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 12:02:58 -0500",
    "summary": "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was hospitalized for two weeks at the start of 2024 for complications arising from surgery to treat prostate cancer.",
    "story": [
      "The Pentagon inspector general found in its review of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin's hospitalization last year that it \"increased unnecessarily\" the risks to national security, even if ultimately, there were no immediate consequences.",
      "\"Although we found no adverse consequences to Defense Department operations arising from how the hospitalizations we reviewed were handled, the risks to our national defense, including the command and control of the Defense Department's critical national security operations, were increased unnecessarily,\" Inspector General Robert Storch said in a statement.",
      "Austin was hospitalized for two weeks at the start of 2024 for complications related to surgery to treat prostate cancer. The Pentagon faced sharp criticism for waiting several days to inform the White House that Austin was in the hospital \u2014 and at one point, in the intensive care unit.",
      "The review did not identify any adverse impacts on operational command and control or Defense Department functions but says, \"we believe that there was a potential for adverse effects.\"",
      "A senior defense official told reporters shortly after the report was released, that the review \"found that at no time, was there a break in command and control\" and \"at every moment, either the secretary of defense or the deputy secretary of defense was fully prepared to support the president as commander-in-chief.\"",
      "The report states that during the course of his hospitalization, Austin transferred authority of some of his duties to his deputy secretary of defense from Jan. 2 to 5, but neither of them notified Congress or the White House Situation Room in a \"timely manner\" as required.",
      "The report found that Austin did not consider transferring authorities while he was undergoing medical procedures on Jan. 6 and 8 that required moderate sedation. The inspector general found no evidence that Austin told the deputy secretary or his chief of staff he was undergoing the procedures. According to the review, Austin had texted his chief of staff that he did not want his medical condition to become \"a media circus.\"",
      "Austin told the inspector general investigators he told his doctors he would have to notify his superiors if he underwent general anesthesia. He signed forms acknowledging moderate sedation but said he needed to remain functional as \"that was the mandate \u2026 and I'm confident that that happened.\" He said that his doctors met his \"requirement to remain \u2026 functional.\"",
      "Nevertheless, the inspector general in its 20 recommendations said the Defense Department should further define what is \"medically incapacitated,\" and the phrase, \"unable to perform the functions and duties.\" Other recommendations include expanding the scope of who is required to report the hospitalization of secretaries of defense or senior Pentagon officials.",
      "The inspector general announced last year it would initiate a review to: \"examine the roles, processes, procedures, responsibilities, and actions related to the Secretary of Defense's hospitalization in December 2023 \u2013 January 2024, and assess whether the DoD's policies and procedures are sufficient to ensure timely and appropriate notifications and the effective transition of authorities as may be warranted due to health-based or other unavailability of senior leadership.\"",
      "The review found that Austin's intense privacy affected the course of events. It says that not only did Austin not tell his senior staff members of his medical condition or appointments, \"he specifically told one junior staff member 'if anyone had any questions they're more than welcome to ask [me] directly.'\"",
      "After he returned to work at the Pentagon following his hospitalization, Austin apologized for not telling President Biden or the public about when and why he had been hospitalized.",
      "\"We did not handle this right, and I did not handle this right,\" Austin said. \"I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public. And I take full responsibility. I apologize to my teammates and to the American people.\"",
      "The senior defense official said Austin \"apologized and he committed to improving transparency and processes moving forward, which the department has already done over the past year to ensure it doesn't happen again.\"",
      "CBS News obtained the audio of the 911 call that led to the hospitalization in which an aide asked the operator if the ambulance headed to Austin's residence could be discreet.",
      "\"Can I ask that, can the ambulance not show up with lights and sirens? We're trying to remain a little subtle,\" the caller is heard saying.",
      "A separate review by the Pentagon released last year concluded that there was no deliberate ill intent by Austin or his aides to keep the hospitalization secret but did acknowledge the policies for transferring the responsibilities of the secretary need to be improved.",
      "Austin told David Martin during a \"CBS Sunday Morning\" interview that he is now cancer-free.",
      "\"I thank God for that,\" Austin said.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:59:05 -0500",
    "summary": "In remarks to Congress, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Justice Department said that \"partisan weaponization of the Department of Justice will end\" under her watch.",
    "story": [
      "Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Justice, told the Senate Judiciary Committee\u00a0Wednesday that \"partisan weaponization of the Department of Justice will end,\" if she is confirmed as attorney general.",
      "\"America must have one tier of justice for all,\" the former Florida attorney general said.\u00a0 Her opening statement was earlier obtained exclusively by CBS News.",
      "The declaration comes as Democrats are expected to pepper the close ally of the president-elect with questions over whether she might weaponize the Justice Department to target Trump's political enemies, including President Biden and former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "The longtime prosecutor, who represented the president-elect during his first impeachment trial, says her \"overriding objective\" is to \"return the Department of Justice to its core mission,\" and vows to get the department \"back to basics \u2013 prosecuting violent crime and gang activity, stopping child predators and drug traffickers, protecting our nation from terrorists and other foreign threats, and addressing the overwhelming crisis at the Border.\"",
      "While seeking the job of the nation's highest ranking law enforcement officer, Bondi also plans to take aim at the Bureau of Prisons, promising to reduce recidivism and reform the federal agency long afflicted by understaffing, abuse, disrepair.",
      "\"We must fix the Bureau of Prisons and follow through on the promise of the First Step Act by building new halfway houses,\" Bondi said, referencing the president elect's hallmark criminal justice reform law. Signed by then-president Trump in 2018, it aims to reduce prison sentences and federal spending, but has been plagued by persistent implementation failures.",
      "\"The Bureau has suffered from years of mismanagement, lack of funding, and low morale. Federal corrections officers serve in challenging conditions on minimal pay and need more support. Our prison system can and will do better,\" Bondi told lawmakers Wednesday.",
      "Echoing the president-elect's promise of a \"new golden age,\" Bondi told lawmakers that Trump is \"unafraid to do things that have been deemed 'too difficult' and to reach across the aisle\" to address criminal justice reform.",
      "Trump selected Bondi to be his nominee for U.S. attorney general after his first pick, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration. Bondi formerly made history in 2010 when she became the first woman to serve as Florida's attorney general, and became an early advocate for Trump during his first bid for the White House in 2016.",
      "Harking on her early days as \"an intern at the Hillsborough County State Attorney's Office,\" Bondi spotlighted her 18 years of experience as a prosecutor and two terms as Florida attorney general, which she claims was defined by a fight to eliminate drug dealers in a state \"overwhelmed by pill mills and opioid deaths.\" While serving as Florida's top cop, Bondi established a prescription drug monitoring program which requires opioid-prescribing clinics to register with the state and have a physician-owner.",
      "\"On the civil side, we worked to protect consumers,\" Bondi said, touting her efforts to tackle \"overreach by big tech companies.\"",
      "If confirmed as attorney general, Bondi would inherit a slew of legal fights against the world's largest technology companies, including ongoing litigation with TikTok and the department's ongoing defense of a law that would force its parent company to sell the platform altogether.",
      "In the weeks leading up to her confirmation hearing, Bondi walked the halls of Capitol Hill, attending back-to-back meetings with senators. Unlike Trump's Gaetz, she is not expected to face significant hurdles to confirmation by the Republican-led Senate.",
      "Considered one of the less controversial choices for Trump's\u00a0new cabinet, Democrats are still likely to probe Bondi on her interpretation of the role of attorney general and commitment to the independence of the Justice Department.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, who met with Bondi last week, accused Trump of using the Justice Department as his personal law firm, expressing concern that she might prioritize loyalty to Trump over the Constitution.",
      "\"The Department of Justice must also return to defending the foundational rights of all Americans, including free speech, free exercise of religion, and the right to bear arms,\" Bondi said, name-checking a campaign tagline of the president-elect. \"That is what the American people expect and deserve from the Department.\u00a0 If confirmed, I will do what it takes to make America safe again.\"",

    "summary": "The federal government already collects tariffs, and deposits them in the General Fund of the United States.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump says he'll establish a new federal agency to collect tariffs, duties and all other foreign revenue, seemingly carving out responsibilities that are currently handled by the Commerce Department, the U.S. Trade Representative and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "The president-elect said he will establish the agency on Inauguration Day, with the goal of making other countries pay \"their fair share.\" Tariffs are taxes levied on imported foreign goods. Experts say higher tariffs are typically passed on to the consumer, and if enacted, Trump's tariff hikes will likely mean higher costs for Americans.",
      "\"Through soft and pathetically weak Trade agreements, the American Economy has delivered growth and prosperity to the World, while taxing ourselves,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"It is time for that to change. I am today announcing that I will create the EXTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE to collect our Tariffs, Duties, and all Revenue that come from Foreign sources. We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying, FINALLY, their fair share. January 20, 2025, will be the birth date of the External Revenue Service. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "Who would pay for Trump's promised tariffs? You will!",
      "Who would pay for Trump's promised tariffs? You will!",
      "It's not clear how establishing a new federal agency to oversee tariffs will expedite the president-elect's tariff goals, given that federal agencies are already collecting that revenue. While USTR and the Commerce Department establish tariffs, U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the primary collector and enforcer of tariffs. CBP then deposits collections into the General Fund of the United States.",
      "Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all goods coming from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% across-the-board tariffs on all foreign imports, and tariffs of 60% or higher on Chinese goods. Despite Trump's vows, some Wall Street economists believe it's unlikely that the new administration would enact a broad-based tariff on all imports due to the potential to reignite inflation while spurring retaliatory tariffs from other nations.",
      "Federal law allows presidents to adjust tariffs based on stated threats to national security, or to remove the practice of a foreign government that the U.S. believes is violating an international trade agreement or is unfair or discriminatory. Trump heavily relied on his tariff authority in his first term, and President Biden's team didn't undo all of his tariffs. The Biden administration even imposed additional tariff hikes, including a 100% duty on electric vehicles from China.",
      "The conservative Tax Foundation found that, despite Trump's fondness for tariffs, the Biden administration has collected more revenue through tariffs on foreign goods than did Trump's \u2014 $89.1 billion under Trump compared with $144 billion under Mr. Biden, as of March 2024. The bulk of revenue under both presidents was collected through tariffs on China.",

    "summary": "Scientists analyzing 2,000-year-old DNA have revealed that a Celtic society in the southern U.K. during the Iron Age was centered around women, a study said.",
    "story": [
      "Female family ties were at the heart of social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion, a new analysis suggests.",
      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\"That was really jaw-dropping \u2014 it's never been observed before in European prehistory,\" said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2014 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",
      "Meanwhile \"it's your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife's family for land and livelihood,\" said Cassidy.",
      "This pattern \u2014 called matrilocality \u2014 is historically rare.",
      "\"Such a matrilocal pattern is undescribed in European prehistory, but when we compare mitochondrial haplotype variation among European archaeological sites spanning six millennia, British Iron Age cemeteries stand out as having marked reductions in diversity driven by the presence of dominant matrilines,\" the authors write in an article accompanying the study.",

      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2014 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2014 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",

    "summary": "If the weather cooperates, the Starship launch will follow the maiden flight of Jeff Bezos' already weather-delayed New Glenn rocket.",
    "story": [
      "After launching more than 100 small payloads from California on Tuesday and two commercial moon landers from Florida early Wednesday, both atop Falcon 9 rockets, SpaceX readied a huge Super Heavy-Starship for a ground-shaking launch from the Texas Gulf Coast to kick off the program's seventh test flight.",
      "But bad weather prompted the California rocket builder to delay the high-profile flight to Thursday, when it will follow a NASA spacewalk outside the International Space Station and the launch of Jeff Bezos' New Glenn rocket on its maiden flight.",
      "The New Glenn is scheduled for its own weather-delayed liftoff from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 1 a.m. EST, the opening of a three-hour launch window.",
      "Six hours later, space station astronauts Nick Hague and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams plan to venture outside the NASA lab complex for a six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk starting around 8 a.m. to carry out a variety of maintenance and upgrade tasks.",
      "That will set the stage for the Super Heavy-Starship launch from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight test facility at 5 p.m. EST, weather permitting.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built, generating a staggering 16 million pounds of thrust at liftoff using 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines. The New Glenn rocket, built by Bezos' space company Blue Origin, is not nearly as powerful, but it will compete head-to-head with SpaceX's industry-dominating Falcon 9-family rockets.",
      "Like the Falcon 9's first stage, the New Glenn booster is reusable, and Blue Origin will attempt to recover its first stage with touchdown on an offshore landing ship. The rocket's upper stage will continue into orbit where flight controllers will carry out a series of tests. Additional flights are planned later this year.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship has a more ambitious agenda befitting its gargantuan size.",
      "As with the two most recent test flights, the first stage will boost the Starship upper stage out of the dense lower atmosphere before falling away and heading back to the launch site for recovery. The Starship, meanwhile, will continue to space on the power of six Raptor engines of its own.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For the third flight in a row, SpaceX planned an attempt to \"catch\" the Super Heavy first stage after it propelled the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, snagging it on the way down using giant mechanical arms known as chopsticks mounted on the launch tower.",
      "The first such catch  last October was successful, a spectacular sight to thousands of  cheering residents and tourists. But the Super Heavy used for the next such flight a month later  was diverted to a Gulf of Mexico splashdown because of launch damage to  sensors on the tower that were needed to help guide the descending  booster into position.",
      "New sensors now have more robust shielding to eliminate such damage and SpaceX engineers are optimistic they'll soon be recovering Super Heavy boosters with the same regularity they've demonstrated with the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets.",
      "But the bulk of the upgrades being tested Thursday are built into what SpaceX calls a \"new generation\" Starship. Multiple systems have been modified to improve performance and to test systems needed for eventual stage recovery.",
      "\"This new year will be transformational for Starship,\" SpaceX said on its website, \"with the goal of bringing reuse of the entire system online and flying increasingly ambitious missions as we iterate towards being able to send humans and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\"",

    "story": [
      "Aircraft battling fires raging through the Los Angeles area are dousing the area with more than water: Hundreds of thousands of gallons of hot-pink fire suppressant have been dropped ahead of the flames in a desperate effort to stop them before they destroy more neighborhoods.",
      "The deadly fires have displaced thousands of residents and destroyed more than 12,000 structures since they began last Tuesday, Jan. 7. Four major fires driven by strong Santa Ana winds have charred about 62 square miles, according to Cal Fire.",
      "Fire agencies say the suppressants \u2014 most often used to fight forest fires \u2014 are an invaluable tool. But what is in them and are they safe?",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "When are fire suppressants used?",
      "The fires are burning quickly through canyons and other rugged areas that are difficult for firefighters on the ground to reach, Cal Fire said.",
      "While fire suppressants can be very effective, they do have limitations, the agency said. Strong winds can make it too dangerous to fly at the low altitudes needed for drops and can dissipate the retardant before it hits the ground.",
      "Besides Cal Fire, multiple agencies have dropped fire retardant and water, including the U.S. Forest Service, the Los Angeles and Ventura county fire departments, the city and the National Guard.",
      "What is in aerial fire suppressants?",
      "Aerial fire suppressants are generally a mixture of water, ammonium phosphate \u2014 essentially fertilizer \u2014 and iron oxide, which is added to make the retardant visible, said Daniel McCurry, a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of Southern California.",
      "The Forest Service, which has used 13 aircraft to dump suppressants on the Los Angeles fires, says they help starve a fire of oxygen and slow the rate of burn by cooling and coating vegetation and other surfaces.",
      "Perimeter, the company that supplies fire retardant to the Forest Service and other agencies, says the phosphate changes the way cellulose in plants decomposes and makes them non-flammable.",
      "The fire suppressants are generally considered safe for people, but many worry about their potential effects on wildlife.",
      "The Forest Service bans use of aerial suppressants over waterways and endangered species habitats, \"except when human life or public safety are threatened,\" due to potential health effects on fish and other wildlife.",
      "McCurry, from USC, said he and other researchers tested several suppressants and found heavy metals, including chromium and cadmium, in one commonly used by the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "McCurry said the study's findings suggest that it's \"plausible\" that fire suppressants could contribute to spikes of chromium and other heavy metals in waterways downstream of wildfires.",
      "\"We don't quite have a smoking gun yet because it's difficult, although not impossible, to prove where a heavy metal came from,\" McCurry said. \"We're working on that.\"",
      "Perimeter, the manufacturer of the Forest Service's fire retardant, said McCurry's research was on a formulation that wasn't used in California and is no longer used by the Forest Service. The company also says it doesn't add metals, which it says are naturally present in all ammonium phosphate fertilizers, and that its aerial suppressants \"are exhaustively tested by the USDA Forest Service and meet or exceed all health and safety standards.\"",
      "Using flame retardants to protect the power grid",
      "Several Los Angeles area power companies are also using flame retardants to try to help protect power poles and lines, CBS Los Angeles reported.",
      "Crews have been working for days, stopping at as many power poles as possible along the edges of the wildfires \u2014the Palisades Fire along the Los Angeles coast and the Eaton Fire in the mountains above Pasadena and Altadena.",
      "First, they clear dry shrubbery from the area surrounding the poles, then they use their trucks to douse each power pole with fire retardant \u2014 the same substance that's dropped by firefighting aircraft from above. They try to spray it as far up the pole as possible and into all the cracks, so embers can't get a foothold.",
      "\"That way, if or when the fire does make it this way, we don't have to worry about embers catching it,\" said Connor Norton, one of the PG&E employees working in North Hollywood on Sunday.",
      "\"The best way to save lives\"",
      "The use of fire retardants is imperative to putting out wildfires that expose millions of people to health risks, including from a toxic mix of microscopic particles that can cause breathing and heart problems by penetrating deep into the lungs and bloodstream.",
      "Studies have shown that wildfire smoke accounted for up to half of all health-damaging particle air pollution in the western U.S. in recent years as warming temperatures fueled more destructive blazes.",
      "And research released last year by the Alzheimer's Association found that wildfire smoke may be worse for brain health than other types of air pollution, raising the risk of dementia.",
      "\"The use of wildland fire retardant is the best way to save lives, protect communities and keep fires small,\" said Edward Goldberg, vice chairman of solutions at Perimeter.",
      "McCurry, the USC researcher, said more study is needed on fire suppressants \u2014 including in Los Angeles once the fires are out \u2014 but he understands their value: \"If there was a brush fire coming for my house, I'd still rather than paint a lot of (fire retardant) in front of it.\"",

      "As for the booster, Limp said \"we knew landing our booster ... on the first try was an ambitious goal. We'll learn a lot from today and try again at our next launch this spring. Thank you to all of Team Blue for this incredible milestone.\"",
      "The mission got underway at 2:03 a.m. EST when the New Glenn's seven methane-burning BE-4 engines at the base of the first stage roared to life with a rush of brilliant flame and a ground-shaking roar.",
      "Smoothly accelerating as it consumed propellants and lost weight, the  New Glenn streaked away from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force  Station atop a brilliant blue-white plume, putting on a spectacular show for  cheering Blue Origin employees, area residents and tourists.",
      "The launch came a week later than originally planned because of rough weather in the booster landing zone and, once, because of a minor technical problem. But it appeared to be clear sailing Thursday as the rocket climbed away and disappeared from view.",
      "Three minutes and 10 seconds after liftoff, the rocket's first stage engines shut down, triggering stage separation and ignition of the two hydrogen-burning BE-3U engines powering the rocket's second stage.",
      "As the upper stage continued the climb to orbit, the first stage briefly coasted upward before arcing over and falling back to Earth, homing in on the Jacklyn, which was standing by several hundred miles downrange in the Atlantic Ocean. NASA's WB-57 photo-reconnaissance jet was flying nearby, documenting the flight with high-resolution cameras.",
      "Three engines re-ignited as planned to slow the booster for re-entry but during the burn, video showing one of the engines froze and on-screen telemetry stopped while showing an altitude of 84,226 feet and a velocity of 4,285 mph. Whether the rocket exploded or suffered some other malfunction and crashed into the sea was not immediately known.",
      "But company officials said before launch that they would learn from any anomalies and press ahead with another flight in the next few months.",
      "\"We have another one (in production), and it'll be coming off the line here shortly,\" Limp told CBS News earlier this week. \"So we'll fly (again) either way in the spring.\"",
      "While SpaceX tested its Falcon 9 landing system with ocean splashdowns before attempting an actual landing, Blue Origin opted to make the attempt on the rocket's maiden flight. That was based in part on the company's experience launching and landing its sub-orbital New Shepard rocket, used to carry space tourists, researchers and payloads on brief up-and-down flights out of the lower atmosphere.",
      "Even so, company officials acknowledged the challenge, naming the New Glenn first stage \"So You're Telling Me There's A Chance.\"",
      "\"There's no question that it's a bit audacious to try to land it the first time,\" Limp said before launch.",
      "But the first stage landing was just one of several major objectives. The primary goal of the flight was to put the upper stage into orbit, along with a Blue Origin-designed spacecraft known as the Blue Ring Pathfinder. A sort of space tug, the Blue Ring can host or deploy multiple satellites in different orbits while providing on-board computer support and even servicing.",
      "For its initial flight, the Blue Ring was to remain attached to the New Glenn's upper stage throughout the planned five-hour 50-minute mission.",
      "The flight plan called for two firings of the upper stage engines, with the second coming about an hour after liftoff, to put the vehicle and the attached Blue Ring Pathfinder in an elliptical orbit with a high point of about 12,000 miles and a low point of around 1,500 miles.",
      "Blue Ring is equipped with roll-out solar arrays stretching 144 feet. It features 13 ports for hosted and deployable payloads and can accommodate satellites or other instruments weighing up to 2.5 tons on its upper deck.",
      "There are no such payloads on the initial flight, but the spacecraft's systems will undergo a series of tests to learn more about how the craft performs in space.",
      "Regardless of the results of Thursday's mission, Blue Origin will face an uphill battle with SpaceX, which currently dominates the commercial launch market.",
      "Musk had kind words about the launch in a post on his X platform, saying, \"Congratulations on reaching orbit on the first attempt!\"",
      "SpaceX began launching its Falcon 9 rockets in 2010 and since then has fired off 436 Falcon 9-family missions with only two in-flight failures.",
      "Complicating the picture for Blue Origin, SpaceX is in the process of testing a gargantuan, fully reusable rocket known as the Super Heavy-Starship. It is the most powerful rocket ever built, and once operational is expected to play a major role in launching payloads to low-Earth orbit, the moon and beyond.",
      "SpaceX plans to launch a Super Heavy-Starship from the company's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and test center on Thursday at 5 p.m. EST.",
      "After boosting the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, the Super Heavy booster is designed to fly back to its launch pad, where giant mechanical arms would attempt to pluck it out of mid-air. The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, would loop around the planet, launching 10 mockup Starlink satellites before a simulated landing in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Some 225 Falcon 9 flights have launched 7,700 Starlink internet satellites since 2019, with thousands more planned. The company already has millions of customers around the world, giving it a formidable head start over potential competitors.",
      "How Blue Origin and other rocket builders will complete with SpaceX, it's Falcon-family rockets and the Super Heavy-Starship remains to be seen.",
      "But Blue Origin already has a backlog of satellites awaiting launch on its New Glenn and is awaiting certification to launch high-priority national security payloads, NASA probes and other civilian satellites.",
      "Amazon plans to launch more than 3,232 broadband relay stations known as Project Kuiper to provide space-based internet services in direct competition with SpaceX's Starlink.",
      "Blue Origin says it has booked 80 launches using New Glenn rockets and boosters provided by the European consortium Arianespace, United Launch Alliance and even SpaceX to get the data relay stations into orbit.",
      "\"I'm very bullish about space in general,\" Limp said. \"I think there's going to be lots of winners in this segment. It might be SpaceX; I think Blue will be there. But I also believe there's going to be new companies that we've never even heard of yet. There's some entrepreneur out there that hasn't started a space company that's going to be at the table.\"",

    "story": [
      "After launching more than 100 small payloads from California on Tuesday and two commercial moon landers from Florida early Wednesday, both atop Falcon 9 rockets, SpaceX readied a huge Super Heavy-Starship for a ground-shaking launch from the Texas Gulf Coast to kick off the program's seventh test flight.",
      "But bad weather prompted the California rocket builder to delay the high-profile flight to Thursday, when it will follow a NASA spacewalk outside the International Space Station and the launch of Jeff Bezos' New Glenn rocket on its maiden flight.",
      "The New Glenn is scheduled for its own weather-delayed liftoff from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 1 a.m. EST, the opening of a three-hour launch window.",
      "Six hours later, space station astronauts Nick Hague and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams plan to venture outside the NASA lab complex for a six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk starting around 8 a.m. to carry out a variety of maintenance and upgrade tasks.",
      "That will set the stage for the Super Heavy-Starship launch from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight test facility at 5 p.m. EST, weather permitting.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built, generating a staggering 16 million pounds of thrust at liftoff using 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines. The New Glenn rocket, built by Bezos' space company Blue Origin, is not nearly as powerful, but it will compete head-to-head with SpaceX's industry-dominating Falcon 9-family rockets.",
      "Like the Falcon 9's first stage, the New Glenn booster is reusable, and Blue Origin will attempt to recover its first stage with touchdown on an offshore landing ship. The rocket's upper stage will continue into orbit where flight controllers will carry out a series of tests. Additional flights are planned later this year.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship has a more ambitious agenda befitting its gargantuan size.",
      "As with the two most recent test flights, the first stage will boost the Starship upper stage out of the dense lower atmosphere before falling away and heading back to the launch site for recovery. The Starship, meanwhile, will continue to space on the power of six Raptor engines of its own.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For the third flight in a row, SpaceX planned an attempt to \"catch\" the Super Heavy first stage after it propelled the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, snagging it on the way down using giant mechanical arms known as chopsticks mounted on the launch tower.",
      "The first such catch  last October was successful, a spectacular sight to thousands of  cheering residents and tourists. But the Super Heavy used for the next such flight a month later  was diverted to a Gulf of Mexico splashdown because of launch damage to  sensors on the tower that were needed to help guide the descending  booster into position.",
      "New sensors now have more robust shielding to eliminate such damage and SpaceX engineers are optimistic they'll soon be recovering Super Heavy boosters with the same regularity they've demonstrated with the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets.",
      "But the bulk of the upgrades being tested Thursday are built into what SpaceX calls a \"new generation\" Starship. Multiple systems have been modified to improve performance and to test systems needed for eventual stage recovery.",

    "story": [
      "With the nearly full moon shining overhead, two companies, one American and the other headquartered in Japan, launched privately developed robotic lunar landers early Wednesday, sharing a sky-lighting ride to space atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.",
      "The U.S. lander, built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace and known as \"Blue Ghost,\" is carrying 10 sophisticated instruments for NASA while the Japanese spacecraft, built by Tokyo-based ispace and known as \"Resilience,\" is carrying four instruments of its own and a small microrover known as \"Tenacious.\"",
      "Mounted one atop the other in the nose cone of the Falcon 9, liftoff from historic pad 39A came on time at 1:11 a.m. EST Wednesday. Blue Ghost, weighing 1,033 pounds without propellant, was released to fly on its own one hour and five minutes after liftoff.",
      "Resilience, which weighs about 750 pounds, was deployed 21 minutes later, after the Falcon 9 carried out a final second stage engine firing to put the craft on a different trajectory.",
      "\"Our customers have different strategies for arriving to the moon, and Falcon 9's abilities enable us to deliver each lander to their respective injection orbits to complete their missions,\" said Julianna Scheiman, a senior SpaceX manager.",
      "The landers are taking very different routes to the moon. Blue Ghost is expected to spend about 25 days in Earth orbit, giving Firefly engineers time to thoroughly check out the craft's instruments, propulsion and other subsystems. The craft then will fire its engines for a four-day trip to the moon, followed by 16 days in lunar orbit.",
      "If no major problems develop, Blue Ghost, 6.6 feet tall and 11.5 feet wide, then will descend to the surface near the center of Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crisis \u2014 touching down on four shock-absorbing legs. Its 10 science instruments will have two full weeks, or a lunar \"day,\" to collect data.",
      "\"The research we gather will help unlock future space exploration, while also benefiting life on Earth, with new insights into how space weather and other cosmic forces affect our planet,\" said Firefly CEO Jason Kim.",
      "\"Each milestone we complete will provide valuable data for future missions and ultimately keep the United States and our international partners at the forefront of space exploration.\"",
      "Unlike Blue Ghost, ispace's Resilience, also known as Hakuto-R, will head for the moon about two days after launch, using a low-energy fuel-saving trajectory. One month later, the craft will fly past the moon, using its gravity to adjust the flight path before entering orbit about four months after launch. Two weeks after that, Resilience will attempt its own landing at Mare Frigoris, the Sea of Cold.",
      "ispace launched its first Hakuto lander in late 2022, but flight controllers lost contact the following March as the spacecraft was nearing the moon's surface.",
      "Investigators later determined the onboard software misinterpreted the lander's altitude after flying over the rim of a crater. The vehicle subsequently ran out of propellant and crashed to the surface.",
      "That problem has been corrected, ispace says, prompting the company to name its second Hakuto lander \"Resilience.\" ispace officials are optimistic about its chances the second time around.",
      "\"We've got experiments that I think are going to help with the establishment of lunar infrastructure that will eventually, hopefully lead to a permanent, significant human presence on the moon,\" said Ron Garan, a former space shuttle astronaut and CEO of ispace USA.",
      "\"We're doing an electrolysis experiment. We're doing a food production experiment. We also have some art installations.\"",
      "A model of a Swedish house will be carried away from the lander on the rover, which will \"set it down on the lunar surface,\" Garan said. \"We're going to photograph it, and it's a really exciting artistic endeavor as well.\"",
      "Garan called the microrover, built by ispace's Luxembourg-based unit and measuring just 10.2 inches tall and 21.6 inches long, \"really critical to the future of our company.\"",
      "\"The data that's going to come off the rover is going to be really valuable to us as we continue to hone our design on the surface mobility aspect of the business,\" he said. \"And so, that's really exciting, too.\"",
      "The Resilience mission is privately funded, without any financing from NASA. The instruments aboard Blue Ghost, in contrast, cost NASA $44 million to develop. The agency agreed to pay Firefly $101 million to carry them to the moon as part of its\u00a0Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the moon to enable industry growth and to support long-term lunar exploration, helping the United States stay ahead in space innovation,\" said Nicola Fox, head of NASA's science mission directorate.",
      "\"To date, five vendors have been awarded 11 lunar deliveries under CLPS and are sending more than 50 instruments to various locations on the moon, including the lunar South Pole. Existing CLPS contracts (have) a cumulative maximum contract value of $2.6 billion through 2028. No other nation has done this.\"",
      "The Blue Ghost instruments will collect data on the lunar dust environment, drill into the soil below the lander, monitor background X-ray emissions, test whether Earth-orbiting navigation satellites can be used near the moon and the effectiveness of computer radiation shielding, among other topics of interest.",
      "\"Before we can send our humans back to the moon, we are sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\" said Fox.",
      "\"The technological and science demonstrations on board Firefly's Blue Ghost mission will be critical in our ability to not only discover more science, but also to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments and most importantly, the safety of our astronauts.\"",
      "Kim said the Blue Ghost mission will span about two months.",
      "\"After Blue Ghost lands on the moon, we'll be collecting critical payload science data throughout the entire mission,\" he said. \"We'll then wrap up the mission by capturing a solar eclipse and a lunar sunset in high definition video before operating several hours into the lunar night.\"",
      "Toward the end of the mission, the company hopes to capture a phenomenon first seen by NASA's Surveyor moon landers and at least two Apollo crews, a so-called \"horizon glow\" caused by sunlight interacting with small dust particles kicked up by solar radiation and micrometeoroid impacts.",

      "With the U.S. government's TikTok ban\u00a0set to kick in on Sunday, Americans have been flocking to an alternative social media platform, but it's another Chinese app, and experts say it could present the same, if not even more issues. There's been a surge in U.S. downloads of the Chinese-owned application Xiaohongshu, or \"RedNote\" as many users call it.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Thursday that RedNote, just like TikTok, could face an ultimatum to divest, or be banned.",
      "\"This appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it's not divested,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment as to whether the company would agree with that assessment.",
      "What is RedNote?",
      "Xiaohongshu has been the most downloaded free app on Apple's app store in the U.S. since Tuesday. Analysis by Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, showed the platform's downloads in the U.S. had increased 200% year-on-year and seen a 194% uptick since last week.",
      "QR Code Generator, a firm that provides statistics on trends online, said there had been a 4,900% increase in searches on Google for Xiaohongshu in the U.S. on Monday alone.",
      "Xiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and is a lifestyle platform \"where over 300 million users every month share their life experiences,\" according to a description on Apple's app store.",
      "The Chinese photo and video-sharing platform has often been compared to Instagram. It operates as a platform for e-commerce, a manual for tips on travel and fine dining, as well as a vehicle for users to share content from their everyday lives.",
      "Xiaohongshu literally translates from Mandarin to \"little red book,\" likely a reference to the famed little red book of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of Communist China.",
      "That reference has not put off the many American users who've turned to the app to share their experiences as so-called \"TikTok refugees\" ahead of the U.S. ban. Videos including a use of the \"TikTok refugee\" term on RedNote have racked up millions of views and impressions this week.",
      "\"This is for my fellow TikTok refugees and Americans, behave on this app! You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",
      "One American \"TikTok refugee\" with the username \"anieladiaz\" posted a video asking Chinese users if they had any questions. A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "The legislation is currently subject to a legal challenge by ByteDance, which has argued that it's unconstitutional and violates the first amendment protecting free speech. A ruling from the Supreme Court is pending\u00a0in that case.",
      "CBS News has asked President-elect Donald Trump's transition team whether the incoming administration might deem RedNote a national security threat that should be subject to the law. The transition team had not responded by the time of the publication of this article.",
      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",
      "Content on RedNote appears to be much more heavily censored than posts on TikTok. A CBS News analysis found that any search for \"Xi Jinping,\" China's autocratic president, on RedNote yielded no results whatsoever.",
      "The term \"Free Hong Kong\" also brought back no results. A search for \"Taiwan\" will turn up several memes welcoming Americans to the platform, but noting that users must recognize the Beijing-imposed narrative that the democratically governed island just off China's coast, which the U.S. is legally bound to help defend from invasion, is an inseparable part of China.",
      "A similar search for those terms on TikTok turns up a wide range of political opinions from users, including posts heavily critical of Chinese censorship.",
      "RedNote even appears to be scaling up operations to monitor content given the vast number of Americans signing onto the app. CBS News found local job listings posted by the company online in mainland China advertising jobs to review English content and promising a monthly salary of between $950 and $1,200.",
      "\"Users are not going to a place with more freedom. RedNote is moderated differently, and the algorithm is different from TikTok,\" Warmenhoven told CBS News. \"You will not get traction or it will not spread politically sensitive issues, or maybe social sensitive issues \u2014 especially issues that are socially sensitive in China.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 14:16:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A law that could ban TikTok in the U.S. is set to take effect on Jan. 19. Here's what that would mean for users of the social media platform.",
    "story": [
      "TikTok faces a\u00a0possible ban in the U.S.\u00a0later this month if a law that could require the social media app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to part ways with the platform takes effect as scheduled on Jan. 19.",
      "Specifically, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok. If ByteDance had started the process to sell TikTok, the president also could push pause on adoption of the law for 90 days.",
      "On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Elon Musk could buy TikTok's U.S. operations, effectively allowing the app to evade a ban. Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives said that he doesn't expect ByteDance to ever sell TikTok with its algorithm, which is widely considered to be the platform's most valuable feature.",
      "Asked for comment on the possibility of a sale of its U.S. operations to Musk, a spokesperson for TikTok told CBS MoneyWatch, \"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "The Supreme Court on Jan. 11 heard arguments from government attorneys, who say TikTok poses a threat to U.S. national security, and from lawyers for the social media platform. Experts said the justices seemed receptive to the government's case, increasing the likelihood of a ban. Here's what that would mean for TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Edgar cautioned that more sophisticated VPNs require time, money and effort to set up.",
      "\"It's not something Americans are used to doing because we haven't experienced our government filtering the internet,\" he said.",
      "What are some TikTok alternatives?",
      "Users looking for a TikTok replacement app do have alternatives, such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.",
      "\"Short-form video content is something people want and they'll continue to find ways to get it,\" Edgar said.",
      "Another substitute is Lemon8, a social media app owned by ByteDance that launched in 2020, although experts note it could be subject to the same law that threatens to ban TikTok in the U.S.",
      "RedNote, a Shanghai-based Chinese language social media app also bears many similarities to TikTok. Called \"Xiaohongshu\" in China, meaning \"little red book\" in Mandarin, it's available for download in app stores in the U.S., and is currently the top social app in Apple's store.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:00:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk claims the U.S. needs a pipeline of foreign employees working on H-1B visas because the country lacks skilled engineers. Here's what the data shows.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk sparked fierce online debate recently when the billionaire said on social media that the U.S. lacks enough top engineers, pointing to immigration as the solution to what he characterized as a dearth of technical expertise.",
      "\"There is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America,\" Musk posted on his social media platform, X, comparing tech companies to a pro sports team scouting players. \"If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE.\"",
      "The claims are at the center of a divide between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, who tend to take a hard line against immigration, and technology entrepreneurs like Musk, who along with X runs exploration company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, both of which employ many foreign workers hired with H-1B visas.",
      "Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers.",
      "Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71.",
      "Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years.",
      "Companies with the most H-1B workers",
      "Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position.",
      "\"The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes,\" said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. \"If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor.\"",
      "Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages.",
      "Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills.",
      "In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract.",
      "These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said.",
      "\"Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs.\"",
      "A boost to innovation?",
      "Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One\u00a0study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers.",
      "The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed.",
      "\"Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters,\" said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, \"There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent.\"",
      "Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow.",
      "But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers.",
      "When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable.",
      "Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe.",
      "More firing than hiring",
      "Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023.",
      "The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform.",
      "How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed \"Buy American and Hire American,\" aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",
      "But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a \"great program.\" Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would \"go to war on this issue\" in one X post.",
      "\"I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas,\" Trump said. \"That's why we have them.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 08:13:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposal is raising concerns with the chip industry, with artificial intelligence leader Nvidia calling it \"misguided.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that would limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, part of an effort to preserve America's six- to 18-month advantage on AI over rivals such as China.",
      "Proposed Monday, the framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict in 120 countries the chips used for data centers and AI products. Mexico, Portugal, Israel and Switzerland are among the nations that could have limited access.",
      "Chip giant Nvidia on Monday called\u00a0the proposal \"misguided,\" and said that it \"threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\"",
      "On a call with reporters previewing the framework, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that it's \"critical\" to preserve America's leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips. The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.",
      "\"As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense,\" Raimondo said. The framework \"is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.\"",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.",
      "Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve U.S. companies' advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains.",
      "AI-enhanced technology is forecast to help fuel growth and boost corporate productivity, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling the tech developments a \"once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution\" in a recent research note.",
      "Risks to AI leadership?",
      "A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\"While we share the U.S. government's commitment to national and economic security, the rule's potential risks to U.S. global leadership in AI cannot be emphasized enough,\" said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group's senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry.",
      "One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.",
      "Nvidia bashes proposal",
      "Because the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration of President-elect Donald Trump could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips. This sets up a scenario in which Trump will have to balance economic interests with the need to keep the United States and its allies safe.",
      "Ned Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI's development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.",
      "\"While cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,\" he said. \"The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\"",
      "Under the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.",
      "Nations without restrictions",
      "The allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.",
      "Users outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the U.S.",
      "Institutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.",
      "Also, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.",

      "Meta's move comes three days after the technology company said it would stop third-party fact-checking of content on Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms. Axios was the first to report that Meta is terminating DEI programs geared to hiring, training and choosing suppliers, citing an internal employee memo.",
      "A Meta spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that it was eliminating its DEI efforts.",
      "In explaining the policy shift, Janelle Gale, vice president of human resources at Meta, said the \"legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the United States is changing,\"",
      "The retreat from DEI policies by Meta and others follows a 2023 Supreme Court decision banning affirmative action in college admissions, as well as pressure from conservatives political activists. Other large companies to unwind their DEI programs include motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson, hardware chain Lowe's, and farm equipment manufacturers John Deere and actor Supply.",
      "More recently, the shift away from DEI has coincided with President-elect Donald Trump's startling political comeback.",
      "\"Many global businesses will be using the second Trump presidency to finally kill off the DEI agenda, if they haven't done so already,\" Daniel Snell, co-founder of Arrival, a UK-based consulting firm focused on corporate leadership and culture, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"Those attempting to curry favor with Trump are doing it publicly, while other organizations, not wishing to suffer any potential public backlash or fallout, will do so quietly and over time.\"",
      "Under fire by \"anti-woke\" factions that have targeted companies, universities and other organizations in court and on social media, a number of corporations have backtracked on diversity efforts that intensified after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd sparked the largest racial justice protests in the U.S. since the civil rights movement.",
      "Some corporate leaders have also questioned the value of diversity and its contribution to a company's bottom line, with DEI \"seen by many leaders as distracting to business performance and growth,\" Snell said.",
      "DEI defenders",
      "Other companies, including Apple, Costco and Target, continue to maintain and defend their DEI policies.",
      "Costco's board is recommending that shareholders vote against\u00a0proposal to dismantle its DEI program ahead of January 23 investor meeting amid calls by activists such as Robby Starbuck urging boycotts and membership cancellations of the warehouse club.",
      "\"Among other things, a diverse group of employees helps bring orginality and creativity to our merchandise offerings, promoting the 'treasure hunt' that our customers value,\" the retailer stated.",
      "The proposal, submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, argues that DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore to shareholders.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 12:41:49 -0500",
    "summary": "Meta shocked the tech world this week by moving to overhaul its approach to fact checking. Here's what the changes mean for social media users.",
    "story": [
      "Mark Zuckerberg set the internet abuzz this week when the Meta CEO announced that the tech giant would no longer conduct independent fact-checking. The program, implemented in 2016, will be replaced with Meta's own version of Community Notes, a crowdsourced approach to reviewing online content employed by\u00a0 X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.",
      "So what exactly is Community Notes, and how does it work?",
      "How Community Notes works",
      "Meta hasn't released specifics about how it will empower users of Facebook, Instagram and other social platforms to monitor content, said Melissa Mahtani, executive producer at CBS News Confirmed.",
      "On X, Community Notes works by leaving fact-checking up to the community. Approved contributors call out content deemed false or misleading by attaching notes providing more context. Here's an example of a community note provided by X on its site:",
      "Becoming an approved contributor on X \"doesn't take much,\" Mahtani said. Any X user with an active phone number and who's been on the platform for at least six months with no violations is qualified to volunteer to be a contributor, she said. Contributors are protected by anonymity.",
      "When a post is deemed false or misleading by an approved contributor, the person will post a note that provides users with additional context. The note appears beneath the original post.",
      "Once a note is added by an approved contributor, it is still not visible to regular users on X. Before that happens, other approved contributors must vote on whether the note is helpful. This is where \"things get tricky\" said Mahtani.",
      "Is the note helpful?",
      "Once a note is added to a post on X, other approved contributors rate it on its utility.",
      "Explained Mahtani, \"Other contributors need to take a look at the sourcing, the accuracy of that note, and vote on whether or not it's helpful. If they vote that it's helpful \u2014 this is the tricky part \u2014 the company says that an algorithm takes a look at the ideological spectrum of all those contributors who voted. If they deem that those voters are diverse, it gets published.\"",
      "The algorithm decides",
      "According to X's website, the purpose of its so-called\u00a0bridging-based algorithm\u00a0is to \"identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives.\"",
      "In other words, if the algorithm finds that contributors who voted on a given note represent an ideologically diverse group, then the note becomes visible on the platform. But if the algorithm finds that the voting contributors are too uniform in their political views \u2014 a possible sign of bias \u2014 \"the public never sees it,\" Mahtani said.",
      "Problems with X's system of crowd-based fact-checking arise when a valid note calling out misinformation isn't rated as helpful by a diverse enough group of contributors to satisfy the algorithm, and is therefore never seen by readers. The speed at which a note is made public is also important, so that false or misleading information isn't given the opportunity to spread unchallenged.",
      "A report in October\u00a0by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate analyzed the Community Notes feature and found that accurate notes correcting false and misleading claims about the U.S. elections were not displayed on 209 out of a sample of 283 posts deemed misleading \u2014 or 74%.",
      "More information on how X's Community Notes works can be found on X's Community Notes page.",

      "Find updates from the TikTok Supreme Court arguments here.",
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",

      "The Florida governor emphasized border security as part of that mandate, saying Florida would be working with the Trump administration to make sure immigration laws are enforced.",

      "Moody, 49, has served as Florida's attorney general since 2019. DeSantis touted Moody's \"impressive resume\" as a commercial litigator and federal prosecutor, noting that she became Florida's youngest circuit court judge in 2007. The Florida governor said Moody has been someone who \"has acted time and time again to support the values that we all share,\" from addressing the opioid and fentanyl crisis to illegal immigration and human trafficking.",
      "DeSantis also pointed to Moody's track record of supporting the president-elect, noting that she signed on to lawsuits to \"take on the weaponization of law enforcement that targeted then-candidate Donald Trump,\" took on special counsel Jack Smith and fought back against New York Attorney General Letitia James. He also noted that Moody led the state investigation into the second assassination attempt against Trump in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "Moody, speaking after DeSantis on Thursday, said she would \"bring the same persistence and passion and tenacity as a United States senator that I have brought as Florida's attorney general.\"",
      "\"I'm ready to show up and fight for this nation and fight for President Trump to deliver the America first agenda on day one,\" Moody said, while pledging to rein in \"out of control federal agencies\" and bring down spending.",
      "Senate vacancies in Florida are filled by an appointment by the governor, who selects a replacement to serve until the next statewide election. DeSantis' appointment means Moody will be expected to hold the seat until a special election can be held in 2026. The winner of the 2026 election would serve the remainder of Rubio's term, meaning that person would have to run for election again in 2028.",
      "The announcement comes after months of speculation about who could fill the seat. A number of possibilities have emerged for DeSantis to appoint, including Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who until recently was the co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Last month, she said she was removing herself from consideration.",

    "summary": "Erroneous accusations that a wealthy couple, Stewart and Lynda Resnick, have been hoarding water amid the Southern California wildfires have been spreading widely online.",
    "story": [
      "Accusations that one wealthy couple, Stewart and Lynda Resnick, have been hoarding water needed to fight the Southern California wildfires have been spreading widely online. While the Resnicks do own water rights in the state, claims they are hoarding the supply or hindering the fight to control the blazes aren't true. Here's what we know.",
      "Who are the Resnicks?",
      "Stewart and Lynda Resnick own the Wonderful Company. Founded in 1979, their portfolio includes Wonderful Pistachios, POM pomegranate juice, Halo tangerines \u2014 agricultural businesses that all require water \u2014 and Fiji Water. The company claims to be one of the largest food producers in the world and grows a significant portion of its produce in California.",
      "However, it is the Resnicks' large stake in the Kern Water Bank \u2014 a 32-square-mile underground reservoir 150 miles from Los Angeles \u2014 that has garnered negative attention in recent weeks.",
      "The Kern Water Bank can hold nearly 500 billion gallons of water. The Resnicks own 57% of the rights to that water. That massive amount of water is fueling anger online, with some on social media erroneously claiming the couple owns 60% of the water in the state and accusing them of being one of the reasons firefighters lacked the water necessary to fight the fires. Those claims are not true.",
      "How do California water rights work?",
      "In California, water rights are owned by a collection of municipalities, homeowners and agricultural interests. Rights holders do not own the actual water; they own the right to use the water. The California State Water Resources Control Board clarifies that water rights are a \"legal permission to use a reasonable amount of water for a beneficial purpose such as swimming, fishing, farming or industry.\" Rights holders are also allowed to sell access to their water.",
      "Felicia Marcus, former chair of the California State Water Resources Control Board, said that the state constitution includes a \"prohibition against waste and unreasonable use.\" That means that if \"you actually ended up in a situation where somebody was withholding water at a grand scale,\" the government could step in.

      "While overall cancer deaths are in decline, thanks to factors like earlier detection and better treatments, that's not true for all cancers. Death rates are increasing for certain types, including oral, pancreatic, uterine and liver cancers, the report found.",

      "The report also found that more women and young adults are having cancer, a shift. Cancer cases in women aged 50 to 64 have surpassed those in men, for example. And cancer rates in women under 50 are now 82% higher than their male counterparts, which is up from 51% in 2002.",
      "\"One thing we found out really striking in this report is for an increase in the number of women being diagnosed with cancer, particularly in the 50 to 64 age, compared to men,\" Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer for the American Cancer Society told CBS News. \"Seeing this trend over time is certainly concerning and something we need to take a look at.\"",

      "A military doctor who pleaded guilty to sexually abusing dozens of male soldiers at Joint Base Lewis-McChord was sentenced Wednesday to just over 13 years in prison, was ordered to forfeit all pay and allowances and was dismissed from the U.S. Army.",
      "Maj. Michael Stockin, an anesthesiologist and pain management specialist at the base's Madigan Army Medical Center, pleaded guilty on Jan. 8 to 36 specifications, or counts, of abusive sexual contact and five of indecent viewing, said Michelle McCaskill, spokesperson with the U.S. Army Office of Special Trial Counsel.",
      "\"The sentence imposed by the court holds Maj. Stockin accountable for every person he victimized through his crimes,\" Maj. Allyson Montgomery, prosecutor, Army Office of Special Trial Counsel, said in a statement. \"The results of this proceeding shine a light on the trauma caused by Maj. Stockin by allowing the voices of every victim to be heard in a public hearing.\"",
      "JBLM is the Army's fifth-largest base and is about 47 miles south of Seattle. The Madigan medical center is the Army's second-largest medical treatment facility.",
      "After his plea, 22 of the 41 victims testified about the trauma and distress they endured because of Stockin's abuse. Many said Stockin caused them to suffer negative emotional, physical, and psychological harm because of the crimes committed against them.",
      "\"The resilience of the victims in this case should be celebrated,\" said lead prosecutor Maj. Ryan Keeter. \"They have been living with the trauma that has come from Maj. Stockin's actions for years and the last 16 months of litigation on the way to this court-martial has not been easy. I thank them for their patience, their strength, and their determination for justice.\"",
      "In a report that first aired\u00a0on \"CBS Mornings\"\u00a0last February, two men described alleged misconduct that occurred under the guise of medical care from Stockin.",
      "One of the men said he sought the doctor's help to manage arthritis in his shoulders, and said he was at first \"very confused\" by Stockin's examination.",
      "\"Myself and Dr. Stockin were left alone in the room. He first checked my shoulders and then he asked me to stand up and to pull down my pants and lift up my gown,\" he said. \"Dr. Stockin, he was face level with my groin, and he started touching my genitals.\"",
      "The other said he was sexually abused by Stockin on three occasions and described a similar experience of receiving what he called an \"alternate assessment.\" He said he struggled to understand why this visit was unlike any he had previously encountered with a physician.",
      "\"Even with my wife I couldn't bring myself to talk through what happened,\" he said, \"It just felt very uncomfortable.\"",
      "Stockin's lawyer, Robert Capovilla, said the doctor faced more than 300 years of prison, but his sentence was capped at just over a dozen years.",
      "\"Major Stockin took full responsibility for his actions, and he made no excuses,\" Capovilla said in an email. \"The Defense hopes and prays that the victims and Major Stockin will finally be able to heal and to move forward with their lives.\"",
      "Lawyers representing 22 of Stockin's former patients have filed Federal Tort Claims Act complaints against the Army and Department of Defense on behalf of the servicemen, claiming the agencies were negligent in hiring, supervising and retaining Stockin. Each is seeking $5 million in damages for the emotional distress they say they've suffered.",
      "Christine Dunn, representing the victims, said Stockin's sentencing provides some sense of justice, \"but for our clients, real justice requires holding the Army accountable for its role in allowing this to happen.\"",
      "The Army failed their clients and other victims, scarring them for life, Dunn said in an email.",
      "\"During the sentencing hearing, victim after victim described the emotional impact the sexual abuse has had on their lives,\" Dunn said. \"These brave soldiers are now riddled with anxiety and shame \u2014 many of them terrified to even seek medical attention.\"",
      "The Army launched an investigation into Stockin in 2022 after receiving multiple complaints, McCaskill said. He was suspended from patient care and was given administrative duties. He was formally charged in August 2023 with 23 counts of abusive sexual contact. In January 2024, the Army Office of Special Trial Counsel referred 52 charges and specifications, stemming from allegations by 41 male patients he treated between 2019 and 2022.",
      "Stockin will be transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he'll serve his prison sentence, McCaskill said. Based on his crimes, he'll be required to register as a sex offender and will be subject to federal and state sex offender registration requirements once released from prison.",

But federal authorities said there's no way to implement the rules before\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump\u00a0takes office on Monday.",
      "The new vessel speed rules proposed by the National Marine Fisheries Service more than two years ago have been the topic of much debate among shippers, commercial fishermen and wildlife conservationists, who all have a stake in the whale's fate. The whale, which is vulnerable to collisions with ships, numbers less than 380 and\u00a0its population has plummeted\u00a0in recent years.",
      "The Trump administration is likely to be less enthusiastic about new restrictions on shipping, said Gib Brogan, a campaign director with conservation group Oceana.",
      "\"While we've been waiting and watching the proposed rule move forward, and ultimately stall, we've watched on the water outcomes of the current insufficient protections,\" Brogan said. \"And we've watched whales be killed by speeding boats.\"",
      "Thousands of public comments",
      "The proposed rules would have expanded slow zones off the East Coast as well as the size classes of boats and ships that must slow down.",
      "The fisheries service received about 90,000 public comments about them, according to documents set to be published in the Federal Register on Thursday. The filing says the service \"does not have sufficient time to finalize this regulation in this administration due to the scope and volume of public comments.\"",
      "The final rule to modify North Atlantic right whale vessel speed regulations had been with the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which reviews new regulations before they are implemented, said Katherine Silverstein, a spokesperson for the National Marine Fisheries Service. She confirmed the fisheries service withdrew the rule on Wednesday.",
      "Conservation groups have\u00a0long argued that\u00a0tighter ship speed rules are necessary to protect the whales, in part because warm ocean waters appear to be causing the animals to stray from protected zones. The federal government first announced the proposal in summer 2022 and a coalition of environmental groups\u00a0sued to try to speed up\u00a0the finalization of the rules last year.",
      "Some shippers, however, have argued that the rules could be economically devastating to boating and shipping industries.",
      "\"This is a huge step forward for American boat manufacturers, coastal economies, and outdoor enthusiasts across the U.S.,\" said Frank Hugelmeyer, president and CEO of the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the largest trade association in North America for the recreational boating industry. \"The way this rule was drafted gave rulemaking a bad name and created an entirely preventable dynamic.\"",
      "What to know about North Atlantic right whales",
      "Right whales are massive creatures that grow to be between 45 and 52 feet in length. Adults can weigh up to 70 tons, according to NOAA. They're identified by signature white calluses on the head.",
      "They were once numerous off the East Coast, but their numbers were devastated during the commercial whaling era. They have been a protected species for many years but have been slow to recover.",
      "The whales migrate from their calving grounds off Florida and Georgia to feeding grounds off New England and Canada. The journey has become increasingly perilous as the tiny organisms they eat seek colder waters, causing the whales to leave established protected areas, scientists have said.",
      "Earlier this year, scientists were concerned after seeing nearly a quarter of the world's population of the critically endangered North Atlantic\u00a0right whales\u00a0in an unusual and potentially dangerous spot for them, CBS News Boston reported.",
      "The New England Aquarium said at least 82 whales were observed in late July and August during research flights south of New York's Long Island \u2014 hundreds of miles away from\u00a0New England\u00a0and Canadian waters where they are typically seen in the summer.",
      "Aquarium scientist Katherine McKenna told the station that scientists didn't know for sure why the whales were in that area, but they seemed to be following food.",
      "\"They're kind of becoming more unpredictable with what they're doing in response to how the ocean conditions are changing,\" she said.",
      "Why these whales are important",
      "Whales are at the top of the ocean's food chain and they help capture carbon from the atmosphere, according to the international nonprofit World Wildlife Fund.",
      "The right whale is among six out of the 13 great whale species that are classified as endangered or vulnerable.",
      "They numbered more than 480 in 2010, but that fell by more than 25% over the following decade. It has\u00a0ticked up slightly\u00a0more recently, but the animal remains critically endangered. Vessel strikes are \"a leading cause of the species' decline,\" the National Marine Fisheries Service said in documents.",
      "Conservation groups that have pushed for the finalization of slower ship speed rules said they were motivated in part by documented collision deaths of right whales in recent years. In one much-publicized case last year, a calf stranded off the state of Georgia\u00a0had head injuries\u00a0consistent with a vessel strike, according to government investigators.",

    "summary": "With the U.S. ban on TikTok looming, many Americans are opting for another Chinese app known as RedNote. It could be short-lived.",
    "story": [
      "With the U.S. government's TikTok ban\u00a0set to kick in on Sunday, Americans have been flocking to an alternative social media platform, but it's another Chinese app, and experts say it could present the same, if not even more issues. There's been a surge in U.S. downloads of the Chinese-owned application Xiaohongshu, or \"RedNote\" as many users call it.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Thursday that RedNote, just like TikTok, could face an ultimatum to divest, or be banned.",
      "\"This appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it's not divested,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment as to whether the company would agree with that assessment.",
      "What is RedNote?",
      "Xiaohongshu has been the most downloaded free app on Apple's app store in the U.S. since Tuesday. Analysis by Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, showed the platform's downloads in the U.S. had increased 200% year-on-year and seen a 194% uptick since last week.",
      "QR Code Generator, a firm that provides statistics on trends online, said there had been a 4,900% increase in searches on Google for Xiaohongshu in the U.S. on Monday alone.",
      "Xiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and is a lifestyle platform \"where over 300 million users every month share their life experiences,\" according to a description on Apple's app store.",
      "The Chinese photo and video-sharing platform has often been compared to Instagram. It operates as a platform for e-commerce, a manual for tips on travel and fine dining, as well as a vehicle for users to share content from their everyday lives.",
      "Xiaohongshu literally translates from Mandarin to \"little red book,\" likely a reference to the famed little red book of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of Communist China.",
      "That reference has not put off the many American users who've turned to the app to share their experiences as so-called \"TikTok refugees\" ahead of the U.S. ban. Videos including a use of the \"TikTok refugee\" term on RedNote have racked up millions of views and impressions this week.",
      "\"This is for my fellow TikTok refugees and Americans, behave on this app! You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",
      "One American \"TikTok refugee\" with the username \"anieladiaz\" posted a video asking Chinese users if they had any questions. A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "The legislation is currently subject to a legal challenge by ByteDance, which has argued that it's unconstitutional and violates the first amendment protecting free speech. A ruling from the Supreme Court is pending\u00a0in that case.",
      "CBS News has asked President-elect Donald Trump's transition team whether the incoming administration might deem RedNote a national security threat that should be subject to the law. The transition team had not responded by the time of the publication of this article.",
      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",
      "Content on RedNote appears to be much more heavily censored than posts on TikTok. A CBS News analysis found that any search for \"Xi Jinping,\" China's autocratic president, on RedNote yielded no results whatsoever.",
      "The term \"Free Hong Kong\" also brought back no results. A search for \"Taiwan\" will turn up several memes welcoming Americans to the platform, but noting that users must recognize the Beijing-imposed narrative that the democratically governed island just off China's coast, which the U.S. is legally bound to help defend from invasion, is an inseparable part of China.",
      "A similar search for those terms on TikTok turns up a wide range of political opinions from users, including posts heavily critical of Chinese censorship.",
      "RedNote even appears to be scaling up operations to monitor content given the vast number of Americans signing onto the app. CBS News found local job listings posted by the company online in mainland China advertising jobs to review English content and promising a monthly salary of between $950 and $1,200.",
      "\"Users are not going to a place with more freedom. RedNote is moderated differently, and the algorithm is different from TikTok,\" Warmenhoven told CBS News. \"You will not get traction or it will not spread politically sensitive issues, or maybe social sensitive issues \u2014 especially issues that are socially sensitive in China.\"",

      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2014 women leaving their homes to join their husband's family group \u2014 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",
      "In studies of pre-industrial societies from around 1800 to the present, anthropologists found that men join their wives' extended family households only 8% of the time, said Cassidy.",
      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2014 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2014 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",
      "But it does suggest that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, making Britain's Celtic society \"more egalitarian than the Roman world,\" said study co-author and Bournemouth University archaeologist Miles Russell.",
      "\"When the Romans arrived, they were astonished to find women occupying positions of power,\"\u00a0 Russell said.",
      "Some had doubted these accounts, suggesting \"that the Romans exaggerated the liberties of British women to paint a picture of an untamed society,\" he told AFP.",
      "\"But archaeology, and now genetics, implies women were influential in many spheres of Iron Age life,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire and hostage release agreement to halt more than a year of fighting in the Gaza Strip, President Biden and Qatar's prime minister announced separately on Wednesday. The deal comes after a week of intense negotiations mediated by Qatar, the U.S. and Egypt.",
      "\"Today, after many months of intensive diplomacy by the United States, along with Egypt and Qatar, Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire and hostage deal,\" Mr. Biden said in a written statement. \"This deal will halt the fighting in Gaza, surge much needed-humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians, and reunite the hostages with their families after more than 15 months in captivity.\"",
      "Speaking from the White House Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Biden said, \"There was no other way for this war to end than with a hostage deal, and I'm deeply satisfied this day has finally come, for the sake of the people of Israel, and for the families waiting in agony, and for the sake of the innocent people in Gaza who suffered unimaginable devastation because of the war.\"",
      "He said Americans will be among the hostages released in phase one of the deal, \"and the vice president and I cannot wait to welcome them home.\"",
      "The deal is expected to take effect Sunday, the White House said.",
      "As news of the agreement broke, crowds gathered in Deir al Bala in Gaza, and celebratory gunfire was heard.",
      "\"I'm extremely happy,\" one young Palestinian woman in the Gaza city of Khan Younis told CBS News. \"The past 15 months I experienced tears, laughters, lost martyrs and people went into prison, but finally I feel the joy.\"",
      "\"I am very happy, and today is the day I wished to hear about since the beginning of the war,\" an elderly man said. \"God is sending us hope,\" he added.",
      "The ceasefire is not yet in effect, and Israeli airstrikes continued Wednesday in Gaza City and Khan Younis after the news broke.",
      "The families of the American hostages still being held in Gaza expressed their relief at the news of a deal.",
      "\"We are deeply grateful that there is finally an agreement between Israel and Hamas to bring our loved ones \u2014 Omer, Edan, Sagui, Itay, Keith, Gad, and Judi \u2014 home,\" the families said in a statement. \"We have been waiting for 467 days while our family members suffer from life-threatening injuries, abuse, torture, and sexual violence. We thank President Biden, President-elect Trump, and their teams for their constructive efforts to make this possible.\"",
      "A draft of the deal had been agreed to in principle earlier in the week, Arab, U.S. and Israeli officials told CBS News. It sets out a phased framework for a ceasefire and the exchange of hostages still held by Hamas for a larger number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. It also includes access for humanitarian aid to Gaza and the eventual ability of Palestinians in Gaza to return to areas they fled.",
      "Intense negotiations had been underway in Doha for the past few weeks, with President Biden's top Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, staying in the region for the better part of a month. McGurk has been closely coordinating with President-elect Donald Trump's pick for special Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.",
      "Mr. Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone on Sunday about the negotiations and again on Wednesday. A senior U.S. official described their latest conversation as \"a very warm call, marking this moment.\"",
      "In Israel, families of the approximately 100 hostages still being held after Hamas' brutal Oct. 7 2023 attack, which saw the group and allied militants kill about 1,200 people, have been holding regular rallies demanding a negotiated deal for the release of their loved ones. The Israel Defense Forces has said it believes around a third of the hostages have already died.",
      "More than 46,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in Israeli strikes since the war began, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, and most of Gaza's population is displaced and living in camps. Humanitarian groups have been struggling to deliver aid, and experts have warned of famine.",
      "What is in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal?",
      "Details of the deal are similar to a plan outlined by Mr. Biden last year. The deal is expected to go into effect on Sunday.",
      "According to a draft from mediator sources, viewed by CBS News earlier this week, and Mr. Biden's description, it would consist of three phases, each lasting about 42 days.",
      "During the first phase, Hamas would release 33 women and children hostages, as well as hostages over 50 years old, the draft viewed by CBS News said. The first phase will also include the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza, Mr. Biden said.",
      "For each woman or child hostage returned to Israel, Israel is expected to release 30 Palestinian women and children from its prisons. Hamas would release all hostages over 50 years of age, and Israel would release 30 Palestinian prisoners aged 50 or older.",
      "A senior Israeli official told CBS News that the release of hostages from Israel would begin on the first day of a 42-day ceasefire period. Mr. Biden said Americans will be among the first wave of hostages released.",
      "On that first day, Hamas would release three hostages, according to the draft viewed by CBS News. On the seventh day, Hamas would release four hostages. Thereafter, Hamas would release three hostages taken from Israel every seven days, starting with the living and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died.",
      "During the exchange of hostages and prisoners, there would be a complete ceasefire in Gaza to allow aid to enter, the draft viewed by CBS News said. International aid groups and the United Nations would resume operations in Gaza, and would begin reconstruction of the enclave's infrastructure, such as water, electricity and sewage systems.",
      "The second phase of the deal would involve the release of all remaining male Israeli hostages and the withdrawal of all IDF forces from Gaza, the president announced Wednesday.",
      "The third phase would include the exchange of bodies of deceased hostages and prisoners and the beginning of the reconstruction of Gaza, Mr. Biden said.",
      "Trump responds to ceasefire and hostage release deal",
      "In his remarks, Mr. Biden noted that the deal will largely be implemented after his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, takes office.",
      "\"This deal was developed and negotiated under my administration, but its terms will be implemented, for the most part, by the next administration,\" the president said. \"For these past few days, we've been speaking as one team.\"",
      "Trump posted on social media as news broke of the hostage and ceasefire agreement.",
      "\"This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,\" Trump wrote. \"I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones.\"",
      "Trump said his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will continue to work closely with Israel \"to make sure Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven.\"",
      "\"We have achieved so much without even being in the White House,\" Trump wrote. \"Just imagine all of the wonderful things that will happen when I return to the White House, and my Administration is fully confirmed, so they can secure more Victories for the United States!\"",
      "Trump is at his Mar-a-Lago estate Wednesday, with five days to go until he becomes president.",
      "Asked how much credit Trump should get for the deal, White House national security communications adviser John Kirby told CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns: \"I would hope we would all move beyond the question of who gets credit. I mean, I don't think that the hostages are caring about that, and I don't think their families care about that. I don't think the Palestinians in Gaza care about who gets credit for this. The truth is that there's a lot of credit to go around, including in the [Mideast] region.\"",
      "Kirby said the Biden administration worked closely with their counterparts on Trump's team.",
      "\"It's important to remember that this deal was the deal that President Biden negotiated and put on the table back in May, got international support for it. That's the deal that we're talking about being implemented here,\" Kirby said. \"And it was due to a lot of intense diplomacy by American diplomats.\"",

      "Methanol is a substance that's often added to alcohol to increase its potency.

    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea\u00a0\u2014 South Korea's impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol was detained in a massive law enforcement operation at the presidential compound Wednesday, defiantly insisting the anti-corruption agency didn't have the authority to investigate his actions but saying he complied to prevent violence.",
      "In a video message recorded before he was escorted to the headquarters of the anti-corruption agency, Yoon lamented the \"rule of law has completely collapsed in this country.\"",
      "Yoon, the country's first sitting president to be apprehended, had been holed up in the Hannam-dong residence in the capital, Seoul, for weeks while vowing to \"fight to the end\" the efforts to oust him. He has justified his brief declaration of martial law on Dec. 3 as a legitimate act of governance against an \"anti-state\" opposition employing its legislative majority to thwart his agenda.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials said Yoon was brought into custody about five hours after investigators arrived at the presidential compound and about three hours after they successfully entered the residence, in their second attempt to detain him over his imposition of martial law.",
      "A series of black SUVs, some equipped with sirens, were seen leaving the presidential compound with police escorts. Yoon was later seen stepping out of a vehicle after arriving at the agency's office in the nearby city of Gwacheon.",
      "Hundreds of Yoon's conservative supporters rallied near the anti-corruption agency's office as he underwent questioning, shouting slogans and holding signs that read: \"We will fight alongside President Yoon Suk Yeol.\"",
      "An unidentified man was in life-threatening condition after an apparent self-immolation near the site, according to the Gyeonggi provincial fire department.",
      "Following the questioning, Yoon was sent to a detention center in Uiwang, near Seoul. He could be held in custody for weeks.",
      "The anti-corruption agency, which is leading a joint investigation with the police and the military over whether Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an attempted rebellion, has 48 hours to request a court order for a formal arrest on a charge of attempting a rebellion, and if it fails to do so, Yoon will be released. If Yoon is formally arrested, investigators can extend his detention to 20 days before transferring the case to public prosecutors for indictment.",
      "The anti-corruption agency told reporters that Yoon, during his first two hours of questioning, exercised his right to remain silent.",
      "The detainment warrant for Yoon, issued by the Seoul Western District Court, said there were substantial reasons to suspect that he committed crimes as a \"ringleader of a rebellion.\"",
      "Yoon's presidential powers were suspended when parliament impeached him on Dec. 14. The impeachment case now rests with the Constitutional Court, which could formally remove Yoon from office or reject the case and reinstate him.",
      "In a separate message posted on his Facebook account after his detainment, Yoon claimed that \"martial law is not a crime,\" saying his declaration was necessary to raise awareness about an opposition that was exercising \"legislative dictatorship by blocking laws and budgets\" and \"paralyzing\" state affairs. He denied the rebellion accusations, describing his impeachment as \"fraud.\"",
      "As they began the detention operation in the early morning, the anti-corruption investigators and police officers engaged in an hourslong standoff at the compound's gate with presidential security forces but otherwise encountered no meaningful resistance.",
      "Police officers were seen using wire cutters to remove the barbed wire placed by the presidential security service on the perimeter of the compound to block their entry. Some police officers used ladders to climb over rows of buses placed by the presidential security service near the compound's entrance, and then the investigators began moving up the hilly compound. The investigators and police later arrived in front of a metal gate with a gold presidential mark that's near Yoon's residential building. Some officers were seen entering a security door on the side of the metal gate, joined by one of Yoon's lawyers and his chief of staff. The presidential security service later removed a bus and other vehicles that had been parked tightly inside the gate as a barricade.",
      "Despite a court warrant for Yoon's detention, the presidential security service had insisted it's obligated to protect the impeached president and fortified the compound with barbed wire and rows of buses blocking paths.",
      "South Korea's acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, issued a statement early Wednesday urging law enforcement and the presidential security service to ensure there are no \"physical clashes.\"",
      "Following Yoon's detainment, Choi met with diplomats from the Group of Seven nations, including the United States, Japan, Britain and Germany, as well as the representative of the European Union, to reassure them that the government was functioning stably.",
      "Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, which drove the legislative campaign that led to Yoon's impeachment on Dec. 14, said Yoon's detention is the \"first step toward restoring constitutional order, democracy, and realizing the rule of law.\"",
      "As investigators moved up the hillside compound, lawmakers from Yoon's People Power Party held a rally in nearby streets, decrying the efforts to detain him as unlawful.",
      "The National Police Agency met with field commanders in Seoul and nearby Gyeonggi province in recent days to plan their detainment efforts, and the size of those forces fueled speculation that more than a thousand officers could be deployed. The agency and police had openly warned that presidential bodyguards obstructing the execution of the warrant could be arrested.",
      "Yoon's lawyers have claimed that the detainment warrant issued by the Seoul Western District Court was invalid. They cited a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge \u2014 which would be Yoon. They also claimed that the anti-corruption agency had no legal authority to investigate rebellion allegations.",
      "\"I am truly appalled to see illegalities upon illegalities upon illegalities being carried out and procedures being forcefully conducted under an invalid warrant,\" Yoon said in the video released before his detention. \"I do not acknowledge the investigation by the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials. As the president, who is responsible for upholding the constitution and legal system of the Republic of Korea, my decision to comply with such illegal and invalid procedures is not an acknowledgment of them, but rather a willingness to prevent unfortunate and bloody incidents.\"",
      "Yoon's supporters and critics have held competing protests near the residence \u2014 one side vowing to protect him, the other calling for his imprisonment \u2014 while thousands of police officers in yellow jackets closely monitored the tense situation.",
      "Yoon declared martial law and deployed troops around the National Assembly on Dec. 3. It lasted only hours before lawmakers managed to get through the blockade and vote to lift the measure. \u00a0The opposition-led assembly voted to impeach him on rebellion charges Dec. 14.",
      "The Constitutional Court held its first formal hearing in the impeachment case on Tuesday, but the session lasted less than five minutes because Yoon refused to attend. The next hearing is set for Thursday, and the court will then proceed with the trial whether or not Yoon is there.",

    "summary": "Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada decided to stick with the lawyer defending him from U.S. drug trafficking charges despite a possible conflict of interest.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. prosecutors said Wednesday that they're discussing a potential plea deal with Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, the long-elusive Mexican drug lord who was arrested last summer and whose son could testify against him if he goes to trial.",
      "Assistant U.S. attorney Francisco Navarro said the plea discussions with Zambada, a leader of Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel, haven't borne fruit so far, but prosecutors want to keep trying. A judge scheduled an April 22 hearing for an update.",
      "Zambada's lead attorney, Frank Perez, declined to comment on the discussions.",
      "It's common for prosecutors and defense lawyers to explore whether they can reach a deal, and the talks don't necessarily go anywhere.",
      "Zambada was an attentive and active participant during Wednesday's hearing, which focused on whether he wanted Perez to continue representing him even while also representing a potential government witness in the case - Zambada's son Vicente Zambada.",
      "\"I don't want a different attorney,\" the father said through a court interpreter. \"I want him, even though this could be a conflict if he represents me and my son.\"",
      "The younger Zambada was charged himself and made a plea deal in the long-running and sprawling U.S. prosecutions of Sinaloa cartel figures. He testified for the government at the trial of the cartel's infamous and now imprisoned co-founder, Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n.",
      "Working alongside Guzm\u00e1n, Ismael Zambada kept a lower profile and was seen as concentrating more on the business of smuggling than the extremes of brutality, serving as a strategist and dealmaker who engaged with day-to-day operations, authorities say.",
      "At Guzm\u00e1n's trial, Vicente Zambada recounted how his father and Guzm\u00e1n ran the cartel together. At one point, he described corrupt Mexican politicians asking whether the syndicate could help them ship 100 tons of cocaine in an oil tanker.",
      "\"They wanted to know if my dad and Chapo could provide that amount of coke,\" he told a jury in the same Brooklyn federal courthouse where his father is being prosecuted. At another point, Vicente Zambada recalled hearing a rival drug gang leader say he wanted to kill Ismael Zambada and Guzm\u00e1n to avenge a botched hit.",
      "Prosecutors said in a court document last month that the son might be called to testify against his father, which could pose a conflict of interest for Perez. For instance, he'd be hindered in cross-examining the son because of the loyalty he owes both clients.",
      "Defense lawyers do sometimes have potential conflicts of interest regarding a client, and federal courts have outlined the steps judges should take to address such situations. Among them is having an independent lawyer advise defendants as they consider what to do about the possible conflict. Zambada had one at Wednesday's hearing.",
      "Zambada said he realized there could be problems with Perez representing him and his son - \"for example, that he will have to hide information that he obtained from Vicente from me.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan ultimately agreed that Perez could stay on the case, noting that Ismael Zambada also has other lawyers who could handle any piece of it relating to his son.",
      "Law enforcement sought the elder Zambada for years before his startling arrest in July at an airport near El Paso, Texas, after arriving in a private plane with one of Guzm\u00e1n's sons, Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez. He, too, was wanted by U.S. authorities.",
      "Zambada has said he was kidnapped in Mexico and hauled to the U.S. by Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, whose lawyer denies those claims. Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez and his brother Ovidio are in plea negotiations with the U.S. government, their lawyers said this month in a Chicago courtroom.",
      "Following the July arrests and Zambada's allegations of kidnapping, horrific fighting erupted in Mexico between a cartel faction loyal to him and another tied to the \"Chapitos,\" Guzm\u00e1n's sons.",
      "The Chapitos have used corkscrews, electrocution and hot chiles to\u00a0torture their rivals\u00a0while some of their victims were \"fed dead or alive to tigers,\" according to an indictment released by the U.S. Justice Department.",
      "In recent months, bodies have appeared across Sinaloa, often left slung out on the streets or in cars with either\u00a0sombreros on their heads\u00a0or pizza slices or boxes pegged onto them with knives. The pizzas and sombreros have become informal symbols for the warring cartel factions, underscoring the brutality of their warfare.",
      "The chain of events also strained relations between Mexico and the United States.",
      "First, Mexico's president at the time, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and current President Claudia Sheinbaum laid part of the blame for the bloodshed at Washington's feet, saying the U.S. arrests uncorked trouble.",
      "The outgoing U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Ken Salazar, responded that it was \"incomprehensible\" to suggest the cartel wars were Washington's fault. He subsequently asserted that the Mexican government had stopped cooperating with Washington on fighting cartels and was sticking its head in the sand about violence and police corruption.",

Scientists have named the 3.54-inch-long species Atrax christenseni, with a nickname of \"Big Boy.\" Common Sydney funnel-web spiders, in comparison, can grow up to nearly 2 inches.",
      "\"Our research uncovered hidden diversity among funnel-web spiders,\" lead researcher Stephanie Loria said in a statement. \"The Newcastle funnel-web, Atrax christenseni \u2014 'Big Boy' \u2014 is a totally new species.\"",
      "The dark, glossy and large spiders are considered among the most dangerously venomous spiders for humans. The current antivenom is already effective against a wide variety of funnel-web spider bites, including the newly discovered \"Big Boy.\"",
      "Only male Sydney funnel-web spiders have venom that can kill an adult, and 13 deaths have been attributed to the common Sydney funnel-web spider between 1927 and the early 1980s. There have been no deaths since the antivenom was introduced in the 1980s.",
      "In 2024, a Sydney funnel-web spider\u00a0found in Australia\u00a0set a record as the largest spider at the Australian Reptile Park. It measured 3.1 inches from foot to foot, surpassing the park's previous record-holder from 2018.",

      "The Russian missiles sought out targets from the Lviv region in western Ukraine near Poland to Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine bordering Russia. The state energy company Ukrenergo reported emergency power outages in six regions. It often shuts down production during attacks as a precaution.",

Hamas would release all hostages over 50 years of age, and Israel would release 30 Palestinian prisoners aged 50 or older.",
      "On the first day of that ceasefire, Hamas would release 3 hostages, according to the document viewed by CBS News. On the seventh day, Hamas would release 4 hostages. Thereafter, Hamas would release 3 hostages taken from Israel every seven days, starting with the living and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died.",
      "During the exchange of hostages and prisoners, there would be a complete ceasefire in Gaza to allow aid to enter, the draft viewed by CBS News said. International aid groups and the United Nations would resume operation in Gaza, and reconstruction of its infrastructure, like water, electricity and sewage systems, would begin. There would also be negotiations over the next phase of the deal.",
      "The second phase of the deal would involve the release of all the Israeli male hostages and the withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza, according to the document viewed by CBS News.",

In the committee\u2019s first hearing of the 119th Congress, Comer delivered remarks slamming the Biden administration\u2019s \"failure\" to get federal employees back to the office.",
      "\"When President Trump\u2019s team enters federal agency headquarters in and around DC, they\u2019ll find them to be mostly empty. That\u2019s due to the Biden administration\u2019s failure to end telework and to bring federal employees back to the office,\" Comer said.",
      "While there are still a few days left in President Biden\u2019s term, Washington is preparing itself for a shift ahead of President-elect Trump\u2019s return to DC. According to the Oversight Committee\u2019s report, which cites \"the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s own data,\" as of May 2024, 1,057,000 telework-eligible federal employees were in-office three times a week, and another 228,000 remote employees \"never come to the office at all.\"",

      "The report, titled \"The lights are on, but everyone is at home: Why the new administration will enter largely vacant federal agency offices,\" is 41 pages and was prepared by Republicans on the committee. In its report, the committee makes the case that telework policies have been \"detrimental\" to government agencies.",
      "In the hearing, Comer pointed the finger at Democrats, in particular, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-Ny. He slammed Schumer for allegedly letting the Show Up Act \"collect dust.\" The legislation would bring federal employees\u2019 telework back to \"pre-pandemic levels.\"",

      "\"The Government Accountability Office found that 17 of the largest 24 federal agency headquarters in the DC area were less than 25% occupied, some much less than 25% occupied. A separate study by the Public Buildings Reform Board found that occupancy rates were just half that at 12%, 12% occupancy,\" Comer said at the hearing. \"Taxpayer money is being wasted to lease and maintain all that expensive, empty office space.\"",
      "The committee writes in its report that Trump is inheriting \"a largely absentee workforce,\" blaming it on the telework policies \"entrenched\" by the Biden administration.",
      "Comer also noted that the telework policy for federal workers has resulted in a \"lack of foot traffic\" that is \"economically devastating\" for DC, something Mayor Muriel Bowser has also pointed out. Bowser has been \"imploring the White House to change\" the telework policy for nearly two years.",
      "In fact, the Democrat lawmaker met with President-elect Trump to discuss what could be done with the \"underutilized federal buildings\" around the city.",

Numerous incidents demonstrate that Macs are not impenetrable, and a new one has recently been added to the list. Security researchers have discovered a new variant of stealer malware that targets browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets and other personal data. I\u00a0reported on this malware in 2024 as well. Previously, it relied on macOS browser extensions to steal data.

      "Cybersecurity company\u00a0Check Point has discovered a new variant of info-stealer malware, BanShee. Elastic Security Labs first highlighted this malware in mid-2024, noting that it operates as malware-as-a-service, a business model in which cybercriminals provide access to malicious software and related infrastructure for a fee. At that time, it was available for as much as $3,000 per month.",
      "Check Point says this malware evolved in September after being exposed. This time, its developers had \"stolen\" a string encryption algorithm from Apple\u2019s own XProtect antivirus engine, which replaced the plain text strings used in the original version. Since antivirus programs expect to see this kind of encryption from Apple\u2019s legitimate security tools, they weren\u2019t flagged as suspicious, allowing the BanShee to remain undetected and quietly steal data from targeted devices.",

      "4.3 MILLION AMERICANS EXPOSED IN MASSIVE HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT DATA BREACH",
      "How the Mac malware operates",
      "BanShee Stealer is a prime example of how advanced malware has become. Once it\u2019s on a system, it gets straight to work stealing all kinds of sensitive information. It goes after data from browsers like Chrome, Brave, Edge and Vivaldi, as well as cryptocurrency wallet extensions. It even takes advantage of two-factor authentication (2FA) extensions to grab credentials. On top of that, it collects details about the device\u2019s software and hardware, as well as the external IP address.",
      "The Mac malware also tricks users with fake pop-ups that look like real system prompts, tricking victims into entering their macOS passwords. Once it has gathered the stolen information, BanShee exfiltrates it to command-and-control servers, using encrypted and encoded files to ensure the data remains secure.",
      "The malware\u2019s creators used GitHub repositories to spread BanShee. They set up fake repositories that looked like they hosted popular software, complete with stars and reviews, to seem trustworthy. These campaigns didn\u2019t just target macOS users with BanShee. They also hit Windows users with a different\u00a0malware called Lumma Stealer. Over three waves, the attackers used these fake repositories to trick people into downloading their malicious files.",

      "1) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links. Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3)\u00a0Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS and your apps to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4)\u00a0Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5)\u00a0Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "No device is immune to cyberattacks when a human operator is involved. Take the BanShee Stealer, for example. It managed to target Macs not due to weak cybersecurity measures by Apple but because it successfully tricked users into installing it and granting the required permissions. Most breaches, hacks and other cyberattacks stem from human error. This highlights the importance of maintaining basic cybersecurity hygiene. It's crucial to know what you\u2019re downloading, ensure it\u2019s from a trusted source and carefully review the permissions you grant to any online service or application.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 12:00:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson reveals that hackers stole data from Gravy Analytics, a major seller of smartphone location data to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "When we talk about data privacy, tech giants like Google and Facebook are often blamed for using personal data to show ads and recommendations. Less discussed are the businesses whose entire business model revolves around collecting your data and selling it to other companies and governments. These companies often operate in legal gray areas, with the consent required to collect user data buried deep in the fine print.",
      "What\u2019s even more concerning is that these data brokers fail to adequately protect the data they collect. Last year, National Public Data made headlines for\u00a0failing to secure 2.7 billion records of individuals whose data it had harvested. Now, hackers have reportedly stolen data from Gravy Analytics, the parent company of Venntel, which has sold vast amounts of smartphone location data to the U.S. government.",

      "What you need to know about the breach",
      "Hackers claim to have breached Gravy Analytics, a major location data broker and parent company of Venntel, a firm known for selling smartphone location data to U.S. government agencies. The compromise is massive, including sensitive location data that tracks precise smartphone movements, customer information and even internal infrastructure, according to a\u00a0404 Media report.",
      "The hackers are threatening to make the stolen data public. The files contain precise latitude and longitude coordinates of the phone and the time at which the phone was there. Some even indicate what country the data has been collected from.",
      "Hackers have claimed access to Gravy's systems since 2018. If true, this represents a serious security lapse on the company\u2019s part. It is baffling how companies that collect and sell user data (a practice that arguably shouldn\u2019t be allowed in the first place) failed to protect it from being leaked.",
      "404 Media also suggests that the hackers gained deep access to the company\u2019s infrastructure, including Amazon S3 buckets and server root access. The exposed customer list reportedly includes major companies like Uber, Apple and Equifax as well as government contractors like Babel Street.",

      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",
      "What this breach means for people",
      "This data breach highlights the serious security flaws in the location data industry. Companies like Gravy Analytics and Venntel have been profiting from collecting and selling sensitive location data, often without proper user consent. They've prioritized profit over security, and now the privacy of millions is at risk. This data could end up on black markets, endangering individuals, especially those in vulnerable situations, by making them targets for harassment or worse.",
      "The FTC's recent crackdown on Gravy, announced in December, underscores their negligence. The proposed order will prohibit these companies from selling or using location data, except in specific cases like national security or law enforcement. The implications are worrying. Sensitive locations like schools and workplaces could become easy targets for those with malicious intent.",

      "The Gravy Analytics breach serves as a sobering reminder of the vulnerabilities in the digital age. While it\u2019s impossible to control how every company handles data, you can take steps to minimize your exposure and protect your privacy. Here are five actionable tips to stay safe.",
      "1) Limit app permissions: Many apps request access to location data, contacts and more, even when it's not necessary for their functionality. Regularly review the permissions for apps on your smartphone and revoke access to anything that feels excessive. For instance, a weather app doesn\u2019t need access to your microphone or camera.",
      "2) Use a VPN:\u00a0Virtual private networks (VPNs) can mask your IP address and encrypt your internet activity, making it harder for data brokers and hackers to track your online behavior. A good VPN adds an extra layer of security, especially when using public Wi-Fi networks.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Opt out of data sharing where possible:\u00a0Some companies allow you to opt out of having your data collected or shared. Services like Your Ad Choices and privacy settings within platforms like Google can help you reduce the amount of data collected. Check for opt-out options with any apps or services you use frequently.",
      "4)\u00a0Avoid free apps that monetize data: Free apps often generate revenue by selling user data. Instead, consider paid versions of apps that explicitly prioritize privacy. Research the company behind the app to understand its data handling policies before downloading.",
      "5) Invest in data removal services:\u00a0Data removal services can help you regain some control over your personal information by identifying and removing it from people-search websites, data broker platforms and other online databases.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Companies that collect and sell user data pose a significant threat to privacy, and when they fail to protect this data, it often ends up in the hands of even worse actors. Cybercriminals, and even some governments, can exploit this information to target individuals. It is crucial to implement stringent repercussions for these companies when they fail in their duty to safeguard user data. A mere slap on the wrist is not enough. We need real accountability to deter negligence and protect individual privacy rights.",

Open the app from the App Library, and it\u2019ll keep your login details encrypted and synced across all your devices.",
      "While Apple's new Passwords app in iOS 18 offers a convenient and cost-free solution for password management, it's important to consider its limitations.

      "German automaker Volkswagen isn't having a great time. The company is planning to cut capacity at five factories, reducing production by about 700,000 vehicles, while also laying off more than 35,000 workers in its home country. Now, reports suggest the company had a massive data leak at its subsidiary software company Cariad, which exposed personal data, including geolocation data, of around 800,000 EV owners online and accessible for months. Such information could be valuable to criminals for extortion purposes. What's interesting is that a hacker association informed the company about this data leak after receiving a tip from an anonymous hacker.",

      "As reported by Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel magazine, Volkswagen is facing a major data security issue after movement data from 800,000 electric cars and the personal contact information of their owners were left exposed on the internet. This data revealed sensitive details, such as the precise locations where cars were parked, including private locations like people\u2019s homes, government buildings and even questionable spots like brothels.",
      "The exposed data includes detailed movement patterns of these vehicles, allowing for the creation of comprehensive profiles of individuals' daily activities. This could be particularly concerning for public figures or anyone with privacy concerns.",
      "Several car brands under the Volkswagen group, including VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda, were affected by the breach, which exposed sensitive data across multiple countries. The information was stored on Amazon cloud servers without adequate protection, leaving it vulnerable for months before the issue was discovered.",
      "For around 466,000 of the 800,000 affected vehicles, the location data was detailed enough to map out drivers\u2019 daily routines. Spiegel reported that the list of affected users included German politicians, business leaders, the entire EV fleet used by Hamburg police and even suspected intelligence agents.",
      "The breach came to light when an anonymous hacker tipped off the Chaos Computer Club. While Volkswagen left the data easily accessible during this time, there is no indication so far that anyone misused or accessed it maliciously.",

      "The Volkswagen data leak is more than just a tech issue. It is a real concern for anyone who values their privacy. With precise location data out in the open, someone could figure out where you live, work or spend your free time. This information could be misused in many ways, from targeted scams where hackers pretend to be Volkswagen or its partners to trick you into giving up sensitive information, to more personal threats like stalking or harassment.",
      "Imagine someone knowing your daily routine or identifying places you visit that you would prefer to keep private. Visits to clinics, legal offices or other sensitive locations could expose you to embarrassment or blackmail.",
      "The breach also raises concerns for business leaders, government officials and military personnel as their movements linked to high-security or restricted areas could be exposed, increasing the risk of corporate espionage or national security threats. Moreover, when paired with other vulnerabilities, such as app credentials, hackers could potentially exploit the data to unlock or even control vehicles remotely.",

      "1) Check your app settings:\u00a0Review the permissions and data-sharing settings in your car's companion app. Disable features that track or share your location if they are not essential for your use. Regularly update the app to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "2) Be alert to scams:\u00a0Keep an eye out for suspicious emails, messages or calls pretending to be from Volkswagen or related services. Avoid clicking on links or sharing sensitive information without verifying the sender.",
      "3) Consider data opt-out options:\u00a0Many vehicles with online features allow you to limit or disable certain data-sharing functionalities. Check your car\u2019s settings to reduce the amount of personal data being collected.",
      "4) Strengthen your online accounts:\u00a0If you use the same email or password across multiple accounts, update them immediately. Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication wherever possible to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.",
      "5) Beware of snail mail scams: While most people focus on digital threats, physical mail scams can also follow a data breach like this. If your contact information was exposed, you might receive fraudulent letters pretending to be from Volkswagen or related services. These could ask for payments, personal details or even encourage you to visit fake websites.",
      "6) Install strong antivirus software: Ensure that you have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices, especially those connected to your vehicle or its apps. This can help protect you from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "30% OF AMERICANS OVER 65 WANT TO BE REMOVED FROM THE WEB. HERE\u2019S WHY",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Volkswagen data leak is a glaring example of how companies need to take user data security more seriously. Exposing personal details and precise locations is not just a technical mistake. It is a massive breach of trust. While VW has patched the issue, the damage shows how important it is for businesses to be more responsible with the data they collect. People deserve to know their information is safe and used only when necessary. If companies cannot protect their customers\u2019 privacy, they risk losing their confidence altogether. It is time for the industry to step up and do better.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson takes a closer look at Shell's Starship 3.0: A natural gas big rig boosting efficiency 2.5 times, proving greener trucking.",
      "The Shell Starship Initiative has been on an interesting journey since its inception in 2018, with a mission to redefine energy efficiency in the commercial trucking sector. Starting with diesel engines, the first two versions of the Starship made impressive strides in fuel efficiency, but now with the introduction of the Starship 3.0, we're witnessing a remarkable shift towards sustainability. This latest iteration features the innovative Cummins X15N natural gas engine, which not only enhances performance but also significantly reduces emissions.",

      "Evolution of the Starship initiative",
      "The Shell\u00a0Starship Initiative began with a clear goal: to set new benchmarks for energy efficiency in commercial trucking. The first two versions of the Starship were powered by diesel engines, achieving notable fuel efficiencies compared to industry standards. However, the introduction of the Cummins X15N natural gas engine in the Starship 3.0 represents a pivotal shift away from diesel, addressing both environmental concerns and operational efficiency.",
      "The X15N engine, launched in 2024, is designed specifically for heavy-duty applications and overcomes previous limitations associated with natural gas as a fuel source. It provides similar power outputs to diesel engines but does so with enhanced fuel efficiency and significantly lower emissions. This is particularly important as the trucking industry faces increasing pressure to meet stricter environmental regulations.",

From its innovative natural gas power train to its sleek aerodynamic design, every aspect of this vehicle has been meticulously crafted to enhance efficiency and reduce emissions. Let\u2019s dive into some of the standout features that make the Starship 3.0 a game-changer for the industry.",
      "Natural gas power train: The switch to the Cummins X15N engine allows the Starship 3.0 to operate on various forms of natural gas, including renewable natural gas. This adaptability not only enhances its eco-friendliness but also positions it as a practical option for fleets looking to transition away from traditional fuels.",
      "Weight reduction: The new engine is approximately 500 pounds lighter than its diesel counterpart, which increases the potential freight-carrying capacity of the truck. This weight reduction is complemented by other lightweight materials used in the truck's construction, contributing to an impressive ton-miles per gallon efficiency of 183, compared to an industry average of 72.",
      "Aerodynamic design: The Starship 3.0 features a sleek design with curved edges and optimized aerodynamics that reduce wind resistance. Additional enhancements like low rolling resistance tires and integrated aerodynamic panels further contribute to its efficiency.",
      "Advanced lubricants: Shell has developed specialized lubricants tailored for the higher temperatures generated by natural gas engines. The truck uses Shell Rotella NG Plus SAE 5W-30 synthetic oil, formulated specifically for this purpose, alongside advanced transmission lubricants that improve overall performance.",
      "Real-world testing: The input from experienced truck drivers, such as brothers Brian and Eric Rector, has been invaluable in refining the Starship's design and functionality. Their hands-on experience with all three iterations of the truck has provided critical data that informs ongoing improvements.",

      "BULLET TRAIN-LOOKING GIANT SEMI TRUCK TO HIT US HIGHWAYS",
      "Performance metrics",
      "The performance metrics achieved by the Starship 3.0 are impressive. It surpassed its predecessors with a freight ton efficiency that is 2.542 times better on a ton-miles per gallon basis, while also achieving an average fuel consumption of 9 mpg (diesel gallon equivalent) while hauling an industry maximum load of 80,000 pounds. Additionally, the emissions reductions associated with using renewable natural gas further enhance its environmental credentials, making it a viable option for fleets aiming for sustainability.",

    "story": [
      "These scams can catch Facebook veterans and novices off guard.",

      "How did hackers target PowerSchool",
      "PowerSchool revealed a cybersecurity breach to its customers Jan. 7, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer. The company said it discovered the breach Dec. 28, after customer data from its PowerSchool SIS platform was stolen through the PowerSource support portal.",
      "PowerSchool SIS is a student information system used for managing grades, attendance, enrollment and other student records. Hackers accessed the PowerSource portal using stolen credentials and used an \"export data manager\" tool to steal information.",
      "The company said this wasn\u2019t a ransomware attack or a result of software flaws, but rather a straightforward network break-in. The company has hired a third-party cybersecurity firm to investigate the breach, figure out what happened and determine who was affected.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "UNDERSTANDING BRUSHING SCAMS AND HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF",
      "What data got stolen",
      "The PowerSource portal includes a feature that allows PowerSchool engineers to access customer systems for support and troubleshooting. The attacker exploited this feature to export the PowerSchool SIS \"students\" and \"teachers\" database tables to a CSV file, which was then stolen.",
      "PowerSchool confirmed the stolen data primarily includes contact details like names and addresses. However, for some districts, the data may also include sensitive information such as Social Security numbers, personally identifiable information, medical records and grades.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The company said customer support tickets, credentials and forum data were not accessed or stolen during the breach. PowerSchool also emphasized that not all SIS customers were affected and expects only a subset of customers will need to notify those affected.",
      "\"We do not anticipate the data being shared or made public, and we believe it has been deleted without any further replication or dissemination,\" the developer told customers in a notice.",
      "\"We have also deactivated the compromised credential and restricted all access to the affected portal. Lastly, we have conducted a full password reset and further tightened password and access control for all PowerSource customer support portal accounts.\"",

      "5 ways you can stay safe from PowerSchool data breach",
      "The PowerSchool data breach has highlighted the importance of staying vigilant about your personal information. Here are five steps you can take to protect yourself:",
      "1. Monitor your accounts regularly:\u00a0Keep a close eye on your bank accounts, credit cards and any online services linked to your personal information. Watch for unauthorized transactions or changes to your accounts that could signal misuse of your data.",
      "2. Freeze your credit: If your Social Security number or other sensitive details were compromised, consider placing a credit freeze with major credit bureaus like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. This prevents potential identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name.",
      "3. Use identity theft protection services:\u00a0Take advantage of any identity protection services offered by PowerSchool as part of its breach response. These services can alert you to suspicious activity and provide support if your identity is stolen.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "One of the best parts of some identity protection services is that they have identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Wherever possible, enable\u00a02FA for your online accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text code or app-generated token, to access your accounts.",
      "5. Be aware of phishing links and use strong antivirus software: Cybercriminals often use phishing scams to exploit data breaches. Avoid clicking on suspicious links in emails or text messages, especially those claiming to be from PowerSchool or your school district.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "You can blame hackers for this breach, but PowerSchool shares the responsibility for failing to adequately protect sensitive data. The company may also be in violation of data privacy agreements it signed with school districts, as well as federal and state laws designed to safeguard student privacy. What\u2019s more concerning is that PowerSchool took nearly two weeks to notify its customers about the breach. Schools are now left scrambling to assess the full extent of the intrusion. This delay is not just irresponsible; it puts students, parents and teachers at heightened risk of cyberattacks and identity theft.",

    "story": [
      "Paul Petersen, head of the United Aerial Firefighters Association, said that wildfires raging in Southern California are among the deadliest and costly fires in U.S. history.",
      "The head of the United Aerial Firefighters Association, which has deployed about 200 pilots to Southern California to fight massive ongoing wildfires, told Fox News Digital that the scope of the fires is \"totally demoralizing\" and shaping up to be some of the worst in the nation's history.",
      "\"What we are seeing, especially in the United States and worldwide, is there is no longer a fire season \u2013 it is fire year-round,\" Paul Petersen said on Wednesday. \"[This] could end up being one of the deadliest and most climate-costliest fires in U.S. history.\"",
      "Aerial firefighters with the association are limited to eight-hour shifts in the air, like airline pilots. However, Petersen said, they are on 24-hour shifts. At night, he said, pilots are outfitted with night vision goggles. From the air, they communicate the position of the flames to firefighters on the ground and spray water or retardant substances from above.",
      "Among the aircraft supplied by the association are helicopters, like Blackhawks and ACH 47 Chinooks, and air tankers, like Grumman S-2T and Lockheed C-130H planes, carrying thousands of gallons of water. They also supply \"scooper\" planes, which \"scoop water from oceans, lakes and reservoirs which can be dropped as regular water or be mixed with a foam retardant,\" according to Cal Fire.",

Cal Fire currently has over 60 planes and helicopters within its firefighting fleet; Cal Fire also counts three King Air A200 twin-turboprop planes among its \"air tactical aircraft.\" The Air National Guard has flown C-130 Hercules planes \"equipped with Modular Aerial Fire Fighting Systems\" to the Los Angeles area, where they are operating missions.",
      "\"I've seen just the pictures, and I've talked to fire chiefs that are down there \u2013 they [are] ensuring that the devastation is worse than what you see on TV, that it's worse than what you can imagine,\" he continued. \"And from a firefighter's perspective, it is just totally demoralizing because firefighters are there to solve problems and their people call them when it's their worst day.

The Palisades Fire, which has consumed more than 23,000 acres in the Los Angeles area, is only 19% contained, according to the agency.",

      "\"There's a couple of different components of [this],\" Petersen said of why these latest fires are so devastating. \"When you have extreme weather, and you have the Santa Ana winds that are blowing, you know, 50, 60, 70, 80 miles an hour, and then you introduce fire into that\u2026 it just moves so rapidly that people are unprepared for it.",
      "\"Communities that are unprepared for it, firefighters are surprised by it\u2026 When you start losing home after home and blocks after blocks after blocks, you're just trying to figure out how do we stop this? And, you know, there's really no playbook of how to stop a fire.\"",
      "Fox News Digital previously reported that the city's fire hydrants ran out of water as firefighters worked to stop the flames, and that the department's budget was slashed just weeks before the Palisades Fire broke out.",
      "\"Without increased funding for wildland fire, we're going to continue to see this over and over again,\" Petersen said. \"[It's] not only recognizing that it is a year-round fire season, but also having the funding and the money to invest not only for fire suppression, but for hazardous fuels, for hardening communities. U.S. needs to get it, you know, take this seriously, that you have to do all things in order to protect communities from wildfire.\"",

      "\"There is a huge need to look at local, state and federal levels to how do we really start to combat when fire and suppression is a big part of it,\" he continued. \"You got to fight. You have to fight the fire you have. But there also has to be fuel treatments, logging, grazing, green stripping. There also has to be incentives from insurance companies for fire-adapted communities. All three of those have to work and in one fell swoop in order to do that.\"",
      "\"It takes a tragedy for people to really wake up to this,\" Petersen said. \"And firefighters have been talking about this for 25 years, these problems that have been going on.\"",

      "Jairo Saenz, 28, is expected to receive a sentence of 40 to 60 years in federal prison after admitting to seven murders, multiple attempted murders, arson and other charges. Saenz's brother Alexi, another gang leader, previously pleaded guilty to similar charges in exchange for an expected sentence of 70 years behind bars.",
      "The Saenz brothers were the leaders of a Suffolk County, New York, branch of MS-13 known as the Sailors, according to federal authorities. Their group was known for extreme brutality and violence, including the murder of two Brentwood High School girls with a machete and a baseball bat.",

As Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker prepared to lead a livestreamed service, a man, later identified as Malik Faisal Akram, arrived at the synagogue. His presence would change the course of the day forever.",
      "A new documentary, \"Colleyville,\" directed by award-winning filmmaker Dani Menkin, reveals never-before-seen footage from the synagogue\u2019s 13 security cameras, documenting the harrowing 11-hour hostage crisis in real-time. The film offers a chilling yet profoundly human look at the bravery of the hostages and the resilience of a community under threat.",
      "The day began with an act of kindness. Security footage shows Akram ringing the doorbell and being welcomed inside by Cytron-Walker, who offered him tea and a place to warm up. \"I was just trying to do what we do on any other day: offer kindness and welcome,\" the rabbi said.",

      "The security footage, revealed for the first time in \"Colleyville,\" captures every tense moment. Akram\u2019s demands centered on the release of Dr. Aafia Siddiqui, known as \"Lady al-Qaeda,\" held in a nearby Fort Worth prison.

Before exiting, Shane negotiated to switch places with Larry, ensuring the older man\u2019s safety.",
      "As the hours wore on, the tension escalated. Akram fired a shot into the ceiling, an alarming act captured on camera.

That moment came when Akram held a cup of liquid in his dominant hand, temporarily preventing him from pulling the trigger.",
      "\"I saw how he held the cup, and I knew it was our best chance,\" Cytron-Walker told Fox News Digital. In a decisive move, he threw a chair at Akram, creating a window for escape. \"We weren\u2019t far from the exit. It was a split-second decision, but it was the culmination of hours of watching, waiting, and thinking.\"",
      "The hostages bolted out of the synagogue. Moments later, law enforcement stormed the building, ending the standoff. None of the hostages were physically harmed, though the psychological toll of the ordeal lingered. \"It was a horrible day, but we had so much to be grateful for,\" he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 17:06:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Using a cage-like device, South African rescuers have brought at least 60 bodies and 92 survivors to the surface from one of the country&apos;s deepest mines.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Months after South African authorities initially cut off supplies to miners working illegally in an abandoned gold mine, rescuers brought dozens of bodies and emaciated survivors to the surface Tuesday with hundreds more still believed to be underground, many of them dead and others too weak to come out on their own.",
      "At least 60 bodies and 92 survivors had been pulled from one of South Africa's deepest mines since Monday in a red cagelike device lowered thousands of feet underground, police said. Police are uncertain how many miners remain inside but said it is likely in the hundreds. Another nine bodies were brought out Friday in a community-led rescue effort, according to a group representing the miners.",
      "DEATH TOLL CLIMBS TO 13 IN SOUTH AFRICA MINING DISASTER",
      "The mine has been the scene of a tense standoff between police, miners and members of the local community since authorities launched an operation in November to force the miners out by cutting off food and water from the surface for a period of time. At the time, a Cabinet minister said the aim was to \"smoke them out\" and the government would not send help because they were \"criminals.\"",
      "But that tactic has been fiercely criticized by civic groups and the community, and the South African government is under scrutiny for the way it has dealt with the issue at the Buffelsfontein Gold Mine, where more than 100 miners are believed to have died underground of starvation or dehydration, according to the group representing them.",
      "Rescue workers assist an illegal miner who has been trapped deep in an abandoned gold mine for months, in Stilfontein, South Africa, Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2025.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Themba Hadebe)",
      "Authorities, who removed the ropes and pulley system miners used to enter and to lower supplies, say the survivors are able to come out but refuse to because of fear of arrest. That has been disputed by the civic groups, which won a court case to force authorities to allow food, water and medicine to be sent down to the miners. But they say the supplies aren\u2019t enough and many of the miners are dying of starvation and unable to climb out because the shaft is too steep.",
      "Residents desperately waiting for news of family members gathered at the mine Tuesday near the town of Stilfontein, southwest of Johannesburg, some holding placards criticizing authorities for their response. One sign said there had been a \"Sacrifice at Stilfontein\" while some handcuffed survivors were led away in a line by police.",
      "The community organized its own rescue operation on Friday before the official effort by authorities began Monday. They say a proper rescue operation should have been launched months ago.",
      "\"We are happy that this operation is happening, even though we believe that if it was done earlier, we wouldn\u2019t even have one dead person,\" said Mzukisi Jam, the regional chairperson of the South African National Civics Organization, an umbrella for civic and rights groups.",
      "Authorities have grappled with informal mining for years",
      "Illegal mining is common in parts of gold-rich South Africa where companies close down mines that are no longer profitable, leaving groups of informal miners to enter them illegally in a search for leftover deposits.",
      "Large groups of miners often go underground for months to maximize their profits, taking food, water, generators and other equipment with them, but also relying on others in their group on the surface to send down more supplies.",
      "Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe visited the site Tuesday and said that more than 1,500 miners who resurfaced from the Buffelsfontein mine have been arrested since authorities began a larger crackdown on illegal mining in late 2023. He said the vast majority were foreign nationals from neighboring countries.",
      "Police have also doubled down on their assertion that the miners who are still underground aren't coming out because they are afraid of being arrested.",
      "Activists said the only way out is for miners to make a dangerous trek to another shaft, which can take days, and crawl out there, but many are too weak or ill to climb out. The mine is 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) deep with multiple shafts, many levels and a maze of tunnels. The group representing the miners said there are numerous groups in various parts of the mine.",
      "\"The last time I spoke to my brother was in July, when he told us that he is going underground,\" said Zinzi Tom, a sister of one of the miners who remained underground. \"We had not heard anything from him, but yesterday one of the miners who surfaced said he saw him about two weeks ago. Apparently he is very sick and he is struggling to survive.\"",
      "Cellphone videos emerge from underground",
      "The Mining Affected Communities United in Action group, which took authorities to court in December to force them to allow supplies to be sent down to the miners, released two cellphone videos that they said were from underground and showed dozens of dead bodies of miners wrapped in plastic. A spokesman for the group said \"a minimum\" of 100 miners had died.",
      "The cellphone videos purportedly from the depths of the mine are filmed by a man who can be heard saying, \"This is hunger. People are dying because of hunger,\" as he records emaciated-looking men sitting on the damp floor of the mine. He adds: \"Please help us. Bring us food or take us out.\"",
      "The rescue operation will go on for 10 days and authorities would then reassess, Police Minister Senzo Mchunu said. Police also said that the survivors who had been brought to the surface will be arrested and charged with illegal mining and trespassing after receiving medical attention.",
      "Authorities made clear their approach when South African Cabinet Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni told reporters in November that the government would not help the miners, who they consider criminals.",

India and Pakistan are long-standing rivals, having fought three wars over Kashmir since both countries gained independence in 1947.

The weakening of Iran, due to conflicts in the Middle East and internal issues, has diminished its influence over the Taliban. At the same time, Russia, one of India's closest allies, is moving toward recognizing the Taliban government in Afghanistan, even calling the group a partner in combating terrorism.

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 A ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas has been reached after 15 months of devastating war that has seen tens of thousands of people killed in the Gaza Strip, left scores of Israeli hostages in painful limbo and changed the face of the Middle East.",
      "The truce, announced Wednesday, is expected to stop the Israeli bombardment of Gaza that has killed more than 46,500 people, according to local health officials. It will also see the phased release of dozens of hostages captured during the Oct. 7 2023, terrorist attack who are still being held in Gaza, as well as the release of hundreds of Palestinians detained by Israel.",
      "Hundreds of trucks of desperately needed aid are also expected to start entering the enclave daily once the ceasefire comes into force.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know so far about the three-phase deal:",
      "What happens first?",
      "The agreement outlines a roughly six-week initial ceasefire phase that could begin as early as the end of the week, a diplomatic source in Washington told NBC News.",
      "Before the deal can get underway, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will have to get approval from his security Cabinet and his full Cabinet. Israel's Supreme Court would have 24 hours to permit an appeal.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "The earliest a ceasefire could go into effect would be Friday, the diplomatic source said, though the truce is expected to begin Sunday if Netanyahu's security Cabinet and the full government Cabinet give the go-ahead.",
      "It is unclear when the Israeli Cabinet will convene, however, with Netanyahu's office on Thursday reporting a delay, accusing Hamas of reneging on part of the deal and creating a \"last-minute crisis.\"",
      "The Directorate of Abductees, Returnees and Missing Persons in the prime minister\u2019s office said in a separate statement Thursday that Hamas had added demands that \u201ccontradict the agreement\u201d with mediators.",
      "David Mencer, a spokesman for Netanyahu said during a news conference Thursday that the Israeli negotiating team remained in Doha to \"finalize the hostage release agreement.\"",
      "In an interview with the Saudi state-owned television channel Al Arabiya, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri denied that, saying there was \u201cno basis\u201d for claims the group had \u201cbacked down from the terms of the ceasefire agreement.\""

    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is considering ways to keep TikTok available in the United States if a ban that\u2019s scheduled to go into effect Sunday proceeds, according to three people familiar with the discussions.",
      "\u201cAmericans shouldn\u2019t expect to see TikTok suddenly banned on Sunday,\u201d an administration official said, adding that officials are \u201cexploring options\u201d for how to implement the law so TikTok does not go dark Sunday.",
      "Deputy White House Chief of Staff Bruce Reed has been a point person on the issue and has received many calls from people urging the president not to let a ban go into effect, according to two people familiar with the matter.",
      "If the administration moves forward with any such plan, it would mean the popular app\u2019s going down would not define his last full day in office, and it would defer the issue to Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated Monday.",
      "Mike Waltz, Trump\u2019s incoming national security adviser, told Fox News on Wednesday that Trump is ready to intervene to preserve access to the Chinese-owned video app in the American marketplace. And Pam Bondi, his pick for attorney general, refused to commit to enforcing the ban when she was asked about it at her Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday.",
      "The moves represent parallel efforts by the rival presidents to execute an end-run around Congress and the Supreme Court, which is teed up to rule on the ban at any time.",
      "Still, a White House official insisted that not enforcing the ban, if it is upheld, is not an option.",
      "\u201cWe are not considering deferring enforcement,\u201d the official said. \u201cStatutorily, we don\u2019t believe we have the authority to do that.\u201d",
      "Biden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s positions are reversals from their onetime support for banning TikTok.",
      "The Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment on the plan.",
      "TikTok is considering its options, including the last-ditch possibility that it goes dark Sunday, though it could also allow the app to remain active but without future updates and bug fixes.",
      "The law in question required ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s China-based owner, to divest from the company and find an outside buyer to take over within nine months. That window closes Sunday. The law also gave the president the authority to grant a one-time 90-day extension if \u201csignificant progress\u201d has been made toward divestment.",
      "The measure was enacted in the name of national security, as lawmakers believed U.S. users\u2019 data was at risk of being compromised by China or that China could influence Americans by controlling content on TikTok. TikTok \u2014 which has long said those concerns are meritless \u2014 and some of its users sued to block the law, challenging it from a First Amendment standpoint.",
      "Without a sale, a reprieve for TikTok would mean that the national security concerns would, at least for now, remain unresolved.",
      "Just days ahead of the potential ban, throngs of U.S. TikTok users have downloaded Chinese alternatives that pose similar security issues.",
      "Trump, who tried and failed to implement a ban during his first term, vowed on the campaign trail last year to \u201csave TikTok.\u201d Biden signed the ban into law as part of a $95 billion measure providing aid to Ukraine and Israel in April. But now his White House is looking to take the teeth out of it.",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a longtime Biden ally, is among a small set of lawmakers who have appealed to the White House and the Supreme Court to stop the ban.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that President Biden will listen to the millions of voices who don\u2019t want the lights to go out on this app,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cHe has the power to extend the timeline to try to have a solution that prevents the app from shutting down.\u201d",
      "Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., also said he has relayed his concerns to White House officials and asked them to delay the ban.",
      "He said they replied that they \u201cwould take it under consideration\u201d but did not give a clear answer about what would happen.",
      "Late last month, Trump filed a brief urging the Supreme Court to hold off on implementing that part of the law so the incoming president could \u201cpursue a negotiated resolution\u201d to prevent a TikTok shutdown. Trump\u2019s attorney John Sauer argued in the brief that Trump \u201creceived a powerful electoral mandate from American voters to protect the free-speech rights of all Americans \u2014 including the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.\u201d",
      "Days later, Trump asked on his Truth Social platform: \u201cWhy would I want to get rid of TikTok?\u201d",
      "He attached a graphic showing his broad reach on the short-form video app, which claims 170 million U.S. users.",
      "Last week, Supreme Court justices did not appear convinced by TikTok\u2019s free speech arguments, though they could decide to temporarily block the law while still ruling against the company.",
      "During arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts pointed to Congress\u2019 finding that TikTok\u2019s parent company is subject to Chinese laws requiring it to assist in intelligence-gathering.",
      "\u201cSo are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\u201d he asked.",
      "In addressing the free speech concerns, Roberts said, \u201cCongress doesn\u2019t care about what\u2019s on TikTok.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers were \u201cnot saying TikTok has to stop,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re saying China has to stop controlling TikTok.\u201d",
      "While TikTok\u2019s Asia headquarters are in Singapore, its parent company, ByteDance, is in Beijing.",
      "Some congressional Republicans who voted for the law said they expect Trump to step in and negotiate a sale to U.S. interests once he takes office.",
      "\u201cThey have to divest by law, so Trump could play an effective role by finding a buyer. ... He fancies himself as a top negotiator,\u201d said Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, a China hawk who was chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee when Congress passed the legislation last year. \u201cOtherwise, I guess it shuts down unless he can find a way to divest it.",
      "\u201cA lot of these influencers rely on TikTok,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to switch over, but ByteDance is controlled out of Beijing. It\u2019s just not a threat to Congress but to our children.\u201d",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said there is only one path for TikTok if it wants to continue operating in the United States: divestiture.",
      "\u201cCongress has already passed the bill,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping for is the owners of TikTok \u200b\u200bcome forward and say, \u2018We will never share Americans\u2019 data with the Communist Party of China, and here\u2019s how that will be enforced: divesting from the parent company.\u2019\u201d"

    "summary": "Noem's role as Homeland Security secretary is expected to be more limited in scope than her predecessors\u2019, sources familiar with the Trump transition tell NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick to head the Department of Homeland Security,\u00a0Kristi Noem, is set to go before a Senate committee for a confirmation hearing Friday. But even if she is successful at the hearing and is confirmed, as she is expected to be, her role\u00a0as homeland security secretary is expected to be more limited in scope than her predecessors\u2019, sources familiar with the Trump transition told NBC News.",
      "If she is confirmed,\u00a0Noem, the governor of\u00a0South Dakota,\u00a0will oversee a workforce of more than 260,000\u00a0across a number of agencies, including Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Secret Service and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. But\u00a0on the issue in her purview that is highest-profile and most important to Trump, immigration,\u00a0she would be taking marching orders from the White House,\u00a0specifically\u00a0from incoming border czar Tom Homan and\u00a0Stephen Miller, the deputy\u00a0chief of\u00a0staff for\u00a0policy, four sources familiar with the transition preparations said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media about transition discussions.",
      "Previous homeland security\u00a0secretaries have been involved in Cabinet-level discussions about immigration policy and\u00a0have advised\u00a0the presidents they served on the realities of carrying out policies on the ground. They have also set the priorities for how to conduct immigration enforcement.",
      "Noem is not considered a key player in planning mass deportations, a major campaign promise of Trump\u2019s, as that is seen largely to be the focus of Homan and Miller, the sources said. She has not been vocal about the issue, nor has she made national media appearances since Trump announced her as his choice to head DHS shortly after he won the White House in November.\u00a0But if there are policy questions from Congress, she would be the one to answer them.",
      "In response to a query about Noem\u2019s role in immigration policy, the transition team said in a statement: \u201cPresident Trump was elected to secure America\u2019s borders. As President Trump\u2019s choice to be DHS Secretary, Governor Noem will ensure that CBP, ICE, and USCIS, critical immigration agencies under her purview, have what\u2019s necessary to protect our borders and keep Americans safe.\u201d",
      "The transition team also noted that the Border Patrol union endorsed Noem in a letter to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which will hold the confirmation hearing. \u201cWe are confident that as Secretary, Governor Noem will continue to ensure Border Patrol agents have the resources and manpower that we need to secure our border,\u201d the letter said.",
      "Noem\u2019s spokesperson in the governor\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign manager and a longtime Noem ally,\u00a0is involved in hiring for key positions within the new DHS, even though he is not an official part of the DHS transition, three of the sources said. Two of them said that has been frustrating for people within the Trump transition whose jobs are supposed to be hiring for the department. One of the sources called Lewandowski\u2019s role \u201coutsized\u201d and \u201cabnormal,\u201d while another called it \u201cunusual.\u201d",
      "Both said Lewandowski used a Gmail account for people to email him if they wanted jobs in DHS.",
      "A lawyer for Lewandowski said that he is not \u201chandling the hiring process for DHS\u201d and that he has a professional relationship with Noem.",
      "Though Noem\u2019s role in immigration policy might be limited, DHS\u2019 responsibility to secure critical infrastructure, respond to natural disasters, prevent terrorist attacks and protect the president and other dignitaries would ultimately fall to her if she is confirmed.",
      "Critics, including Democrats and Native American tribes in her state, as well as some senators, have argued that as governor of South Dakota, a state far from the U.S. southern border with only 5% of the workforce of DHS, Noem lacks the right experience to run DHS.",
      "Doug Sombke, a South Dakota farmer and president of the South Dakota Farmers Union, who has been a frequent critic of Noem, said she was not qualified to run DHS. \u201cGood God, no, she can\u2019t run the state,\u201d\u00a0he said.",
      "Noem has come under fire most recently for the state auditor\u2019s denial of an open records request for her government-issued credit card.\u00a0The auditor told The Dakota Scout newspaper of Sioux Falls that the records could not be released because it could violate her safety.\u00a0The newspaper has sued to get the records.",
      "Fellow Republicans have also criticized her for\u00a0spending $13 million in taxpayer money on a shooting range project that the Legislature had rejected.",
      "\u201cThe Legislature objected to the spending, and the governor approved it anyway,\u201d Sombke said.",
      "Noem\u2019s backers applaud her tough stance on immigration. She has called\u00a0for\u00a0so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with ICE to be punished. And she sent South Dakota\u00a0National\u00a0Guard members to the border to address what she has called an immigrant \u201cinvasion.\u201d",
      "\u201cKristi has been very strong on Border Security,\u201d Trump said in a statement in November announcing her as his choice to run DHS. \u201cShe will work closely with Border Czar Tom Homan to secure the Border and will guarantee that our American Homeland is secure from our adversaries.\u201d",
      "Other issues likely to come up in Noem\u2019s hearing before the\u00a0Senate committee Friday are her revelation in a recently published memoir that she shot and killed her family dog when she considered it \u201cuntrainable.\u201d\u00a0Another is\u00a0a 2022 South Dakota state legislative committee\u2019s finding that Noem\u2019s daughter\u00a0Kassidy Peters\u00a0received special treatment when she was given her real estate appraisal license.\u00a0A\u00a0state agency awarded the license in 2020 despite Peters\u2019 failure to obtain training that was required, the legislative committee found.",
      "The committee\u00a0noted in its legislative minutes that when Noem\u2019s daughter was initially rejected, she \u201cshould have waited the required six months and reapplied.\u201d\u00a0Instead, she received her license from the agency that answered to the governor.",
      "Noem denied she had ever intervened on her daughter\u2019s behalf, saying in a video at the time, \u201cI never once asked for special treatment for Kassidy.\u201d"

Tammy Duckworth, grilling President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice for defense secretary over whether he had the \u201cbreadth and depth of knowledge\u201d needed to lead international negotiations, asked Pete Hegseth if could name one member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, describe what type of agreement the U.S. had with the countries and how many nations were in the bloc.",
      "Hegseth responded at the heated Senate confirmation hearing that he couldn\u2019t tell Duckworth the exact number of ASEAN nations, but that \u201cI know we have allies in South Korea and Japan, and in AUKUS with Australia,\u201d referring to a pact among the U.S., Australia and Britain.",
      "\u201cNone of those three countries are in ASEAN,\u201d responded Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois. \u201cI suggest you do a little homework.\u201d",
      "What is ASEAN and why is it relevant to the U.S.?",
      "ASEAN is made up of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. An 11th country, East Timor, is set to join soon.",
      "Established in 1967, its goal is to promote regional economic and security cooperation, leveraging a combined population of more than 650 million people with a GDP of more than $3 trillion.",
      "Duckworth\u2019s question came after Hegseth had noted the strategic importance of the Indo-Pacific, a region where China\u2019s influence has been rapidly growing and Beijing has become increasingly assertive in pressing territorial claims.",
      "ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei are locked in maritime disputes with China over its claims of sovereignty over virtually all of the South China Sea, one of the world\u2019s most crucial waterways for shipping. Indonesia has also expressed concern about what it sees as Beijing\u2019s encroachment on its exclusive economic zone.",
      "What does ASEAN have to do with the U.S. secretary of defense?",
      "The U.S. is treaty partners with ASEAN members Thailand and the Philippines, and Washington has sought to harness ASEAN\u2019s regional influence as it seeks to counter Chinese influence and promote what the White House has called \u201ca free and open region that is connected, prosperous, secure and resilient.\u201d",
      "President Joe Biden said ASEAN was \u201cat the heart of my administration\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy\u201d and hosted a meeting of ASEAN leaders in Washington in 2022.",
      "ASEAN also holds top-level meetings annually, this year in Malaysia, which holds the rotating chair of the group.",
      "Its defense meetings are typically attended by the U.S. defense secretary, and its foreign minister meetings by the U.S. secretary of state. The meetings culminate with an annual summit, which is regularly attended by the sitting U.S. president. Both Biden and Donald Trump have participated.",
      "Why else is ASEAN important?",
      "Despite some members\u2019 territorial conflicts with China, many in the bloc have close relations with Beijing as well, and top-level Chinese officials also attend ASEAN meetings.",
      "The U.S. in 2022 was elevated to the top-level \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership\u201d with ASEAN \u2014 a largely symbolic status that put Washington on the same level with China, which was granted the distinction the year before.",
      "ASEAN emphasizes noninterference and personal diplomacy, and its breadth of membership and partnerships makes it uniquely positioned as a forum to address major geopolitical issues.",
      "Beyond China and the U.S., ASEAN has formal relationships with Russia, India, Australia, the European Union, Britain, Japan, South Korea and many others.",
      "It hosts annual \u201cASEAN Plus Three\u201d meetings with the leaders of China, South Korea and Japan, \u201cASEAN Plus Six\u201d talks that add in the leaders of Australia, India and New Zealand, and the East Asia summit, which includes the six plus Russia and the United States.",
      "The ASEAN nations are also central to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, a free trade agreement that was signed in 2020, creating the largest trade bloc in history.",
      "The 10 nations plus China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand account for more than 30% of the world\u2019s population and about 30% of global GDP. Conceived at ASEAN\u2019s 2011 summit, the agreement includes commitments on trade in goods and services, investments and other areas."

      "The committee asked Ratcliffe in written questions before the hearing about Trump\u2019s vow in 2023 to \u201cclean out all of the corrupt actors in our National Security and Intelligence apparatus, and there are plenty of them.\u201d",
      "Ratcliffe wrote in reply that he was not in a position to comment on quotes attributed to Trump \u201cfor which context may be lacking.\u201d But he said that throughout his career he found CIA employees \u201cto be skilled professionals who were driven by mission\u2014not by political or ideological bias.\u201d",
      "Unlike other confirmation hearings,\u00a0Ratcliffe\u2019s two-hour hearing, which was followed by a closed-door session to discuss classified topics, proceeded smoothly with comparatively little partisan rancor. Ratcliffe is expected to be easily confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, where he has mostly received praise for his performance as director of national intelligence in Trump\u2019s\u00a0first term.",
      "Former intelligence officers, Democratic lawmakers and Western officials have harbored\u00a0concerns that Trump and his deputies could undermine the\u00a0work\u00a0of the country\u2019s intelligence agencies by injecting politics into their conclusions and analysis, which could discourage allies from sharing sensitive information.",
      "Since\u00a0the start of his first term in 2017, Trump has had a stormy relationship with the intelligence\u00a0community. He and his supporters have portrayed officials in the agencies \u2014 along with the Justice Department\u00a0and\u00a0the FBI\u2014 as part of a \u201cdeep state\u201d plotting against him.",
      "Questioned by Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, Ratcliffe said he would not encourage an intelligence professional to alter assessments to avoid criticism from the White House and pledged that no \u201cpolitical litmus\u201d or \u201cloyalty\u201d tests would be imposed on agency employees.",
      "King said he hoped Ratcliffe could persuade Trump to be more open to the information the intelligence community provides.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s notoriously skeptical of the intelligence community, and being skeptical is not necessarily a bad thing,\u201d King said. \u201cBut I hope that\u2019s one of the first things that you can work with him on, is to make him receptive to the information and the truth that you will be providing as a result of your position.\u201d",
      "A focus on China",
      "Ratcliffe said his top priority as CIA director would be the threat posed by China, and he vowed to expand the CIA\u2019s focus on Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese Communist Party remains committed to dominating the world economically, technologically and militarily,\u201d he said.",
      "The CIA needs \u201cto continue \u2014 and increase in intensity \u2014 its focus on the threats posed by China and its ruling Chinese Communist Party,\u201d he\u00a0added.",
      "Ratcliffe said in his written answers that he would shift more of the CIA\u2019s workforce to\u00a0collecting and analyzing\u00a0intelligence about China and praised the current CIA director, William Burns, for having created a China Mission Center.",
      "He said\u00a0his\u00a0effort would include \u201cbuilding broad and deep expertise on the target\u201d and increasing \u201cthe number of officers with language capability in analytic and operational roles.\u201d",
      "Ratcliffe\u00a0said that he would aim to increase intelligence collection on China\u2019s activity in new technologies and seek to counter Beijing\u2019s efforts to exploit the theft of U.S. intellectual property and research.",
      "The chair of the Intelligence Committee, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said that the CIA had become politicized and overly bureaucratic and that it needed to get back to what he said was its core mission \u2014 collecting foreign intelligence, or \u201cstealing secrets.\u201d",
      "Ratcliffe agreed that the CIA\u2019s core mission was to collect intelligence and that it needed to guard against \u201ccomplacency.\u201d CIA officers who do not meet expectations will be held accountable, he said.",
      "Cotton said the CIA had failed to anticipate a series of major global events, including Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, the strength of the Afghan government army fighting the Taliban, the ability of Ukraine\u2019s military to fend off\u00a0Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022 and the fall of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad last month.",
      "In questioning Ratcliffe, Cotton also cited an internal survey of the CIA\u2019s workforce on the objectivity of it work, which is mandated by Congress but has not been released publicly. Ratcliffe said he was familiar with the highlights of the survey, which he said showed significant concerns among employees about \u201cobjectivity.\u201d",
      "He said the survey \u201creflects that a significant percentage of the current CIA workforce does have concerns about the objectivity of the products that they\u2019re producing and even cited that in specific instances, to include the PDB, the president\u2019s daily brief,\u201d Ratcliffe said. He did not elaborate.",
      "The CIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Lawmakers from both parties also asked Ratcliffe to commit to renew efforts to investigate the causes of the mysterious health incidents known as \u201cHavana Syndrome,\u201d which have plagued intelligence officers and diplomats,\u00a0first in Cuba and then in other countries.",
      "Ratcliffe promised\u00a0a renewed effort\u00a0to get to the bottom of the health cases, saying, \u201cI share your frustration that four years later, we\u2019re very much in the same place in terms of trying to make an assessment and determination on the cause of this.\u201d",
      "Last week,\u00a0a split emerged\u00a0among intelligence agencies over whether foreign adversaries may have been responsible for the unexplained injuries, which include vertigo, severe headaches and other effects. A U.S. intelligence assessment released Friday revealed that two of seven unnamed spy agencies concluded a foreign actor may have developed or deployed a weapon that caused the incidents."

      "Shortly after the Supreme Court greenlit unlimited donations to political committees known as super PACs over a decade ago, billionaire tech CEO Larry Ellison began to cut multimillion-dollar checks aimed at influencing politics at the highest levels.",
      "And now, after a Supreme Court ruling eased restrictions on college athletes profiting from their name, image and likeness (commonly referred to as NIL) in recent years \u2014 a ruling that\u2019s opened the floodgates for outside groups to essentially pay players to attend their preferred school \u2014 Ellison made another splash, helping to pay for the deal that prompted a top high school quarterback recruit to flip his commitment from Louisiana State University to the University of Michigan.",
      "The decision by Bryce Underwood sent shockwaves through the college football landscape.",
      "But once Ellison\u2019s involvement was revealed, it sent another message, too \u2014 just like in politics, megadonors have a new avenue to directly influence another arena, thanks to rules allowing for uncapped donations.",
      "Tim Lolli, a former Republican congressional and campaign staffer who is now the director of sports strategy and growth at Causeway Solutions, told NBC News that it\u2019s no surprise that the intersection of sports and politics will continue to grow because \u201cthe worlds just operate very similarly.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey have rabid fan bases, they are very driven financially \u2014 especially in the college ranks now, where collectives have expedited what that looks like \u2014 and then you have the high-net-worth individuals wanting to play a part in this through their resources,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are both driven by results and winning. You have very clear, defined moments when success comes about \u2014 when the clock strikes zero, and on Election Day when the polls close.\u201d",
      "Ellison, the chairman and founder of the tech company Oracle, has an estimated net worth of almost $200 billion, according to Forbes, which pegs him the fourth richest person in the world. Over the last 12 years, he\u2019s given more than $46 million to federal campaigns and outside groups, according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission.",
      "His first multimillion political donation came in 2012, when he sent $1 million to the Restore Our Future super PAC supporting then-GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney (before donating another $2 million weeks later). That presidential campaign was the first after the Supreme Court paved the way for super PACs by allowing unlimited donations to some outside political groups, and Ellison was one of the pro-Romney super PAC\u2019s largest donors.",
      "In the 2016 presidential race, Ellison donated $5 million to a super PAC backing the GOP presidential campaign of Sen. Marco Rubio, of Florida. But the vast majority of his political donations have come since then, as he has spent the last few years helping to fill South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott\u2019s political coffers by donating $35 million to an outside group that supports Scott (money that was integral to the senator's 2024 Republican presidential bid).",
      "Supreme Court rulings in the early 2010s reset the entire political landscape and created a brand-new playbook for how to run campaigns. Donations from both individuals and corporations used to be capped, vastly limiting the amount of political spending each election cycle. But over time, candidates and political parties have become dependent on these outside efforts aimed at boosting their campaigns, and spending has ballooned over time. In 2012, outside spending hit more than $500 million. By 2024, that number has doubled.",
      "College sports appears to be facing a similar moment, after federal court rulings and subsequent NCAA rules paved the way for college athletes to receive compensation from outside groups by selling the rights to their name, image and likeness. It\u2019s fundamentally transformed recruiting, particularly for high revenue-generating sports like football and basketball. Now, NIL collectives affiliated with college programs play a big role in the recruiting landscape, wooing student athletes with contracts that can total in the millions.",
      "\u201cIn July of 2021, the NCAA thought they were doing something great for the first time. But what they didn\u2019t know was there were a bunch of these, call them super PACs, LLCs or 501(c)(3)s, ready to find ways, legitimate ways, to funnel money to athletes,\u201d a top NIL collective official at a Power 4 conference program, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide their candid views about the college football landscape, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pro sports. I was on the phone this morning and comparing it with an agent \u2014 essentially, it\u2019s unrestricted free agency, every six months, with no rules. It\u2019s just the ability for the deepest pockets to go acquire the top talent every cycle.\u201d",
      "Lolli, who previously worked for former Ohio Republican Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (a college football standout and former NFL wide receiver who was one of the early advocates on Capitol Hill for NIL reform), said the similarities between politics and college sports make college sports fertile ground for political megadonors to explore.",
      "\u201cYou have Larry Ellison and these high net-worth individuals that were like, 'Well, I know how this one world works, being politics, so why can I not do the same thing in college now?' Collectives \u2014 I\u2019ve been calling them super PACs for athletic departments from Day One,\" Lolli said.",
      "Underwood\u2019s high-profile decision to decommit from LSU and promise to go to Michigan instead made headlines across the sports world. And in the following days, Ellison\u2019s involvement became clear.",
      "A statement from \u201cChampions Circle,\u201d the NIL collective affiliated with Michigan, pointedly thanked \u201cLarry and his wife Jolin who were instrumental\u201d in securing Underwood\u2019s recruitment \u201cby providing Champions Circle with invaluable guidance and financial resources.\u201d",
      "And Dave Portnoy, the Barstool Sports founder and podcast host, took a victory lap on a podcast, going into detail about how Ellison and his wife, a Michigan graduate, reached out to team up after Portnoy said he was willing to spend millions of his own money to \u201cgo get us a quarterback.\u201d",
      "\u201cJolin, on that first phone call, she\u2019s like, \u2018I needed somebody to step up from Michigan and show that they cared as much as I did,\u2019\u201d Portnoy said.",
      "Portnoy needled his colleagues on the Barstool podcast, arguing that Michigan\u2019s newfound \u201cunlimited\u201d resources will change the landscape of the sport.",
      "\u201cThe second you get anyone worth looking at \u2014 yoink, he\u2019s mine,\u201d Portnoy said about how other schools won\u2019t be able to compete with Ellison\u2019s wealth. \u201cWhen our guy, Larry Ellison, zeroes in on somebody, it\u2019s a done deal.\u201d",
      "Ellison, through a spokesman at Oracle, declined to comment for this article. And there\u2019s no public indication about whether the investment was a one-time deal or if he will continue to use his largesse to help Michigan\u2019s recruiting.",
      "While the scope of Ellison\u2019s personal wealth is an unprecedented development in the NIL landscape, it\u2019s the outgrowth of an explosion of NIL money in college sports in the years since the rules changes. Top college players can earn hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars through NIL deals with school collectives and other organizations. While the terms of those deals aren\u2019t usually disclosed, there\u2019s been a steady drip of reporting making the largess clear.",
      "In 2022, The Athletic reported that a top college football quarterback recruit had signed an $8 million contract (while the identity of that player was not immediately clear, the reporter later said it was Tennessee\u2019s Nico Iamaleava). Two years later, a lawsuit filed by former University of Florida quarterback Jaden Rashada centered on his NIL deal and claimed he was offered $9.5 million to attend the University of Miami but chose Florida in part because of its $13.85 million offer. And the athletic director at Ohio State, which is set to face off in the college football championship game on Monday, told media outlets in 2024 that its NIL collective and the broader \u201cecosystem\u201d gave its football players \u201caround $20 million\u201d in NIL deals in the previous year.",
      "Another reason why Ellison\u2019s involvement in Michigan\u2019s recruiting sticks out is because the collective and its allies (mainly, Portnoy) went public. Similarly to the world of campaign finance, there are easy ways for donors to avoid public disclosure. Many collectives are nonprofits or structured like other groups that do not have to disclose individual donors, similar to how billions of dollars of political donations flow through nonprofits that don\u2019t have to disclose their donors compared to groups that do.",
      "One major difference in the political and NIL megadonor landscape is that more regulation is coming in college sports.",
      "The NCAA has been working through a settlement related to a series of antitrust lawsuits that could allow schools to pay athletes directly, bringing potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in payments to athletes in house and creating a new clearinghouse to approve deals. The details are still not finalized \u2014 the settlement has received preliminary approval in court ahead of more action in the coming months, and it\u2019s unclear how it would mesh with sometimes contradictory state laws on NIL payments \u2014 but it appears that significant change is on the horizon.",
      "\u201cThe current model is not sustainable for 90% plus of these teams. It isn\u2019t doable to lean on your donors \u2014 you\u2019ve already asked them to build new stadiums and fund scholarships and now we\u2019re saying, wait a minute, now we have to pay kids and we need to to do that, too,\u201d the Power 4 conference NIL official said, calling the looming settlement \u201ca good shift, but not a perfect shift.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe kids deserve a piece of the pie, I\u2019m glad the NCAA is allowing it to happen. I think the fa\u00e7ade of NIL is baloney. Let\u2019s just call it what it is \u2014 pay for play \u2014 let\u2019s let them collectively bargain, let\u2019s create a cap, let\u2019s pay these football kids and basketball kids and let them earn some dollars because they\u2019re bringing in hundreds of millions, right?\"",
      "Members of Congress from both parties have been also batting around potential legislation of their own, even though partisan differences remain. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the new chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, called reforming college athletics \u201ca priority\u201d on his podcast in November.",
      "\u201cRight now, the current world of college sports is the Wild West,\u201d he said. \u201cName, image and likeness, open transfer portals \u2014 it is, I think, endangering the future inviability of college athletics. I think Congress needs to step in and legislate.\u201d",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who has co-sponsored his own reforms, told NBC News he\u2019s \u201cmore deeply concerned about the monetization of college sports and the predominance of funding, whether it\u2019s by donors or alumni, to attract and entice athletes, and in effect, make them pawns of a system.\u201d He added he believes lawmakers are \u201con the cusp of making some progress toward a bipartisan bill.\u201d",
      "The widespread agreement for more regulation is a far different reality than the campaign finance system. Despite calls from many Democrats and some Republicans to change the way political campaigns and outside groups operate \u2014 adding more disclosures or reinstating donation caps \u2014 there\u2019s been no fundamental campaign finance reform since those court cases changed the landscape more than a decade ago, as lawmakers and operatives from both parties have benefited politically and financially from the newer landscape.",
      "James Carville, the longtime Democratic strategist and vocal LSU fan, told NBC News that while it\u2019s clear there\u2019s \u201cmuch more money in sports and politics\u201d than ever before, it\u2019s hardly a new dynamic in either realm.",
      "\u201cBig money is becoming very dominant, not just in American politics but all of American athletics, too. Look how much Juan Soto is signing for,\u201d Carville said, referring to the All-Star baseball player who signed a $765 million contract with the New York Mets this offseason. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to criticize that the only reason you wouldn\u2019t do it yourself is you just don\u2019t have that much money. If he [Ellison] had donated to LSU, he\u2019d be the most popular guy in Baton Rouge.\u201d",
      "Deep pockets remain important for those looking to compete in sports and politics, but most agree it\u2019s not always the end all, be all.",
      "Jesse Hunt, a Republican strategist and former college football player, noted how the vaunted recruiting classes at Texas A&M when Jimbo Fisher was the coach didn\u2019t pan out as expected, arguing that there are certain intangibles in both sports and politics \u2014 locker room cohesion and motivation, for example, in sports, and the winning issues in politics \u2014 that aren\u2019t necessarily for sale.",
      "\u201cThere are four or five premium positions in football and they cost a lot of money,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you have to pay if you want to win national championships. \u2026 You don\u2019t have to spend the most money, but you have to spend.\"",
      "\u201cJust because your opponent is outspending you by $1 million the final week of the campaign, it doesn\u2019t matter if the other factors are on your side. If your team plays together well, you have better coaching, better play callers, you can pull the upset.\u201d",
      "Democrats significantly outspent President-elect Donald Trump in each of the last three elections, finishing with one win and two losses \u2014 proof that, in both sports and politics, while it\u2019s good to be well funded, it\u2019s not the be-all and end-all.",
      "\u201cDemocrats spent over $3 billion,\u201d Carville said, \u201cand, I don\u2019t know, there will be people on earth who try to figure out to what avail.\u201d"

      "The Lions and the Commanders are two of the most aggressive fourth-down teams in the NFL, and their coaches\u2019 willingness to be bold will almost certainly be a major factor in who advances to the NFC championship game.",
      "During the regular season, Detroit and Washington ranked second and third, respectively, in giving themselves the biggest edge on fourth downs in a formula devised by The Athletic\u2019s Austin Mock.",
      "The Commanders, in fact, are appearing in Saturday's matchup in large part because of their mettle on do-or-die downs. Washington went for it five times on fourth down against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in its playoff opener. It converted three of those attempts, including a fourth-and-2 in the fourth quarter for a go-ahead touchdown.",
      "\u201cWe were going to be bold but not reckless,\u201d Commanders coach Dan Quinn said. Quinn kept going for it on fourth down even after the team didn\u2019t convert its first attempt of the night.",
      "\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s who we are the whole season,\u201d he added. \u201cBut when you do get stopped early, you just have to stay the course knowing that \u2018hey, keep your chin tucked and keep swinging,\u2019 knowing that this is going to be a game that\u2019s going to go all the way down to the end.\u201d",
      "While Washington finished first in the NFL in fourth-down conversion percentage during the regular season (87%) \u2014 the best mark in NFL history for a team with more than 10 attempts \u2014 Quinn is kind of stealing Detroit\u2019s whole flow.",
      "Since Dan Campbell took over the Lions in 2021, no other team has attempted more fourth-down conversions. Campbell was doing it even when his team wasn\u2019t good, having introduced his bold strategy during the Lions\u2019 3-13-1 season in his first year at the helm.",
      "Campbell\u2019s unapologetic nature on fourth down has been polarizing, even as he has made it easier for coaches like Quinn to adopt a version of it for themselves.",
      "In last year\u2019s NFC championship game against the San Francisco 49ers, Detroit went 1-for-3 on fourth down in a 34-31 loss, a game in which they led by 17 at one point. Both failed attempts came while the team was in field goal range, including once while the 49ers led 27-24.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t regret those decisions,\u201d Campbell said after the game.",
      "Campbell shocked even some of the most analytics-pilled NFL onlookers this season when he attempted a late fourth-down conversion against the Green Bay Packers.",
      "In a tie game with 43 seconds left, the Lions had a fourth-and-1 on the Packers\u2019 21-yard line. Green Bay was out of timeouts. A field goal would have given Detroit a 34-31 lead, and the Packers would have had to drive into field-goal range with no timeouts on their next possession.",
      "Instead, Detroit went for it and picked up the yard on a handoff even after quarterback Jared Goff stumbled. The Lions were able to run down the clock and kick the winning field goal as time expired.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019d love to say that if you\u2019re going to do that, you\u2019re going to convert every one of them, but that\u2019s not the reality,\u201d Campbell said after the win. \"It doesn\u2019t always work that way. So, you know, you\u2019re taking a high level of risk. There is risk with it, but I felt like with our guys, it wouldn\u2019t be as big of a risk as it may appear to be.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed state Attorney General Ashley Moody to the U.S. Senate, setting her up to fill the seat of Sen. Marco Rubio, whom President-elect Donald Trump tapped to be secretary of state.",
      "Rubio was selected to serve in Trump\u2019s administration shortly after Trump won the 2024 presidential race, handing DeSantis a Senate appointment that is likely to have ripple effects across Florida government and politics.",
      "It has widely been expected in recent weeks that Moody would be the pick, while others, including Reps. Kat Cammack and Cory Mills, did talk to DeSantis about the position. DeSantis had said publicly he had reservations about appointing a member of the House because of the GOP\u2019s slim majority in that chamber.",
      "State Sen. Jay Collins, who served as a Green Beret, also got considerable support from conservatives who wanted DeSantis to pick an military veteran.",
      "But ultimately, the seat will go to Moody, 49, who easily won her first election in 2018 to become attorney general and her re-election bid in 2022. She was unable to run again due to term limits.",
      "She will have to run in a 2026 special election to keep the seat for the final two years of Rubio's term. Mills has already said he is running for Senate in 2026, as first reported by Politico, and Cammack is mulling a run, meaning Moody is going to face Republican primary challengers.",
      "Right now, though, her appointment will set a new record for Republican women in the Senate, according to data from the Center for American Women in Politics. When Moody takes the seat, there will be 10 GOP women in the chamber.",
      "Moody is a close ally of DeSantis, who has served as his chief legal bulldog on a host of high-profile political fights with the Biden administration.",
      "Most recently, Moody\u2019s office, which is technically separate from the governor\u2019s office, filed a lawsuit in October against the Department of Justice over what she argued was a federal government effort to block Florida\u2019s own investigation into the second assassination attempt against Trump, which happened in September at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach.",
      "\u201cEvery day that Florida is prevented from investigating, the State\u2019s case becomes harder to prove at trial,\u201d Moody argued in the suit. \u201cBy contrast, the federal government suffers no injury from Florida investigating state law crimes, as the State has no intention of interfering with or obstructing the federal investigation.\u201d",
      "DeSantis has said he believes the federal government had \u201cstonewalled\u201d Florida\u2019s ability to conduct its own investigation.",
      "Moody said the state\u2019s independent investigation was needed, in part, because the DOJ should not have been investigating an attempted assassination attempt on Trump while simultaneously trying to prosecute him. Since Trump\u2019s election victory in November, former special counsel Jack Smith, who was leading federal cases against Trump over whether he tried to overturn the 2020 election and over alleged mishandling of classified documents, has resigned, and those cases against Trump have ended.",
      "In December, Moody also released an arrest affidavit for Ryan Routh, the alleged gunmen behind the second assassination attempt. She said a traffic backup that resulted from searching for Routh led to an accident that injured a 6-year-old girl. Routh is in federal custody and facing five charges related to the attempted assassination.",
      "Earlier this year, the state attorney general also sued the Biden administration to try and block a rule Moody argued would have forced doctors to provide gender transition care against their judgement. Transgender issues have been one of the main culture war fights DeSantis has focused on as governor.",
      "DeSantis had not signaled publicly who he would pick to fill Rubio\u2019s seat, but has said the person will be a hard-liner on immigration, including pushing reforms to the so-called H-1B visa program, which has been the subject of intense internal post-election fights among Trump\u2019s own supporters.",
      "Trump-backers like billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk have said the program offers lower-cost international talent for many companies, while the populist wing of the MAGA movement, led by people like conservative pundits Steve Bannon and Laura Loomer, have said the program should be abolished.",
      "Trump said in late December that he believes the program is \u201cgreat.\u201d",
      "Moody\u2019s pick is also likely to reshuffle DeSantis\u2019 own political orbit.",
      "It is widely believed that longtime DeSantis chief of staff, James Uthmeier, will now be appointed to fill Moody\u2019s post, requiring that DeSantis select a new top staffer. Uthmeier served as the campaign manager for DeSantis\u2019 failed 2024 presidential bid and is considered one of his closest confidants."

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 10:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has promised significant changes when he takes office, on everything from immigration to foreign policy to tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump spent the past two years on the campaign trail making more than a dozen promises about what he would enact on his first day in office.",
      "Trump\u2019s day-one plans are wide-reaching, calling for the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, sweeping tariffs that economists have warned could have drastic and harmful effects on the U.S. economy and pardons of defendants charged in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "On the first day of his previous term, Trump signed just one executive order, which targeted Obamacare. Here are some of Trump\u2019s most notable day-one promises this time around.",
      "Immigration",
      "As he did during his previous campaigns, Trump made immigration the centerpiece of his 2024 pitch, repeatedly vowing to deport undocumented migrants. On Oct. 27, just days before the election, Trump reiterated during a rally in New York City, \u201cOn day one, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history to get the criminals out.\u201d In 2022, the number of undocumented migrants living in the U.S. stood at nearly 11 million according to a federal estimate, though the exact number is unknown.",
      "When asked in November about the cost of a mass deportation plan, Trump told NBC News that \u201cit\u2019s not a question of a price tag.\u201d That same month, Trump confirmed a post by another Truth Social user, who wrote that the Trump administration would be \u201cprepared to declare a national emergency and will use military assets\u201d for a deportation program. Trump shared the post, writing, \u201cTRUE!!!\u201d",
      "Anyone who is born in the U.S. is automatically granted citizenship, a right laid out in the 14th Amendment. Trump wants to change it, a logistically difficult operation that would almost certainly lead to legal battles. In a December interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d moderator Kristen Welker asked Trump whether it was still his plan to end birthright citizenship on day one. Trump said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d",
      "Trump has issued broad pushback to President Joe Biden\u2019s immigration policies, vowing to use his first day in office to \u201cterminate every open-borders policy of the Biden administration.\u201d Trump also said during a New Hampshire campaign event in October that he would \u201cuse Title 42,\u201d a public health law that was implemented toward the start of the Covid-19 crisis and allowed the White House to deport migrants faster. The law was continued partway through the Biden administration but ended in 2023.",
      "Democracy",
      "On numerous occasions, Trump has said he would quickly pardon people convicted for their role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. When NBC News\u2019 Welker asked Trump in December about his timeline for pardons, he said, \u201cI\u2019m looking first day.\u201d He went further in an interview with Time magazine published last month, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll be looking at J6 early on, maybe the first nine minutes.\u201d In a January press conference, Trump was asked if he was looking to pardon Jan. 6 defendants who were charged with violent crimes. Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it,\u201d adding that he intended to make \u201cmajor pardons.\u201d",
      "More than 1,580 defendants have been charged and more than 1,270 convicted in the Jan. 6 investigation, on charges ranging from unlawful parading to seditious conspiracy. There are more than 700 defendants who either received sentences that included no prison time or who have already completed their sentences, meaning Trump could theoretically pardon hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants without much of a practical impact.",
      "Just a handful of Jan. 6 defendants remained detained pretrial at the order of a federal judge, while all other incarcerated Jan. 6 defendants have been sentenced to prison after their conviction, when they either admitted they committed the crimes they were charged with, or when a judge or jury found them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "Foreign policy",
      "One of Trump\u2019s most audacious promises was that he could end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours of taking office \u2014 or even before.",
      "\u201cThat is a war that\u2019s dying to be settled. I will get it settled before I even become president,\u201d Trump said during a September debate with Vice President Kamala Harris in Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cI know [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy very well, and I know [Russian President Vladimir] Putin very well. I have a good relationship and they respect your president, OK, they respect me. They don\u2019t respect Biden,\u201d Trump added.",
      "During remarks to the press at Mar-a-Lago in January, Trump was asked when he plans to meet with Putin to discuss an end to the Ukraine war. Trump said it would be inappropriate to hold the meeting ahead of his Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "Economy",
      "Weeks after his election, Trump promised that he would sign an executive order to implement a 25% tariff on products imported from Mexico and Canada, two of America\u2019s biggest trading partners.",
      "\u201cOn January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,\u201d Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Nov. 25.",
      "Trump had previously proposed 10% tariffs across the board, but his November comments about the two U.S. allies went further. During his campaign, Trump referred to tariffs as \u201cthe most beautiful word in the entire dictionary of words.\u201d",
      "Economists have warned that consumers could bear the brunt of sweeping tariffs, which may lead to higher prices. Companies could respond to tariffs by buying a product in the U.S. rather than from another country, or they may raise prices for consumers to offset the cost of the tariff. Alan Deardorff, an economist at the University of Michigan, had previously told NBC News that Trump\u2019s tariffs \u201care like a sales tax, in the sense that consumers everywhere are going to end up paying.\u201d",
      "In 2021, Biden signed an order setting a nationwide goal aiming for 50% of new cars and trucks sold by 2030 to be zero-emission. In March, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized tailpipe emission limits, and electric vehicles were expected to help meet the goals. California also has a law dictating that all new car sales in the state be zero-emission by 2035.",
      "Trump has painted them all with a broad brush, referring to them as \u201celectric vehicle mandates,\u201d though no one is required to buy a certain car. In November, at a campaign event in Houston, he reiterated his promise, saying, \u201cThe day I take office, I will cancel Crooked Joe\u2019s electric vehicle mandate.\u201d",
      "One of Trump\u2019s most frequent promises, repeated in almost every campaign speech, is the commitment to increase oil drilling in the United States.",
      "In a town hall interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity in December, Trump said he would not be a dictator \"except for day one,\" clarifying that he intends to use that authority to \u201cclose the border\u201d and \u201cdrill, drill, drill\u201d on his first day in office. Trump has routinely claimed increasing U.S. oil production would drastically reduce energy costs.",
      "Last month, incoming Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that he would get to work on this within seconds of arriving in the Oval Office.",
      "Leavitt promised the administration would \u201cexpedite permits for drilling and for fracking all over this country so we can immediately bring down the cost of living.\u201d",
      "In 2023, U.S. energy production exceeded consumption by a record amount, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "Trump said during a rally in September that \u201ca vote for President Trump means the future of the automobile will be made in America.\u201d He forecast that the auto industry would be \u201cfueled by American energy,\u201d \u201csourced by American suppliers\u201d and built by American laborers. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen, and we\u2019ll do it. First day in office.\u201d",
      "In recent years, major auto companies have laid off thousands of workers, though in January, General Motors and Ford Motor reported their best domestic vehicle sales since 2019.",
      "Transgender rights",
      "Trump has repeatedly referred to transgender women as men, vowing to his supporters that he will ensure transgender women cannot compete in women\u2019s sports. In an October speech in West Palm Beach, he said, \u201cI will keep men out of women\u2019s sports, 100%, immediately, first day.\u201d During the same speech, he vowed to sign an executive order on his first day in office to cut federal funding for schools \u201cpushing critical race theory, transgender insanity and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content to our beautiful children.\u201d",
      "Trump has also frequently railed against gender-affirming care, which can include hormone therapy. During the Biden administration, the White House has provided resources and guidance to ensure accessibility and information about the care options. Trump said in a video posted to his campaign website on Feb. 1, 2023, that \u201con day one, I will revoke Joe Biden\u2019s cruel policies on so-called \u2018gender affirming care.\u2019\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Rudy Giuliani was set to be back in court Thursday for a trial to determine ownership of some of his most valuable assets: a Florida condo and New York Yankees World Series rings.",
      "The trial was scheduled to start at 9 a.m. ET, but Giuliani had still not arrived at the courthouse by 10:30 a.m. It was not clear why he was delayed. A spokesperson for Giuliani did not immediately respond to inquiries about the delay.",
      "The former Trump lawyer was scheduled to be the first witness called in federal court in New York, marking the third time he will have\u00a0testified\u00a0under oath\u00a0in the past two weeks.",
      "One of those times was for a contempt hearing before U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman, who's presiding over the Thursday trial. The judge found Giuliani in contempt for not complying with court orders in the case.",
      "He was also found in contempt days later by another federal judge in Washington, D.C. for not complying with the terms of a court ordered agreement in a related case.",
      "In the New York action, attorneys for Ruby Freeman and her daughter Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss \u2014 the former Georgia election workers Giuliani defamed \u2014 want the condo and the rings turned over to help satisfy the $146 million judgment against him.",
      "Giuliani's attorney Joseph Cammarata said in court filings that the Florida home can't be taken because it has protected status under a state law and that the rings no longer belong to Giuliani because he gifted them to his son, Andrew Giuliani, years ago.",
      "Andrew Giuliani has argued in a court filing that the rings are his property.",
      "\"[O]n or before May 26, 2018, Mayor Giuliani gifted to his son, Andrew Giuliani, four New York Yankees World Series rings \u2014 one for each of the Yankees\u2019 titles in 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2000, and each engraved with the name 'Giuliani' \u2014 which had been purchased by Mayor Giuliani after he had finished his second term as New York City Mayor in or around 2002,\" his filing said.",
      "Lawyers for Freeman and Moss are skeptical of Andrew Giuliani's account; they're seeking three of the four rings.",
      "Rudy Giuliani, a Yankees superfan, listed the rings as his property in his bankruptcy case last year, and they were in his possession until at least 2023, the lawyers for Freeman and Moss noted.",
      "While Giuliani was \"a meticulous reporter of gifts to the IRS,\" he never noted the gift on his tax returns, they added.",
      "At his deposition last month, Giuliani testified that he had given the rings to his son but forgot that he had done so. \u201cI remember talking about the rings and him telling me\u2014and reminding me that I gave them to him,\u201d Giuliani said, according to the filing.",
      "Andrew Giuliani said he reminded his father and his father's bankruptcy attorney that the rings belonged to him last January. But his father was still claiming them as his assets a month later, according to the filing by Freeman and Moss.",
      "The attorneys also noted that Andrew Giuliani acknowledged that his father didn't physically give him the rings until sometime in 2023 \u2014 about five years after they were allegedly gifted, while Giuliani was facing numerous lawsuits, including Freeman and Moss\u2019.",
      "\"Even if it were disputed, Defendant\u2019s\u00a0possession is well-documented. Defendant has been photographed throughout this time period wearing the World Series Rings,\" their filing said.",
      "Giuliani was found liable for defaming Freeman and Moss by repeatedly accusing them \u2014 falsely \u2014 of committing election fraud in 2020. A jury awarded them\u00a0$148 million in damages in December 2023. A judge later reduced the award to $146 million.",
      "Giuliani is appealing that verdict, but Freeman and Moss have moved to seize his assets while the case is litigated. He has already been ordered to turn over cash, his car, his multimillion-dollar New York apartment and other sports memorabilia.",
      "Giuliani contends that Freeman and Moss aren\u2019t entitled to his Florida home, which he said he made his permanent residence last January.",
      "Freeman and Moss' lawyers are skeptical of that, as well. They noted that Giuliani listed his New York apartment as his primary residence in a bankruptcy filing in March and that in August he applied for a bank account at a New Hampshire credit union, checking a box that said: \u201clive or work in NH.\u201d",
      "They contend Giuliani was using the Florida condo the way he had for years \u2014 as a winter home \u2014 until Freeman and Moss slapped a lien on the property on Aug. 8.",
      "\"Mr. Giuliani\u2019s own evidence in this case shows that he spent approximately the same amount of time at the Palm Beach Condo in the first half of 2024 as in prior years: approximately four months,\" their filing said.",
      "Cammarata has countered that Giuliani obtained \"a homestead tax exemption from the Palm Beach County Tax Assessor\" last year and also registered to vote and got a driver's license in Florida.",
      "\"Under Florida law and the Florida Constitution, there is no mandatory number of days that Defendant had to actually sleep in his Florida Condominium Unit,\" he wrote.",
      "The non-jury trial before Liman is expected to take one or two days, with closing arguments scheduled for Tuesday."

    "story": [
      "Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee urged Attorney General Merrick Garland to release the rest of special counsel Jack Smith's report on President-elect Donald Trump's handling of classified documents even if it means dismissing charges against his co-defendants.",
      "Democrats on the panel, led by ranking member Jamie Raskin, of Maryland, said in a letter to Garland that Americans have a \"right to know\" how the second part of Smith's report details the charges against Trump: that he willfully retained national defense information after he left office and then conspired with two aides at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to obstruct officials from retrieving the records.",
      "\"As Attorney General, it is incumbent upon you to take all necessary steps to ensure the report is released before the end of your tenure, including, if necessary, by simply dismissing the remaining criminal charges against Mr. Trump\u2019s co-conspirators, Waltine Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira,\" they wrote in the letter released Thursday.",
      "Garland has said he wouldn\u2019t make the second volume of Smith\u2019s report, focused on the classified documents case, public while the charges against Nauta and De Oliveira are still being prosecuted.",

      "The Justice Department declined to comment Thursday on the letter.",

    "summary": "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has informed Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, he will no longer be chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, according to a GOP leadership source and a Republican lawmaker familiar with the matter.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has informed Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, that he will no longer be chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, according to a GOP leadership source and a Republican lawmaker familiar with the matter.",
      "The lawmaker said Turner told him Wednesday that he would not be staying on as head of the critical panel that conducts oversight of the U.S. intelligence community. The House Intelligence Committee chair is also a member of the so-called \"Gang of Eight\" congressional leaders who receive some of the most sensitive, classified briefings from the intelligence community.",
      "Johnson confirmed the news later Wednesday but downplayed the change as he offered praise for Turner.",
      "\"It's a new Congress. We just need fresh horses in some of these places. But I'm a Mike Turner fan,\" Johnson told reporters in the Capitol. \"He's done a great job. He performed valiantly in a difficult time under difficult circumstances. So I have nothing but positive things to say about my friend and colleague.\"",
      "\"This is not a President Trump decision; this is a House decision,\" the speaker added, referring to speculation that politics may have led to the change. \"And this is no slight whatsoever to our ... outgoing chairman.\"",
      "The top post on the Intelligence Committee is one of the few positions directly chosen by the speaker of the House at the start of a new Congress. Johnson said he would make an announcement about Turner\u2019s replacement on Thursday.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, Turner, a staunch NATO supporter who has aggressively pushed for U.S. aid for Ukraine, said he was \"proud\" of his time serving on and leading the committee. His office said Turner would only be serving on the Armed Services and Oversight and Government Reform committees in the new Congress, meaning he will no longer have a seat on the Intelligence panel.",
      "\u201cUnder my leadership, we restored the integrity of the Committee and returned its mission to its core focus of national security. The threat from our adversaries is real and requires serious deliberations,\" Turner said.",
      "\u201cAs a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, I have been and will continue to be a strong advocate for the military and our national defense,\" he continued. \"My work to expand missions and capabilities at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base continues. Furthermore, I look forward to welcoming the NATO Parliamentary Assembly to Dayton in the coming months.\u201d",
      "House Republican sources said they did not know who Johnson would choose to replace Turner. Some senior Republicans on the panel are Reps. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, Trent Kelly of Mississippi, and Darin LaHood of Illinois.",
      "Last year, Johnson raised eyebrows in the intelligence community and around Capitol Hill when he appointed two Donald Trump loyalists, Reps. Scott Perry, R-Pa., and Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, to the Intelligence Committee.",
      "The decision to replace Turner stunned lawmakers in both parties given that Turner, a defense hawk, is well-respected on both sides of the aisle. A former mayor of Dayton, Turner belongs to the GOP's Main Street Caucus, which describes its members as \"pragmatic.\" Other lawmakers in the caucus said they were frustrated by Johnson's decision to oust one of their own.",
      "One member said the move erodes trust and could complicate Republicans' ability to pass Trump's 2025 agenda given the their paper-thin majority.",
      "\"A bunch of Main Street Republicans are disappointed,\" said the member, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly. \"This hurts us in the reconciliation process too. Looks like backroom politics and backstabbing.\"",
      "Then-House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., had tapped Turner to serve as the top Republican on the panel starting in January 2022 after the lawmaker who had that job, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, resigned to lead Trump Media & Technology Group. After Republicans took back the majority that fall, McCarthy kept him on as chairman of the Intelligence committee for the 118th\u00a0Congress, a term that started January 2023.",
      "When McCarthy was ousted and Johnson succeeded him as speaker in October 2023, Johnson decided to keep Turner in place as Intelligence chairman.",
      "Now, after winning his first full term as speaker earlier this month, Johnson appears to be putting his own mark on this position and others. On Tuesday, Johnson appointed Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., the former Education and Workforce Committee chair, as the new Rules Committee chair. And Johnson is keeping Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., in the role of Administration Committee chair.",
      "Democrats on the Intelligence Committee said they did not get any warning that Turner was being removed.",
      "\"I'm enormously concerned because I think you'd be hard-pressed to find somebody as fair-minded,\" said Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the Intelligence panel.",
      "He added that Turner \"and I had our disagreements, but, you know, I had confidence in him.\"",
      "With Trump days away from returning to the White House, Democrats have been sounding the alarm that top intelligence and national security posts are being influenced by presidential politics.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Senate Democrats pressed former Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, Trump's pick to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, asking him if he would push back against efforts requiring CIA employees to demonstrate \"loyalty to a political figure above loyalty to country.\u201d",
      "Ratcliffe, a former House Intelligence Committee member who served as Trump's director of national intelligence, responded that he would not impose a political litmus test on his employees.",
      "\u201cIf you look at my record and my record as DNI, that never took place. That is never something anyone alleged,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I would never do.\u201d"

      "Men in 1992 had a 1.6 higher risk than women of being diagnosed with cancer. But as of 2021, the risk was almost equal, according to a report published Thursday by the American Cancer Society.",
      "The report highlights that the cancer burden is shifting from men to women in the United States \u2014 narrowing the gap between the sexes \u2014 as well as from older to younger adults.",
      "For the first time, cancer rates in women ages 50 to 64 have surpassed those in men, the report found. Women under age 50 also had an 82% higher cancer rate in 2021 than men the same age, compared with a 51% higher rate in 2002. The trend may be in part because of rising rates of breast and thyroid cancer in younger women, along with declining rates of melanoma, non\u2010Hodgkin lymphoma and prostate cancer in men under 50 over the roughly 20-year period.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line: We\u2019ve got more cancers overall, particularly those in younger people, and particularly those in women,\u201d said Dr. Arif Kamal, chief patient officer at the American Cancer Society.",
      "\u201cTen years ago, men were 50% more likely to get cancer than today,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, it\u2019s almost close to even, and that\u2019s a combination of two things: less cancers in men but, importantly, more cancers in women.\u201d",
      "The report also found that although cases of lung cancer declined overall from 2012 to 2021, the decrease was slower in women \u2014 most likely because women were slower to take up heavy smoking and slower to quit, said Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer for the American Cancer Society.",
      "\u201cFor the first time, if you\u2019re a woman under the age of 65 you have a greater chance of developing lung cancer than a man,\u201d Dahut said on a call with reporters.",
      "Overall, the report predicts that 2,041,910 cancer cases will be diagnosed this year, slightly more than last year\u2019s prediction.",
      "More cancer cases doesn\u2019t mean more deaths, however: The mortality rate from cancer fell 34% from 1991 to 2022, the report says. It attributes the positive news to earlier detection of some cancers, better treatment options and decreases in smoking.",
      "Dr. Neil Iyengar, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said part of the reason is immunotherapy treatments \u2014 an approach that uses a person\u2019s immune system to fight disease. Genetic sequencing has also helped doctors better match patients with the appropriate treatments, he said. And new antibody drugs have helped increase the effectiveness of chemo while reducing side effects.",
      "As for why the cancer burden has shifted more to women and younger people, it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint one particular cause, said Dr. Jennifer Litton, vice president of clinical research at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.",
      "\u201cIf anyone says, \u2018I know it\u2019s because of X, Y or Z,\u2019 it\u2019s really hard to tease that out from this big swath of data,\u201d said Litton, who wasn\u2019t involved in the report.",
      "Several doctors suggested the trend might have to do with lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption, lack of exercise and diets high in ultra-processed foods, all of which increase cancer risk.",
      "\u201cTen years ago, we thought that cancer was the product of either bad genetics or bad luck. And now we know that about half of cancers are the product of lifestyle,\u201d Kamal said. \u201cThere are 13 different cancers associated with being overweight. There are seven different cancers associated with alcohol intake.\u201d",
      "Iyengar said obesity \u201cis now the major cancer risk factor of our time.\u201d According to the American Cancer Society, excess body weight causes about twice as many cancer cases in women as in men. Younger women in particular have recorded a rise in endometrial cancer, which is strongly linked to obesity.",
      "\u201cObesity-related cancers are showing up more in people now who are 40s and 50s versus their parents who are 60s and 70s,\u201d Kamal said. \u201cWe know that, generationally, people who are in their 60s and 70s grew up being a bit more active, grew up not eating ultra-processed foods as much.\u201d",
      "Another potential explanation, doctors said, could be exposure to cancer-causing substances in the environment, such as radon and air pollution. Radon \u2014 a radioactive gas found in some homes, particularly in the Midwest \u2014 is the leading cause of lung cancer in people who have never smoked.",
      "\u201cProbably what we\u2019re seeing here is the shift in environmental exposures is catching up with the cancer statistics,\u201d Iyengar said.",
      "Doctors emphasized that lots can be done to prevent new cancer cases, however.",
      "\u201cThe average person knows the importance of healthy eating and active lifestyle to reduce heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease and high blood pressure. Now we really need to be talking about the clear connection between those behaviors and cancer,\u201d Kamal said."

    "story": [
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2014\u00a0Blue Origin\u00a0launched its massive new rocket on its first test flight Thursday, sending up a prototype satellite to orbit thousands of miles above Earth.",
      "Named after the\u00a0first American to orbit Earth, the New Glenn rocket blasted off from Florida, soaring from the same pad used to launch NASA\u2019s Mariner and Pioneer spacecraft a half-century ago.",
      "Years in the making with heavy funding by\u00a0Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the 320-foot (98-meter) rocket carried an an experimental platform designed to host satellites or release them into their proper orbits.",
      "All seven main engines fired at liftoff as the rocket blazed through the predawn sky to the delight of spectators lining nearby beaches. Bezos took part in the action from Mission Control and Blue Origin employees erupted in cheers once the craft successfully reached orbit 13 minutes later, a feat that drew praise from SpaceX\u2019s Elon Musk.",
      "The first-stage booster missed its landing on a barge in the Atlantic, but the company stressed that the more important goal was achieved. Bezos said before the flight it was \u201ca little crazy\u201d to even try to land the booster on the first try.",
      "\u201cWe did it!\u201d Blue Origin\u2019s CEO Dave Limp said via X about reaching orbit. \u201cOn to spring and trying again on the landing.\u201d",
      "For this test, the satellite was meant to remain inside the second stage while circling Earth. Plans called for the second stage to be placed in a safe condition to stay in a high, out-of-the-way orbit in accordance with NASA\u2019s practices for minimizing space junk.",
      "New Glenn was supposed to fly before dawn Monday, but ice buildup in critical plumbing caused a delay. The rocket is built to haul spacecraft and eventually\u00a0astronauts to orbit\u00a0and also the moon.",
      "Founded 25 years ago by Bezos, Blue Origin has been\u00a0launching paying passengers\u00a0to the edge of space since 2021, including himself. The short hops from Texas use smaller rockets named after the first American in space, Alan Shepard. New Glenn, which honors John Glenn, is five times taller.",
      "Blue Origin poured more than $1 billion into New Glenn\u2019s launch site, rebuilding historic Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The pad is 9 miles (14 kilometers) from the company\u2019s control centers and rocket factory, outside the gates of NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center.",
      "Blue Origin envisions six to eight New Glenn flights this year, with the next one coming up this spring.",
      "In a weekend interview, Bezos declined to disclose his personal investment in the program. He said he does not see Blue Origin in a competition with Musk\u2019s SpaceX, long the rocket-launching dominator.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s room for lots of winners\u201d Bezos said, adding that this was the \u201cvery, very beginning of this new phase of the space age, where we\u2019re all going to work together as an industry ... to lower the cost of access to space.\u201d",
      "New Glenn is the latest in a series of big, new rockets to launch in recent years, including United Launch Alliance\u2019s Vulcan, Europe\u2019s upgraded Ariane 6 and NASA\u2019s Space Launch System or SLS, the space agency\u2019s successor to the Saturn V for sending astronauts to the moon.",
      "The biggest rocket of all, at approximately 400 feet (123 meters), is SpaceX\u2019s Starship. Musk said the seventh test flight of the full rocket could occur later Thursday from Texas. He hopes to repeat what he pulled off in October, catching the returning booster at the launch pad with giant mechanical arms.",
      "Starship is what NASA plans to use to land astronauts on the moon later this decade. The first two moon landings under the space agency\u2019s Artemis program, which follows the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s, will see crews descending from lunar orbit to the surface in Starships.",
      "Blue Origin\u2019s lander, dubbed Blue Moon, will make its debut on the third lunar touchdown by astronauts.",
      "NASA Administrator Bill Nelson pushed for competing moon landers similar to the strategy to hire two companies to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Nelson will step down when President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Monday.",
      "Trump has tapped tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to run NASA. Isaacman, who has twice rocketed into orbit on his own privately financed SpaceX flights, must be approved by the Senate.",
      "New Glenn\u2019s debut was supposed to send twin spacecraft to Mars for NASA. But the space agency pulled them from last October\u2019s planned flight when it became clear the rocket wouldn\u2019t be ready in time. They will still fly on a New Glenn rocket, but not until spring at the earliest. The two small spacecraft, named Escapade, are meant to study the Martian atmosphere and magnetic environment while orbiting the red planet."

      "Houston Mayor John Whitmire, Harris County District Attorney Sean Teare and Houston Police Chief J. Noe Diaz announced new steps Friday to dispose of drugs and other evidence kept at police headquarters downtown, some of which has been sitting there for decades, attracting rodents, even though cases they are linked to have long been adjudicated.",
      "About 1.2 million pieces of evidence are kept in the evidence room downtown and at a second location, a property warehouse, including hundreds of thousands of pounds of drugs, officials said.",
      "\u201cWe got 400,000 pounds of marijuana in storage,\u201d Whitmire said. \u201cThe rats are the only ones enjoying it.\u201d",
      "Teare said Friday that drug evidence collected before 2015 that is no longer needed for cases will be destroyed. An old rule did not allow destroying drugs unless cases predated 2005.",
      "His office will use its funds to dispose the drugs, Teare said.",
      "A new position has been created in his office, filled by a senior attorney, who will work with law enforcement to help destroy evidence held at the two locations upon the immediate completion of a case, Teare and police spokesperson Jodi Silva said.",
      "Prosecutors sent notifications this week to defense attorneys representing subjects in 3,600 open cases involving drug evidence, explaining that rats have been eating drugs held in the downtown evidence room, Rafael Lemaitre, a spokesperson for the district attorney\u2019s office, said Wednesday.",
      "He said that of the open cases, only one has evidence deemed compromised by rodents.",
      "Asked whether the rodent problem in the downtown evidence room could compromise convictions, Lemaitre declined to answer, saying he's not an attorney.",
      "Peter Stout, president and CEO of Houston Forensic Science Center, said at the media briefing that evidence held in storage rooms attracts rodents and critters of all types. It is a nationwide issue, Stout said.",
      "\u201cThis is a problem for property rooms everywhere in the country \u2014 rodents, bugs, fungus, all kinds of things love drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is difficult getting these rodents out of there. I mean, think about it. They\u2019re drug-addicted rats. They\u2019re tough to deal with.\u201d",

      "For students across New York, the upcoming Year of the Snake will start off with a bit more of a bang.",
      "Public schools across the state will be celebrating the Lunar New Year on Jan. 29 as an official holiday for the first time. This also makes New York the first state to mandate school closures for the occasion. Last year, the state holiday\u2019s inception fell on a Saturday, and students weren\u2019t given an additional day off.",
      "New York Assemblymember Grace Lee, who led efforts to pass a bill that resulted in the change, told NBC News that the holiday is an opportunity for students of all backgrounds to reflect and learn about Asian traditions.",
      "\u201cRecognizing Lunar New Year as a statewide holiday is sending a message to Asian Americans, and to all New Yorkers, that Asian Americans are New Yorkers, and that we belong here,\u201d Lee, who\u2019s also chair of the Assembly\u2019s Asian Pacific American Task Force, said. \u201cI think it\u2019s also a recognition for the many contributions that Asian Americans have made to New York\u2019s history in the nearly 200 years since we\u2019ve been here.\u201d",
      "Gov. Kathy Hochul signed legislation in September 2023 putting the mandate into effect. The Lunar New Year \u2014 which includes Chinese New Year, Seollal in Korea, Tet in Vietnam and more \u2014 begins at the end of the month and kicks off more than two weeks of festivities. Celebrated by Chinese diasporas and other East Asian populations as well as the Vietnamese, the occasion is also largely considered the most important holiday of the year for these cultures.",
      "New York has long been home to a significant Asian American population, who are currently the fastest-growing racial demographic in the state. About 10% of students are Asian American, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, according to public school enrollment data from the 2023-24 school year. That figure jumps to 18.7% when looking at New York City schools, where the racial group outnumbers white students.",
      "While schools citywide began recognizing the holiday roughly seven years ago, Lee, who was elected to the Assembly in 2022, says it\u2019s taken more Asian Americans in state leadership for the \u201cpush that it needed\u201d to make changes across New York.",
      "\u201cI came into the state Legislature at a historic moment for New York,\u201d Lee, whose district includes Chinatown, said. \u201cWe had a record number of Asian American legislators in both the State Assembly and the State Senate, and I think that representation really matters.\u201d"

      "\"Father God, give Rachael and I strength to mend our broken hearts. Give us a peace about this decision to end our relationship that transcends worldly understanding,\" he captioned the post. \"Shower our friends and family with kindness and love to comfort us. And remind us that our Joy comes from you, Lord \ud83d\udc94.\"",

      "James added that he ended their relationship so Kirkconnell could work on herself. Meanwhile, she said she felt blindsided.",
      "\u201cI thought about how strong I thought our relationship was, so for him to end things, he must have been very, very hurt by everything,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was hard because I lost the love of my life and in the process of doing that, I hurt him. \u2026 I love him so much and I always will.\u201d",

      "In February 2024, James talked to People about getting engaged to Kirkconnell in the future.",

    "story": [
      "As a girl, Aaliyah dreamed of musical stardom \u2014 and used her Barbie dolls to act them out.",
      "\u201cThe dolls would be singing and they\u2019d be performing. Sometimes I\u2019d try to get in on it,\u201d Rashad Haughton, the late singer\u2019s brother and a writer and director, tells TODAY.com.",
      "Aaliyah's childhood fantasies turned into reality as she grew up and became one of the most celebrated R&B artists of the \u201890. Sadly, the singer, whose full name was Aaliyah Haughton, passed away at the age of 22 in 2001 following a plane crash.",
      "Nearly 24 years after Aaliyah\u2019s death, the singer is being honored with a Barbie doll in her likeness.",
      "Part of the Barbie Music Collector Series, the doll is being released on the singer\u2019s birthday, Jan. 16. and will be available to purchase on the Mattel Shop for a suggested retail price of $55. (As of Jan. 16 at 9:34 a.m., the doll is sold out).",
      "Haughton worked closely with Mattel to design a doll that would resemble his sister and capture her style. The end result? A striking doll that rocks a miniature replica of the outfit Aaliyah wore in the music video for her hit song \u201cOne in a Million.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis was the second album and \u2018One in a Million\u2019 was such a key song in transitioning her sound to maturity, empowerment, confidence at that point in her career,\u201d Haughton says.",
      "Haughton and Mattel worked together to design the doll\u2019s outfit, which consists of a faux leather black top and matching pants with lace-up details, a zippered vest with detached sleeves and cool sunglasses. The Mattel team also enlisted the insight of Aaliyah\u2019s stylist Derek Lee.",
      "Haughton was \u201cblown away\u201d when he saw the final product and thinks his sister would approve of the edgy ensemble since her favorite color was \u201call black.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still tight fitting, it\u2019s still a little bit sexy. But it\u2019s pants so it brings that power and that confidence and expression. It really just checked all the boxes of what my sister represents and also what Barbie represents, which is empowerment and expression,\u201d he explains.",
      "Best known for the musical style she called \u201cstreet but sweet\u201d and hits like \u201cTry Again,\u201d Aaliyah earned a host of awards throughout her career, including three American Music Awards for favorite soul/R&B female artist and two MTV Video Music Awards. She also collaborated with top musicians, including Missy Elliot and Timbaland.",
      "Haughton regularly worked as a creative consultant for the singer. Following an Aaliyah makeup collection with M.A.C. in 2018, the singer\u2019s Barbie doll is the latest brand collaboration Haughton has spearheaded to ensure that his sister\u2019s legacy lives on.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like that job that I had with her is still continuing. And obviously it\u2019s emotional at times, but it\u2019s also wonderful because there\u2019s a lot of meaning in that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt brings back memories and it continues on dreams that we had when she was here. In a lot of ways, it makes me feel like things are continuing on as they should, and those dreams are still valuable and they\u2019re still real.\u201d",
      "Haughton calls the collaboration with Mattel \u201ca dream come true\u201d for himself and Aaliyah.",
      "\u201cIt was something that I always wanted because I know it was something that was my sister\u2019s dream,\u201d he says.",
      "With her new doll, Aaliyah joins other legendary musicians who have been part of the Barbie Music Collector Series, including Gloria Estevan, David Bowie, Elvis Presley, Elton John and Stevie Nicks.",
      "\u201cTo have my sister part of that list, it really is a testament to her legacy, and I\u2019m elated to have this doll come out. It\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d Haughton says.",
      "When asked how he wants people to remember Aaliyah, Haughton shares a quote his sister once gave during an appearance on MTV.",
      "\u201cWhat she said was, \u2018I want people to remember me as a true entertainer\u2019 because she really, truly loved what she did every single day. As hard as the work was and as challenging it was, I think it\u2019s not work when you love what you do,\u201d he says.",
      "Noting that Aaliyah was always \u201cappreciative\u201d of her success, Haughton recalls how those dreams started in her childhood bedroom while playing with her Barbie dolls.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s (about) imagination and taking that imagination and dreaming about what you want to be, then taking those steps from childhood to the future and making it real. My sister did that. Every little girl can do that too. That\u2019s the message that I want people to take from this collaboration.\""

      "Basgiath War College: The school that every Navarrian officer goes through. Each student chooses to enter one of four quadrants: Healers, Scribes, Infantry or Riders, the quadrant with the highest death rate. Near Basgiath are the dragon hatching grounds known as the Vale. Basgiath is where the original dragon riders, known as the First Six, wove the wards of Navarre, which protect the borders.",

Navarre's wards that originate near Basgiath do not reach Tyrrendor. Aretia was the capital before the Tyrrish Rebellion.",

Once bonded, they have a channel of communication within their Riders mind, and the dragon's power manifests in a Rider in the form of a signet.",

She's a lightning wielder.",
      "Xaden Riorson: The main love interest of Violet and son of Tyrrish Rebellion leader, Fen Riorson. Xaden begins as an enemy since Violet's mother executed Xaden's father.

Xaden and Violet have had a tumultuous relationship so far, with plenty of secrets. Xaden is leading another revolution and has two signets: shadow-summoning and is an inntinnsic (meaning he can read minds). He is bonded to Sgaeyl, who is mated to Tairn, giving Xaden and Violet a path to mind speak to one another.",

      "Andarna: She is an unknown breed of dragon and the second bonded dragon to Violet. When she was a baby dragon (known as a feathertail) she was able to stop time for brief moments. However, the power faded with age. Currently, she can change the color of her scales, but her development from a child into an adolescent was altered. By the end of \"Iron Flame,\" her personality is akin to that of a teenager: moody, keen on not being left out and searching for independence.",
      "Sgaeyl: She's a blue daggertail dragon, mated to Tairn and bonded to Xaden.",
      "Dain Aetos: Violet's childhood best friend, although they've grown slightly apart as adults. The pair had a brief romantic moment; however, it did not last.

      "Jesinia Neilwart: Curator of the Scribe Quadrant at Basgiath and Violet's friend. Jesinia speaks many languages.",

      "Violet struggles to survive each day at Basgiath War College, facing threats from fellow cadet Jack Barlowe, who views her as weak. But she uses her book smarts to make it through physical fights and training.",
      "One night, she overhears Xaden holding a secret meeting with all the rebellion children. Basgiath has a rule that no more than three marked ones can meet at once, so this meeting is a capital offense. Violet is caught by Xaden, but she promises to keep the meeting a secret.",
      "She ends up excelling at Threshing, bonding with not only one, but two dragons: Andarna, who is thought to be a golden feathertail, and Tairn, an extremely powerful black dragon.",
      "Violet and Dain kiss after Threshing, although Violet doesn't think it feels right. Afterwards, the pair maintain a friendship.",
      "Bonding with Tairn immediately links her to Xaden, as Tairn is mated to Xaden's dragon, Sgaeyl, giving them the power to mind speak to each other.",
      "Despite being mortal enemies, Xaden ends up training Violet. A rider will die if their dragon dies, and occasionally, a dragon can't recover after their rider's death. Tairn and Sgaeyl's mating bond also means they cannot be apart from each other for long, and if one dies, so does the other. Because of their mated dragons, Xaden now needs to keep Violet alive to keep himself alive.",
      "Xaden assigns Liam to be Violet's shadow and security guard. Although Violet initially hates this, she and Liam grow a close friendship.",
      "Xaden also trains her, and in the process, they get to know each other better, sparking attraction.",

      "What happens at the end of 'Fourth Wing'?",
      "In the books climactic ending, Dain betrays Violet.",
      "Throughout the book, Dain regularly touches her face in times of worry. It's revealed that secretly, he'd been using his signet to read her thoughts, and he saw the secret, illegal meeting Xaden held. Dain reported it.",
      "When the War Games, an end of year test of a squad's abilities, comes around, Dain's dad, Colonel Aetos, assigns Xaden and Violet's squad to go to Aethebyne,\u00a0located beyond the wards' safety.",
      "When they get there, Violet learns that Xaden has been secretly assisting gryphon riders from Poromiel, supplying them with weapons. It turns out, the reason they've been attacking Navarrian outposts is because they are under attack from venin, creatures Violet previously believed were only myth, and needed supplies.",
      "Learning that venin exist and that the gryphon fliers aren't the true enemy, Violet is forced to question her complacency and her mother's role in spreading propaganda.",
      "The squad then realizes that Colonel Aetos sent them into a trap. Instead of a War Games exercise, they are forced into real battle against four venin while trying to defend a nearby village.",
      "Working in tandem with the gryphon riders, they fight the venin and win the battle, but at deadly costs. Liam's dragon is killed, which kills Liam as well. Violet holds him as he dies and promises she will protect his younger sister, Sloane.",
      "During the battle, Violet takes out the final venin with a bolt of lightning, but before it dies, it stabs her with a poisoned blade. Xaden flies a semi-unconscious Violet to his secret hideout in Aretia.",
      "Violet is mended and eventually wakes up furious at Xaden for his deception. Still, Violet agrees to join the revolution and keep it a secret, but she tells Xaden she can't trust him with her heart.",
      "The novel ends with one more secret Xaden was hiding: Violet's dead brother, Brennan, is very much alive, and he was the one who mended Violet.",
      "\"Welcome to the revolution, Violet,\" is the last line of the book, spoken by Brennan, as he smiles at his shocked sister.",
      "What happens in 'Iron Flame'?",
      "\"Iron Flame\" begins where the first book ended, but Violet's inner turmoil is at an all-time high as she comes to terms with fables being real, mourns the loss of Liam, battles conflicting emotions regarding Brennan being alive and misses Xaden, despite not wanting to.",
      "After they return to Basgiath, Xaden graduates and is immediately stationed at Samara. However, because Tairn and Sgaeyl are mated and need to see each other consistently, Violet and Xaden are given leave once a week to see each other.",
      "Xaden promises to help Violet build her mental shields so she can protect her mind from Dain and others with similar signets. As for their relationship, they still struggle with trust. With Xaden becoming the revolution's leader, he needs to keep some secrets, but Violet requests full disclosure if he wants to be together. They remain at an impasse for a while.",
      "Meanwhile, the other marked ones continue to smuggle weapons out of Basgiath to gryphon fliers. Violet, now a second-year, embarks on a research journey in the Archives, with the help of Jesinia, to figure out how Basgiath wards work so she can set up wards around Aretia.",
      "New characters are introduced, including first years Aaric and Sloane, who Violet promised to protect, as well as new villains, like Major Varrish, who is known for his harsh torture techniques and harbors a hatred for Violet.",
      "As Violet continues to search for accounts from the First Six on how the wards were created, Jack Barlowe returns to Basgiath. It turns out, Violet didn't kill him in the first book, and he's been going through an extensive mending process.",
      "With the help of her friends, Violet figures out that the journals of the First Six are most likely in King Tauri's private vault, but they'll need someone from his bloodline to get in, so they rope Aaric into their plan.",
      "But before they can enact it, infantry cadets try to kill Violet. Surprisingly, Jack saves her, though it doesn't change her distrust of him.",
      "Violet and Xaden eventually break into the Archives for the journals and take two. However, Nolan, a healer who Violet has always trusted, deceives and drugs her. Varrish arrives, taking one of the journals with him.",
      "Violet is subjected to torture from Varrish, but she holds strong. In a final act to break her, Varrish calls in Dain and commands him read Violet's memories, which he does. After seeing the truth, Dain frees Violet just as Xaden and Garrick arrive. Xaden and Violet then kill Varrish together.",
      "Xaden uses the chaos of Basgiath to his advantage, addressing all the cadets and telling them the truth of what's happening beyond the wards. He gives them the option to stay at Basgiath and defend Navarre, or, come with him to fight for the whole Continent. Nearly half the quadrant decides to join.",
      "The group continues holding classes for the riders at Aretia as Violet tries to translate the journals and get the wards up and running. Soon, she thinks she's discovered the solution: blood magic.",
      "After her first attempt fails, Violet goes in search of a luminary. She visits Poromiel's leader, Viscount Tecarus, and learns that Xaden was offered a luminary in exchange for herself, a deal he refused.  After having to fight off another venin and agreeing to train gryphon fliers in Aretia, Xaden and Violet secure the luminary.",
      "Back at Aretia, Violet, Xaden and his ex-fianc\u00e9e, a gryphon flier named Cat, spar over their twisted romantic pasts. Xaden reveals he is technically heir to Tyrrendor, reassuring Violet that he and Cat were only ever together for a political alliances.",
      "But just as the pair starts to piece their relationship back together, it crumbles once more when Violet realizes that Xaden has a secret second signet, since Sgaeyl bonded Xaden and his grandfather before him.",
      "Violet demands he tell her what it is. He reveals he's inntinnsic, meaning he can read minds. Manifesting as an inntinnsic typically results in death in Navarre.",
      "How does 'Iron Flame' end?",
      "General Melgren, General Lilith Sorrengail and some other members of leadership request a meeting with Violet, Xaden and Mira.",
      "Melgren tells them that he's seen an upcoming battle, claiming the venin will attack Samara and win. He asks them to help in the battle, but Brennan reveals himself, telling them no.",
      "Violet then realizes that the real battle won't be at Samara, but at Basgiath. Violet convinces Xaden that they have to fight for Basgiath, but Brennan refuses.",
      "Violet and Xaden give the cadets and gryphon fliers the choice to fight or not, and most decide to join.",
      "When they arrive, Violet and Xaden rush to the wardstone, passing dead guards, to find Jack and his dragon within the chamber. It turns out, Jack survived Violet dropping a mountain on him because he turned venin. Jack kills his own dragon, which cracks the wardstone in half, knocking down the college's wards.",
      "Xaden knocks Jack out before he can draw power from the ground.",
      "They begin to assemble their forces, as Brennan arrives with more riders and fliers. Brennan tries to mend the wardstone as the battle above begins.",
      "One of the venin reveals that their goal is to take Violet alive. Violet kills the venin and runs to Jesinia, who has been continuously transcribing one of the First Six's journals amidst the battle. Jesinia reveals that Andarna is the secret to activating the wardstone. Andarna turns out to be a dragon breed of her own and waited for Violet \u2014\u00a0a period of 650 years \u2014\u00a0before hatching.",
      "Now, Violet has a solution to their ongoing battle. But a dragon can only power one wardstone, meaning Violet and Xaden have to decide to protect either Basgiath or Aretia.",
      "Xaden tells her to go ahead and ward Basgiath. But first, the wardstone has to be imbued with a rider's power, which typically takes weeks to do safely.",
      "Violet decides to sacrifice herself, pouring all of her power into the wardstone knowing she will die from it. Just before Violet burns out, her mother kicks her aside and forces Sloane to siphon all of her power into the stone. Lilith and her dragon die in an act of sacrifice for her children, and the wards at Basgiath are restored.",
      "The wyvern fall with the wards back up, but a bigger threat looms. It's revealed that while Violet was sacrificing herself, Xaden was taking on a venin general \u2014\u00a0and losing. When Xaden felt Violet dying for him, he channeled power from the Earth so he could save her, turning venin in the process.",
      "Now, in the aftermath of the battle, he reveals his new venin status to Violet, and she looks on in horror.",
      "The final pages of \"Iron Flame\" are from Xaden's perspective. Xaden seeks out Jack for help finding a cure to being venin. Jack responds that there is no cure, saying Xaden will \"only hunger for more\" power.",
      "\"All this time, you've been convincing everyone you're the hero, and now you'll be the villain... especially in her story,\" Jack says. \"Welcome to our f---ed-up family. Guess we're brothers now.\""

      "\"And when I say, 'hang out with all the boys' that is simply 1970s black slang for black guys hanging-out together for sports, gambling or whatever.

      "Willis added that \"Y.M.C.A.\" had \"benefited greatly\" from Trump's use at his rallies, noting that the song finally reached the No. 1 spot on the Billboard dance/electronic chart and was now generating \"millions\" of dollars in sales.",
      "\"The true anthem is Y.M.C.A.\u2019s appeal to people of all strips (sic) including President Elect Trump,\" he concluded."

      "Cosby tells TODAY.com that she's a \"helicopter mom\" who wants to \"protect my son at all costs,\" so it was a challenging decision to be so public about the conversation. But the response has both motivated Robert Jr. to continue his recovery and made her feel confident the scene had a powerful impact.",
      "Before the scene aired, Cosby says she was contacted by tabloids threatening to publish that Robert Jr. was in rehab. \"I was like, well, I'm just going to let this air, and then they can all just be quiet,\" she says. \"It really worked.\"",

I was in the moment ... and it shocked me, and it hurt me. It just made me feel like, 'Oh my god. How did I miss the cues?'\"",
      "\"It wasn't planned,\" she continues. \"What came out of him was real, and what came out of me was real. And I think that's why it went across so good, because we weren't doing it for any sole reason. We were doing it because that's our relationship.\""

    "summary": "YouTubers Myka Stauffer and her husband James Stauffer gave up custody of their adopted 4-year-old son in 2020. A new documentary explores the controversy.",
    "story": [
      "YouTubers Myka Stauffer\u00a0and James Stauffer ignited a firestorm of controversy when they gave up custody of their adopted 4-year-old son with special needs in 2020. Now a new HBO documentary series, \"An Update on our Family,\" revisits the Stauffers' story.",
      "The limited three-part series, which will premiere on HBO on Wednesday, Jan. 15, uses the Stauffer controversy to explore wider issues about what happens when parents decide to make their private family lives public.",
      "But why are the Stauffers' decisions so controversial? Take a look at how the family rose to social media stardom ... and then enraged their followers.",
      "Who is Myka Stauffer and her husband James?",
      "Myka Stauffer had a parenting and lifestyle YouTube channel with more than 700,000 subscribers.\u00a0Together with her husband, she and her four biological children \u2014 Nakova, Jaka, Radley and Onyx \u2014 had a family YouTube channel, The Stauffer Life, with more than 300,000 followers.",
      "Neither channel is publicly accessible on YouTube at the time of this story's publication.",
      "The Ohio-based vlogger parents\u00a0began inviting viewers into their international adoption journey in 2016, via social media. Myka Stauffer produced 27 videos with the boy they named Huxley, sharing everything from fundraising to grappling with the ever-changing rules surrounding international adoption to learning about their potential child\u2019s special needs.",
      "Why did Myka and James Stauffer adopt a child?",
      "In an article for Parade\u00a0in September 2019, Myka wrote, \"My husband was resistant (to adoption) at first, but after letting him reflect on the idea for several months, we both agreed to start researching and see what surfaced.\"",
      "The couple felt compelled to pursue an international adoption, \"and we kept being lead to China,\" Myka Stauffer wrote. Because Chinese adoption laws would only allow U.S. couples to adopt children with special needs, the couple had to decide if they were prepared to take on additional challenges.",
      "And then, Myka Stauffer wrote, she \u201csaw a little face that I couldn\u2019t walk away from.\u201d This little boy had a brain tumor; Myka Stauffer said that since she was an oncology nurse, \u201ctumors didn\u2019t scare me.\u201d",
      "She wrote, \u201cUltimately, his sad little face won our hearts over and we just knew that he was our little guy.\u201d",
      "Who is Huxley, the boy the Stauffers adopted?",
      "The boy was 2.5 years old when the whole Stauffer family flew to China to meet him and bring him to their home in America. They renamed him Huxley.",
      "Over the years, the Stauffers updated their followers on their experience adopting a child with special needs, sometimes on posts that featured advertising from major companies.",
      "Not all videos about Huxley were monetized, but many of the videos about adoption were some of the most watched on the channel, raising the Stauffers\u2019 profile and clout online. In the last two years, the video on their channel with the most views, 5.5 million, was\u00a0\u201cHuxley\u2019s EMOTIONAL Adoption VIDEO!! GOTCHA DAY China Adoption.\u201d",
      "Why did the the Stauffers find a new home for their adopted son?",
      "At the age of 4, Huxley was just starting to form words verbally and had learned a few words in sign language.",
      "Myka Stauffer said, in her Parade essay and in now-deleted videos, the family learned eventually that Huxley did not, in fact, have a brain tumor. Instead, they shared, he had a number of different medical issues: he suffered a stroke in utero, and had autism and sensory processing disorder.",
      "Eagle-eyed followers began to notice that Huxley was missing from photos and other posts on the family\u2019s social media and YouTube channel. In May 2020, the Stauffers posted a video that was viewed by TODAY.com and has since been deleted, explaining what was happening with their adopted son.",
      "\u201cOnce Huxley came home, there was a lot more special needs that we weren\u2019t aware of, and that we were not told,\u201d James Stauffer said in the video, titled \u201can update on our family.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor us, it\u2019s been really hard hearing from the medical professionals, a lot of their feedback, and things that have been upsetting,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve never wanted to be in this position. And we\u2019ve been trying to get his needs met and help him out as much as possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not an ounce of our body that doesn\u2019t love Huxley with all of our being,\u201d Myka Stauffer added. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a minute that I didn\u2019t try our hardest and I think what Jim is trying to say is that after multiple assessments, after multiple evaluations, numerous medical professionals have felt that he needed a different fit and that (with) his medical needs, he needed more.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I feel like a failure as a mom? Like, 500%,\u201d Myka Stauffer said, adding that Huxley was living with a \u201cnew mommy\u201d in a \u201cforever home.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe last couple months have been like the hardest thing I could have ever imagined to going to choosing to do ... after pouring our guts and our heart into this little boy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is thriving, he is happy, he is doing really well, and his new mommy has medical professional training, and it is a very good fit.\u201d",
      "Why are people upset by the Stauffers' decision?",
      "An online uproar followed the Stauffers' announcement.",
      "Almost 50,000 people (as of publication of this article) have signed a\u00a0Change.org petition\u00a0demanding that the Stauffers remove all monetized content featuring Huxley from YouTube. And in a now-completed case, local authorities investigated the \u201cwell-being\u201d of Huxley Stauffer in response to compaints. No charges were filed.",
      "TODAY.com reached out to the Stauffers' attorney and did not get a response. In 2020, in a statement to People magazine, Myka and James Stauffer\u2019s lawyers, Thomas Taneff and Taylor Sayers, said:",
      "\u201cWe are privy to this case and given the facts at hand, we feel this was the best decision for Huxley ... In coming to know our clients we know they are a loving family and are very caring parents that would do anything for their children.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince his adoption, they consulted with multiple professionals in the healthcare and educational arenas in order to provide Huxley with the best possible treatment and care,\u201d Taneff and Sayers continued. \u201cOver time, the team of medical professionals advised our clients it might be best for Huxley to be placed with another family.\u201d",
      "In the adoption world, failed adoptions are called \u201cdisruptions.\u201d While a disruption may seem stone-hearted from the outside, according to experts TODAY.com spoke with, these  anguished acts are complex and soul-crushing for all concerned.",
      "Myka Stauffer responded to some of the backlash in an Instagram post on June 24, 2020. That screenshot remains the most recent post on her page.",
      "\"I am sorry for the confusion and pain I have caused, and I am sorry for not being able to tell more of my story from the beginning,\" she wrote, adding, \"I was naive, foolish and arrogant.\"",
      "She also debunked a few rumors, writing that the Stauffers \"did not adopt a child to gain wealth.\"",
      "The new, three-episode documentary airing this week called \"An Update On Our Family\" looks at the broader world of family vlogging through the lens of the Stauffer family's story."

Netflix announced on Aug. 21 that it was set to begin production on a documentary about the former \"Posh Spice,\" who was a scene-stealing fan favorite in David Beckham's documentary.",
      "\"It wasn\u2019t the easiest thing to get her to agree to, but in my opinion she was the star of mine,\" David Beckham told Savannah Guthrie and Craig Melvin. \"So I just thought this is the opportunity, because she\u2019s been working on our brand for the last 18 years, and she\u2019s unbelievably hard working, and no one gets to see that.",
      "\"So I convinced her to actually let people see what she does every day and what goes into her business,\" he continued. \"She\u2019s a very clever and hard-working lady, so I want people to see that.\"",
      "One scene between the couple that captivated fans in the 2023 documentary involved them dancing together in their kitchen to \"Islands in the Stream\" by Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers. It sparked a TikTok dance trend of people putting the song on and dancing to see if their partners would join them.",

      "\"For me, it was a great moment for me to actually look back because I never really looked back at my career and the things I\u2019d won over that time,\" he said. \"But also to talk about things that I\u2019d never spoke about ever, and wasn\u2019t planning on speaking about it.\"",
      "\"I was very proud of my family throughout that time, and obviously for me and Victoria to sit there and look at everything that had gone on,\" he continued. \"I forgot about things that were said about me or said to me.\"",

      "At a news conference this month, President-elect Donald Trump bragged, \u201cWe defeated ISIS.\u201d",
      "It has been a point of pride for him, and it is true. In the first year of Trump\u2019s first term,\u00a0U.S. forces, working with Syrian Kurdish allies,\u00a0defeated\u00a0the Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed \u201ccaliphate\u201d and liberated\u00a0its capital. But the fall of the Assad regime has left Syria at risk of coming apart under pressure from a variety of terrorist groups, local militias and Israeli airstrikes. And Syria\u2019s interim leaders, while proclaiming moderate intentions, have roots\u00a0in Al Qaeda and\u00a0another terrorist group, Hayat al Sham (HTS). The\u00a0nightmare scenario for many experts is that\u00a0ISIS could re-establish its stronghold in the fledgling state and export more terrorism to the West or inspire it, as it did the New Year\u2019s Day attack in New Orleans.",
      "The situation means that, once he is in office,\u00a0Trump will\u00a0most likely\u00a0have to make some hard choices \u2014\u00a0insist on withdrawing all or some of the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, in line with his previous positions,\u00a0or leave them in place to prevent an ISIS resurgence and a tarnishing of what he sees as his accomplishment in his first term. U.S. withdrawal\u00a0could easily re-create Syria as a base of operations for terrorist attacks\u00a0in\u00a0Israel, the United States and Europe.",
      "The United States has been relying on fighters from the\u00a0Syrian Defense Force (SDF),\u00a0an alliance led by Kurds\u00a0in northeast Syria,\u00a0to guard thousands of\u00a0captured\u00a0ISIS\u00a0fighters and their families\u00a0there. At the height of the war\u00a0against ISIS, Gen. Joseph Votel, a former commander of U.S. Central Command,\u00a0told NBC News\u00a0that the SDF\u2019s fighters were among the best he has ever led.",
      "But the SDF\u2019s commander in chief, Gen. Mazloum\u00a0Abdi,\u00a0told The Guardian this\u00a0month\u00a0that ISIS is growing in strength after it seized weapons from the collapsed\u00a0Syrian\u00a0regime. He\u00a0also\u00a0said the Kurdish forces are coming under increased pressure from\u00a0Turkish\u00a0President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who views them, along with\u00a0Kurdish separatists based in Syria\u00a0known as the PKK,\u00a0as threats\u00a0to his regime.",

      "The United States has a stake in the \u201cextraordinary opportunity that is now before the Syrian people to actually control their own lives and their own destinies,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cThat means, I believe, keeping some presence, but it also means being very engaged in all of the efforts to help support a Syrian-owned, Syrian-led transition to get the country to a better place.\u201d",
      "Theodore\u00a0Kattouf,\u00a0a career diplomat who was the U.S. ambassador to Syria under President George W. Bush,\u00a0told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0recently\u00a0that even if Trump were to continue bombing campaigns and targeted operations against the terrorist group, removing U.S. troops would leave the Kurdish coalition vulnerable and ultimately lead to an expanded footprint for ISIS.",
      "\u201cWith those troops out of there, we\u2019re putting a lot of U.S. interests at risk,\u201d\u00a0Kattouf\u00a0said. \u201cI don\u2019t see\u00a0[HTS]\u00a0or other allied rebel forces able to take on that issue right now.\u201d",
      "The fear among Biden administration counterterrorism officials\u00a0is that\u00a0a Trump withdrawal of U.S. forces would leave the Syrian Kurds guarding the ISIS prisoners vulnerable to attacks from other factions \u2014 or the looming presence of Turkey, just across the border.\u00a0Both\u00a0Trump in his first term and President Joe Biden\u00a0have worked hard to restrain Erdo\u011fan,\u00a0whose country remains\u00a0a NATO ally, from attacking America\u2019s Kurdish allies. Trump said\u00a0at his news conference last week that\u00a0he had asked Erdo\u011fan\u00a0not to\u00a0go\u00a0after \u201ccertain people,\u201d clearly referring to the Kurds. Trump added, \u201cPresident Erdo\u011fan\u00a0is his friend of mine, he\u2019s a guy I like, respect. I think he respects me also.\u201d",
      "Beyond serving as a base for operations and planning, any Syrian territory that falls to ISIS could help it project an image of power and resistance and inspire others around the world. The group has already been\u00a0expanding its global\u00a0reach through social media, sponsoring attacks and\u00a0influencing followers worldwide, including so-called lone wolves,\u00a0through what anti-terrorism experts say is a surge of sophisticated online propaganda. CIA Director William Burns\u00a0told NPR\u00a0last\u00a0week\u00a0that\u00a0the agency is \u201cquite concerned\u201d about the rising threat posed by ISIS, particularly its \u201cability to inspire people.\u201d\u00a0And in July, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned the House Judiciary Committee that \u201cthe greatest terrorism threat to our homeland has been posed by lone actors or small cells of individuals who typically radicalize to violence online and use easily accessible weapons to attack soft targets.\u201d",
      "The U.S. intelligence community\u00a0and the FBI have been sounding those alarm bells for more than a year.\u00a0A senior administration official\u00a0told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0on Friday, \u201cThere is a heightened focus on ISIS,\u201d pointing to the cancellation of three Taylor Swift Eras Tour shows in Vienna in August after warnings from U.S. intelligence of ISIS terrorist plots targeting the venues. And in March, gunmen from ISIS-K, an affiliate of ISIS based in Afghanistan, killed more than 130 people at the Crocus City Hall, a well-known concert venue outside Moscow, despite warnings from U.S. intelligence, according to U.S. officials.",
      "\u201cSyria could provide the group with the momentum that it\u2019s long sought to kind of spill back onto the headlines, whether that\u2019s ISIS K in Afghanistan, ISIS core, ISIS Central and Syria and parts of Iraq, and again, the homegrown violent extremists that live in the West that ISIS is attempting to push over the edge conduct the types of attack that we saw in New Orleans,\u201d counterterrorism\u00a0expert\u00a0Collin Clarke\u00a0of the Soufan Group\u00a0told NBC News\u00a0after the New Orleans attack.",
      "Clearly alarmed by the possibility of the collapsed state\u2019s exporting terrorism to Europe,\u00a0two weeks ago\u00a0the foreign ministers of France and Germany, representing the European Union, traveled to Damascus to meet Syria\u2019s interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa,\u00a0who was\u00a0known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, before he disavowed his connections with\u00a0HTS.",
      "American boots?",
      "\u201cSyria is a mess, but is not our friend,\u201d Trump said on X in the hours before the collapse of the Assad regime, adding, \u201cThe United States should have nothing to do with it. This is not our fight. Let it play out. Do not get involved!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser,\u00a0Rep. Mike Waltz,\u00a0R-Fla.,\u00a0echoed Trump\u2019s reluctance for the United States to intervene in Syria but underscored the incoming administration\u2019s commitment to combating ISIS. \u201cWe do not need American boots running around Syria in any way, shape or form, but we\u2019re keeping an eye on those things, ISIS, Israel\u2019s border, and kind of the broader dynamic with our Gulf allies,\u201d Waltz said on a podcast late last month.",
      "But experts question the ability to continue the fight against ISIS in Syria without a U.S.\u00a0military\u00a0presence.",
      "During the transition, a senior Biden administration official said, the current administration has been briefing Trump\u2019s national security team on the need for a continued U.S. military presence to prevent Russia, Turkey or Iran from gaining dominance. The outgoing Biden administration has itself been treading carefully, sending its top Middle East diplomat, Assistant Secretary of State Barbara\u00a0Leaf, to Damascus only after European counterparts had already visited and only after\u00a0public pressure\u00a0from the mother of Austin Tice, the American journalist believed to be imprisoned in Syria,\u00a0who said\u00a0the United States should be more engaged.\u00a0To even meet with the new interim leader, the State Department first\u00a0had to lift\u00a0the\u00a0$10\u00a0million bounty\u00a0it\u00a0had\u00a0put\u00a0on\u00a0his\u00a0head\u00a0when he led\u00a0HTS.",
      "But now the critical question of whether the United States should play a role in preventing Syria from again harboring terrorists or permitting power plays from U.S. regional adversaries will be on Trump\u2019s doorstep as he arrives at the White House. That and the challenge of combating the online propaganda that spreads ISIS\u2019 terrorist philosophy far and wide."

      "BEIJING \u2014 As he prepares to leave Beijing, the U.S. envoy to China feels relations between the two rival powers are the most stable they\u2019ve been in recent years. But there\u2019s no guarantee they will stay that way.",
      "It \u201cremains a very challenging, often very contentious and in a long-term way deeply competitive relationship,\u201d Ambassador Nicholas Burns told NBC News in an interview this week. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t get around that. We\u2019re rivals for global power.\u201d",
      "Still, the world\u2019s two biggest economies have learned that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to talk to each other,\u201d Burns said, adding that \u201cthere are times when we have to work with China because it\u2019s in the American national interest.\u201d",
      "China is increasingly challenging the U.S.-led international order that has been in place since the end of World War II, working to various degrees with Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "The two countries have profound differences on issues such as trade, technology, the status of Taiwan and human rights, and blame each other for cyberattacks and the deadly U.S. fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s been unduly provocative in the Taiwan Strait with its military maneuvers,\u201d Burns said, adding that Beijing \u201chas made a major mistake and continues with that mistake in helping Russia to prosecute its illegal and barbaric war against Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Beijing denies that it is aiding the Russian war machine or carrying out cyberattacks on the U.S. that Burns said are \u201con a scale of lethality that is unprecedented.\u201d",
      "Burns is winding down his job after nearly three years of managing the day-to-day tensions of what is often described as the world\u2019s most important bilateral relationship and navigating some of its lowest points in decades.",
      "If Beijing wants to maintain the newfound stability in ties, \u201cI think the onus is on the government here in China to make that happen,\u201d Burns said.",
      "One thing the Chinese government can do, he said, is lift its sanctions on Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., if he is confirmed as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state. Rubio and other U.S. lawmakers were sanctioned in 2020 over their criticism of authorities\u2019 crackdown on dissent in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cThey have to talk to the American secretary of state,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Burns declined to comment directly on how the incoming Trump administration might manage the U.S.-China relationship, though he said he had been in touch with former Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., whom Trump has said he will nominate as his China ambassador.",
      "Trump has advocated a tougher approach toward the country than the Biden administration.",
      "In what may be indirect advice to Trump and his Cabinet appointees, Burns emphasized the importance of talking with China as well as maintaining regional alliances the Biden administration has fortified in order to counter China\u2019s influence, the future of which is uncertain as Trump begins a second term.",
      "\u201cWe have got to keep our allies close to us,\u201d Burns said, pointing to South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and India.",
      "Working with allies \u201cmultiplies and expands American power in trying to deter some of these really pernicious actions\u201d by China, Russia and others, Burns said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one way to compete with China effectively, to win part of the competition for power, but also to keep the peace with China,\u201d he said.",
      "Slowly thawing ties",
      "In-person diplomacy was disrupted during the Covid-19 pandemic, which kept China\u2019s borders closed for three years. During this time, the previous Trump administration ratcheted up criticism of Beijing\u2019s handling of the outbreak, which began in China.",
      "When Burns arrived in Beijing in March 2022 to take up his post, he spent most of the first month of his job in quarantine at the ambassador\u2019s residence, unable to meet anybody even as the relationship he was tasked with steering was heading to new lows.",
      "At the same time, Chinese nationalism and anti-Western sentiment surged across state media and online platforms here, and the people-to-people exchanges that Burns likes to call the \u201cballast\u201d of the relationship have never really recovered.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has the tightest grip on power here since Mao Zedong, and has carried out an internal campaign against corruption that, during Burns\u2019 term alone, saw a foreign minister and two defense ministers expelled from their positions and the public eye. The heightened scrutiny has made some Chinese officials, academics and average citizens more reluctant to engage with foreigners.",
      "Relations hit their lowest point in decades in August 2022, when Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House speaker at the time, visited the Beijing-claimed island of Taiwan over China\u2019s objections. They sank even lower in early 2023, when the American military shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that had been spotted over the continental United States.",
      "\u201cIt took us a while to dig out of that,\u201d Burns said. Since then, both sides have moved to stabilize ties.",
      "China has only recently resumed direct military and other communications that were cut off in protest over Pelosi\u2019s visit. The head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command has since had two meetings with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s significant because we\u2019re trying to drive down the probability or the chance of any kind of accident or misunderstanding between our military forces,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Another example of improved cooperation, he said, is in addressing the U.S. fentanyl crisis, one of the areas where Biden and Xi agreed to cooperate at a summit in California in November 2023. Many of the precursor chemicals used to make the deadly opioid originate in China before being processed into fentanyl in Mexico and other countries, then smuggled into the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe have begun to see action from the government of China,\u201d Burns said, including 300 arrests, the shutdown of online sales of illicit chemicals and the scheduling of 55 synthetic opioids and precursor chemicals as prohibited for export.",
      "Burns pointed to other successes in the Biden administration, including the release of four Americans who had been detained in China for years: David Lin in September, and Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung in November.",
      "\u201cTo meet them at the airport, to give them their passports, to tell them that they were free people again was an extraordinary moment, certainly for me as the American ambassador,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Though all Americans the State Department considered wrongfully detained by China have been released, hundreds of others remain imprisoned on various charges, more than in any other foreign country. They continue to receive consular assistance.",
      "In the interest of keeping the lines of communication open, Burns urged members of Congress from both parties to make greater efforts to visit China.",
      "\u201cI have hawkish views on the relationship between China and the United States. Many members of Congress do, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to be here to understand the adversary and to talk to the adversary and to know the reality on the ground.\u201d",

      "The prime minister of Pakistan has ordered an investigation over an ad by the country\u2019s flag carrier that was criticized as resembling the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.",
      "The Pakistan International Airlines ad announcing the resumption of flights from Islamabad to Paris, which was posted on its official X account Jan. 10, shows a plane flying toward the Eiffel Tower with the tagline, \u201cParis, we\u2019re coming today.\u201d",
      "The post has received more than 21 million views on X since it was published.",
      "The ad quickly drew backlash on social media from commenters who said it evoked imagery from the 9/11 attacks in which almost 3,000 people were killed, when two hijacked passenger planes crashed into the World Trade Center in New York City, a third hijacked plane crashed into the Pentagon and a fourth plane crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after passengers fought the hijackers and prevented it from reaching Washington.",

      "Pakistan has long struggled with domestic terrorism, as well as the overseas activities of terrorists based there.

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in Ukraine\u2019s capital on Thursday with a pledge to help guarantee the country\u2019s security for a century, days before Donald Trump is sworn in as U.S. president.",
      "The British government said Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will sign a \u201c100-Year Partnership\u201d treaty in Kyiv covering areas including defense, science, energy and trade.",
      "Starmer\u2019s unannounced visit is his first trip to Ukraine since he took office in July. He visited the country in 2023 when he was opposition leader, and has twice held talks with Zelenskyy in London since becoming prime minister.\u00a0The war\u00a0will be three years old next month.",
      "The Italian defense chief was also in Kyiv on Thursday, two days after Germany\u2019s defense minister visited and three days after Zelenskyy\u00a0talked by phone\u00a0with French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "The flurry of diplomatic activity came in the run-up to Trump\u2019s inauguration next Monday, which is expected to bring a departure from the outgoing U.S. administration\u2019s pledge to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes to defeat Russia. Trump has also indicated he wants Europe to shoulder more of the burden for helping Ukraine.",
      "Starmer arrived at Kyiv railway station on a gray and frosty morning. \u201cWe\u2019re a long way into this conflict,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t let up.\u201d",
      "During the visit, Starmer and Zelenskyy laid flowers at a wall of remembrance for those killed in the war. The wall outside St. Michael\u2019s Golden-Domed Monastery, a Kyiv landmark, is covered in photos of the slain, stretching for a city block. It has become a place of pilgrimage for families paying tribute to their lost loved ones.",
      "Starmer also visited a Kyiv hospital specializing in burn treatment.",
      "While Starmer was later meeting with Zelenskyy at the presidential palace, a car and a building were damaged elsewhere in Kyiv by debris from Russian drones shot down by Ukraine\u2019s air defenses, according to city adminstration chief Tymur Tkachenko.",
      "The U.K., one of Ukraine\u2019s biggest military backers, has pledged 12.8 billion pounds ($16 billion) in military and civilian aid since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion three years ago, and has trained more than 50,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil. Starmer is to announce another 40 million pounds ($49 million) for Ukraine\u2019s postwar economic recovery.",
      "But the U.K.\u2019s role is dwarfed by that of the United States, and there is deep uncertainty over the fate of American support for Ukraine once Trump takes office on Jan. 20. The president-elect has balked at the cost of U.S. aid to Kyiv, says he wants to bring the war to a swift end and is planning to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom he has long expressed admiration.",
      "Kyiv\u2019s allies have rushed to flood Ukraine with as much support as possible before Trump\u2019s inauguration, with the aim of putting Ukraine in the strongest position possible for any future negotiations to end the war.",
      "Zelenskyy has said that in any peace negotiation, Ukraine would need assurances about its future protection from its much bigger neighbor.",
      "Britain says its 100-year pledge is part of that assurance and will help ensure Ukraine is \u201cnever again vulnerable to the kind of brutality inflicted on it by Russia,\u201d which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and attempted a full-scale invasion in February 2022.",
      "The deal commits the two sides to cooperate on defense \u2014 especially maritime security against Russian activity in the Baltic Sea, Black Sea and Sea of Azov \u2014 and on technology projects including drones, which have become vital weapons for both sides in the war. The treaty also includes a system to help track stolen Ukrainian grain exported by Russia from occupied parts of the country.",
      "\u201cPutin\u2019s ambition to wrench Ukraine away from its closest partners has been a monumental strategic failure. Instead, we are closer than ever, and this partnership will take that friendship to the next level,\u201d Starmer said ahead of the visit.",
      "\u201cThis is not just about the here and now, it is also about an investment in our two countries for the next century, bringing together technology development, scientific advances and cultural exchanges, and harnessing the phenomenal innovation shown by Ukraine in recent years for generations to come.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said he and Starmer also would discuss a plan proposed by France\u2019s Macron that could see troops from France and other Western countries stationed in Ukraine to oversee a ceasefire agreement.",
      "Zelenskyy has said any such proposal should go alongside a timeline for Ukraine to join NATO. The alliance\u2019s 32 member countries say that\u00a0Ukraine will join one day, but not until after the war. Trump has appeared to sympathize with Putin\u2019s position that Ukraine should not be part of NATO.",
      "As the grinding war nears the three-year mark, both Russia and Ukraine are pushing for battlefield gains ahead of possible peace talks. Ukraine has started a second offensive in Russia\u2019s Kursk region, where it is struggling to hang onto a chunk of territory it captured last year, and has stepped up drone and missile attacks on weapons sites and fuel depots inside Russia.",
      "Moscow is slowly taking territory at the cost of high casualties along the 600-mile front line in eastern Ukraine and launching intense barrages at Ukraine\u2019s\u00a0energy system, seeking to deprive Ukrainians of heat and light in the depths of winter. A major Russian ballistic and cruise missile attack on regions across Ukraine on Wednesday compelled authorities to shut down the power grid in some areas."

      "At around 9 a.m. IST (10:30 p.m. Wednesday ET), the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) carried out the highly anticipated Space\u00a0Docking Experiment (SpaDeX), a spokesperson for the agency said.",
      "Two ISRO satellites, Target and Chaser \u2014 each roughly the size of a large refrigerator \u2014 successfully latched onto each other and unlatched after a series of complex orbital maneuvers.",
      "The indigenous technology, crucial for satellite servicing, space station operations, and interplanetary missions, positions\u00a0India\u00a0to play a significant role in the commercial and exploratory frontiers of\u00a0space.",
      "\u201cIndia\u00a0has ambitious missions planned and to achieve those this is an important technology we have to have. Various missions like building a\u00a0space\u00a0station need assembly in\u00a0space, which is not possible without\u00a0space\u00a0docking,\u201d\u00a0Indian astrophysicist Jayant Murthy said.",
      "The mission was postponed twice earlier \u2014 first because the\u00a0docking process\u00a0needed further validation through ground simulations, and later because of an issue arising from\u00a0excess drift\u00a0between the satellites.",
      "SpaDeX,\u00a0launched on Dec. 30\u00a0from\u00a0India\u2019s main\u00a0spaceport, used an\u00a0Indian-made rocket to deploy the satellites into orbit. Among various payloads and experiments were eight cowpea seeds ISRO had sent to\u00a0space\u00a0onboard the rocket to study plant growth in microgravity conditions, which germinated within four days of the launch of the mission.",
      "The mission will also demonstrate the transfer of electric power between docked\u00a0spacecraft, a capability vital for applications like in-space\u00a0robotics, composite\u00a0spacecraft control and payload operations post-undocking.",
      "Such technologies are essential for missions requiring multiple rocket launches to achieve shared objectives.",
      "Space\u00a0exploration and commercialization is a key part of\u00a0Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s efforts to position the country as a global superpower.",
      "The successful SpaDeX mission \u201cis a significant stepping stone for\u00a0India\u2019s ambitious\u00a0space\u00a0missions in the years to come,\u201d Modi said on X on Thursday.",
      "ISRO is focused on deep-space\u00a0exploration and enabling private companies to commercialize the sector, with projects that include solar studies, orbital astronaut missions and planetary defense, in collaboration with NASA.",
      "The stakes are significant. While the global commercial space market is expected to reach $1 trillion by 2030,\u00a0India\u2019s current share is just 2%, or $8 billion. The government aims to grow this to $44 billion by 2040."

    "summary": "South Korea\u2019s arrested President Yoon Suk Yeol failed to attend a second day of questioning by investigators, further stonewalling an inquiry into whether he committed insurrection with his martial law bid.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea\u00a0\u2014\u00a0South Korea\u2019s arrested President Yoon Suk Yeol failed to attend a second day of questioning by investigators on Thursday, further stonewalling a criminal investigation into whether he committed insurrection with his martial law bid.",
      "Yoon on Wednesday became the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested and was taken to the Seoul Detention Center, after refusing to cooperate. He remained in the center on Thursday, with his lawyer citing his health as a factor.",
      "Authorities have 48 hours to question the suspended president, after which they must release him or seek a warrant to detain him for up to 20 days.",
      "Yoon\u2019s refusal to cooperate with investigators comes as the Constitutional Court held a second hearing in his impeachment trial to determine whether to remove him permanently or reinstate his presidential powers.",
      "South Korea is grappling with its worst political crisis in decades, set off by Yoon\u2019s brief attempt to impose martial law on Dec. 3 that was voted down by parliament.",
      "In opening arguments at the Constitutional Court, an opposition Democratic Party lawmaker condemned Yoon for \u201cthe Dec. 3 insurrection\u201d and said Yoon and a small number of supporters had sought to stoke chaos by refusing to accept his arrest warrant.",
      "\u201cThis impeachment trial decides whether or\u00a0not\u00a0to bring someone like this back to the position of commander-in-chief in control of the military,\u201d said Jung Chung-rae, who heads parliament\u2019s Legislation and Judiciary Committee.",
      "In response, one of Yoon\u2019s defense team said his impeachment was\u00a0not\u00a0intended to defend the constitution but for the opposition \u201cto use the majority power of parliament to usurp the position of the president.\u201d",
      "The main opposition Democratic Party used its majority in parliament to bring on Yoon\u2019s impeachment vote, although some 12 lawmakers from Yoon\u2019s own party also voted to impeach.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyer Cho Dae-hyen said the suspended president\u2019s decision to declare martial law had been made in good faith based on his view that the country was in a state of emergency.",
      "Another of Yoon\u2019s lawyers, Bae Jin-han, quipped: \u201cSome say \u2018you get impeached if you breathe\u2019 nowadays.\u201d",
      "Yoon\u2019s arrest on Wednesday ended a weeks-long standoff with authorities after police swooped in before dawn on his fortified hillside villa in Seoul to the despair of followers at the site.",
      "Yoon said he turned himself in for\u00a0questioning\u00a0by corruption investigation officials to prevent what he called the risk of \u201cunsavory bloodshed,\u201d though he continued to protest that it was an illegal investigation and invalid arrest warrant.",
      "The embattled leader has up to now refused to talk with investigators who had prepared a questionnaire of more than 200 pages, an official from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials (CIO) that is heading the\u00a0criminal inquiry\u00a0said.",
      "His\u00a0questioning\u00a0had been due to resume at 2 p.m. (12 a.m. ET) on Thursday, but the CIO said it had been informed by Yoon\u2019s side that he would\u00a0not\u00a0attend.",
      "Yonhap cited Yoon Kab-keun, one of Yoon\u2019s lawyers, as saying that the suspended president\u2019s health was a factor and that further\u00a0questioning\u00a0was pointless, without elaborating.",
      "A small crowd of protesters supporting Yoon gathered and sat on a road outside the CIO office, calling the president\u2019s arrest illegitimate.",
      "His lawyers have said the arrest warrant is\u00a0illegal\u00a0because it was issued by a court in the wrong jurisdiction and the team set up to investigate him had no legal mandate to do so.",
      "They have also asked another court to review the legality of the arrest. Yoon\u2019s arrest period of 48 hours is temporarily paused while the court review is underway, according to the CIO.",
      "His legal team has denied allegations against Yoon of masterminding insurrection, a crime in South Korea punishable by life imprisonment or even technically by the death penalty.",
      "The last executions in South Korea were in 1997, for criminal offenses such as murder."

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 09:57:18 GMT",
    "summary": "Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s defense secretary nominee, appeared stumped when asked about the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN.",
    "story": [
      "BANGKOK \u2014 Sen. Tammy Duckworth, grilling President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice for defense secretary over whether he had the \u201cbreadth and depth of knowledge\u201d needed to lead international negotiations, asked Pete Hegseth if could name one member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, describe what type of agreement the U.S. had with the countries and how many nations were in the bloc.",
      "Hegseth responded at the heated Senate confirmation hearing that he couldn\u2019t tell Duckworth the exact number of ASEAN nations, but that \u201cI know we have allies in South Korea and Japan, and in AUKUS with Australia,\u201d referring to a pact among the U.S., Australia and Britain.",
      "\u201cNone of those three countries are in ASEAN,\u201d responded Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois. \u201cI suggest you do a little homework.\u201d",
      "What is ASEAN and why is it relevant to the U.S.?",
      "ASEAN is made up of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. An 11th country, East Timor, is set to join soon.",
      "Established in 1967, its goal is to promote regional economic and security cooperation, leveraging a combined population of more than 650 million people with a GDP of more than $3 trillion.",
      "Duckworth\u2019s question came after Hegseth had noted the strategic importance of the Indo-Pacific, a region where China\u2019s influence has been rapidly growing and Beijing has become increasingly assertive in pressing territorial claims.",
      "ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei are locked in maritime disputes with China over its claims of sovereignty over virtually all of the South China Sea, one of the world\u2019s most crucial waterways for shipping. Indonesia has also expressed concern about what it sees as Beijing\u2019s encroachment on its exclusive economic zone.",
      "What does ASEAN have to do with the U.S. secretary of defense?",
      "The U.S. is treaty partners with ASEAN members Thailand and the Philippines, and Washington has sought to harness ASEAN\u2019s regional influence as it seeks to counter Chinese influence and promote what the White House has called \u201ca free and open region that is connected, prosperous, secure and resilient.\u201d",
      "President Joe Biden said ASEAN was \u201cat the heart of my administration\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy\u201d and hosted a meeting of ASEAN leaders in Washington in 2022.",
      "ASEAN also holds top-level meetings annually, this year in Malaysia, which holds the rotating chair of the group.",
      "Its defense meetings are typically attended by the U.S. defense secretary, and its foreign minister meetings by the U.S. secretary of state. The meetings culminate with an annual summit, which is regularly attended by the sitting U.S. president. Both Biden and Donald Trump have participated.",
      "Why else is ASEAN important?",
      "Despite some members\u2019 territorial conflicts with China, many in the bloc have close relations with Beijing as well, and top-level Chinese officials also attend ASEAN meetings.",
      "The U.S. in 2022 was elevated to the top-level \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership\u201d with ASEAN \u2014 a largely symbolic status that put Washington on the same level with China, which was granted the distinction the year before.",
      "ASEAN emphasizes noninterference and personal diplomacy, and its breadth of membership and partnerships makes it uniquely positioned as a forum to address major geopolitical issues.",
      "Beyond China and the U.S., ASEAN has formal relationships with Russia, India, Australia, the European Union, Britain, Japan, South Korea and many others.",
      "It hosts annual \u201cASEAN Plus Three\u201d meetings with the leaders of China, South Korea and Japan, \u201cASEAN Plus Six\u201d talks that add in the leaders of Australia, India and New Zealand, and the East Asia summit, which includes the six plus Russia and the United States.",
      "The ASEAN nations are also central to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, a free trade agreement that was signed in 2020, creating the largest trade bloc in history.",
      "The 10 nations plus China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand account for more than 30% of the world\u2019s population and about 30% of global GDP. Conceived at ASEAN\u2019s 2011 summit, the agreement includes commitments on trade in goods and services, investments and other areas."

    "story": [
      "It's a con even more elaborate than \"Oceans 11.\"",
      "A French woman who thought she was in a romantic relationship with Hollywood star Brad Pitt handed over 830,000 euros ($855,000) to scammers as part of an elaborate, yearlong con that involved an AI-generated version of the \"Moneyball\" actor.",
      "To add insult to injury, when she discussed her misfortune on the French television channel TF1, the 53-year-old interior designer known only as \"Anne\" was hit with a wave of mockery and trolling so bad that the station had to pull her interview with its \"Seven to Eight\" show.",
      "\u201cThe story broadcast this Sunday has resulted in a wave of harassment against the witness,\u201d TF1 presenter Harry Roselmack posted on his X account Tuesday. \u201cFor the protection of victims, we have decided to withdraw it from our platforms.\u201d",
      "Anne said she began talking to the fake version of the \"Fight Club\" actor sometime in February 2023, after an account posing as Pitt's mother, Jane Etta Pitt, sent her a message on Instagram while she was on a skiing holiday in the French Alps.",
      "Speaking on TF1, Anne said that the account \u201ctold me that her son needed someone like me,\u201d according to AFP.",
      "Over the next few months, she exchanged several messages on different social media and messaging platforms, including WhatsApp, with the fake Pitt, even receiving AI-generated selfies of the 61-year-old actor, whose facsimile told her he needed money for cancer treatment.",
      "\u201cAt first I said to myself that it was fake, that it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not used to social media and I didn\u2019t really understand what was happening to me.\u201d",
      "The request for money came after the scammers told Anne that Pitt was in the hospital with kidney cancer and needed money for the treatment, but that his bank accounts were allegedly frozen because of his divorce proceedings with ex-wife Angelina Jolie.",
      "She was hesitant at first, but eventually transferred the large sum of money to an account in Turkey after receiving an email from the fake star\u2019s \u201cdoctor.\u201d",
      "Anne said she finally realized she had been the victim of a scam after she saw pictures of the real Pitt with his current partner, In\u00e8s de Ramon, last summer. \u201cI ask myself why they chose me to do such harm like this?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never harmed anyone. These people deserve hell.\u201d",
      "The French newspaper\u00a0Sud Ouest reported that Anne was going through divorce proceedings with a millionaire entrepreneur at the time. She reportedly suffered from severe depression and was hospitalized following the scam.",
      "Police are now investigating the con, but the interview has nevertheless sparked a deluge of jokes online.",
      "Among the individuals, organizations and companies making jokes at Anne's expense was Netflix France, which promoted \u201cfour films to see with Brad Pitt (really) for free\u201d in a post on X.",
      "Artificial intelligence has increased the risk of identity theft and  fraud online, which contributed to over $8.8 million in losses in the U.S., according to the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "A global study conducted by the computer security company McAfee found that 1 in 4 people worldwide have either experienced an AI-voice cloning scam or know someone who has."

      "A total of 78 bodies and 166 survivors \u2014 some of them emaciated and disorientated \u2014 have been hauled out so far in a court-ordered rescue operation that began on Monday, with hundreds more men still stuck 1.5 miles below the surface in a gold mine at Stilfontein, southwest of Johannesburg.",
      "Police had stopped food and water supplies from being taken into the mine since August until a court ruled in December that volunteers could send down essential aid for the miners, known locally as \u201czama zamas.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur mandate was to combat criminality and that is exactly what we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d said Athlenda Mathe, national spokesperson for the South African police, speaking at the site.",
      "\u201cBy providing food, water and necessities to these illegal miners it would be the police entertaining and allowing criminality to thrive,\u201d she said.",
      "The death toll makes the crackdown on the Stilfontein mine one of the deadliest on miners in recent South African history. As the toll has mounted, so has criticism of the police and of the government, which says the siege was part of a much-needed crackdown on illegal mining.",
      "\u201cThese miners, many of them undocumented and desperate workers from Mozambique and other Southern African countries, were left to die in one of the most horrific displays of state wilful negligence in recent history,\u201d the South African Federation of Trade Unions said in a statement on Tuesday.",
      "The Democratic Alliance, the second-biggest party in the ruling coalition, said on Wednesday the situation at the mine had got \u201cbadly out of hand\u201d and called for an independent inquiry.",
      "All 166 of the survivors rescued so far were immediately arrested and charged with criminal offences including illegal immigration, trespass and illegal mining, police said. None were hospitalized and all were taken into police custody.",
      "\u201cIf you come out and you are able to walk they take you straight to the cells,\u201d said Mzukisi Jam, a civil society activist, who has been at the site throughout the rescue operation."

    "story": [
      "Israel and Hamas appeared to be on the verge of agreeing to a ceasefire deal Wednesday that could end 15 months of devastating fighting in the Gaza Strip, even as the Israel military continued to launch airstrikes in the enclave and families of Israeli hostages begged for their safe return.",
      "American, Egyptian and Qatari delegations have been working to secure a truce to end fighting, with officials familiar with the talks taking place in the Qatari capital of Doha saying that an agreement that would see the gradual release of dozens of hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners was on the verge of completion.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said that Hamas had not yet responded to the draft agreement, after reports of a breakthrough in Israeli media.",
      "Earlier Wednesday a senior Arab official familiar with negotiations told NBC News that three key points were still being negotiated: the map dictating where exactly Israeli forces will withdraw to, particularly along the Netzarim Corridor that currently splits the Gaza Strip in two; the extent of its withdrawal from the strategic Philadelphi Corridor that flanks Gaza's southern border with Egypt; and the names of Palestinian prisoners to be exchanged for Hamas' Oct. 7 captives, as well as the method and location of their release.",
      "Netanyahu's spokesman, David Mencer, told NBC News on Wednesday that the deal was \"awaiting Hamas agreement.\u201d",
      "That comment came after Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa\u2019ar said Tuesday that a majority within Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government would support the \u201cgradual deal\u201d being negotiated.",
      "Earlier in the day, a senior Israeli official gave details of the current plans, which involve a 42-day first phase in which 33 hostages, most of whom are believed to be alive, would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners. That would be followed by a \"more complicated\" second phase, Sa\u2019ar said.",
      "The official added that the Israel Defense Forces would also withdraw from central Gaza to the Israeli border, but not before the hostages are freed.",
      "Of the 251 hostages kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, 94 people are still being held in Gaza \u2014 34 of whom have died.",

That saw Israel launch an air and land assault on Gaza, killing more than 46,000 people, most of them civilians, according to local officials.",
      "President Joe Biden said this week that a deal to end the war was \u201con the brink\u201d of being completed.\u00a0Washington is looking to secure the deal before President-elect Donald Trump takes office Monday.",
      "Until that happens, though, the violence continues. At least 17 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza late Tuesday, according to the enclave\u2019s Health Ministry. A separate Israeli strike on Jenin, in the occupied West Bank, killed at least six people, the ministry said.",
      "The Israeli military said in a statement it had \u201cstruck more than 50 terrorist targets across the Gaza Strip, including terrorist cells, weapons storage facilities, underground infrastructure, anti-tank fire positions, and Hamas military structures.\u201d",
      "Alongside the Palestinians desperate for this bombardment to end, Israelis have for months begged their government to bring home their relatives who were kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7. They have often been deeply critical of Netanyahu, whom they accuse of prioritizing the war and keeping together his fractious right-wing coalition government over the safety of their loved ones.",
      "As they have throughout this conflict, thousands of people gathered Tuesday night in the Tel Aviv plaza that has in recent months become known as \u201cHostages Square.\u201d Among them was Moran Stela Yanai, who spent 54 days in captivity after being abducted at the Supernova music festival on the morning of Hamas' surprise attack.",
      "\u201cI appeal to you, the international community, with a simple yet urgent plea: help us bring the hostages home,\u201d she said, according to a statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.",
      "\u201cThis is not about politics\u2014it is about humanity and the shared belief that no one should be left behind in darkness,\u201d she added. \u201cThese are children, parents, brothers, and sisters\u2014individuals with dreams, hopes, and loved ones longing for their return.\u201d",
      "The Bibas family said they had read reports that their relatives were among those set to be freed. Yarden Bibas, his wife Shiri and their sons Ariel, 5, and Kfir, 1, were taken from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7.",
      "\"We have learned from experience and disappointment, and therefore, until our loved ones cross the border, there is no end to the story,\" the family said in a statement. \"We are waiting for certainty regarding their release and their condition and ask that you do not contact us during this sensitive period.\""

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Taiwan will step up the surveillance and management of ships carrying flags of convenience, including boarding them,\u00a0after\u00a0a Chinese-linked cargo vessel was suspected of damaging an undersea communications\u00a0cable, the government said.",
      "Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, said a ship owned by a Hong Kong company but registered both in Cameroon and Tanzania\u00a0damaged a\u00a0cable\u00a0to the north of the island earlier this month, although it says it has not been able to verify the ship\u2019s intentions and was unable to board it due to bad weather.",
      "The ship\u2019s owner has\u00a0denied involvement, and China\u2019s government has said Taiwan is\u00a0making up accusations\u00a0before the facts are clear.",
      "The incident has particularly alarmed Taiwan given it has repeatedly complained about \u201cgray zone\u201d Chinese activities around the island, designed to pressure it without direct confrontation, such as balloon overflights and sand dredging.",
      "In a report to lawmakers ahead of ministers taking questions in parliament on Thursday, Taiwan\u2019s National Security Bureau said it planned to step up surveillance and management of ships carrying so-called flags of convenience, referring to those registered to other countries than their actual owner.",
      "Such ships which have previously been found to misreport information about them will be put on a list of ships for priority inspection at ports, it said.",
      "If these ships enter within 24 nautical miles of Taiwan\u2019s coast and are close to where undersea\u00a0cables are, the coast guard will be dispatched to board them and investigate, the bureau added.",
      "Taiwan will also promote greater international cooperation with the United States and Europe over suspected\u00a0damage\u00a0to undersea\u00a0cables, it said.",
      "\u201cThe bureau will continue to exchange intelligence with like-minded countries, collect threat alert information, analyze developing trends in sabotage techniques and false covers, and share prevention and response experience.\u201d",
      "It did not give details.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s coast guard, in its report to lawmakers, said its priority was to get access to the ship in question as part of its investigation and that areas where\u00a0cable\u00a0are located, and their landing points on shore, are key monitoring locations.",
      "All departments must strengthen monitoring of these areas to drive away any ships engaged in illegal activities or \u201cloitering about\u201d as needed, or to collect evidence, it added.",
      "Taiwan, whose government rejects Beijing\u2019s sovereignty claims, has pointed to similarities between what it experienced and\u00a0damage\u00a0to undersea\u00a0cables in the\u00a0Baltic Sea\u00a0following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",

      "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s anti-corruption minister resigned on Tuesday, bowing to mounting pressure over her links to her aunt, ousted Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.",
      "Tulip Siddiq said that she had been cleared of wrongdoing but was quitting as economic secretary to the Treasury because the issue was becoming \u201ca distraction from the work of the government.\u201d",
      "Siddiq, 42, is a former local councilor who was elected lawmaker for a north London district in 2015. She was appointed to the government after Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s center-left Labour Party won a landslide election victory in July.",
      "Starmer has been under growing pressure to remove Siddiq from her post since she referred herself to the government\u2019s ethics watchdog in early January following reports that she lived in London properties linked to her aunt.",
      "Starmer said he was sad to see Siddiq go, adding in a letter that the watchdog \u2014 independent adviser on ministerial interests Laurie Magnus \u2014 \u201chas assured me he found no breach of the Ministerial Code and no evidence of financial improprieties on your part.\u201d",
      "Starmer offered Siddiq the possibility of returning to government, saying \u201cthe door remains open to you going forward.\u201d",
      "Hasina was Bangladesh\u2019s longest-serving prime minister and ruled the country for 15 years until August, when she was ousted amid a mass uprising in which hundreds of protesters were killed and thousands were injured. Hasina, who has fled to India, faces many court cases over the deaths, including some on charges of crimes against humanity.",
      "Siddiq, who is responsible for tackling corruption in financial markets, was named last month in an anti-corruption investigation in Bangladesh against Hasina. The investigation alleged that Siddiq\u2019s family was involved in brokering a 2013 deal with Russia for a nuclear power plant in Bangladesh in which large sums of money were said to have been embezzled.",
      "Magnus said he accepted \u201cat face value\u201d Siddiq\u2019s statement that \u201cshe had no involvement in any inter-governmental discussions between Bangladesh and Russia or any form of official role.\u201d",
      "The minister faced further questions about her links to her aunt\u2019s government after reports in the Sunday Times and Financial Times newspapers alleged that she had used two London apartments given to her by associates of Bangladesh\u2019s Awami League, led by Hasina.",
      "Magnus said \u201ca lack of records and lapse of time\u201d meant he had not seen all potentially relevant information, but he added that \u201cI have not identified evidence of improprieties\u201d over the apartments.",
      "Magnus concluded that Siddiq hadn\u2019t breached ministerial standards. But he noted that given her role in government \u201cit is regrettable that she was not more alert to the potential reputational risks \u2014 both to her and the government \u2014 arising from her close family\u2019s association with Bangladesh.\u201d"

      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials (CIO), which is leading a joint investigation, said the arrest warrant was executed at 10:33 a.m. (8:33 p.m. Tuesday ET), hours after hundreds of police officers arrived at Yoon\u2019s presidential compound in central Seoul.",
      "Yoon, who was impeached last month after his short-lived martial law order plunged South Korea, a key U.S. ally, into political chaos, is South Korea\u2019s first president to be arrested in office.",
      "\u201cUnlike the first execution attempt, this time there were no individuals or security staff actively obstructing the execution, and there were no significant physical clashes,\u201d the CIO said in a briefing.",
      "In an address to the nation, Yoon said that the warrant was illegal but that he decided to comply \u201cto prevent an unfortunate and bloody confrontation.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the rule of law in this country has completely collapsed,\u201d he said, according to his office.",

      "Lawyers for Yoon and lawmakers from his People Power Party were also on the access road leading to the residence, arguing that the warrant was illegal and blocking the police from progressing toward the residence\u2019s entrance.",
      "Nearby, thousands of Yoon\u2019s supporters and critics held dueling protests in below-freezing temperatures.

      "Police officers could later be seen making progress toward the hillside villa after they pushed through multiple blockades made up of vehicles and barbed wire.",
      "Yoon\u2019s legal team said Wednesday that he was willing to appear for questioning voluntarily rather than be taken into custody. But a convoy of black SUVs was later seen leaving the presidential compound with a police escort, and Yoon arrived at the CIO office shortly afterward."
