      "Designer Christian Siriano transformed a Macy's department store into a New York Fashion Week runway show for his latest collection",
      "NEW YORK -- Hidden behind cream curtains, designer Christian Siriano transformed the athleisure aisles of the Herald Square Macy\u2019s department store into a cinematic universe as he ushered his New York Fashion Week runway show attendees on a journey through film from black-and-white gowns to full Technicolor looks.",
      "Much like his inspiration for his runway show, the VIP guestlist was straight out of Hollywood. Whoopi Goldberg sat between Oprah and singer Lizzo. Front row celebrities cheered as longtime Siriano muse Coco Rocha opened the catwalk in her classic high powered supermodel strut, wearing a black-and-white stripe and polka dot organza blazer paired with a mini skirt and matching hat.",
      "For his spring 2026 collection, Siriano said he drew inspiration from actor Marlene Dietrich and how she played with both feminine and masculine styles.",
      "\u201cA lot of the collection is black-and-white, but a lot of texture,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have this beautiful plaid sequin, polka dot, stripes ... that she\u2019s worn in her kind of repertoire of clothes and then we end in this idea of like, what if all of a sudden the film turned to color?\u201d",
      "Sticking with the old Hollywood glamour theme, models wore their hair in slick backed buns with one pin curl wave. In a modern twist, some models wore their structured blazers with only tights.",
      "From tailored blazers to voluminous bubble dresses, Siriano played with patterns and structure throughout his collection.",
      "Siriano relied on his color palette to transport attendees to the silver screen with black-and-white patterns from polka dots, stripes and plaid at the top of his show before transitioning his looks to Technicolor fabrics including a tiffany blue ball gown and a barbie pink deconstructed tuxedo dress.",
      "The show was a first for \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d star Natasha Rothwell. \u201cI want to spend an insane amount of money,\u201d she said after the show. \u201cFor my first fashion show, it was everything.\u201d",
      "Attendees came dressed ready for the drama in their tulle and corsets. Singer Adam Lambert arrived in a bronze belted blazer coat with matching oversized bronze sunglass shades.",

      "On the runway, Siriano dressed models of all sizes, genders and backgrounds in his designs. The designer continues to champion inclusivity while others have pulled back.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just important to have a mix of beautiful people, he said.",
      "Siriano accessorized his designs with an array of flat top and oversized whimsical hats. The designer himself has worn his fair share of hats.",
      "Siriano, who won the design competition \u201cProject Runway\u201d in 2007, recently returned to offer his expertise as a mentor to emerging designers on the newest iteration of the show, which features image architect Law Roach and supermodel Heidi Klum.",
      "Siriano is also serving as creative director for Macy's ready-to-wear I.N.C. brand as it marks 40 years. Siriano said by bringing fashion week to Macy's he hoped to bring customers back to retail shopping.",
      "Minutes before the start of the runway show, Siriano's backstage crew were sewing and touching up the final look of the night worn by Rocha, whose showstopping moments have become a signature element of Siriano's shows. In a black-and-white polka dot billowing gown, Rocha elegantly posed as she sauntered in the off-the-shoulder tulle look to close the catwalk",
      "\u201cI love my shows to be a little bit more like a performance too,\u201d Siriano said. \u201cI want people to feel like when they walk in the room, they\u2019re in a different world. We work so hard on making all these beautiful things, and I think it\u2019s escapism. We need that so much right now.\u201d",

      "Fans of Jane Austen are celebrating the 250th anniversary of the beloved author's birth with costumed balls and themed events",
      "LONDON -- Ellie Potts goes dancing with her friends most weeks. They don\u2019t put on the latest Taylor Swift or Ed Sheeran, though \u2014 they much prefer English country dances that were popular more than 200 years ago.",
      "As the music starts, about two dozen men and women curtsy and bow, extend a gloved hand to their partner, before dancing in circles or skipping in elaborate patterns around each other.",
      "Like many of her fellow Hampshire Regency Dancers, Potts is a devotee of Jane Austen and all things from the Regency period. Not only have they studied the books and watched all the screen adaptations \u2014 they also research the music, make their own period dresses, and immerse themselves in dances Austen and her characters would have enjoyed in centuries past.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been interested in Jane Austen since I was about 8 or 9,\u201d said Potts, 25. \u201cI mainly joined (the dance group) so I can have balls and things to go to in my costumes, but I really got into it. I\u2019ve been surprised how much I enjoy the dancing.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no shortage of grand costumed balls and historical dancing this year, which marks the 250th anniversary of Austen\u2019s birth. This weekend, thousands of fans who call themselves \u201cJaneites\u201d are descending on the city of Bath for a 10-day festival celebrating the beloved author of \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d and \u201cSense and Sensibility.\u201d",
      "The highlight is a Regency costumed promenade on Saturday, where some 2,000 people in their finest bonnets, bows and costumes will parade through the streets of Bath. Organizers say the extravaganza holds the Guinness World Record for the \u201clargest gathering of people dressed in Regency costumes.\u201d",
      "Bonny Wise, from Indiana, is attending her sixth Jane Austen festival in Bath. This time she\u2019s bringing four period dresses she made, and will lead a tour group of 25 Austen enthusiasts from all over the United States.",
      "\u201cI started planning a tour four years ago, when I realized this was a big year for Jane,\u201d said Wise, 69. She credited the 1995 adaptation of \u201cSense and Sensibility\u201d with sparking her obsession.",
      "\u201cThat movie just opened up a whole new world for me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou start with the books, the movies, then you start getting into the hats, the tea, the manners \u2026 one thing just led to another.\u201d",
      "Wise said she loves the wit, humor and social observations in Austen\u2019s books. She also finds the author\u2019s own life story inspiring.",
      "\u201cI admire Jane and what she managed as a woman in that era, her perseverance and her process of becoming an author,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re growing all the time because Jane Austen is timeless,\u201d said Mary Mintz, the group\u2019s president. \u201cWe have members from Japan, India. They come from every continent except Antarctica.\u201d",

      "Ed Sheeran has long sought to bring people together with his music, whether it be his emotionally resonant acoustic ballads or unproblematic, danceable pop hits",
      "NEW YORK -- Ed Sheeran has long sought to bring people together with his music, whether it be his emotionally resonant acoustic ballads or unproblematic, danceable pop hits. \u201cPlay,\u201d his eighth studio album out Friday, stays in that familiar lane for the most part.",
      "In his quest, Sheeran has maintained an everyman quality by carefully evolving with the status quo (while, largely, removing himself from public discourse, save his copyright court win and more recent promotional pop-ups in everyman places, like a New York City ice cream shop just this week). The aesthetic of Ed Sheeran, global star, still matches that of Ed Sheeran, up-and-coming troubadour. Most of the time, it's still just Sheeran, his guitar and his loop pedal against the world.",
      "Of course, Sheeran, like most pop stars, knows that as his stardom has risen and his audience widened, the meaning of that relatability has shifted. His listeners, over a decade in, know that too. So \u201cPlay,\u201d the first project in a new series from Sheeran named for symbols (he's said \u201cRewind\u201d will be next), uses Sheeran's global acclaim to his advantage \u2014 without straying too far from his singer-songwriter roots.",
      "Recorded throughout his \u201cMathematics World Tour\u201d and finished in Goa, India, the project feels split. There are moments that herald the return of Sheeran the hitmaker, an exciting development after his last two albums \u2014 the final chapter of his mathematics series, \u201cSubtract,\u201d and the folk-pop \u201cAutumn Variations\u201d \u2014 were well received but failed to produce the kind of chart-toppers that created Sheeran, the megastar. Most tracks, however, fall more in line with those albums, deviating little from the narrative songwriting toolkit that raised Sheeran, the artist.",
      "Sheeran turned to new collaborators for a couple songs that are already established hits. The addictive \u201cSapphire\u201d features Indian singer Arijit Singh, who ranks among Spotify's most popular artists globally. A Farsi version of the single \u201cAzizam,\u201d written and produced with Ilya Salmanzadeh, Savan Kotecha and Johnny McDaid, was released in April featuring Iranian singer Googoosh. Sheeran isn't just eyeing the U.S. and U.K. charts here \u2014 he's playing for cross-cultural domination, and having fun while doing it.",
      "The rest of the tracks, those that feel more classically Sheeran, see old themes recycled: \u201cOld Phone\u201d provides him the space to remember old friends and reminisce about his changing personal life, just as the landscape in 2017's \u201cCastle on the Hill\u201d provided a tangible marker of memory. The conceit of the sappily sweet \u201cCamera\u201d \u2014 \u201cI don't need a camera to capture this moment\u201d \u2014 comes in conflict with that of Sheeran's own beloved \u201cPhotograph\u201d from 2014's \u201cMultiply.\u201d",
      "There are still moments that feel like they'll stick: Sheeran's ode to his daughters, \u201cFor Always,\u201d with cooing backing vocals from co-writer Amy Allen, is sure to be a favorite father-daughter dance track, right behind the groovy \u201cThe Vow\u201d on wedding playlists.",
      "Sheeran flexes his pen on \u201cOpening,\u201d the album's first track. Bounded by glittery verses about boundaries, he raps about his family, his mental health, that court case, fame and what comes next. \u201cBeen a long time up top but I ain\u2019t complacent/If I look down I can see replacements,\u201d he raps at one point. \u201cGotta make dreams and chase them.\u201d",
      "Sheeran wants to be for everyone. And to do that, he'll still be an everyman.",

      "\u201cJaws\u201d is the subject of the first ever large-scale exhibit devoted to a single film at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Why would anyone keep a prop from the set of \u201cJaws?\u201d",
      "Steven Spielberg was musing about what it felt like while making his 1975 oceanic classic, and how little he thought any of it would matter when shooting the now-legendary opening scene of a woman night-swimming past an ocean buoy. His primary concern was keeping his job as a 26-year-old director amid unfolding disasters.",
      "\u201cHow did anybody know to take the buoy and take it home and sit on it for 50 years?\u201d he said.",
      "That prop is among the first things visitors will see as they enter a 50th anniversary \u201cJaws\u201d exhibit opening Sunday and running through July at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures.",
      "The exhibition featuring more than 200 pieces from the culture-changing blockbuster is the first full show in the four-year history of the museum that is dedicated to a single film. It comes amid a bevy of celebrations of the film's five-decade life, including a theatrical re-release last week.",
      "Spielberg spoke to a gathering of media at the museum after touring the exhibit, which takes visitors chronologically through the film's three acts, with some relic or recreation from virtually every scene.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just so proud of the work they\u2019ve done,\u201d the 78-year-old said. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve put together here at this exhibition is just awesome. Every room has the minutiae of how this picture got together.\u201d",
      "\u201cClearly this is a very historic initiative for us,\u201d museum director Amy Homma said before introducing the director and also announced the museum plans a full Spielberg retrospective in 2028.",
      "\u201cJaws\u201d has been essential to the Academy Museum, which opened in 2021 and is operated by the organization that gives out the Oscars.",
      "The only surviving full-scale mechanical shark from the production, 25 feet in length and nicknamed \u201cBruce\u201d by Spielberg after his lawyer, has permanently hung over the escalators since it opened.",
      "Homma said Bruce has become an \u201cunofficial mascot\u201d that \u201chelped to define this museum.\u201d",
      "The media preview was accompanied by a 68-piece orchestra playing John Williams\u2019 score. Two of the musicians played on the original.",
      "The exhibit includes a keyboard with instructions on how to play Williams' famously ominous two-note refrain that a generation of children learned to tap out on the piano.",
      "Similar novelties include a dolly-zoom setup to which visitors can attach their phone and shoot their own face to recreate perhaps the film\u2019s most famous shot, the zoom-in to star Roy Scheider\u2019s frightened gaze on the beach in the fictional town of Amity.",

And they can get a play-by-play of the processes of casting director Shari Rhodes and a team of screenwriters that included Peter Benchley, author of the novel.",
      "Spielberg said for him the exhibition above all \u201cproves that this motion picture industry is really truly a collaborative art form. No place for auteurs.\u201d",
      "He said the crew's camaraderie was the only thing that kept the production together.",
      "Their making of the riveting film was oddly enough marked mostly by boredom \u2014 endless waits because of unfavorable conditions, unwanted ships in the background and broken down equipment that led to the shoot going 100 days over schedule.",
      "\u201cI just really was not ready to endure the amount of obstacles that were thrown in our path, starting with Mother Nature,\u201d Spielberg said. \u201cMy hubris was we could take a Hollywood crew and go out 12 miles into the Atlantic Ocean and shoot an entire movie with a mechanical shark.

      "A new Whitney Houston song has arrived 13 years after her death",
      "NEW YORK -- It sounds impossible, but that's the magic of it. On Thursday, a new Whitney Houston song arrives 13 years after her death.",
      "English singer Calum Scott is responsible. The single is a duet between Scott and Houston, a balladic reinterpretation of the timeless \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me),\u201d using Houston's original vocal stems. (Stems are the individual musical elements that, when combined, make up a song.)",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even something I could have dreamt as a possibility, and the fact that I'm getting to do it is, geez, one of the honors of my career,\u201d Scott told The Associated Press. Houston's voice is one that soundtracked his childhood \u2014 courtesy his mom \u2014 and he refers to Houston as one of the most influential performers in his life and the lives of many.",
      "\u201cTimeless,\u201d he describes her.",
      "Here's how the new song came into existence.",
      "Such an undertaking couldn't be possible without the approval of a number of parties. Specifically, it required Pat Houston, Whitney\u2019s sister-in-law and the executor of her estate, and Primary Wave, which acquired the copyrights to hit Whitney Houston songs as part of a 2022 deal.",
      "Pat Houston says the idea for Scott's \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\u201d actually came from Primary Wave. They were familiar with Scott's live cover version of the song from his stint opening for Ed Sheeran in 2024. On that tour, Scott stripped the 1987 classic down into a ballad, blending it with Robyn's \u201cDancing On My Own.\u201d",
      "After hearing what Scott could do with the song \u2014 taking it from its up-tempo pop spirit to a big-hearted ballad, while also taking into consideration that 2025 marks the 40th anniversary of Houston's music career \u2014 Pat Houston was on board. It was yet another opportunity for celebration. \u201cI said, you know what, this is a no-brainer. This is the Houston style. So, let\u2019s go with this,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWhitney was a balladeer and that\u2019s why we all fell in love with her,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd Calum turned the song into a beautiful ballad.\u201d",
      "First, the Houston estate and Primary Wave provided Scott with the original vocal stems, produced by her longtime producer Narada Michael Walden. Then Scott recorded the song with producers Jon \u201cMAGS\u201d Maguire, Andrew Yeates and Charlie T in the U.K. in \u201cabout a week,\u201d he recalls. They were joined by a string section, which gave additional dimension to their somber take on the song.",
      "\u201cTake a pop song and make it sad,\u201d Scott jokes of his approach.",
      "Recording the ballad made sense because, as Scott points out, the lyrics to the original song are a bit melancholic. \u201cYou want to dance with somebody who loved you, you know, you're not actually dancing with them,\u201d he says. It's about yearning. But in an early demo, the chorus was recorded in a minor chord \u2014 which sounded a bit too depressing. The change was made swiftly; even slowed, the song needed some of that Houston ebullience.",

      "Another early decision: The new song would start with just Houston's voice, alone, in the first verse. \u201cWhitney starts the song because this is her song,\u201d Scott says simply. \u201cI would never dare stand in front of Whitney for that first verse.\u201d",
      "Eagle-eyed (eared?) fans might notice the sound of a snare drum bleeding into her vocal on that verse \u2014 because it was originally recorded to tape, not digitally, and because \u201cwe can\u2019t change anything like that because those are etched into the song and into her vocal,\u201d says Scott. \u201cAnd to remove it would be taking a piece away.\u201d",
      "It's one of the reasons they kept the song's iconic key change in the last chorus as well.",
      "\u201cI really had to dig for those high notes,\u201d he says of the recording. \u201cIt was an honor just to harmonize with her.\u201d",
      "Scott looked to the original songwriters for approval \u2014 the dream team of George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam. They were immediately on board.",
      "\u201cSome people would have come in and they would have added something ... to boost their visibility next to Whitney. And he had the boldness to tear it all down and just have acoustic piano, just Whitney, and then give her the first verse,\u201d said Merrill. \u201cAnd I mean, this is his project. To me, that\u2019s showing such respect.\u201d",
      "That, and they recognize Scott as a virtuosic vocalist. \u201cHis music really features his voice, as with Adele or Whitney, and rightly so because he can carry it off,\u201d said Rubicam. \u201cThere aren\u2019t just hundreds of people who can carry that off with his kind of power.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a good vocal match together,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey both got a lot of emotionality and command also of their vocal instrument. ... Whitney could overpower a lot of people. But for Calum, he\u2019s confident and he had a vision about it and they both are meeting at an emotional level.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like I gently walked alongside Whitney,\u201d says Scott. The song is meant to feel alive, channeling the spirit of Houston \u2014 not a tribute, but an active single. It's why their version of \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\u201d will be featured on his new album \u201cAvenoir,\u201d out Oct. 10.",
      "\u201cThis is as much part of my story as any other song on the album,\u201d he says. \u201cJust being given the honor of it has been, you know, I could die a very happy man now.\u201d",
      "\u201cForty years ago, this particular song was hot then and it\u2019s hot now,\u201d says Pat Houston. \u201cSo why not keep producing. But it\u2019s the right connection, it's the right platform and it certainly is the right artist to collab with her on this.\u201d",

      "\"Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale\" brings change to the Crawley family as they face the 1930s",
      "Change comes slowly to the Downton Abbey universe and its Crawley family. Just watch Robert Crawley go flat-hunting in London.",
      "Wait, what? FLAT-HUNTING? The Earl of Grantham? Well, yes, and it\u2019s the most amusing scene in \u201cDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale\u201d (a self-announcing title if there ever was one).",
      "Just look at proud and starched Robert (Hugh Bonneville), trying to be open-minded but utterly flummoxed by this \u201cflat\u201d in which you cannot go \u201cup\u201d to bed because there is no \u201cup.\u201d Well, you can go \u201calong\u201d to bed, suggests daughter Mary (Michelle Dockery, as always the sensible center of things) trying to make it all sound manageable.",
      "But the prospect of flat-living \u2014 rather than maintaining a mansion in London \u2014 is a thing the Crawleys must consider as they move into the 1930s, with financial and social instability always around the corner. \u201cFamilies like us need to keep moving to survive,\u201d says Mary, with the weight of Downton Abbey\u2019s future itself resting on her shoulders.",
      "A note to those coming in cold to the franchise here: Well, it\u2019s going to be quite hard. Writer Julian Fellowes and director Simon Curtis do not engage in hand-holding when it comes to mastering the Crawley family tree or the broader family of servants that Downton fans know and love. Even those who saw the first two films \u2013 the last in 2022 \u2013 might feel the need for a refresher.",
      "We begin in London\u2019s West End, at a show by Noel Coward, attended by Downton inhabitants from all levels. They\u2019re all there to watch dashing actor Guy Dexter (Dominic West), who in the last movie asked former butler Thomas Barrow to become his dresser, and more. It\u2019s nice to see Barrow is happy now, able to live life as a gay man \u2014 even if Robert can\u2019t quite grasp their relationship (change is slow, remember).",
      "Meanwhile Mary is shopping in London with sister Edith, and the importance of this scene is perhaps to remind us that the real star of the \u201cDownton\u201d universe, after that stupendous house of course, are the costumes. Mary finds a sleek red satin gown that is quite possibly the most smashing outfit we\u2019ve seen yet.",
      "But when she puts it on for a society ball, trouble erupts. As the family arrives we learn that Mary\u2019s divorce decree has come through \u2014 and this means, alas, that she will become a pariah. The newspaper screams news of \u201cdivorce in high places,\u201d and indeed, the ball\u2019s hostess actually kicks Mary out of the party because royalty is coming. Mary\u2019s concerned parents are outraged \u2014 but they stay, and their daughter heads out, quipping that she hopes a taxi will agree to take her.",
      "Soon enough we\u2019re back at Downton, and there is one very big difference: no longer does Violet Crawley, aka Maggie Smith, with her inimitable style and those hilarious quips, rule the halls. She died in the last film \u2014 and Smith died in 2024. But the film is dedicated to her in more ways than one.",

      "Harold arrives from America with some unfortunate news \u2013 he\u2019s wasted away much of their family fortune.

The playwright is the closest thing in Downton world to a modern celebrity \u2014 everyone wants to be with him, no matter station nor gender, and he winds up helping Mary overcome her social shunning.",
      "Nowhere to be seen is dashing Hugh Dancy, who played a film director (besotted with Mary) in the last movie. But the character that director anointed as a screenwriter, Joseph Moseley (Kevin Doyle), is back, and Fellowes must have enjoyed writing this line for him: \u201cIn many ways the writers are the stars of cinema.\u201d",

      "\u201cSometimes I feel that the past is a more comfortable place than the future,\u201d someone says in a poignant moment.

      "Movie theaters across the country are pulling out the stops for Dick Van Dyke\u2019s 100th birthday in December. A new documentary about the song and dance man\u2019s life, \u201cDick Van Dyke: 100th Celebration,\u201d will be in theaters over his birthday weekend on Dec. 13 and 14, Fathom Entertainment said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful; a total surprise for me,\u201d Van Dyke said in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cIf you don\u2019t think luck has a lot to do with it, then you\u2019re mistaken.\u201d",
      "The feature length film has been in the works for over three decades. In telling the story of Van Dyke's 80-plus years in entertainment, the film weaves together clips from classic films, like \u201cMary Poppins,\u201d \u201cChitty Chitty Bang Bang\u201d and \u201cBye Bye Birdie,\u201d and television shows, including \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show\u201d and \u201cDiagnosis: Murder,\u201d as well as new interviews with Van Dyke in which he shares never-before-heard stories from his time in Hollywood.",
      "The portrait is bookended with a visit to his hometown of Danville, Illinois, where he visits his childhood home, the radio station where he started his career as a DJ at age 16 and his old high school where he took the stage once more to join in with the students performing songs from some of his most beloved films.",
      "\u201cHe couldn\u2019t help himself,\u201d filmmaker Steve Boettcher said. \u201cHe got out of the seat and went up on stage and sang and danced with them. It\u2019s really a sweet coming home. Danville built him in so many ways.\u201d",
      "Over the past 30 years, Boettcher also spoke many of his closest Hollywood friends and collaborators including Mary Tyler Moore,Carl Reiner,Rose Marie,Morey Amsterdam,Betty White,Tim Conway and Chita Rivera, all of whom have since died.",

      "Holliday earned four Golden Globe nominations and won one in 1980 for \u201cAlice,\u201d as well as four Emmy Award nominations, three for \u201cAlice\u201d and one for \u201cFlo.\u201d",

      "Curator Madeleine Haddon said the never-made film \u2014 titled \u201cYoung Americans,\u201d like Bowie\u2019s 1975 album of the same name \u2014 is \u201creflective on what it\u2019s like to be a Brit in the U.S., and thinking about international politics and their place in the world.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s about \u201cthe relationship between art and politics in London at the cusp of modernity,\u201d Haddon said Wednesday at a preview of V&A's David Bowie Centre. \u201cI would love to see where he was going with that.\u201d",
      "The center, which opens Saturday, is a treasure chest for Bowie fans and researchers, holding everything from stage outfits and musical instruments \u2013 a stringed Japanese koto, Ziggy Stardust\u2019s acoustic guitar \u2013 to letters, lyrics, photos, to-do lists and idea-filled sticky notes.",
      "The archive chronicles decades of restless creativity by the shape-shifting musician, who was born plain old David Jones in the London suburbs in 1947.",
      "Bowie donned and shed personas as he moved through musical styles, from glam rock to soul, electronica and collaborations with British jungle and drum \u2018n\u2019 bass musicians, including A Guy Called Gerald and Goldie. He also acted in movies and on Broadway, collaborated on stage shows, painted and embraced technology, setting up a 1990s internet service provider called BowieNet.",
      "\u201cHe was such a world-builder,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cMusic was (just) one angle into the worlds he wanted to build.\u201d",
      "The archive occupies part of the V&A East Storehouse, a hybrid warehouse-museum that opened in June in east London\u2019s Olympic Park.

      "\u201cThe Alexander McQueen costumes and some of the Ziggy costumes are proving particularly popular,\u201d said V&A archivist Sabrina Offord.",

      "Real moviegoer energy has always made the Toronto International Film Festival a good measuring stick for not just what might catch on during Hollywood\u2019s awards season but what will click with audiences",
      "TORONTO -- Anyone will tell you it\u2019s the audiences that make the Toronto International Film Festival. They aren\u2019t purely industry folks, like they are in Cannes or Venice, but more boisterous, enthusiastic moviegoers with their own rituals, like growling like buccaneers at the piracy warning that plays before each screening.",
      "That real-moviegoer energy has always made TIFF a good measuring stick for not just what might catch on during Hollywood\u2019s awards season, but also what will click with audiences. Yet there might be no more endangered species in today\u2019s film industry than the kind of crowd-pleaser that thrives in Toronto.",
      "More than most years, this year\u2019s festival, which wraps up this weekend, has been a veritable ark for the castaways of today\u2019s Hollywood: star-driven dramas, big-screen comedies, adult-oriented movies without a whiff of franchise about them. All struggled to reach the screen in the first place. But for many of these movies, the fight to reach audiences is just getting started.",
      "One of the standouts was Derek Cianfrance\u2019s \u201cRoofman,\u201d a stranger-than-fiction true tale about a North Carolina man (Channing Tatum) imprisoned for robbing dozens of McDonald's by burrowing in from their roofs. He escapes prison and, instead of trying to outrun the authorities, hides out for weeks inside a Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. Cianfrance, the grittily realistic filmmaker of \u201cBlue Valentine\u201d and \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines,\u201d uses the story as a funny and oddly moving examination of box-store materialism. Paramount will release it Oct. 10.",
      "\u201cWhen I was shopping it around, a lot of people were saying, \u2018We don\u2019t make movies like this anymore,\u2019\u201d Cianfrance said. \u201cSo it\u2019s really hard. It\u2019s one of the reasons why there are so many production credits on the front of the movie. I had to get it from everywhere to be able to do it.\u201d",
      "The movie industry is coming off a summer that fell painfully shy of expectations. May-to-Labor Day ticket sales at the North American box office came to about $3.67 billion, according to Comscore, well short of the $4 billion-plus season that was once automatic. You could point to numerous reasons for that, like the diminished potency of superhero films or that Sony Pictures Animation\u2019s \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d the biggest hit of the summer, launched on Netflix, not in theaters.",
      "But it\u2019s also true that Hollywood, mostly concerned with hitting home runs, is badly in need of some doubles, too.",
      "This year\u2019s TIFF was full of good candidates, though some of them will be steered toward streaming platforms. That includes Rian Johnson\u2019s deliciously gothic, surprisingly sincere, church-set whodunit \u201cWake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery,\u201d which Netflix will give a two-week theatrical release despite its director\u2019s strong affinity for theaters.",
      "And Paul Greengrass\u2019 \u201cThe Lost Bus,\u201d a disaster movie for the age of climate change, will likewise get a quick two weeks in theaters before landing on Apple TV+. Starring Matthew McConaughey as a bus driver rescuing kids during the 2018 Camp Fire, Greengrass' film viscerally captures the swift-spreading blaze, as well as the dry, tinderbox landscape it rose out of.",
      "But even a brief theatrical run can be hard-won. Nia DaCosta\u2019s \u201cHedda,\u201d a stylish 1950s-set Ibsen adaptation starring Tessa Thompson, will launch in theaters Oct. 22 before detouring to Prime Video a week later.",
      "\u201cLiterally three months after it was greenlit, people were like: This movie wouldn\u2019t happen anymore,\u201d DaCosta said. \u201cWe were with Orion Pictures, a full theatrical release, and then the strikes happened. We were holding. We had to fight for the movie to stay alive. We lived but the consequence of that was theatrical window and then Prime Video. We did feel that industry shift. But I\u2019m really proud we got to make it.\u201d",

But tastes are always changing. Donna Langley, chief of Universal Pictures, noted as much in her talk at the festival.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the shift in horror,\u201d said Langley, who pointed to \u201cauteur directors turning to horror.\u201d \"It\u2019s not the horror as we came to know over the last decade.\u201d",
      "Fate, like it does in \u201cEternity\u201d and \u201cGood Fortune,\u201d will soon have its say for this year's crop of crowd pleasers in search of ticket-buying crowds. Some signs are ominous. Last year\u2019s winner of the festival\u2019s People's Choice Award \u2014 the most watched honor of TIFF and usually a signal of a surefire best-picture nomination \u2014 went to the Stephen King adaptation \u201cThe Life of Chuck.\u201d Mike Flanagan's film didn\u2019t have distribution at the time, and when Neon ultimately released it in June, \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d went mostly unnoticed. It was a reminder that success in Toronto no longer guarantees anything.",
      "Some are taking distribution into their own hands. Black Bear Pictures, the production company behind last year\u2019s \u201cSing Sing,\u201d announced that it will distribute one of the buzziest TIFF entries: David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s \u201cChristy,\u201d starring Sydney Sweeney as the boxer Christy Martin. Black Bear co-financed \u201cChristy,\u201d just as it did two other highlights of TIFF: Clint Bentley\u2019s Denis Johnson adaptation \u201cTrain Dreams,\u201d a hit at Sundance, and Daniel Roher\u2019s \u201cTuner.\u201d",
      "\u201cTuner,\u201d which played without distribution in place, stars Leo Woodall (\u201cThe White Lotus\u201d) as a piano tuner with a pitch-perfect ear who, after his father-figure partner (Dustin Hoffman) falls ill, uses his gift to crack open safes. It's a crackling crime thriller, and \u2014 like so many of the movies at TIFF \u2014 the kind of movie that supposedly doesn't get made anymore. And yet movies like \u201cTuner\u201d do get made, somehow, and will keep finding a way to do so, so long as audiences show up for them.",
      "\u201cSomeone wrote, \u2018This movie-movies really hard,\u2019\u201d Roher said at the premiere, citing a review. \u201cI was like: That\u2019s right. That was the intention.\u201d",

      "Julian Fellowes has been saying goodbye to \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d for nearly as long as it has existed. By the fifth season of the series, he\u2019d even grown accustomed to writing more definitive endings, not knowing that there would be a sixth season and three feature films to come.",
      "But 15 years after the world first met Violet Crawley, Lord Grantham, Lady Mary, Mr. Carson, John Bates and everyone else upstairs and downstairs at that beautiful estate, the creators are really, truly closing a chapter and saying farewell with \u201cDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale,\u201d which opens in theaters nationwide Friday.",
      "\u201cIt is sad,\u201d Fellowes said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s been a huge chunk of my life. And when I die, I think it\u2019ll probably be the only job anyone remembers. But I hope it\u2019s been happy.\u201d",
      "\u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d which was conceived by producer Gareth Neame as a kind of spinoff to \u201cGosford Park,\u201d was in many ways an improbable hit. In an era of television that celebrated difficult men and antiheroes, here was a warm British period drama about aristocrats and their household staff that became a global phenomenon and, later, a successful film franchise. The first two features, released in 2019 and 2022, grossed more than $287 million at the worldwide box office.",
      "\u201cNone of us knew it was going to be a success,\u201d said actor Hugh Bonneville, who plays Lord Grantham. \u201cI remember Gareth saying to me, \u2018Let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s not going to run beyond seven episodes, these sorts of shows don\u2019t.\u2019\u201d",
      "But audiences never seemed to tire of the Downton crew. The longer it went on, the more it became part of the furniture.",
      "\u201cIt has been this remarkable journey,\u201d Neame said. \u201cWe look at the Grantham family, the Crawleys, as a representative of the families that we all live in because we\u2019ve seen them marry and have children and pass away and get money and lose money and become sick and get well again, hopefully. There\u2019s something extremely comforting about that.\u201d",
      "Despite the success of the show, which ended in 2015, a feature film was never a given. From a studio perspective, Neame said, there were very few precedents and the ones that existed were not positive. Money always seemed to be lost. But the bigger headache was the idea that even if they got the greenlight to make a film, they\u2019d have to assemble more than 20 specific actors to do it. And they needed every one.",
      "\u201cWe said goodbye when we finished the TV show and didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever come back,\u201d Bonneville said. \u201cI said, it\u2019s like herding cats, he\u2019ll never get us together again. And, blow me down, he did, not once but three times.\u201d",
      "They were difficult negotiations, Neame said, and much more complicated than anyone might imagine, but there was still such goodwill that they made it work. Especially for this last film, he said, \u201ceveryone wanted to give it a proper conclusion and see an ending for all of those characters.\u201d",
      "In the first film, the family prepared for a visit from the king and the queen. In the second, they traveled to the South of France and said goodbye to the Dowager, Maggie Smith's sharp, beloved matriarch who had been with the show from the beginning and was a large part of the reason it even got made. There were many farewell parties for her on set. Then, two years after the film was released, Smith died at 89.",

      "It would be naive in this era of intellectual property to say definitively that there will never be more \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d stories. People regularly ask Fellowes if there might ever be a crossover with his current series, \u201cThe Gilded Age.\u201d",

      "The World Health Organization said limited access and adequate funding are a key challenge in its response to the Ebola outbreak in southern Congo",
      "KINSHASA, Congo -- Limited access and required funding are the key challenges facing health officials trying to respond to the latest Ebola outbreak in southern Congo, the World Health Organization said on Friday.",
      "It is the first Ebola outbreak in 18 years in Kasai province, a remote part of Congo with poor road networks, which is more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from the nation\u2019s capital of Kinshasa.",
      "A United Nations peacekeeping helicopter was used to help deliver 400 vaccine doses to the epicenter, in the locality of Bulape, on Friday, Patrick Otim, WHO's programme area manager, told a briefing in Geneva.",
      "An additional 1,500 doses will be sent from the capital of Kinshasa, he said.",
      "\u201cWe have struggled in the last seven days with access but are collaborating with MONUSCO (UN peacekeeping mission in Congo) now,\u201d Otim said.",
      "While the WHO and Congolese authorities have \u201cramped up efforts to have a full scale response\u201d on ground, \u201cwe need to be able to pay for the operations,\u201d he added.",

      "Otim said the most recent confirmed case was located 70 kilometers (43 miles) from the current epicenter. \u201cOur worry is if we get cases in the other health zone, we need to expand and it will be resource-intensive,\u201d he said.",
      "WHO\u2019s projected cost for the current outbreak over the next three months is $20 million while Congo\u2019s national response plan is estimated at $78 million, said Otim.",
      "A major concern has been the impact of recent U.S. funding cuts. The U.S. had supported the response to Congo\u2019s past Ebola outbreaks, including in 2021 when the U.S. Agency for International Development provided up to $11.5 million to support efforts across Africa.",

      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is willing to risk a government shutdown at the end of the month if Republicans don\u2019t accept Democratic demands on health care",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer weathered backlash from Democrats earlier this year when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open. But he\u2019s now willing to risk a shutdown at the end of the month if Republicans don\u2019t accede to Democratic demands.",
      "Schumer says he and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries are united in opposing any legislation that doesn\u2019t include key health care provisions and a commitment not to roll them back. He argues that the country is in a different place than it was in March, when he vigorously argued against a shutdown, and he says he believes Republicans and President Donald Trump will be held responsible if they don\u2019t negotiate a bipartisan deal.",
      "\u201cThings have changed\u201d since the March vote, Schumer said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday. He said Republicans have since passed Trump\u2019s massive tax breaks and spending cuts legislation, which trimmed Medicaid and other government programs, and Democrats are now unified \u2014 unlike in March, when he voted with Republicans and Jeffries voted against legislation to fund the government.",
      "A shutdown, Schumer said, wouldn\u2019t necessarily worsen an environment in which Trump is already challenging the authority of Congress. \u201cIt will get worse with or without it, because Trump is lawless,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "Schumer\u2019s threat comes as Republicans are considering a short-term stopgap spending measure to avoid a Sept. 30 shutdown and as Democrats face what most see as two tough choices if the parties can\u2019t negotiate a deal \u2014 vote with Republicans to keep the government open or let it close indefinitely with no clear exit plan.",
      "It also comes amid worsening partisan tensions in the Senate, where negotiations between the two parties over the confirmation process broke down for a second time Thursday and Republicans are changing Senate rules to get around Democratic objections. Democrats are also fuming over the Trump administration\u2019s decision to unilaterally claw back $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid just as negotiations over the spending deadline were getting underway in late August.",
      "Republicans have said that Democrats clearly will be to blame if they don\u2019t vote to keep the government open, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has repeatedly said that Schumer needs to come to them with a specific proposal on health care, including an extension of expanded government tax credits for many Americans who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Some Republicans are open to extending those credits before they expire at the end of the year.",

      "Less realistic is Democrats\u2019 demand that Republicans roll back Medicaid cuts enacted in their tax breaks and spending cuts legislation this summer, what Trump called his \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d",
      "Schumer said Democrats also want Republicans to commit that the White House won\u2019t take back money they have negotiated and Congress has approved after Republicans pushed through a $9 billion cut requested by the White House in July and Trump blocked the additional foreign aid money in August. \u201cHow do you pass an appropriations bill and let them undo it down the road?\u201d Schumer said.",
      "Schumer\u2019s move to support the spending legislation in March put him in the rare position of bucking his party\u2019s base. He said then that of two bad options, a partial government shutdown was worse because it would give Trump even more control to shut down agencies and there would be \u201cno off-ramp\u201d to get out of it. \u201cI think people realize it\u2019s a tough choice,\u201d he said.",
      "He faced massive backlash from within the party after the vote, with some activists calling on him to resign. Jeffries temporarily distanced himself from his New York colleague, saying in a statement immediately after Schumer\u2019s vote that House Democrats \u201cwill not be complicit.\u201d The majority of Senate Democrats also voted against the plan.",
      "This time, though, Schumer is in lockstep with Jeffries and in messaging within his caucus. In Democrats\u2019 closed-door lunch Wednesday, he shared polling that he said suggested most Americans would blame Trump, not Democrats, for a shutdown.",
      "\u201cI did what I thought was right\u201d in March, Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different situation now than then.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to subpoena medical records of transgender patients who received gender-affirming care at Boston Children's Hospital.",
      "In a ruling on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Myong Joun said the administrative subpoena served by the U.S. Department of Justice was improper and \u201cmotivated only by bad faith.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department said the information was needed to investigate possible fraud or unlawful off-label promotion of drugs, but the information requested \u2014 including actual patient records \u2014 seemed to be unrelated, the judge said. Phone messages left with the Justice Department\u2019s attorney Ross Goldstein and with a Justice Department public affairs officer were not immediately returned.",
      "\u201cThe Administration has been explicit about its disapproval of the transgender community and its aim to end GAC,\u201d Joun wrote, referring to gender-affirming care. The judge later continued, \u201cIt is abundantly clear that the true purpose of issuing the subpoena is to interfere with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' right to protect GAC within its borders, to harass and intimidate BCH to stop providing such care, and to dissuade patients from seeking such care.\u201d",
      "Just eight days after taking office, President Donald Trump issued an executive order aimed at restricting access to medical care for transgender youth. In June, the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division announced the division would use \u201call available resources to prioritize investigations of doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and other appropriate entities,\u201d in an effort to investigate what it called \u201cradical gender experimentation.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in a statement July 9 that the Justice Department had sent more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics that provide care to transgender patients under 18. Bondi said the requests were part of investigations into \u201chealthcare fraud, false statements, and more.\u201d But the requests did not just seek information on policies or billing practices \u2014 they also demanded information about individual patients who had been prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy.",
      "Boston Children's Hospital asked the federal court to quash the subpoena on July 8, saying the Justice Department was seeking practically every document related to the provision of gender-affirming care over the past five and a half years, including highly sensitive and personally identifiable information about young patients.",
      "But the Justice Department contended the subpoena was proper and a valid way for the agency to investigate potential violations of off-label prescription drug rules.",

It may include counseling, medications that block puberty, hormone therapy to produce physical changes or surgeries to transform chests and genitals, although those are rare for minors.",

      "Every time humans cut into the Amazon rainforest or burn or destroy parts of it, they're making people sick.",
      "It's an idea Indigenous people have lived by for thousands of years. Now a new study in the journal Communications Earth & Environment adds to the scientific evidence supporting it, by finding that instances of several diseases were lowered in areas where forest was set aside for Indigenous peoples who maintained it well.",
      "With the United Nations climate summit set for Brazil in November, the study authors and outside experts said the work highlights the stakes for people around the world as negotiators try to address climate change. Belem, the city hosting the conference, is known as the gateway to the Amazon, and many who will be attending, from activists to delegates, think the role of Indigenous communities in climate action and conservation will be highlighted in a distinct way.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018forest man\u2019 or \u2018man forest,\u2019 according to the Indigenous perspective, has always been linked to the reciprocity between human health and the natural environment where one lives,\u201d said Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez Cayetano, president of the Federation of Ticuna and Yagua Communities of the Lower Amazon, or FECOTYBA, in the Peruvian Amazon. \u201cIf each state does not guarantee the rights and territories of Indigenous peoples, we would inevitably be harming their health, their lives, and the ecosystem itself.\u201d",
      "That harm can look like respiratory diseases such as asthma caused by toxic air pollution after fires, or illnesses that spread from animals to humans such as malaria, said Paula Prist, a senior program coordinator for the Forest and Grasslands Unit at the International Union for Conservation of Nature and one of the study authors.",
      "The researchers compiled and analyzed data on forest quality, legal recognition of Indigenous territory and disease incidence in the countries that border and include the Amazon.",
      "The work was \u201cimpressive\u201d to University of Washington health and climate scientist Kristie Ebi. She said it highlighted the complexity of factors that affect human health, and the importance of understanding the role Indigenous communities play in shaping it. \u201cUsing these methods, others could study other parts of the world,\u201d she said.",
      "The researchers found creative ways to account for other variables that can affect the spread of diseases, like access to health care in a given area, said Magdalena Hurtado, an anthropology and global health professor at Arizona State University and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences who was not involved with the study. But she expressed concern that the findings were presented with a precision that may not be warranted, given that they were based on correlation and use data on observations that can be difficult to measure.",
      "\u201cThey claim that Indigenous territories only protect health when forest cover is above 40%. And so that that feels like, why 40%? Why not 35? Or why not a range?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the study is wrong, but it means that we need to be cautious because the patterns could change if different, more precise methods were used.\u201d",
      "Still, she thinks this is a starting point that could open the door to future research. \u201cThey are actually doing something quite beautiful,\u201d empirically connecting the legal recognition of Indigenous lands to human health outcomes, she said.",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez, of FECOTYBA, said that's important for the global policymakers who are coming to Brazil.",

      "KATHMANDU, Nepal -- Two days of deadly violence left the streets of Kathmandu resembling a war zone. Nepal\u2019s major symbols of power like Parliament, the Supreme Court, and the president\u2019s house were burned by angry protesters. The prime minister was forced to quit, and no one seemed to be in control.",

      "Five days after the violence began, Nepalis are still wondering who is in charge of the country where 34 people were killed in protests sparked by a short-lived social media ban and fueled by broader discontent against the government. But with the army stepping up, many people are breathing a sigh of relief, in contrast to some other countries where citizens are usually fearful of the military taking over the civilian government in moments of crisis.",

      "The military in Nepal, which has also fought a bloody Maoist rebellion, is rarely mobilized in the Himalayan nation wedged between China and India. It is also not known for battling enemy troops at the border and has mostly been confined to barracks. It is normally sought out only when there are floods, landslides or rescues during earthquakes.",
      "Yet it is hugely popular. In the past, it has restored order in difficult times, particularly during the massive pro-democracy protests in the 1990 and the antimonarchy 2006 demonstrations that ended with the abolition of the monarchy.",

      "This week\u2019s deadly protests, however, could very well be the greatest challenge it has faced so far.",
      "So far, the military has been successful in bringing calm, quelling a jailbreak in the heart of the capital, Kathmandu, and initiating talks with the protesters on naming a transitional leader. On Friday, Nepal\u2019s president, army officials and representatives from various protesting groups held meetings to decide on a name.",

      "JERUSALEM -- When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered this week\u2019s attempted assassination of Hamas leaders in Qatar, he took a major gamble in his campaign to pound the group into submission.",
      "With signs growing that the mission failed, that gamble appears to have backfired.",
      "Netanyahu had hoped to kill Hamas' senior exiled leaders to get closer toward his vision of \u201ctotal victory\u201d against the militant group that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and pressure it into surrendering after nearly two years of war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Instead, Hamas claims its leaders survived, and Netanyahu's global standing, already badly damaged by the scenes of destruction and humanitarian disaster in Gaza, took another hit.",
      "The airstrike Tuesday has enraged Qatar, an influential U.S. ally that has been a key mediator throughout the war, and drawn heavy criticism across the Arab world. It also has strained relations with the White House and thrown hopes of reaching a ceasefire into disarray, potentially endangering the 20 hostages still believed to be alive in Gaza.",
      "But while the strike marks a setback for Netanyahu, the Israeli leader shows no sign of backing down or halting the war. And with his hard-line coalition still firmly behind him, Netanyahu faces no immediate threat to his rule.",
      "Five low-level Hamas members and a Qatari security guard were killed in the strike. But Hamas has said the intended target, senior exiled leaders meeting to discuss a new U.S. ceasefire proposal, all survived. The group, however, has not released any photos of the leaders, and Qatar has not commented on their conditions.",
      "If the airstrike had killed the top leadership, the attack could have provided Netanyahu an opportunity declare Hamas\u2019 destruction, said Harel Chorev, an expert on Arab affairs at Tel Aviv University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all very symbolic and it\u2019s definitely part of the thing which allows Netanyahu at a certain point to say \u2018We won, we killed them all,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Israel\u2019s fierce 23-month offensive in Gaza has wiped out all of Hamas\u2019 top leadership inside the territory. But Netanyahu has set out to eradicate the group as part of his goal of \u201ctotal victory.\u201d",
      "That is now looking increasingly unlikely, making it even harder for Netanyahu to push a ceasefire through his hard-line coalition.",
      "Far-right members of Israel\u2019s governing coalition have cornered Netanyahu, threatening to topple his government unless Israel pushes ahead with an expanded operation in Gaza City, despite serious misgivings by many in the military leadership and widespread opposition among Israel\u2019s public.",
      "A successful operation in Qatar could have allowed Netanyahu to placate the hard-liners, even though it would have eliminated the very officials responsible for negotiating a possible ceasefire.",
      "Israel has had the ability to target Hamas leaders in Doha from the start of the war but did not want to antagonize the Qataris while negotiations took place, Chorev said.",
      "Qatar has helped negotiate two previous ceasefires that have released 148 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for thousands of Palestinian prisoners. Israel\u2019s military has rescued just eight hostages alive, and retrieved the bodies of 51 hostages.",
      "While Israel has complained that Qatar was not putting pressure on Hamas, it had continued to leave that channel open \u2014 until Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIsrael, by the attack, notified the whole world that it gave up on the negotiations,\u201d Chorev said. \u201cThey\u2019ve decided to burn the channel with Qatar.\"",
      "Asked if ceasefire talks would continue, Qatar\u2019s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said that after the strike, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything valid\u201d in the current talks.

      "Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic is intensifying his crackdown on protests challenging his rule",
      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic is escalating his crackdown on protests that have shaken his populist rule in recent months. What began as a small, student-led campaign against corruption has snowballed into one of the most turbulent protest waves in the Balkan country in a quarter of a century.",
      "Rights groups and Vucic's political opponents have warned of increasingly brutal tactics aimed at silencing a movement that has become the biggest challenge yet to his decade-long grip on power.",
      "Last week, tanks rolled through the capital, Belgrade, in preparation for a military parade on Sept. 20. If the parade becomes a flashpoint for unrest, protesters fear the military could remain on the streets.",
      "Vucic has ruled Serbia for more than a decade, reshaping its politics while drawing accusations of corruption and authoritarianism.",
      "He began his political career in the 1990s as a hardline nationalist in the Serbian Radical Party, becoming information minister under the late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic. He was notorious for his calls to punish independent media and his wartime rhetoric against Serbia's neighbors which he maintains to this day.",
      "Serbia was defeated in the wars in the Balkans, Milosevic was ousted by a wave of protests in October 2000, and Vucic reinvented himself as a pro-European reformer. He co-founded the Serbian Progressive Party, which promised modernization and EU integration, but he consolidated his power through populism, control of the media, and a tight grip on state institutions.",
      "On Nov. 1, 2024, a canopy collapsed at the railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad, killing at least 16 people. The tragedy, tied to a Chinese-backed renovation project, sparked outrage over alleged state-run corruption and negligence.",
      "University students were the first to protest, blocking traffic every Friday for 15 minutes in memory of the dead.",
      "But the anger over corruption quickly resonated beyond campuses, drawing crowds of ordinary citizens frustrated with rising costs of living and a sense of impunity among ruling-party elites.",
      "Protesters now demand accountability, transparency, and early elections.",
      "At first, the demonstrations were peaceful marches and sit-ins. But tensions rose when authorities deployed riot police, plainclothes officers and even shady parapolice units, led by soccer hooligans loyal to Vucic, to disperse the gatherings with batons, sticks and flares.",
      "Protesters reported beatings, arbitrary arrests, and the use of tear gas, stun grenades and sonic devices \u2014 tactics that rights groups have condemned as brutal and excessive.",
      "The harsh response from the authorities has fueled defiance. Students have escalated their actions by blocking major intersections, occupying university halls, and staging sit-ins outside state institutions. Each new crackdown has drawn more people into the streets, creating a cycle of confrontation.",
      "And while previous waves of protests petered out over a disputed property development, allegations of stolen elections and two mass shootings, this time the protests have built up over time. Crucially, they spread beyond Belgrade to dozens of cities and small towns across the country.",
      "Vucic has repeatedly branded the student protesters as \u201cterrorists\u201d who are working in conjunction with Western powers to remove him from office, without presenting any evidence. Although he has called for a dialogue with the students, he has refused to call early elections and warned of an even harsher response to the protests.",
      "Students flatly rejected the offer of talks before early elections. In response to the student demands, authorities sacked more than 100 teachers, professors and deans and replaced them with Vucic's loyalists.",

      "He attended a summit on Sept.1 with leaders from China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, where he said he received their support in dealing with the protests at home. He has also refused to join international sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.",
      "However, he has also made no move to block Serbian exports of weapons to Ukraine and earlier this year, he made his first-ever visit to Kyiv, signaling a willingness to engage with Western-aligned nations.",
      "Serbia has been a candidate for EU membership since 2012, but negotiations have made slow progress.",
      "Vucic's tenure is marked by a centralization of power, suppression of dissent, and tight control over the media, drawing scrutiny from human rights organizations.",
      "He has openly advocated the closure of the last remaining independent TV outlets, N1 and Nova, or a purge of reporters and management. He has called them liars for their coverage of the protests, although they mainly broadcast live, with minimal intervention from editors or commentators.",

      "Lebanese dancer Alexandre Paulikevitch takes to the stage in Beirut, defying extremist threats",
      "BEIRUT -- BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Alexandre Paulikevitch put on his white dress and wig and danced his way to center stage, knowing that the extremist groups who had threatened him before his controversial recital might be waiting for him outside the theater.",
      "The Lebanese dancer\u2019s sold-out performance to a cheering crowd at a popular Beirut venue had angered fundamentalist movements ranging from the right-wing Christian Soldiers of God to Sunni Islamists.",
      "The fundamentalists say Paulikevitch is \u201cpromoting homosexuality\" because he wears dresses and corsets and undulates to classical Arabic music in a way which society largely sees as exclusive to women.",
      "Paulikevitch says he\u2019s breaking social norms and reintroducing forms of dance that were commonplace for men as recently as the early 20th century.",
      "Lebanon is seen as a place of relative tolerance in the region when it comes to LGBTQ+ rights, following years of activism from the queer community and supporters. But the community still faces restrictions and even violence.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not promoting anything, I am just dancing. If you want to come watch me, come,\u201d Paulikevitch said defiantly in his changing room as the audience took their seats outside. \u201cThey think if one looks a certain way, that means they have an agenda to convert society. If the society was going to convert, it would have happened hundreds of years ago.\u201d",
      "Male dancers in the 19th and early 20th century in countries like Egypt who moved their hips and torsos expressively were once widely appreciated but today are largely shunned. Paulikevitch says he\u2019s paying tribute to his favorite dancers and songs with local forms that go beyond belly dancing, which he dismisses as a narrow and exoticized Western perception of Middle Eastern dancing.",
      "The crowd gazed at Paulikevitch as he swayed and contorted his slender body to music played by his backing band of traditional percussionists and flutists. His lipstick, eyeshadow, and eyeliner glowed while he moved under the spotlight. Some in the crowd smiled and sang along, while others watched as if mesmerized. Many filmed with their cellphones. All of them applauded.",
      "Paulikevitch, 43, was seen at protests for years, holding a megaphone for all sorts of causes, including labor rights, combating domestic violence, and in the countrywide uprisings against Lebanon's banks and political leadership in late 2019. He also faced attacks and was once imprisoned under Lebanon\u2019s opaque laws.",
      "\u201cWe dance because we have no other option. We dance because whatever happened and whatever is happening to us, this is our resistance,\u201d he told the audience in his white dress after his first number.",
      "Over 20 years ago, the first non-governmental organization for queer rights in the Middle East was founded in Lebanon. Helem, Arabic for \u201cdream\u201d, was even formally registered. Owners of a handful of Beirut\u2019s nightlife venues are largely accessible to the country\u2019s LGBTQ+ community, including Metro al-Madina, where Paulikevitch is performing. Some even host drag shows.",

      "Lebanon has spiraled downward since 2019, with its banks collapsing and corrupt state institutions decaying. Over half its population of about six million has been pulled into poverty after decades of mismanagement and profiteering by the political class. Israel\u2019s widespread destruction of southern and eastern Lebanon in its monthslong war with the Hezbollah militant group last year further compounded the country\u2019s woes.",
      "\u201cWith everything that\u2019s happening now, especially now \u2014 the killing, the strikes, the extermination, and the insanity that we are living through \u2014 is this the time to focus on me?\u201d the dancer said while putting on his makeup. \u201cWho\u2019s paying attention to me? I don\u2019t understand where this gravity is coming from, which is why I refused to stop my show, because something doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d",
      "As Lebanon has struggled to stand on its own two feet, the queer community has been periodically targeted by conservatives and right-wing groups in ways similar to the ongoing culture wars of the United States and Europe. In Lebanon\u2019s fractured sectarian power-sharing political system, it became a rare bridge of unity.",
      "The summer of 2023 was notably hostile. Lebanon\u2019s culture minister moved to ban the movie \u201cBarbie\u201d, saying it \u201cpromotes homosexuality and transgenders.\u201d Right-wing groups unsuccessfully lobbied to shut down Helem and have mobilized against anything displaying rainbows, from cakes in bakery storefronts to children\u2019s board games at schools. In some cases, their actions turned violent. Members of the Soldiers of God group entered a bar in Beirut hosting a drag show, attacking several people, and forcing other patrons to hide in a bathroom.",
      "Paulikevitch says he isn\u2019t interested in imposing anything on people and their personal choices, but simply wants his right to perform his art.",
      "\u201cI have a problem with you the same way you have a problem with me, but the difference between us is that I respect you,\u201d he said, addressing the groups attacking him. \u201cEven if your beard or your appearance bothers me, I respect and accept you as you are. You can\u2019t see me as I\u2019m not getting near you, (so) why do you have such a problem with me?\u201d",
      "The dancer has faced more than just threats. He said he was detained for a year under a murky law which criminalizes sexual activity \u201cagainst nature\u201d, which some interpret as including same-sex acts. In 2020, during popular protests across the country decrying corruption and the country\u2019s politicians and bankers, Paulikevitch was among a handful of activists beaten and arrested by riot police by the Central Bank.",
      "Still, he remains optimistic for the future of the queer community and artistic expression in Lebanon. One member of his band helped him with his wig before a quick rehearsal. His calm demeanor soon turned into nervousness, with his mind fixed on his performance and not on whatever might be taking place outside.",
      "\u201cMe putting this makeup and putting (on) my dresses is a political act, (whether) I want it or not,\u201d he said. \u201cDoing what I do is resisting, is giving the possibility for others to be inspired, to say it is possible. I\u2019m paying a high price, but ... maybe, maybe I can inspire someone.\u201d",

      "Their names are engraved in a stone monument at the Fukuoka POW Camp No. 2 \u2014 the site of the larger of the two war prisons in Nagasaki during the war \u2014 that was erected in 2015 with contribution from Japanese survivors of the Nagasaki bombing and their descendants as a symbol of reconciliation and peace.",

      "His father, Johan Willem Schram, was a Dutch Navy sailor who survived the forced labor and hardship at the No. 2 camp in the last three years of the war and the atomic bombing on Aug. 9, 1945 \u2014 just a week before Japan's surrender.",
      "Andre Schram published \u201cJohan's Story,\u201d an account about the Netherland's colonial rule of the Dutch East Indies, the war with Japan and the aftermath of WWII, based on his own research.

      "Most prisoners there were Dutch but there were also others, from the United States, Britain and Australia. None were directly killed as a result of the atomic blast but by the time the bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, more than 70 had died of malnutrition, overwork and illnesses.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump\u2019s push to revitalize American manufacturing by luring foreign investment into the U.S. has run smack into one of his other priorities: cracking down on illegal immigration.",
      "Hardly a week after immigration authorities raided a sprawling Hyundai battery plant in Georgia, detained more than 300 South Korean workers and showed video of some of them shackled in chains, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned that the country's other companies may be reluctant to take up Trump\u2019s invitation to pour money into the United States.",
      "If the U.S. can't promptly issue visas to the technicians and other skilled workers needed to launch plants, then \u201cestablishing a local factory in the United States will either come with severe disadvantages or become very difficult for our companies,\u201d Lee said Thursday. \u201cThey will wonder whether they should even do it.\u201d",
      "The raid and subsequent diplomatic crisis show how the Trump administration's mass deportation goals are running up against its efforts to bring in money from abroad to drive the U.S. economy and create more jobs. Moves like workplace immigration enforcement and visa restrictions could risk alienating allies that are pledging to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. to avoid high tariffs.",
      "Trump\u2019s economic agenda is built around using hefty tariffs on imports, including a 15% levy on South Korean products, as a cudgel to force manufacturing to return to the U.S. He\u2019s repeatedly said foreign companies can escape his tariffs if they produce in America. South Korea, already a top investor, pledged to invest $350 billion in the U.S. when the two sides announced a trade deal in July.",
      "It made more investments in new construction, such as factories, on previously undeveloped land than any other country in 2022. Last year, it ranked 12th in the world with $93 billion in total American investment \u2014 including acquisitions of existing companies, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.",
      "But the dramatic roundup of South Koreans and others working to set up the battery plant threatens to put a chill on the investment push. Indeed, Trump seems to be trying to undo the damage.",
      "While demanding that foreign investors \u201cLEGALLY bring your very smart people,\u201d Trump also promised to \u201cmake it quickly and legally possible for you to do so.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump will continue delivering on his promise to make the United States the best place in the world to do business, while also enforcing federal immigration laws,\u201d White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement Thursday.",
      "For now, the South Koreans are furious and immigration experts are puzzled. It's been common practice for decades for foreign companies \u2014 such as the Japanese and German carmakers that have built factories in the American Midwest and South \u2014 to send technical specialists from their home countries to help open plants in the United States. Most of them train U.S. workers, then go home.",
      "\u201cJapanese managers, senior engineers, other technical experts had to come to the United States to set this stuff up,\u201d said Lee Branstetter, a professor of economics and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University who's studied Japanese auto plants in the U.S.",

      "The Congressional Budget Office has released new economic projections, indicating that unemployment, inflation and overall growth will worsen in 2025 before improving over the next year",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policy, immigration crackdowns and sweeping tax and spending law are expected to increase jobless rates and inflation and lower overall growth this year before they improve next year, according to a new report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The CBO on Friday released new economic projections for the next three years, updating the outlook it originally released in January, before Trump's inauguration.",
      "The latest figures, which compare fourth quarter changes, show the unemployment rate, inflation and overall growth are expected to be worse this year than initially projected, while the economic picture is expected to steady in subsequent years.",
      "The CBO outlooks attempt to set expectations for the economy in order to help choices made by congressional and executive branch policymakers. It does not forecast economic downturns or recessions, with its estimates generally reverting back to an expected average over time.",
      "But Friday\u2019s outlook showed the degree to which Trump\u2019s choices are altering the path of the U.S. economy, suggesting that growth has been hampered in the near term by choices that have yet to show the promised upside of more jobs and lower budget deficits.",
      "Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, told The Associated Press, \u201cAmericans heard similar doom-and-gloom forecasts during President Trump\u2019s first term, when the President\u2019s economic agenda unleashed historic job, wage, and economic growth and the first decline in wealth inequality in decades.\u201d",

      "Overall, the CBO expects real GDP growth to decrease from 2.5% in 2024 to 1.4% this year, a downgrade from the initial projection of 1.9%. The CBO attributes the projected decline to a slowdown in consumer spending stemming from new tariffs and a decrease in immigration, which would also impact consumer spending.",
      "The tariffs \u201craise prices for consumer goods and services, thereby eroding the purchasing power of households; they also increase costs for businesses that use imported and import-competing inputs in production,\u201d the report says.",

      "Additionally, unemployment is expected to hit 4.5% in 2025, higher than the 4.3% initially expected, according to the CBO. The jobless rate is expected to reach 4.2% in 2026 \u2014 slightly lower than the 4.4% originally anticipated \u2014 and even out at 4.4% in 2027 and 2028.",
      "And inflation is now expected to hit 3.1% for the rest of 2025, according to the CBO, up from its 2.2% projection in January. Inflation would then lower to 2.4% in 2026, higher than the initial expectation of 2.1%, before leveling off at 2% the next two years.",
      "The CBO on Wednesday issued a report that shows Trump\u2019s plans for mass deportations and other hard-line immigration measures will result in roughly 320,000 people removed from the United States over the next ten years.",
      "Coupled with a lower fertility rate in the U.S., the reduction in immigration means that the CBO\u2019s projection of the U.S. population will be 4.5 million people lower by 2035 than the nonpartisan office had projected in January.",

      "British horse racing has gone ahead with its unprecedented one-day strike to protest a feared rise in taxes on race betting",
      "LONDON -- British horse racing went ahead Wednesday with its unprecedented one-day strike to protest a feared rise in taxes on race betting, with a top official in the sport urging the industry to \u201cstand together\u201d and \u201cmake their voices heard.\u201d",
      "Four scheduled meetings \u2014 at Carlisle, Uttoxeter, Lingfield and Kempton \u2014 have been canceled and rescheduled after agreements between the owners of the courses and the British Horseracing Authority, making it the first time the sport in Britain has voluntarily refused to race in modern history.",
      "The BHA set up the \u201cAxe the Racing Tax\u201d campaign in response to proposals to replace the existing three-tax structure of online gambling duties with a single tax, with fears the current 15% duty on racing could be increased to the 21% levied on games of chance.",
      "Economic analysis commissioned by the BHA says such a rise could cost the sport at least 66 million pounds ($90 million) and put around 2,750 jobs at risk in the first year, in what BHA chairman Charles Allen described as \u201cnothing short of an existential threat for our sport.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need every part of our industry \u2014 trainers, jockeys, stable staff, racecourses, and fans \u2014 to stand together and make their voices heard,\" Allen said.",
      "\u201cWe are Britain\u2019s second largest spectator sport, supporting 85,000 jobs and delivering over 4 billion pounds ($5.4 billion) of economic value every year. Yet all of this is now being put at risk by a change that would devastate our funding model and the livelihoods that depend on it.\"",
      "Allen said the protests are about \u201cprotecting communities across Britain\u201d and \u201csafeguarding a national institution.\u201d",
      "Previously, the British government said it was bringing the \u201ctreatment of online betting in line with other forms of online gambling to cut down bureaucracy.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe Chancellor has been clear that speculation on tax rises, which is what this is, is not only inaccurate, but also irresponsible,\" Tomlinson said. \"We have not announced an increase in the tax on horse-race betting, and racecourse betting currently gets a 100% tax break which we have no plans to change.",

      "\u201cIn South Korea, we see Americans coming on tourist visas to teach English at private cram schools \u2014 they do it all the time, and we don\u2019t think much of it, it\u2019s just something you accept,\u201d Lee said.",
      "\u201cBut the United States clearly doesn\u2019t see things that way. On top of that, U.S. immigration authorities pledge to strictly forbid illegal immigration and employment and carry out deportations in various aggressive ways, and our people happened to be caught in one of those cases,\u201d he added.",
      "Following a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Wednesday that U.S. officials have agreed to allow the workers detained in Georgia to later return to finish their work at the site. He added that the countries agreed to set up a joint working group for discussions on creating a new visa category to make it easier for South Korean companies to send their staff to work in the United States.",
      "Before leaving for the U.S. on Monday, Cho told lawmakers that more South Korean workers in the U.S. could be vulnerable to future crackdowns if the visa issue isn\u2019t resolved, but said Seoul does not yet have an estimate of how many might be at risk.",
      "The Georgia battery plant is one of more than 20 major industrial sites that South Korean companies are currently building in the United States. They include other battery factories in Georgia and several other states, a semiconductor plant in Texas, and a shipbuilding project in Philadelphia, a sector Trump has frequently highlighted in relation to South Korea.",
      "Min Jeonghun, a professor at South Korea\u2019s National Diplomatic Academy, said it\u2019s chiefly up to the United States to resolve the issue, either through legislation or by taking administrative steps to expand short-term work visas for training purposes.",
      "He said it would be a mistake to underestimate the public anger in South Korea over the detentions in Georgia, which came after Lee\u2019s government pledged to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into U.S. industrial investments against the backdrop of a decaying job market at home.",
      "Without an update in U.S. visa policies, Min said, \u201cKorean companies will no longer be able to send their workers to the United States, causing inevitable delays in the expansion of facilities and other production activities, and the harm will boomerang back to the U.S. economy.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. inflation likely ticked higher last month as the Trump administration's import taxes have lifted the price of goods, potentially putting the Federal Reserve in a tough spot when it meets next week.",
      "Economists forecast that consumer prices rose 2.9% in August from a year earlier, according to a survey of economists by data provider FactSet. That would be an increase from an annual pace of 2.7% in July. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, core inflation is expected to have increased 3.1%, the same as in July. Both figures are above the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target.",
      "The potential increases, while modest, would underscore the challenges the Fed is facing as it experiences relentless pressure from President Donald Trump to reduce its short-term interest rate. Trump hopes that rate cuts will spur more borrowing and spending and boost the economy.",
      "Recent government reports have also shown that hiring has slowed sharply in recent months and was lower than previously estimated last year, a sign that companies may be worried about future sales and are less interested in adding staff. The unemployment rate ticked up in August to a still-low 4.3%.",
      "Typically the Fed would cut its key rate when unemployment rose to spur more spending and growth. Yet it would do the opposite and raise rates \u2014 or at least keep them unchanged \u2014 in the face of rising inflation. Last month, Chair Jerome Powell signaled that Fed officials are increasingly more concerned about jobs, and are likely to cut their rate when they meet next week. Yet stubbornly high inflation could keep the Fed from cutting very quickly.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices are expected to have risen at an accelerated pace, increasing 0.3% from July to August. Core prices are expected to also increase 0.3% on a monthly basis. The cost of groceries and gas are forecast to have risen last month.",

If so, that would make it easier for the Fed to keep cutting its key rate. Wall Street investors expect the Fed to implement three cuts this year, according to futures pricing tracked by CME Fedwatch.",
      "The inflation data arrives at the same time that Trump has sought to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook as part of an effort to assert more control over the Fed. Yet late Tuesday, a court said the firing was illegal and ruled that Cook could keep her job while the dispute played out in the courts.",

      "\u201cI feel good. Just still taking day by day in the playbook, learning everything I need to know in case I have to play,\u201d Judkins said on Friday. \u201cAs a competitor, you want to go out there and do your best every single day you step on the field. So if I have to play, I\u2019m going to give it my all.\u201d",

      "Stefanski and the Browns are looking for improvement in the run game after gaining only 49 yards on 24 carries in last week\u2019s 17-16 loss to Cincinnati.",

      "Now the Commanders wait to learn how much time these two veterans will miss. Commanders coach Dan Quinn had no immediate update on their conditions after the game.",

      "Losing either player for a big chunk of the season could prove costly for the Commanders, who made a surprise appearance in the NFC championship game last season.",
      "\u201cIt kind of takes the fight out of you a little bit,\" wide receiver Deebo Samuel said. \"All the work that they put in all summer long, and just to see them go down, it kind of hurt. That\u2019s the nature of this game. We pray it\u2019s not as bad as we think it is.\u201d",
      "The 31-year-old Wise is in his first season with the Commanders after totaling 34 sacks with the New England Patriots from 2017-24.",
      "Wise\u2019s injury occured after he had gotten though the line of scrimmage and was attempting to block an extra-point attempt in the second quarter. Green Bay\u2019s blockers fell backward and landed on the back of Wise\u2019s leg.",

      "World Athletics portrayed gender testing as a common-sense way to protect the female category in track and field",
      "TOKYO -- The woman whose genetic test in the 1980s led sports leaders to conclude it was too intrusive, not definitive enough and, ultimately, not worth keeping, said she was faced with \u201ca sadness that I could not share\u201d after results from that test upended her life.",
      "The man who discovered the gene that led to that test being developed called it \u201csurprising that, 25 years later, there is a misguided effort to bring the test back.\u201d",
      "In a recent major policy overhaul, World Athletics brought back the test this year, requiring any athlete seeking to compete in the female category at world championships, which opened Saturday, to submit to the test by Sept. 1.",
      "The federation portrays implementation of the SRY gene test, designed to detect a \u2018Y\u2019 chromosome found in males, as a common-sense approach to tackle an issue that has bedeviled and divided sports for decades. Federation president Seb Coe says the policy is tailored to foster the \u201cprotection and the promotion of the integrity of women\u2019s sport.\u201d",
      "In a telling indicator of the lack of unanimity around the issue, athletes from France hit roadblocks in meeting the deadline because their country has banned that sort of screening for non-medical purposes. Most were forced to have the test conducted at foreign training sites on their way to Tokyo for the championships.",
      "A day before the championships started, World Athletics said about 95% of female athletes set to compete in Tokyo had completed the test. Confidentiality rules make it difficult to determine who, if anyone, did not take the test, and if any of those who did have been ruled ineligible.",
      "Issues with this test began decades before this 2025 reboot.",
      "The most notable case involved Spanish hurdler Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez-Pati\u00f1o, who wrote in a 2005 essay in The Lancet that she \u201cpassed\u201d her first gender test prior to the 1983 world championships and was given a \u201cCertificate of Femininity\u201d that allowed her to compete.",
      "But two years later, she forgot the certificate on her way to the World University Games and was subjected to another test that came back with inconclusive results. Team doctors told her to fake an injury to explain her subsequent absence from the meet.",
      "\u201cI sat in the stands that day watching my teammates, wondering how my body differed from theirs,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI spent the rest of that week in my room, feeling a sadness that I could not share.\u201d",
      "Further testing ultimately revealed Mart\u00ednez-Pati\u00f1o had androgen insensitivity -- meaning that though she carried a \u201cY\u201d chromosome, her body did not respond to testosterone and the hormonal messages it provides to become male.",
      "\u201cI lost friends, my fianc\u00e9, hope, and energy,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I knew that I was a woman, and that my genetic difference gave me no unfair physical advantage.\u201d",
      "In part because of the trauma Mart\u00ednez-Pati\u00f1o endured, medical experts convinced the International Olympic Committee and other sports federations to abandon gene testing. It was gone prior to the 2000 Sydney Olympics.",
      "Among those involved in sidelining the test was Andrew Sinclair, the scientist who discovered the gene that results in a positive test for the \u201cY\u201d chromosome.",
      "His recent essay in The Conversation detailed the many ways the SRY test can go wrong. One of them is an inability to detect the androgen insensitivity that Martinez-Patino had. In a nod to the Spanish athlete\u2019s landmark case, World Athletics has carved out an exception for people with \u201cComplete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.\u201d",
      "But Sinclair outlined other potential difficulties. They could include problems generating accurate lab readings in poorer nations without sophisticated equipment, and that the test is sensitive enough that a male lab technician can inadvertently cause a false result by mishandling it.",
      "\u201cGiven all the problems outlined above, the SRY gene should not be used to exclude women athletes from competition,\u201d Sinclair concluded.",

      "As part of its rules reset, World Athletics wrote virtually the same guidelines for transgender athletes as for those with differences in sex development (DSD) -- two sets of athletes whose issues are often conflated.",
      "DSD athletes were born with a typical male XY chromosome pattern, but identified as female at birth and raised as girls.",
      "While World Athletics acknowledged no transgender females currently compete at the elite international level, it created an exception allowing DSD athletes who had followed previous guidelines, which involved them taking drugs to suppress their testosterone level, to be grandfathered in to future competitions under the old rules.",
      "The exception would not have helped Caster Semenya, the two-time Olympic gold medalist who has DSD and refused to suppress her testosterone. Her long-running case has served as a focal point for the issue of transgender and DSD athletes in track.",
      "Earlier this year, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of Semenya, saying her rights to a fair hearing in her sex-eligibility case were violated, which kept alive the seven-year-old legal struggle for the now 34-year-old champion.",
      "\u201cI think Caster is, in a lot of ways, the unfortunate martyr for a lot of this,\u201d said Anna Posbergh, a Florida State researcher who studies gender in sports. \u201cI applaud Caster for the strength she\u2019s had to push back. But I think it was inevitable that at some point, (the test) was going to make a comeback, given the political direction the world seems to be going.\u201d",

      "Gardner was hurt Thursday, when he was first listed as a limited participant. He was listed without any injury designation on Friday, meaning he was a full participant and received no treatment.",
      "\u201cI'm straight,\u201d Gardner told The Associated Press in the locker room after practice. \u201cI'll be good to go.\u201d",

      "Gardner, the NFL's highest-paid cornerback after receiving a four-year, $120.4 million contract extension in July, is coming off a strong opening-game performance against Pittsburgh. He was lined up against DK Metcalf on 30 of 34 pass plays by the Steelers and allowed only one 11-yard catch by Pittsburgh's top receiver.",

      "Against the Bills, Gardner will likely cover Keon Coleman for a good chunk of the game. Coleman had seven catches for 100 yards, including a 10-yard touchdown reception, in the fourth quarter of the Bills' comeback win against Baltimore last Sunday.",
      "The news wasn't as good for a few other players, including No. 2 wide receiver Josh Reynolds, who was ruled out with a hamstring injury. Running back/kick returner Kene Nwangwu (hamstring) and defensive tackle Jay Tufele (illness) will also sit out Sunday.",

      "Ghost is originally from the waters of British Columbia, Canada, and arrived at the aquarium in May 2024 from a scientific collector. She was only 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms) then but now weighs more than 50 pounds (22.7 kilograms).",
      "The average giant Pacific octopus lives for three to five years. Ghost is estimated to be between two and four years old, Jaros said.",
      "Ghost was a \u201csuper active and very physical octopus\u201d who enjoyed spending time with humans, Jaros said.",

      "He is now one of thousands of small-scale farmers in the southern African country using a generative AI chatbot designed by the non-profit Opportunity International for farming advice.",
      "The Malawi government is backing the project, having seen the agriculture-dependent nation hit recently by a series of cyclones and an El Ni\u00f1o-induced drought. Malawi\u2019s food crisis, which is largely down to the struggles of small-scale farmers, is a central issue for its national elections next week.",
      "More than 80% of Malawi's population of 21 million rely on agriculture for their livelihoods and the country has one of the highest poverty rates in the world, according to the World Bank.",
      "The AI chatbot suggested Maere grow potatoes last year alongside his staple corn and cassava to adjust to his changed soil. He followed the instructions to the letter, he said, and cultivated half a soccer field's worth of potatoes and made more than $800 in sales, turning around his and his children's fortunes.",
      "\u201cI managed to pay for their school fees without worries,\u201d he beamed.",
      "Artificial intelligence has the potential to uplift agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 33-50 million smallholder farms like Maere's produce up to 70-80% of the food supply, according to the U.N.'s International Fund for Agricultural Development. Yet productivity in Africa \u2014 with the world's fast-growing population to feed \u2014 is lagging behind despite vast tracts of arable land.",
      "As AI's use surges across the globe, so it is helping African farmers access new information to identify crop diseases, forecast drought, design fertilizers to boost yields, and even locate an affordable tractor. Private investment in agriculture-related tech in sub-Saharan Africa went from $10 million in 2014 to $600 million in 2022, according to the World Bank.",
      "But not without challenges.",

      "\u201cOne of the biggest challenges to sustainable AI use in African agriculture is accessibility,\u201d said Daniel Mvalo, a Malawian technology specialist. \u201cMany tools fail to account for language diversity, low literacy and poor digital infrastructure.\u201d",
      "The AI tool in Malawi tries to do that. The app is called Ulangizi, which means advisor in the country's Chichewa language. It is WhatsApp-based and works in Chichewa and English. You can type or speak your question, and it replies with an audio or text response, said Richard Chongo, Opportunity International's country director for Malawi.",

      "As Big Tech\u2019s data centers continue to grow threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are considering bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- With the explosive growth of Big Tech's data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.",
      "Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.",
      "Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.",
      "Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.",
      "That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.",
      "Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,\u201d said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. \u201cData center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.\u201d",
      "That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.",
      "Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.",
      "A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.",
      "The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs \u2014 likely for the biggest power users \u2014 to meet growing demand.",
      "The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast \u2014 twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data \u2014 and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.",
      "Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.",
      "\u201cData center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,\u201d said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.",
      "Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.",
      "Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.",
      "The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.",

      "The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.",
      "Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a \u201cbring your own generation\u201d requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.",

      "Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.",

      "\u201cSome individual colonies are edging closer to local extinction every day, particularly in southeast Queensland and New South Wales, where infection rates within populations are often around 50% and in some cases can reach as high as 70%,\u201d\u202fTimms added.",
      "Deborah Tabart, chair of the conservation charity Australian Koala Foundation, said resources being spent on vaccinating koalas should be redirected at saving koala habitat.",
      "\u201cAt the risk of sounding flippant, how can anyone be so delusional as to think that you can vaccinate 100,000 animals? It\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d Tabart said on Friday.",
      "Tabart\u2019s foundation estimates there are fewer than 100,000 koalas in the wild. The government-backed National Koala Monitoring Program estimated last year there were between 224,000 and 524,000 koalas.",
      "\u201cI accept that chlamydia is an issue for koalas, but I also want people to understand that they\u2019re sick because they haven\u2019t got any habitat,\u201d Tabart said.",
      "The Queensland Conservation Council, an umbrella organization for more than 50 environmental groups across the state, welcomed the vaccine. But the council's director, Dave Copeman, echoed Tabart\u2019s focus on preserving koala habitat.",

      "High school and college educators say that student use of artificial intelligence has become so widespread that they need to rethink how to assign and assess students",
      "The book report is now a thing of the past. Take-home tests and essays are becoming obsolete.",
      "High school and college educators around the country say student use of artificial intelligence has become so prevalent that to assign writing outside of the classroom is like asking students to cheat.",
      "\u201cThe cheating is off the charts. It\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve seen in my entire career,\u201d says Casey Cuny, who has taught English for 23 years. Educators are no longer wondering if students will outsource schoolwork to AI chatbots. \u201cAnything you send home, you have to assume is being AI\u2019ed.\u201d",
      "The question now is how schools can adapt, because many of the teaching and assessment tools that have been used for generations are no longer effective. As AI technology rapidly improves and becomes more entwined with daily life, it is transforming how students learn and study, how teachers teach, and it\u2019s creating new confusion over what constitutes academic dishonesty.",
      "\u201cWe have to ask ourselves, what is cheating?\u201d says Cuny, a 2024 recipient of California\u2019s Teacher of the Year award. \u201cBecause I think the lines are getting blurred.\u201d",
      "Cuny\u2019s students at Valencia High School in southern California now do most writing in class. He monitors student laptop screens from his desktop, using software that lets him \u201clock down\u201d their screens or block access to certain sites. He\u2019s also integrating AI into his lessons and teaching students how to use AI as a study aid \u201cto get kids learning with AI instead of cheating with AI.\u201d",
      "In rural Oregon, high school teacher Kelly Gibson has made a similar shift to in-class writing. She is also incorporating more verbal assessments to have students talk through their understanding of assigned reading.",
      "\u201cI used to give a writing prompt and say, \u2018In two weeks I want a five-paragraph essay,\u2019\u201d says Gibson. \u201cThese days, I can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s almost begging teenagers to cheat.\u201d",
      "Take, for example, a once typical high school English assignment: Write an essay that explains the relevance of social class in \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d Many students say their first instinct is now to ask ChatGPT for help \u201cbrainstorming.\u201d Within seconds, ChatGPT yields a list of essay ideas, plus examples and quotes to back them up. The chatbot ends by asking if it can do more: \u201cWould you like help writing any part of the essay? I can help you draft an introduction or outline a paragraph!\u201d",
      "Students say they often turn to AI with good intentions for things like research, editing or help reading difficult texts. But AI offers unprecedented temptation and it\u2019s sometimes hard to know where to draw the line.",
      "College sophomore Lily Brown, a psychology major at an East Coast liberal arts school, relies on ChatGPT to help outline essays because she struggles putting the pieces together herself. ChatGPT also helped her through a freshman philosophy class, where assigned reading \u201cfelt like a different language\u201d until she read AI summaries of the texts.",
      "\u201cSometimes I feel bad using ChatGPT to summarize reading, because I wonder is this cheating? Is helping me form outlines cheating? If I write an essay in my own words and ask how to improve it, or when it starts to edit my essay, is that cheating?\u201d",
      "Her class syllabi say things like: \u201cDon\u2019t use AI to write essays and to form thoughts,\u201d she says, but that leaves a lot of grey area. Students say they often shy away from asking teachers for clarity because admitting to any AI use could flag them as a cheater.",
      "Schools tend to leave AI policies to teachers, which often means that rules vary widely within the same school. Some educators, for example, welcome the use of Grammarly.com, an AI-powered writing assistant, to check grammar. Others forbid it, noting the tool also offers to rewrite sentences.",
      "\u201cWhether you can use AI or not, depends on each classroom. That can get confusing,\u201d says Valencia 11th grader Jolie Lahey, who credits Cuny with teaching her sophomore English class a variety of AI skills like how to upload study guides to ChatGPT and have the chatbot quiz them and then explain problems they got wrong.",
      "But this year, her teachers have strict \u201cNo AI\u201d policies. \u201cIt\u2019s such a helpful tool. And if we\u2019re not allowed to use it that just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Lahey says. \u201cIt feels outdated.\u201d",

      "Many schools initially banned use of AI after ChatGPT launched in late 2022. But views on the role of artificial intelligence in education have shifted dramatically. The term \u201cAI literacy\u201d has become a buzzword of the back-to-school season, with a focus on how to balance the strengths of AI with its risks and challenges.",
      "Over the summer, several colleges and universities convened their AI task forces to draft more detailed guidelines or provide faculty with new instructions.",
      "The University of California, Berkeley emailed all faculty new AI guidance that instructs them to \u201cinclude a clear statement on their syllabus about course expectations\u201d around AI use. The guidance offered language for three sample syllabus statements \u2014 for courses that require AI, ban AI in and out of class, or allow some AI use.",

      "At Carnegie Mellon University there has been a huge uptick in academic responsibility violations due to AI but often students aren\u2019t aware they\u2019ve done anything wrong, says Rebekah Fitzsimmons, chair of the AI faculty advising committee at the university\u2019s Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy.",
      "For example, one English language learner wrote an assignment in his native language and used DeepL, an AI-powered translation tool, to translate his work to English but didn\u2019t realize the platform also altered his language, which was flagged by an AI detector.",
      "Enforcing academic integrity policies has been complicated by AI, which is hard to detect and even harder to prove, said Fitzsimmons. Faculty are allowed flexibility when they believe a student has unintentionally crossed a line but are now more hesitant to point out violations because they don't want to accuse students unfairly, and students are worried that if they are falsely accused there is no way to prove their innocence.",
      "Over the summer, Fitzsimmons helped draft detailed new guidelines for students and faculty that strive to create more clarity. Faculty have been told that a blanket ban on AI \u201cis not a viable policy\u201d unless instructors make changes to the way they teach and assess students. A lot of faculty are doing away with take-home exams. Some have returned to pen and paper tests in class, she said, and others have moved to \u201cflipped classrooms,\u201d where homework is done in class.",
      "Emily DeJeu, who teaches communication courses at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s business school, has eliminated writing assignments as homework and replaced them with in-class quizzes done on laptops in \u201ca lockdown browser\u201d that blocks students from leaving the quiz screen.",
      "\u201cTo expect an 18-year-old to exercise great discipline is unreasonable, that\u2019s why it\u2019s up to instructors to put up guardrails.\u201d",

      "NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- NASA\u2019s Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "They stressed that in-depth analysis is needed of the sample gathered there by Perseverance \u2014 ideally in labs on Earth \u2014 before reaching any conclusions.",
      "Roaming Mars since 2021, the rover cannot directly detect life. Instead, it carries a drill to penetrate rocks and tubes to hold the samples gathered from places judged most suitable for hosting life billions of years ago. The samples are awaiting retrieval to Earth \u2014 an ambitious plan that's on hold as NASA seeks cheaper, quicker options.",
      "Calling it an \u201cexciting discovery,\u201d a pair of scientists who were not involved in the study \u2014 SETI Institute\u2019s Janice Bishop and the University of Massachusetts Amherst\u2019s Mario Parente \u2014 were quick to point out that non-biological processes could be responsible.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason why we can\u2019t go so far as to say, \u2018A-ha, this is proof positive of life,'\u2019\u2019 lead researcher Joel Hurowitz of Stony Brook University told The Associated Press. \u201cAll we can say is one of the possible explanations is microbial life, but there could be other ways to make this set of features that we see.\u201d",
      "Either way, Hurowitz said it\u2019s the best, most compelling candidate yet in the rover\u2019s search for potential signs of long-ago life. It was the 25th sample gathered; the tally is now up to 30, with six more to go.",
      "\u201cIt would be amazing to be able to demonstrate conclusively that these features were formed by something that was alive on another planet billions of years ago, right?\" Hurowitz said. But even if that's not the case, it's \"a valuable lesson in all of the ways that nature can conspire to fool us.\u201d",
      "Collected last summer, the sample is from reddish, clay-rich mudstones in Neretva Vallis, a river channel that once carried water into Jezero Crater. This outcrop of sedimentary rock, known as the Bright Angel formation, was surveyed by Perseverance\u2019s science instruments before the drill came out.",
      "Along with organic carbon, a building block of life, Hurowitz and his team found minuscule specks, dubbed poppy seeds and leopard spots, that were enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide. On Earth, these chemical compounds are the byproducts when microorganisms chomp down on organic matter.",
      "The findings appeared in the journal Nature.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand court has rejected the latest bid by internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom to halt his deportation to the United States on charges related to his file-sharing website Megaupload.",
      "Dotcom had asked the High Court to review the legality of an official\u2019s August 2024 decision that he should be surrendered to the U.S. to face trial on charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering. It was the latest chapter in a protracted 13-year battle by the U.S. government to extradite the Finnish-German millionaire from New Zealand.",
      "The Megaupload founder had applied for what in New Zealand is called a judicial review, in which a judge is asked to evaluate whether an official's decision was lawful.",
      "A judge on Wednesday dismissed Dotcom's arguments that the decision to deport him was politically motivated and that he would face grossly disproportionate treatment in the U.S. In a written ruling, Justice Christine Grice also rejected Dotcom's claim that New Zealand's police were wrong to charge his business partners, but not him, under domestic laws \u2014 which likely yielded laxer sentences than if the men had been tried in the U.S.",
      "The latest decision could be challenged in the Court of Appeal, where a deadline for filing is Oct. 8. It wasn't immediately clear if Dotcom would do so.",
      "One of his lawyers, Ron Mansfield, told Radio New Zealand that Dotcom's team had \"much fight left in us as we seek to secure a fair outcome,\u201d but didn't elaborate further. Neither Dotcom nor Mansfield responded to a request for comment from The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s government hasn\u2019t disclosed what will happen next in the extradition process or divulged an expected timeline for Dotcom to be surrendered to the United States.",
      "The saga stretches back to the January 2012 arrest by New Zealand authorities of Dotcom in a dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion along with other company officers at the request of the FBI. U.S. prosecutors said Megaupload raked in at least $175 million, mainly from people who used the site to illegally download songs, television shows and movies, before the FBI shut it down earlier that year.",
      "Lawyers for Dotcom and the others arrested argued that it was the users of the site, founded in 2005, who chose to pirate material, not its founders. But prosecutors said the men were the architects of a vast criminal enterprise, with the Department of Justice describing it as the largest criminal copyright case in U.S. history.",
      "He has been free on bail in New Zealand since February 2012.",
      "Dotcom and his business partners fought the FBI's efforts to extradite them for years, including by challenging New Zealand law enforcement's actions during the investigation and arrests. In 2021, however, New Zealand\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be surrendered.",

      "Under New Zealand law, it remained up to the country\u2019s justice minister to decide if the extradition should proceed. The minister, Paul Goldsmith, ruled in August 2024 that it should.",
      "But by then, Dotcom was the only person whose fate remained in question. Two of his former business partners, Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk, pleaded guilty to charges against them in a New Zealand court in June 2023 and were sentenced to two and a half years in jail.",
      "In exchange, U.S. efforts to extradite them were dropped. Part of Dotcom's latest legal bid challenged the police decision not to extend a plea deal under New Zealand laws to him too.",
      "Grice rejected that, saying the choice to only charge Ortmann and van der Kolk in New Zealand was \u201ca proper exercise of the Police's discretion.\u201d The jurist also dismissed Dotcom's claim that Goldsmith's extradition decision was politically motivated.",
      "Prosecutors earlier abandoned their extradition bid against a fourth Megaupload officer, Finn Batato, who was arrested in New Zealand. Batato returned to Germany, where he died from cancer in 2022.",
      "In November 2024, Dotcom said in a post on X that he had suffered a stroke. He wrote on X in July that he was making \u201cgood progress\u201d in his recovery but still suffered from speech and memory impairments.",
      "Goldsmith's decision that Dotcom should be extradited was made before the stroke. But Grice said the minister had considered other \u201csignificant health conditions\u201d Dotcom faced and wasn't wrong to conclude that these shouldn't prevent him from being deported.",
      "\u201cI am pleased my decision has been upheld,\u201d Goldsmith said Thursday in a written statement.",

      "A new study finds that climate change is increasing sugar consumption in the United States",
      "WASHINGTON -- Global warming in the United States is amping up the country's sweet tooth, a new study found.",
      "When the temperature rises, Americans \u2014 especially those with less money and education \u2014 drink lots more sugary beverages and a bit more frozen desserts. That amounts to more than 100 million pounds of added sugar (358 million kilograms) consumed in the nation a year, compared to 15 years earlier, according to a team of researchers in the U.S. and United Kingdom.",
      "When temperatures go between 54 and 86 degrees (12 and 30 degrees Celsius), the amount of sugar the average American consumes goes up by about 0.4 grams per degree Fahrenheit (0.7 grams per degree Celsius) per day, based on researchers tracking of weather conditions and consumers' purchases. At 54 degrees, the amount of added sugar for the average American is a little more than 2 grams. At 86 degrees, it\u2019s more than 15 grams.",
      "Beyond that, appetites lessen and added sugar falls off, according to the study in Monday's Nature Climate Change.",
      "\u201cClimate change is shaping what you eat and how you eat and that might have a bad effect on your health,\u201d said study co-author Duo Chan, a climate scientist at the University of Southampton.",
      "\u201cPeople tend to take in more sweetened beverages as the temperature is getting higher and higher,\u201d Chan said. \u201cObviously under a warming climate that would cause you to drink more or take in more sugar. And that is going to be a severe problem when it comes to health.\u201d",
      "The daily difference from higher temperatures doesn't amount to even a single candy bar for the average person. But it adds up over time and has a big effect, said University of California San Francisco endocrinology professor Dr. Robert Lustig, a specialist in pediatrics and obesity who wasn't part of the study.",
      "Lustig wrote in an email that among poorer Americans, just one added can of sugary soft drink per day increases diabetes risk by 29% \u2014 and temperature-related thirst plays a big part in America\u2019s obesity epidemic.",
      "The United States\u2019 average annual temperature has gone up about 2.2 degrees (1.2 degrees Celsius) since 1895, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "To chart the impact on sugar consumption, researchers compared it to the American Heart Association recommendations: limiting daily intake to 36 grams for men and 25 grams for women.",
      "The team then compared wind, precipitation and humidity records to the detailed purchase records of 40,000 to 60,000 American households from 2004 to 2019, not using any data after the pandemic hit. Then they looked at the nutritional information of the items bought. That allowed them to eliminate other factors to make a causal link and come up with a calculation for how much extra sugar is consumed per person per degree, said lead author Pan He, an environmental scientist at Cardiff University.",

      "Researcher He said she started thinking about the study when she noticed that people in the U.S. tend to grab sugary soda when they are thirsty: \u201cFrom a perspective of nutrition science or environmental science, that could be a problem,\u201d she said.",
      "The researchers found that men consumed more sugary soft drinks, and that the amount of added sugar consumed during hot weather was several times higher for low- and very low-income families than for the wealthiest, the study found.",
      "People who work outside drank more sugary drinks than those who work inside, and the same went for families where the head of the household was less educated. White people have the highest added sugar effect, while Asians showed no significant change in added sugar in the heat.",
      "Lustig said sugary drinks are marketed and priced in a way to attract the poor, and in many disadvantaged communities the water tastes funny because of chemicals in them. Poor people are also less likely to have air conditioning and are more likely to work outside and need more hydration, Lustig and He said.",
      "\u201cIt should concern us that the rate of the impact is larger in households where people make less money or are less educated,\u201d said Dr. Courtney Howard, vice chair of the Global Climate and Health Alliance. \u201cThese groups tend to have lower baseline health status, so this is an area where climate-related changes appear to magnify existing health inequalities.\u201d",

      "At the Port of Los Angeles on a site that once housed oil tanks, seven steel structures that look like small blue boats are lowered into the ocean, where they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate power",
      "LOS ANGELES -- On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.",
      "This is the nation\u2019s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port \u2014 enough to power up to 60,000 homes.",
      "Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a \u201cgame changer in terms of clean energy production\u201d for the port and the communities around it. America\u2019s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,\u201d she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project\u2019s power station.",
      "Wave energy is an emerging industry that\u2019s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.",
      "Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America\u2019s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.",
      "Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port\u2019s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,\u201d said R\u00e9mi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.\u201d",
      "A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.",
      "But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.",
      "The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.",
      "As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.",

      "\u201cAnd we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,\u201d he said.",
      "Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn\u2019t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.",
      "The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.",
      "Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.",
      "Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power\u2019s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.",

      "A prosecutor has recommended five years of probation and restitution payments for former CEO Carl Ferrer and sales director Dan Hyer, both of whom pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 2018. The prosecutor said both men acknowledged their crimes and cooperated with authorities by testifying against a company founder during the 2023 trial.",
      "Backpage founder Michael Lacey was convicted of a single count of international concealment money laundering and sentenced to five years in prison and fined $3 million, though he remains free while he pursues an appeal. Chief financial officer John Brunst and executive vice president Scott Spear are each serving 10-year sentences for conspiracy and money laundering convictions.",
      "Prosecutors had argued that Backpage\u2019s operators ignored warnings to stop running prostitution ads, some involving children. The operators were accused of giving free ads to sex workers and cultivating arrangements with others who worked in the industry to get them to post ads with the company.",
      "Backpage\u2019s operators said they never allowed ads for sex and made an effort to try to delete such ads by assigning employees to remove them and creating automated tools. Their legal team maintained the content on the site was protected by the First Amendment.",
      "In pleading guilty, Ferrer acknowledged knowing a majority of Backpage\u2019s revenues came from escort ads, conspiring to sanitize ads by removing photos and words that were indicative of prostitution and publishing a revised version of the notices.",
      "In sentencing memos, both the prosecutor and Ferrer\u2019s attorneys say he helped shut down the site through his cooperation.",
      "His lawyers say Ferrer provided evidence linking defendants to the criminal enterprise and testified that Backpage\u2019s increase in revenue stemmed mostly from prostitution.",

      "Lacey\u2019s first trial in 2021 ended in a mistrial when another judge concluded prosecutors had too many references to child sex trafficking in a case where no one faced such a charge.",
      "Before launching Backpage, Lacey founded the Phoenix New Times weekly newspaper with James Larkin, who was charged in the case and died by suicide in 2023 just before the second trial against Backpage\u2019s operators was scheduled to begin.",
      "Lacey and Larkin held ownership interests in other weeklies such as The Village Voice and ultimately sold their newspapers in 2013. But they held onto Backpage, which authorities say generated $500 million in prostitution-related revenue from its inception in 2004 until 2018, when the government shut it down.",
      "A U.S. Government Accountability Office report released in June 2021 said the FBI\u2019s ability to identify victims and sex traffickers had decreased significantly after Backpage was seized by the government, because law enforcement was familiar with the site and Backpage was generally responsive to requests for information.",

      "There has been concern about the cables being targeted in a Red Sea campaign by Yemen's Houthi rebels, which the rebels describe as an effort to pressure Israel to end its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. But the Houthis have denied attacking the lines in the past.",
      "Undersea cables are one of the backbones of the internet, along with satellite connections and land-based cables. Typically, internet service providers have multiple access points and reroute traffic if one fails, though it can slow down access for users.",
      "Microsoft announced via a status website that the Mideast \u201cmay experience increased latency due to undersea fiber cuts in the Red Sea.\u201d The Redmond, Washington-based firm did not immediately elaborate, though it said that internet traffic not moving through the Middle East \u201cis not impacted.\u201d",
      "NetBlocks, which monitors internet access, said \u201ca series of subsea cable outages in the Red Sea has degraded internet connectivity in multiple countries,\u201d which it said included India and Pakistan. It blamed \u201cfailures affecting the SMW4 and IMEWE cable systems near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\u201d",
      "The South East Asia\u2013Middle East\u2013Western Europe 4 cable is run by Tata Communications, part of the Indian conglomerate. The India-Middle East-Western Europe cable is run by another consortium overseen by Alcatel Submarine Networks. Neither firm responded to requests for comment.",

      "In early 2024, Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government in exile alleged that the Houthis planned to attack undersea cables in the Red Sea. Several were cut, possibly by a ship attacked by the Houthis dragging its anchor, but the rebels denied being responsible. On Sunday morning, the Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel acknowledged that the cuts had taken place, citing NetBlocks.",
      "Moammar al-Eryani, the information minister with Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government that opposes the Houthis and is based in southern Yemen, issued a statement saying the cable cuts \u201ccannot be isolated from the series of direct attacks carried out by the Houthi militia.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat is happening today in the Red Sea should serve as a wake-up call for the international community, which must take a firm stance to stop these escalating threats and protect the digital infrastructure that serves as the lifeline of the modern world,\u201d al-Eryani said.",
      "From November 2023 to December 2024, the Houthis targeted more than 100 ships with missiles and drones over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In their campaign so far, the Houthis have sunk four vessels and killed at least eight mariners.",
      "The Iranian-backed Houthis stopped their attacks during a brief ceasefire in the war. They later became the target of an intense weekslong campaign of airstrikes ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump before he declared a ceasefire had been reached with the rebels. The Houthis sank two vessels in July, killing at least four on board, with others believed to be held by the rebels.",

Meanwhile, the future of talks between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran\u2019s battered nuclear program is in question after Israel launched a 12-day war against the Islamic Republic in which the Americans bombed three Iranian atomic sites.",

      "Nepal's crackdown on social media companies, which led to protests and police killing at least 19 people, is part of a yearslong decline of internet freedoms around the world as even democracies seek to curtail online speech.",
      "The Himalayan country\u2019s government said last week it was blocking several social media platforms including Facebook, X and YouTube because the companies failed to comply with a requirement that they register with the government. The ban was lifted Tuesday a day after the deadly protests.",
      "What's happening in Nepal mirrors \u201cthis broader pattern of controlling the narrative and controlling of stories emerging from the ground,\u201d said Aditya Vashistha, an assistant professor of information science at Cornell University. \u201cThis has happened several times in the neighboring countries India, Pakistan, Bangladesh. So this is nothing new \u2014 in fact, I would say this is taken from the playbook, which is now very established, of trying to control social media narratives.\u201d",
      "Like neighboring countries, Nepal's government have been asking the companies to appoint a liaison in the country. Officials are calling for laws to to monitor social media and ensure both the users and operators are responsible and accountable for what they share. But the move has been criticized as a tool for censorship and punishing opponents who voice their protests online.",
      "\u201cGovernments absolutely have a valid interest in seeking to regulate social media platforms. This is such a daily part of our lives and in our business. And it is certainly reasonable for authorities to sit down and say we want to develop rules for the road,\u201d said Kian Vesteinsson, senior research analyst for technology and democracy at the Washington-based nonprofit Freedom House.",
      "\u201cBut what we see in Nepal is that wholesale blocks as a means of enforcing a set of rules for social media companies results in wildly disproportionate harms. These measures that were put in place in Nepal (cut) tens of millions of people off from platforms that they used to express themselves, to conduct daily business, to speak with their families, to go to school, to get healthcare information.\u201d",
      "It's not just Nepal. Freedom House has found that global internet freedom has declined for the 14th consecutive year in 2024, as governments crack down on dissent and people face arrest for expressing political, social or religious views online. While China consistently tops the list as the \u201cworld's worst environment\u201d for internet freedom, last year Myanmar shared this designation as well. The organization did not track Nepal.",
      "India passed a telecommunications law in 2023 that gave its government \u201cbroad powers to restrict online communications and intercept communications,\" according to Freedom House. Three years earlier, a sweeping internet law put digital platforms like Facebook under direct government oversight. Officials say the rules are needed to quell misinformation and hate speech and to give users more power to flag objectionable content. But critics cautioned it would lead to censorship in a country where digital freedoms have already been shrinking.",
      "In January, meanwhile, Pakistan\u2019s lower house of parliament passed a bill that gives the government sweeping controls on social media, including sending users to prison for spreading disinformation.",
      "Calling internet freedom a \u201cpillar of modern democracy,\u201d Freedom House said a healthy 21st-century democracy cannot function without a trustworthy online environment, where people can access information and express themselves freely.",
      "Increasingly, though, governments are putting up roadblocks.",

      "Often, regulations are in the name of child safety, cyber crime or fraud, Vesteinsson said, \u201cbut unfortunately, a lot of this regulation comes hand in hand with restrictive measures.\u201d",
      "In the Nepali law, for instance, \u201cthe same provision of this law, directs social media platforms to restrict content relating to child trafficking and human trafficking and labor, a really important issue,\" he added. \"Two bullet points above that, it orders platforms to restrict people from posting anonymously.\u201d",
      "The Committee to Protect Journalists said Monday that the protests \u201cunderscore the widespread concerns over Nepal\u2019s ban on social media and the pressing need for the government to drop its order. Such a sweeping ban not only restricts freedom of expression, it also severely hinders journalists\u2019 work and the public\u2019s right to know.\u201d",
      "The crackdown appears to have spurred a surge in use of virtual private networks, or VPNs, according to Proton, which provides encrypted services. Signups for Proton\u2019s VPN service in Nepal have jumped by 8,000% since Sept. 3, according to data the company posted online. A VPN is a service that allows users to mask their location in order to circumvent censorship or geography-based online viewing restrictions.",
      "But experts caution that VPNs are not an end-all solution to government internet blocks. They can be expensive and out of reach for many people, Vashistha noted, and they can be slow and lead to lower-quality experiences when people try to access blocked social platforms.",
      "Google, Meta, X and TikTok (which registered and continues to operate) didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "Vesteinsson said companies can take important steps to safeguard privacy of their users \u2014 particularly human rights defenders and activists who might be a specific target for government repression in their countries.",

      "Artificial intelligence is transforming call centers by streamlining tasks and improving customer service",
      "NEW YORK -- Armen Kirakosian remembers the frustrations of his first job as a call center agent nearly 10 years ago: the aggravated customers, the constant searching through menus for information and the notes he had to physically write for each call he handled.",
      "Thanks to artificial intelligence, the 29-year-old from Athens, Greece, is no longer writing notes or clicking on countless menus. He often has full customer profiles in front of him when a person calls in and may already know what problem the customer has before even saying \u201chello.\u201d He can spend more time actually serving the customer.",
      "\u201cA.I. has taken (the) robot out of us,\u201d Kirakosian said.",
      "Roughly 3 million Americans work in call center jobs, and millions more work in call centers around the world, answering billions of inquiries a year about everything from broken iPhones to orders for shoes. Kirakosian works for TTEC, a company that provides third party customer service lines in 22 countries to companies in industries such as autos and banking that need extra capacity or have outsourced their call center operations.",
      "Answering these calls can be thankless work. Roughly half of all customer service agents leave the job after a year, according to McKinsey, with stress and monotonous work being among the reasons employees quit.",
      "Much of what these agents deal with is referred to in the industry as \u201cbreak/fix,\u201d which means something is broken \u2014 or wrong or confusing \u2014 and the customer expects the person on the phone to fix the problem. Now, it\u2019s a question of who will be tasked with the fix: a human, a computer, or a human augmented by a computer.",
      "Already, AI agents have taken over more routine call center tasks. Some jobs have been lost and there have been dire forecasts about the future job market for these individuals, ranging from modest single-percentage point losses, to as many as half of all call center jobs going away in the next decade. The drop likely won't match the more dire predictions, however, because it's become evident that the industry will still need humans, perhaps with even higher levels of learning and training, as some customer service issues become increasingly harder to solve.",
      "Some finance companies have already experimented with going in heavily with AI for their customer service issues.",
      "Klarna, the Swedish buy now, pay later company, replaced 700 of their roughly 3,000 customer service agents with chatbots and AI in 2024. The results were mixed. While the company did save money, Klarna found there was still a need for higher skilled human agents in certain circumstances, such as complicated issues related to identity theft. Earlier this year, Klarna hired seven internal freelancers to handle these issues.",
      "Earlier this year, Klarna hired a handful of customer service employees back to the firm, acknowledging there were certain issues that AI couldn\u2019t handle as well as a real person, like identity theft.",
      "\u201cOur vision of an AI-first contact center, where AI agents handle the majority of conversations and fewer, better trained and better paid human agents support only the most complex tasks, is quickly becoming a reality,\u201d said Gadi Shamia of Replicant, an AI-software company that trains chatbots to sound more human, in an interview with consultants at McKinsey.",

      "The call center customer's experience, while improved, is still far from perfect.",
      "The initial customer service call has long been handled through interactive voice response systems, known in the industry as IVR. Customers interact with IVR when they're told \u201cpress one for sales, press two for support, press five for billing.\u201d These crude systems got an update in the 2010s, when customers could prompt the system by saying \u201csales\u201d or \u201csupport\u201d or simple phrases like \u201cI\u2019d like to pay a bill\u201d instead of navigating through a labyrinthian set of menu options.",
      "But customers have little patience for these menus, leading them to \u201czero out,\u201d which is call center slang for when a customer hits the zero button on their their keypad in hopes of reaching a human. It\u2019s also not uncommon that after a customer \u201czeros out\u201d they will be put on hold and transferred because they did not end up in the right place for their request.",
      "Aware of Americans' collective impatience with IVR, Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Republican Jim Justice of West Virginia have introduced the \u201cKeep Call Centers in America Act,\u201d which would require clear ways to reach a human agent, and provide incentives to companies that keep call center jobs in the U.S.",
      "Companies are trying to roll out telephone systems that broadly understand customer service requests and predict where to send a customer without navigating a menu. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, is coming out with its \u201cChatGPT Agent\u201d service for users that\u2019s able to understand phrases like \u201cI need to find a hotel for a wedding next year, please give me options for clothing and gifts.\u201d",
      "Bank of America says it has had increasing success in integrating such features into \u201cErica,\u201d its chatbot that debuted in 2018. When Erica cannot handle a request, the agent transfers the customer directly to the right department. Erica is now also predictive and analytical, and knows for instance that a customer may repeatedly have a low balance and may need better help budgeting or may have multiple subscriptions to the same service.",
      "Bank of America said this month that Erica has been used 3 billion times since its creation and is increasingly taking on a higher case load of customer service requests. The chatbot's moniker comes from the last five letters of the company's name.",
      "James Bednar, vice president of product and innovation at TTEC, has spent much of his career trying to make customer service calls less painful for the caller as well as the company. He said these tools could eventually kill off IVR for good, ending the need for anyone to \u201czero out.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're getting to the point where AI will get you to the right person for your problem without you having to route through those menus,\u201d Bednar said.",

      "\u201cThe cheating is off the charts. It\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve seen in my entire career,\u201d says Casey Cuny, who has taught English for 23 years. Educators are no longer wondering if students will outsource schoolwork to AI chatbots. \u201cAnything you send home, you have to assume is being AI\u2019ed.\u201d",
      "The question now is how schools can adapt, because many of the teaching and assessment tools that have been used for generations are no longer effective. As AI technology rapidly improves and becomes more entwined with daily life, it is transforming how students learn and study, how teachers teach, and it\u2019s creating new confusion over what constitutes academic dishonesty.",
      "\u201cWe have to ask ourselves, what is cheating?\u201d says Cuny, a 2024 recipient of California\u2019s Teacher of the Year award. \u201cBecause I think the lines are getting blurred.\u201d",

The chatbot ends by asking if it can do more: \u201cWould you like help writing any part of the essay? I can help you draft an introduction or outline a paragraph!\u201d",
      "Students say they often turn to AI with good intentions for things like research, editing or help reading difficult texts. But AI offers unprecedented temptation and it\u2019s sometimes hard to know where to draw the line.",
      "College sophomore Lily Brown, a psychology major at an East Coast liberal arts school, relies on ChatGPT to help outline essays because she struggles putting the pieces together herself.

      "Her class syllabi say things like: \u201cDon\u2019t use AI to write essays and to form thoughts,\u201d she says, but that leaves a lot of grey area. Students say they often shy away from asking teachers for clarity because admitting to any AI use could flag them as a cheater.",
      "Schools tend to leave AI policies to teachers, which often means that rules vary widely within the same school. Some educators, for example, welcome the use of Grammarly.com, an AI-powered writing assistant, to check grammar. Others forbid it, noting the tool also offers to rewrite sentences.",
      "\u201cWhether you can use AI or not, depends on each classroom.

      "State government and the development authority demanded that six Morgan County property owners who challenged the zoning for Rivian Automotive pay more than $337,000 in legal fees incurred by the government.",
      "Morgan County Superior Court Judge Stephen Bradley, in a ruling filed Friday, said that the two lawsuits where the government agencies were seeking fees were far from frivolous, and that awarding legal fees to the government could make it harder for regular citizens to exercise their rights to challenge government actions in court.",
      "\u201cNo truly aggrieved citizen should be prohibited from suing to test the legality or constitutionality of the government\u2019s claims, and any precedent that could allow political actions and costs to be offloaded to complaining litigants would be untenable,\" Bradley wrote.",

      "Some students watched the video in the middle of class. Others pulled out their phones as they walked out of school and found themselves watching the videos over and over. Some teachers interrupted lessons to discuss the horrific news.",
      "Almost instantly after Charlie Kirk was assassinated Wednesday at Utah Valley University, the news \u2014 captured on video in grisly detail \u2014 sent shockwaves through classrooms everywhere. Because no matter teens' political opinions, everyone knew Kirk.",
      "In high school classes in Spanish Fork, Utah, chatter spread fast Wednesday, as students learned of the shooting and began to wonder if Kirk would live or die. A cellphone ban meant many students didn\u2019t learn of Kirk\u2019s fate until the final bell \u2014 pushing tough conversations in class to the next day.",
      "\u201cBy the end of the day, I was worn out,\u201d said English teacher Andrew Apsley. He discussed the shooting with each of his four classes Thursday at Landmark High School, about 15 miles south of UVU.",
      "In the current political climate and with new cellphone bans, schools have tried to push social media and controversial topics to the sidelines, saying classes should focus on basic academics. Kirk\u2019s shooting upended all that.",
      "Graphic footage of Kirk\u2019s shooting on the Utah college campus was available almost immediately online, captured by cellphones from several angles. The videos, in slow motion and real-time speed, show a direct view of Kirk being shot, his body recoiling and blood gushing from his neck. The videos were easy to find on X, TikTok and Instagram.",
      "Many teens say they feel traumatized by what they saw. They couldn\u2019t escape the videos popping up on their social media feeds or being passed to them by friends and classmates. Some teens posted warnings that urged people not to click on the Kirk videos, saying they wished the visuals had come with trigger warnings.",
      "Apsley's 19-year-old child received a gruesome video of Kirk's death in a message from a friend. His child has autism and has difficulty processing emotions, so the video was \u201cpretty traumatic,\u201d Apsley said. That incident became a teaching moment for Apsley's students.",
      "\u201cI know we want to be first. I know we want to be the one to share the information that other people rely on,\u201d Apsley recalled telling his classes. \u201cBut at the same time, not everyone is well-equipped to handle something as graphic and violent as that.\u201d",

      "In Canada, Aidan Groves was in a college writing class when he saw a headline on Reddit that Kirk had been shot. He had not shared Kirk's political views, yet \u201cmy heart sank, and I was immediately on edge,\u201d said Groves, a student at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology in Calgary. He quickly swiped through comments, feeling overcome by horror and dread. Even so, he left his classroom to watch the video.",
      "Groves, 19, grew up watching his dad play video games with violent imagery, but he was struck by the video\u2019s immediacy and the crowd\u2019s frantic reaction. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anybody die, and immediately everybody in this crowd had just witnessed that,\u201d he said.",

      "After Koreans detained in a historic raid on a Georgia Hyundai plant were sent home, lawyers and social workers say the nearly 200 non-Korean workers ensnared in the crackdown remain in legal limbo",
      "Ever since a massive immigration raid on a Hyundai manufacturing site swept up nearly 500 workers in southeast Georgia, Rosie Harrison said her organization\u2019s phones have been ringing nonstop with panicked families in need of help.",
      "\u201cWe have individuals returning calls every day, but the list doesn\u2019t end,\u201d Harrison said. She runs an apolitical non-profit called Grow Initiative that connects low-income families \u2014 immigrant and non-immigrant alike \u2014 with food, housing and educational resources.",
      "Since the raid, Harrison said, \u201cfamilies are experiencing a new level of crisis.\u201d",
      "A majority of the 475 people who were detained in the workplace raid \u2014 which U.S. officials have called the largest in two decades \u2014 were Korean and have returned to South Korea. But lawyers and social workers say many of the non-Korean immigrants ensnared in the crackdown remain in legal limbo or are otherwise unaccounted for.",
      "As the raid began the morning of Sept. 4, workers almost immediately started calling Migrant Equity Southeast, a local nonprofit that connects immigrants with legal and financial resources. The small organization of approximately 15 employees fielded calls regarding people from Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador and Venezuela, spokesperson Vanessa Contreras said.",
      "Throughout the day, people described federal agents taking cellphones from workers and putting them in long lines, Contreras said. Some workers hid for hours to avoid capture, in air ducts or remote areas of the sprawling property. The Department of Justice said some hid in a nearby sewage pond.",
      "People off-site called the organization frantically seeking the whereabouts of loved ones who worked at the plant and were suddenly unreachable.",
      "Like many of the Koreans who were working at the plant, advocates and lawyers representing the non-Korean workers caught up in the raid say that some who were detained had legal authorization to work in the United States.",
      "Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded to emailed requests for comment Friday. It is not clear how many people detained during the raid remain in custody.",
      "Atlanta-based attorney Charles Kuck, who represents both Korean and non-Korean workers who were detained, said two of his clients were legally working under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was created by former President Barack Obama. One had been released and \u201cshould have never been arrested,\u201d he said, while the other was still being held because he was recently charged with driving under the influence.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say how they chose who they were going to release and who they were going to take into custody,\u201d Palacios said, adding that some who were arrested didn\u2019t have an alien identification number and were still unaccounted for.",

      "The financial impact of the raid at the construction site for a battery factory that will be operated by HL-GA Battery Co. was compounded by the fact that another massive employer in the area \u2014 International Paper Co. \u2014 is closing at the end of the month, laying off another 800 workers, Harrison said.",
      "Growth Initiative doesn\u2019t check immigration status, Harrison said, but almost all families who have reached out to her have said that their detained loved ones had legal authorization to work in the United States, leaving many confused about why their relative was taken into custody in the first place.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.",
      "The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.",
      "Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program \u201cburdensome\u201d and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.",
      "Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency\u2019s statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.",
      "\u201cThe Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,\u201d Zeldin said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIt costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation\u2019s prosperity and hurting American communities,'' he said. \"With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA\u2019s statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.''",
      "But experts say dropping the requirement \u2014 as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history \u2014 risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air.

      "Some Nebraska lawmakers and residents say the Republican governor's plan to convert a prison into an immigration detention center has come with few details about the transition",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- No formal agreement has been signed to convert a remote state prison in Nebraska into the latest immigration detention center for President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping crackdown, more than three weeks since the governor announced the plan and as lawmakers and nearby residents grow increasingly skeptical.",
      "Corrections officials insist the facility could start housing hundreds of male detainees next month, with classrooms and other spaces at the McCook Work Ethic Camp retrofitted for beds. However, lawmakers briefed last week by state officials said they got few concrete answers about cost, staffing and oversight.",
      "\u201cThere was more unanswered questions than answered questions in terms of what they know,\u201d state Sen. Wendy DeBoer said.",
      "Officials in the city of McCook were caught off guard in mid-August when Republican Gov. Jim Pillen announced that the minimum-security prison in rural southwest Nebraska would serve as a Midwest hub for immigration detainees. Pillen and federal officials dubbed it the \u201cCornhusker Clink,\" in line with other alliterative detention centers such as \u201c Alligator Alcatraz \u201d in Florida and the \u201c Speedway Slammer \u201d in Indiana.",
      "\u201cCity leaders were given absolutely no choice in the matter,\u201d said Mike O\u2019Dell, publisher of the local newspaper, the McCook Gazette.",
      "McCook is the seat of Red Willow County where voters favored Trump in the 2024 election by nearly 80%. Most of them likely support the president's immigration crackdown, O'Dell said. However, the city of around 7,000 has also grown accustomed to the camp's low-level offenders working on roads, in parks, county and city offices and even local schools.",
      "\u201cPeople here have gotten to know them in many cases,\u201d O'Dell said. \u201cI think there is a feeling here that people want to know where these folks are going to end up and that they'll be OK.\u201d",
      "The Work Ethic Camp first opened in 2001 and currently houses around 155 inmates who participate in education, treatment and work programs to help them transition to life outside prison. State leaders often praise it as success story for reducing prisoner recidivism.",
      "Some lawmakers have complained that Pillen acted rashly in offering up the facility, noting that the state's prison system is already one of the nation's most overcrowded and perpetually understaffed. The governor's office and state prison officials met with members of the Legislature's Judiciary Committee last week to answer questions about the transfer.",
      "What the lawmakers got, several said, were estimates and speculation.",
      "Lawmakers were told it was the governor's office that approached federal officials with the offer after Trump \u201cmade a generalized, widespread call that we need more room or something for detainees,\u201d said DeBoer, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature.",

      "To that end, state Sen.

      "Cities across the U.S. are combining art with shade to shield people from rising temperatures and educate them about our warming world",
      "LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE, Calif. -- When sculptor Bobby Zokaites moved to Phoenix in the summer of 2011, walking the half mile to classes at Arizona State University in triple-digit heat felt risky. He learned to find shade along his route \u2014 resting in a stoplight's sliver of it, dodging the sizzling sun at each opportunity.",
      "\u201cIt was pretty crazy,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Those experiences influenced one of Zokaites' latest projects: He was one of nine artists commissioned this year to bring shade to the region.",
      "Across the U.S., cities are weaving art, science and community engagement to protect people from extreme heat and communicate its risks. As cities adapt to hotter temperatures, driven by human-caused climate change, and contend with urban heat, shade is playing a critical role. But communicating heat risks and safety can be challenging. That is where art comes in. It can engage, bring hope and even enhance how cool someone feels.",
      "Shade \u201ccan be much more than functional,\" said David Hondula, Phoenix\u2019s director of heat response and mitigation. \"It can enrich our public spaces.\"",
      "At one park in Phoenix, a large awning is held up with panels of dazzling colors. On them are painted whimsical creatures called \u201calebrijes\" from Mexican folk art, and the structure contains a solar-powered misting system. At another park, a canopy decorated with colorful drawings uses reflective paint and an ultraviolet-resistant canvas.",
      "These are part of Phoenix's temporary public art pieces created with help from locals. Each was unveiled during a community event featuring information about shade and heat safety, along with free cooling towels and sunscreen.",
      "\u201cThe more you know and the more you can recognize your own body\u2019s response, the better you can take care of yourself,\" said Carrie Brown, deputy director for the city's office of art and culture.",
      "These art installations are one element of the city's plan to expand shade. Studies show that shade significantly reduces air and surface temperature and how intensely people feel heat. In a city that has averaged in the last decade more than 115 days annually with day temperatures past 100 F (38 C), cooling shade can be lifesaving.",
      "Shade can feel even cooler when combined with beauty. One study in Phoenix, co-authored by Hondula, found that people rated aesthetically pleasing bus stops as being cooler than less beautiful ones. In another from Hong Kong, findings suggested that people had a higher heat tolerance when they perceived their environment as quiet and beautiful.",
      "In Cambridge, Massachusetts, a place accustomed to dreary winters but not heat, a project titled \u201c Shade is Social Justice \u201d is helping the city convey heat dangers and safety with creative designs. One installation features hanging flowers that open when temperatures hit 85 F (29 C), signaling to people to cool down with water and shade, said Claudia Zarazua, the city's art and cultural planning director.",

He measured temperature, humidity, wind and radiation, then estimated what could be happening to a person\u2019s body in both the shade and in direct sun light.",
      "He found that moving from sun to shade dropped the mean radiant temperature from about 145 F (63 C) to 88 F (about 31 C). The change did not significantly affect core temperature, but skin temperature decreased immediately. When MaRTy3D+ returned to the sun, skin temperature rose again.",
      "MaRTy 3D+'s ability to model and measure how different people thermoregulate is unique. It can tell researchers, for instance, the skin and core temperature as well as cardiac strain in someone who is elderly or on a specific medication, said Jennifer Vanos, an associate professor at ASU who studies heat\u2019s impacts on the human body and how to mitigate them. This technology allows them to collect real-time data in sometimes risky situations without impacting humans. They are using their findings to make recommendations to the city.",
      "Edith de Guzman, a cooperative extension researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, has spent years researching how to increase shade in communities most impacted by heat. With colleagues, she has also quantified that shade can reduce up to 25% of heat-related deaths in LA and up to 66% of heat-related emergency room visits. When the opportunity emerged to curate an art exhibit about shade and who lacks access to it, she and her husband took it.",
      "\u201cRoots of Cool: A Celebration of Trees and Shade in a Warming World\" takes visitors into the past, present and future roles of shade in LA with textiles, paintings, mixed media, interactive maps, suspended multicolored umbrellas and more. Their goal is not just to highlight the issue, but also show the general public that solutions exist, de Guzman said.",
      "A three-part installation by artist Leslie K. Gray invites visitors to consider the past, current and future experiences of public transportation users in the city. Each features a silhouetted woman waiting at a bus stop with either no shade, a little bit or ample amounts. The bus stop signs include facts about the dangers of heat, the benefits of shade and the disparate access to it.",
      "The exhibit ends in a room with hundreds of postcards with handwritten messages from visitors to the past, present or future. On the other side are drawings showing how they would bring much-needed shade to a bus stop.",
      "Behind one card dated Sept. 1, a visitor wrote this message: \"Dear people from the past. Take care of others among you. Take care of mother earth or we will be at fault for its destruction and ours. Sincerely \u2014 Someone (who's) watching the effects of our actions occur.\"",

      "The goal of swatting is to get authorities, particularly a SWAT team, to respond to an address and has roots in fake bomb threats that have been around for decades.",
      "Some of the earliest swats stemmed from online gaming disputes. But gradually they became connected to nihilistic groups, which often conduct the calls in mass batches, trading tips in online forums on how to avoid detection.",
      "The FBI said swatting is on the rise. Since a center was created in 2023 to gather details on swatting incidents, hundreds of law enforcement agencies have voluntarily submitted thousands of incidents, the FBI said.",
      "Swatting has become so prevalent that the U.S. Department of Education offered guidance on how to spot hoax calls. Clues include if the caller can\u2019t answer follow-up questions about their phone number or current location, or mispronounces names.",
      "Purgatory, a group affiliated with The Com, which is a loose network of online threat actors, has been linked to some of the recent swats, according to reports from the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, an Alabama-based nonprofit that tracks extremist groups online, and the nonprofit Center for Internet Security and Institute for Strategic Dialogue. The FBI declined to comment on the reports.",
      "On more than two hours of livestreams captured by the nonprofits and provided to The Associated Press, the caller\u2019s friends can be heard in the background laughing, belching and taking breaks to rap.",

      "As a giggling throng listened on messaging platform Telegram, the swatter then described a man armed with an AR-15 prowling the university\u2019s library, a description that was nearly identical to the calls flooding other university towns. The gunfire that peppered the call also was a tip-off because it \u201csounded like it was from a TV,\" Ascher said.",
      "On the livestream, the clearly skeptical dispatcher asked why the caller couldn't see the purported gunman when the shots sounded so close to him and why other 911 calls weren't flooding in.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The fate of a key California climate program Gov. Gavin Newsom has championed as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration's environmental rollbacks is in the hands of state lawmakers.",
      "The Democrat-dominated Legislature is slated to vote Saturday on whether to extend the state's cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. The program, which launched in 2013, allows major greenhouse gas emitters to buy emission allowances from the state, with fewer available over time. Revenues fund climate change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.",
      "Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year.",
      "\u201cAfter months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution \u2014 all while fast-tracking California\u2019s transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,\u201d Newsom said after striking the deal this week.",
      "The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state's climate targets and potentially boost carbon removal projects. It would also change the name to \u201ccap and invest\" to emphasize its funding of climate programs.",
      "The Legislature will vote on another bill committing annual funding from the program's revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state's long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.",
      "The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state\u2019s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state's refining capacity, according to energy regulators.",
      "Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program's future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration's attacks on climate programs, including the state's first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.",
      "Cap and trade is an important cost-effective tool for curbing carbon emissions, said Katelyn Roedner Sutter, the California state director for the Environmental Defense Fund.",
      "\u201cSupporting this program and making this commitment into the future is extremely important \u2014 now more than ever,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "FBI Director Kash Patel is bracing for scrutiny over his leadership of the Charlie Kirk investigation and other areas when he appears before Congress this coming week for oversight hearings",
      "WASHINGTON -- Hours after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, FBI Director Kash Patel declared online that \u201cthe subject\u201d in the killing was in custody. The shooter was not. The two men who had been detained were quickly released, and Utah officials acknowledged that the gunman remained at large.",
      "The false assurance was more than a slip. It spotlighted the high-stakes uncertainty surrounding Patel\u2019s leadership of the bureau when its credibility \u2014 and his own \u2014 are under extraordinary pressure.",
      "Patel now approaches congressional oversight hearings this coming week facing not just questions about that investigation but broader doubts about whether he can stabilize a federal law enforcement agency fragmented by political fights and internal upheaval.",
      "Democrats are poised to press Patel on a purge of senior executives that has prompted a lawsuit, his pursuit of President Donald Trump\u2019s grievances long after the Russia investigation ended, and a realignment of resources that has prioritized the fight against illegal immigration and street crime even though the agency has for decades been defined by its work on complicated threats like counterintelligence and corruption.",
      "That\u2019s in addition to questions about the handling of files from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case, the addition of a co-deputy director to serve alongside Dan Bongino, and the use of polygraphs on some agents in recent months to identify sources of leaks. Republicans, meanwhile, are likely to rally to his defense or redirect the spotlight toward the bureau\u2019s critics.",
      "The hearings will offer Patel his most consequential stage yet, and perhaps the clearest test of whether he can convince the country that the FBI, under his watch, can avoid compounding its mistakes in a time of political violence and deepening distrust.",
      "\u201cBecause of the skepticism that some members of the Senate have had and still have, it's extremely important that he perform very well at these oversight hearings\u201d on Tuesday and Wednesday, said Gregory Brower, a former FBI executive who served as its top congressional affairs official.",
      "The FBI declined to comment about Patel's coming testimony to the committee.",
      "Kirk's killing was always going to be a closely scrutinized investigation, not only because it was the latest burst of political violence inside the United States but also because of Kirk's friendships with Trump, Patel and other administration figures and allies.",
      "While agents from Salt Lake City investigated, Patel posted on X that \u201cthe subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody.\u201d Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said at a near-contemporaneous news conference that \u201cWhoever we did this, we will find you,\u201d suggesting authorities were still searching. Patel soon after posted that the person in custody had been released.",
      "\u201cThat does not deliver the message that you want the public to hear,\u201d said Chris O'Leary, a retired FBI counterterrorism executive. \u201cIt had the opposite effect. People start to wonder what is going in. This looks like the Keystone Cops and it continues to get worse.\u201d",
      "The next day, a scheduled afternoon news conference was canceled for \u201crapid developments\u201d as Patel and Bongino flew to Utah. It was held instead in the evening. Patel appeared but did not speak.",
      "As the search stretched on for over a day, Patel vented on a call with FBI personnel Thursday about what he perceived as a failure to keep him informed, including that he was not quickly shown a photograph of the suspected shooter. That's according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to discuss it by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press. The New York Times earlier reported details of the call.",
      "On Friday morning, authorities announced the arrest at a news conference where Patel claimed credit for certain investigative steps, saying that, \u201cAt my direction, the FBI released the first set of FBI photos.\u201d",
      "Asked about the scrutiny of his performance, the FBI issued a statement saying that it had worked with local law enforcement to bring the suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, to justice and \u201cwill continue to be transparent with the American people.\u201d",
      "Patel's overall response did not go unnoticed in conservative circles. One prominent strategist, Christopher Rufo, posted on X that it was \u201ctime for Republicans to assess whether Kash Patel is the right man to run the FBI.\u201d",

      "On the same day Kirk was killed, Patel faced a separate problem: a lawsuit from three FBI senior executives fired in an August purge that wiped away decades of institutional experience and that they characterized as a Trump administration retribution campaign.",
      "Among those fired was Brian Driscoll, who as acting FBI director in the early days of the Trump administration resisted Justice Department demands for names of agents who investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Driscoll alleged in the lawsuit that he was let go after clashing with Patel over administration demands to fire an FBI pilot who'd been wrongly identified on social media as the case agent in the classified documents investigation of Trump.",
      "The lawsuit quotes Patel as having told Driscoll his job depended on firing people the White House wanted gone. The FBI has declined to comment on the lawsuit.",
      "The other plaintiffs are Spencer Evans, a former top agent in Las Vegas whose termination letter cited a \u201clack of reasonableness and overzealousness\u201d in implementing COVID-19 policies as a human resources official \u2014 a claim his lawyers call false \u2014 and Steve Jensen, who helped oversee FBI investigations into the Jan. 6. Capitol riot.",
      "The upheaval continues a trend that began before Patel took over, when more than a half-dozen senior executives were forced out under a Justice Department rationale that they could not be \u201ctrusted\u201d to implement Trump's agenda.",
      "There's since been significant turnover in leadership at the FBI's 55 field offices. Some left because of promotions and planned retirements, but others because of ultimatums to resign or accept new assignments. The head of the Salt Lake City office, an experienced counterterrorism investigator, was pushed out of her position weeks before Kirk was killed at a Utah college, said people familiar with the move.",
      "In July, an agent based in Norfolk, Virginia, Michael Feinberg, authored a first-person account saying he was told to brace for a demotion and a polygraph exam because of his friendship with Peter Strzok , a lead FBI agent in the investigation into ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign fired over derogatory text messages sent about Trump. Feinberg resigned.",
      "Patel arrived at the FBI having been a sharp critic of its leadership, including for inquiries into Trump that he says politicized the institution. Under Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, the FBI and Justice Department have become entangled in their own politically fraught investigations, such as the one into New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "He's moved quickly to remake the bureau, with the FBI and Justice Department working to investigate one of the Republican president's chief grievances \u2014 the years-old Trump-Russia investigation. Trump calls that probe, which did not establish a criminal conspiracy between Russia and Trump\u2019s campaign, a \u201choax\" and \u201cwitch hunt.\"",
      "The Justice Department appeared to confirm in an unusual statement that it was investigating former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan, pivotal players in the Russia saga listed by Patel in a book he authored as \u201cmembers of the Executive Branch Deep State,\u201d but did not say for what. Bondi has directed that evidence be presented to a grand jury, and agents and prosecutors have begun requesting information and interviews from former officials related to the investigation, according to multiple people familiar with the outreach.",
      "Critics of the fresh Russia inquiry consider it a transparent attempt to turn the page from the fierce backlash the FBI and Justice Department endured from elements of Trump's base following their July announcement that they would not be releasing any additional documents from the Epstein investigation.",
      "Patel has meanwhile elevated the fight against street crime, drug trafficking and illegal immigration to the top of the FBI's agenda, in alignment with Trump's agenda.",
      "The FBI has been key to the federal government's takeover of the Washington police department, participating with partner agencies in arrests for crimes, like drunken driving, not historically thought of as central FBI priorities.",
      "The bureau makes no apologies for aggressive policing in American cities the Trump administration contends have been consumed by crime. Patel and Bongino have been promoting the number of arrests involving federal law enforcement in an initiative they dub Operation Summer Heat. Patel says the thousands of cumulative arrests, many of them immigration-related, are \u201cwhat happens when you let good cops be good cops.\u201d",
      "But some are concerned the street crime focus could draw attention from the sophisticated public corruption and national security threats for which the bureau has long been primarily, if not solely, responsible for investigating. In one example, a federal corruption squad in Washington was disbanded this past spring.",
      "\u201cOne of the big problems that I see is that the investigative programs that have been hurt the most this year are the ones that really only the FBI does, or the FBI does better than anybody else,\u201d said Matt DeSarno, who retired in 2022 as head of the Dallas field office.",

      "One FBI agent presented a 3D computer model of the golf course that showed the so-called sniper\u2019s nest was about 125 feet (38 meters) from the 6th hole, according to local news outlets. Another agent described the collection of evidence, which included an SKS semi-automatic rifle with a round chambered, extra ammunition, metal ballistic plates and cans of Vienna sausages. A Palm Beach deputy testified that the area was swept for explosives, but none were found.",
      "It was the second day of testimony, coming the day after opening statements were cut short. The federal government took its full 40 minutes, but U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon declared that defendant Ryan Routh, who is representing himself, forfeited his right to continue making an opening statement after failing to keep his comments relevant to the case despite repeated warnings.",
      "The case was previously expected to run two or three weeks, but that timeline could shorten, as Routh's cross examinations of prosecution witnesses have been relatively brief. Meanwhile, Routh has indicated that he plans to call a firearms expert, as well as several character witnesses. Routh hasn't said whether he plans to testify himself.",
      "Bob Jarvis, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University, said there are three ways that a defendant representing himself could testify. The method is up to the judge\u2019s discretion, but the judge can\u2019t prevent a defendant from testifying.",

      "Veronica Swanson Beard and Veronica Miele Beard first met at a wedding, where they were seated next to each other. That day, Swanson Beard made two important connections.",
      "\"I met my husband and my work wife all at that wedding,\" she told CBS Saturday Morning with a laugh.",
      "Their their lives began on opposite coasts: Miele Beard grew up in North Caldwell, New Jersey, raised by a single mother, while Swanson Beard was raised in California as an heir to the Swanson frozen-food fortune. The two became sisters-in-law when they married brothers. As their families grew, so did their careers. Swanson Beard pursued fashion, while Miele Beard thrived in finance. What the women shared was a passion for style.",
      "\"Since I was four years old, that's been my dream,\" said Swanson Beard. \"Fashion was the greatest expression of yourself. You could wake up and be whoever you wanted to be.\"",
      "For Miele Beard, even on Wall Street, what she wore was a statement of confidence and authority in a male-dominated environment.",
      "But when it came to dressing for work, both women noticed something missing: a staple piece that could anchor a modern woman's wardrobe. Their answer was inspired by history. In the 1840s, detachable shirtfronts known as \"dickeys\" gave men the appearance of a full shirt beneath their waistcoat without the bulk. Reimagining that idea, the duo designed a tailored blazer with an interchangeable insert.",
      "In 2010, their namesake label, Veronica Beard, was born, along with its now-iconic Dickey Jacket. The early days were anything but glamorous. Swanson Beard set up a makeshift showroom in her apartment, juggling young children and a dog, while Miele Beard announced mid-launch that she was pregnant with her fifth child. Between the two, they had eight children and a fledgling business.",
      "Their breakthrough came with Saks Fifth Avenue, which gave the brand its first major retail platform. From there, Veronica Beard rapidly grew, and today boasts 42 stores worldwide, including a flagship location on Madison Avenue in New York City.",
      "\"It was the most thrilling moment of our career,\" Swanson Beard said of the store opening. \"It was the physical manifestation of all of our hopes and dreams.\"",

      "\"We love the idea of the uniform being your blazer with jeans,\" said Miele Beard. \"Get your best pair of jeans, throw on a white tank and a jacket, and you're done. You've just elevated your style.\"",
      "The Dickey Jacket remains the brand's signature piece. When Gwyneth Paltrow featured it on Goop, the Beards knew they had made it.",
      "\"For us, that was like being on Oprah's list,\" Swanson Beard said.",
      "Beyond fashion, the duo is committed to giving back. Their philanthropic initiative, Veronica Beard Gives Back, supports causes including Feeding America, the American Heart Association, and the Council of Fashion Designers of America.",
      "Their mission resonates with the women who choose their clothes. Recently, Katherine, Princess of Wales wore a Veronica Beard dress to announce she had completed her cancer treatment.",
      "\"She could have chosen a power suit to say, 'I'm strong,'\" said Swanson Beard. \"Instead, she chose something feminine and earthy. I was so emotional about it.\"",
      "At its heart, Veronica Beard is more than a label; it's a mantra.",
      "\"We always say our battle cry is 'make it happen,'\" Swanson Beard explained. \"For us, being the clothes on a woman's back when she's making it happen is the greatest thing in the world.\"",

      "London\u00a0\u2014 Prince Harry made a rare trip back to the United Kingdom this week, and while most of the visit was filled with public events at charities the Duke of Sussex supports, he also met with his father, King Charles III, for the first time since February 2024.",
      "Harry has said previously that he wants to rebuild his relationship with his family, which has been strained since he and his wife Meghan formally stepped down from their roles as working royals and moved to California.",
      "This meeting was at Buckingham Palace, the monarch's official residence in London. CBS News has been told they met privately, for tea, but that all other details of the encounter were private.",
      "Speaking to reporters at an event later, Prince Harry said only that his father was \"doing great\" amid his ongoing treatment for an unspecified form of cancer.",
      "While Harry hasn't been a \"working royal\" for a couple years, he seemed keen to show on this visit to his home nation that he is still prince charming.",
      "The four-day visit was a clear effort to show he hasn't lost any love for the causes he holds dear, including supporting sick children and wounded military veterans.",
      "Absent on this trip were Harry's wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and their children, Archie and Lilibet.",
      "In an interview with CBS News' partner network BBC News in May, Harry said he couldn't envision bringing them all back to the U.K. with him since he has lost a legal bid to have his downgraded state security detail restored.",
      "Harry said his battle with the U.K. government to get full state-security restored for himself and his family during visits back to Britain caused a rift between himself and his father.",
      "\"Life is precious. I don't know how much longer my father has. He won't speak to me because of this security stuff, but it would be nice to reconcile,\" he told the BBC.",
      "That reconciliation may have begun on Wednesday. Harry arrived at Buckingham Palace in the afternoon and was seen leaving less than an hour later.",
      "The father and son relationship is not the only bond that has been strained by the circumstances of Harry and Meghan's departure \u2014 and the prince's tell-all book \"Spare,\" and their interviews, and a documentary, in which they were highly critical of their treatment at the hands of the royal family.",
      "It has been even longer since Harry met with his brother, Prince William, who is next in line to sit on the British throne.",
      "This week, Prince William and Harry appeared at charity events at the same time, only about 10 miles from each other. But those who follow the royal family say they remain far apart.",
      "\"William and Harry haven't seen each other in person since 2022, since the late queen's funeral. And I believe they haven't spoken personally for the same period. So, there's been no contact,\" Roya Nikkhah, the royal editor for the Sunday Times newspaper, told CBS News on Tuesday. \"There's no chance that William and Harry are going to meet up anytime soon... There is no desire on either side to do that. You know, the brothers haven't seen each other for such a long time and relations are as bad as they've ever been \u2014 non-existent.\"",

    "summary": "Four physicians, who recently resigned from the CDC in protest, tell \"Sunday Morning\" they believe HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is jeopardizing the nation's public health.",
    "story": [
      "At the end of summer, Congress is often sleepy, and slowly gets back to work. But this past week was an exception. On Capitol Hill, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. arrived, and the controversial Health and Human Services Secretary sparked a reckoning over public health in America.",
      "At a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday, Kennedy defended the Trump administration's policies: \"We at HHS are enacting a once-in-a-generation shift from a sick-care system, to a true health care system that tackles the root causes of chronic disease,\" he said.",
      "Tempers ran hot at the hearing. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said, \"This is not a podcast. It is the American people's health that is on the line here.\"",
      "Democrats rebuked Kennedy, perhaps the most high-profile member of President Donald Trump's cabinet. Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) asked Kennedy, \"When were you lying, sir \u2013   when you told this committee that you were not anti-vax? Or when you told Americans that there's no safe and effective vaccine?\"",
      "To which Kennedy replied, \"Both things are true.\"",
      "There were Republicans who offered broad support for Kennedy. Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Ida.) said, \"President Trump and Secretary Kennedy have made a steadfast commitment to make America healthy again.\"",
      "Yet some Republicans notably did push Kennedy on how his long-standing opposition to vaccine mandates is affecting policy, and on Kennedy's doubts about the safety of various vaccines. Sen. John Barasso (R-Wyo.) said, \"There are real concerns that safe, proven vaccines like measles, like hepatitis B and others, could be in jeopardy.\"",
      "The committee room standoff had been brewing for days. On Aug. 27, the government announced new restrictions on eligibility for COVID vaccinations. That decision prompted some health organizations to warn the policy could cause confusion.",
      "That same day, the Trump White House said Susan Monarez, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who had just been confirmed by the Senate weeks earlier, was fired.",
      "The Trump White House stood by Secretary Kennedy's sweeping changes, and by the firing. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said of Monarez, \"She was not aligned with President Trump's mission to make America healthy again.\"",
      "In a statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, \"The White House maintains full confidence in Secretary Kennedy's leadership at HHS to advance President Trump's MAHA agenda. With Operation Warp Speed's unprecedented success delivering COVID-19 vaccines in record time, President Trump proved that it's possible to shake up the status quo of our broken and bureaucratic public health system to deliver real results for the American people. Now the second Trump administration is building on this record and experience to restore Gold Standard Science as the guiding principle of health decision-making at HHS to Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Susan Monarez has written that she was pressured to \"compromise science itself\" \u2013 and to sign off on people who \"have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric.\"",
      "This turbulence has put Kennedy, who was a key Trump ally during last year's campaign, in the spotlight.",
      "Asked whether there has been pressure within the Republican Party to stand by Kennedy, Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul said, \"Nobody's pressured me or ever called me on it. I sort of speak my mind. And these are long-standing beliefs for me.\"",
      "Paul, an ophthalmologist, supports Kennedy, and lays blame on scientists \u2014 not skeptics \u2014 for worries about vaccine safety. \"All the doubt over vaccines is \u2013 there might be some doubt coming from those who don't want you to take a vaccine, but quite a bit of doubt is coming from the establishment that I believe is authoritarian in nature,\" said Paul. \"You don't care whether they tell you what to do. You should just do what you're told. We know better than you.\"",
      "But some who have worked at the highest level are fighting back against criticism, and are sounding an alarm.",
      "\"A significant distrust of vaccines\"",
      "Four CDC officials \u2014 Doctors Jennifer Layden, Daniel Jernigan, Debra Houry, and Demetre Daskalakis \u2014 all have resigned in recent days, some citing Secretary Kennedy's vaccine policies, others citing the upheaval at the CDC, which provides crucial health guidance nationwide.",
      "And all four expressed concerns about their resulting trust in CDC information about vaccines and vaccine safety data. \"It's why I left; I'm very concerned,\" said Dr. Daskalakis. \"We've already crossed the line. The COVID recommendations for children and pregnant women are completely not based in any evidence that world experts agree on.\"",
      "I asked, \"You know Secretary Kennedy would push back on that; what would you tell him?\"",
      "\"Ah, easy,\" Daskalakis replied. \"The recommendation is that there should be no healthy kids that get the vaccine; it should only be in kids with underlying conditions. Kids that are six-months-old, 56% of them that are admitted to the hospital have no underlying condition. So, by not offering the vaccine to parents who are willing to do it, those kids that could have been protected won't be.\"",
      "Asked how he would label Kennedy and his view of vaccines, Dr. Daniel Jernigan said, \"I think he has a significant distrust of vaccines. I don't know that he's driving a get-rid-of-vaccines agenda. It's more death by a thousand cuts, death by a thousand questions, calling into question data that has been accepted for many, many years, and simply that calling it into question brings into people's minds that, 'Maybe I shouldn't get that vaccine.'\"",
      "Dr. Debra Houry said that when Kennedy began at HHS, \"I read his books. I wanted to better understand his research and his background on it. So, we were open, you know, to having those discussions.\"",
      "In an additional statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said:",
      "\"Americans haven't forgotten how 'the science' was politicized and weaponized during the COVID era by unaccountable 'health officials' to push intrusive mandates and stifle any semblance of the skepticism that actual scientific inquiry is based on. The Trump administration is committed to restoring evidence-based, Gold Standard Science and answering the questions that Americans haven't been allowed to ask to restore trust, confidence, and accountability in our public health bodies.\"",
      "Asked what the cost to Americans would be of doctors and other officials leaving the CDC, Dr. Jennifer Layden said, \"We're talking about the whole public health infrastructure of our nation. And I think when we start to see (and we will) outbreaks that normally don't happen \u2013 more food-borne outbreaks, Legionella outbreaks, rising measles cases \u2013 people will start to care. That may take time for us to see some of those negative consequences, but that's what the ripple effect of all this will do across our nation.\"",
      "In fact, ripple effects are already apparent.",
      "\"Diseases don't obey borders\"",
      "Just this past week, Florida's Republican governor announced plans to eliminate all childhood vaccine requirements.",
      "Meanwhile, West Coast Democratic governors who oppose Secretary Kennedy's policies are moving fast to protect vaccine programs in their states.",
      "I asked Dr. Atul Gawande, a surgeon who served in the Biden administration, \"What is the consequence for the country when you have such a differentiation? It's splintered.\"",
      "\"It's severely splintered, and I'm very worried about it,\" Gawandea replied, \"because diseases don't obey borders.",
      "For Gawande, Kennedy's actions could upend not only federal agencies, but America's standing in global health. \"There isn't always consensus, for sure, among our own medical community,\" he said, \"but we generally have been able to come together enough to be able to say, 'Here is where we can assure getting \u2013 whether it's COVID boosters, and making sure we don't leave out the people who are most in need of vaccination \u2013 to making sure we're not abandoning our childhood immunization. Other countries around the world are baffled by our now falling into a civil war over whether the discoveries that have saved the world mattered.\"",
      "Later this month, the CDC's vaccine advisory board \u2014\u00a0now featuring Kennedy appointees\u00a0\u2014 will meet to decide future guidelines.",
      "At the end of the day, Gawande says, \"Trust helps assuage doubt.\"",
      "But, I asked, \"Is trust still possible in this environment?\"",
      "\"Trust is still possible,\" said Gawande, \"but it is not possible while we have leaders who actively drive chaos, who actively are trying to create uncertainty and break down trust. But ultimately, people have to choose the leaders who have the track record of demonstrating better outcomes. And those leaders are scientists, health professionals, and others who have demonstrated over years that they actually get you better results.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration wants an appeals court to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook before an interest rate meeting next week.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration asked a federal appeals court Thursday to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, in time for a crucial meeting next week when Fed officials will decide whether to lower interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook from the Federal Reserve's powerful Board of Governors last month, accusing her of falsely claiming two different homes as her principal residence in mortgage documents. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb blocked the firing on Tuesday, concluding that the president \"has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal.\" Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be removed \"for cause.\"",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to stay that ruling while the government appeals it. The Justice Department argued that the president has broad discretion to remove federal officials, including to decide whether \"cause\" exists, and courts have \u2014 at most \u2014 extremely narrow authority to review those decisions.",
      "\"Here, the evidence\u2014which Cook has yet to offer contrary explanation for\u2014was that she applied for two loans for her personal benefit, and was able to obtain favorable interest rates by misrepresenting where she lived,\" the government argued Thursday. \"Regardless of whether that misconduct occurred before or during office, it indisputably calls into question Cook's trustworthiness and whether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy for the whole Nation.\"",
      "Those allegations surfaced in a letter from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee who cited mortgage papers for homes that Cook bought in Georgia and Michigan in 2021. Abbe Lowell, an attorney representing Cook, called the government's accusations \"unsubstantiated and vague.\"",
      "The government requested that the appeals court act by the end of the day on Monday, noting that the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Cook's attorneys asked the appellate court to deny the Trump administration's request, calling it \"wholly unwarranted.\"",
      "\"An administrative stay would threaten Governor Cook's participation in next week's meeting and potentially plunge the FOMC's vote into turmoil,\" Cook's attorneys wrote in court papers. \"In addition, it has the real potential of impacting domestic and foreign markets. The Government has provided no justification for such a grave disruption of the status quo.\"",
      "The appeals court directed the government to reply to Cook's filing by Sunday at 3 p.m., making a ruling before then unlikely.",
      "Why does the Fed committee matter?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 which includes Cook, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and 10 other top central bank officials \u2014 is responsible for setting the Fed's interest rate targets, which have a major impact on economic growth, inflation and borrowing costs. The panel typically acts independently, with little input from elected officials.",
      "The committee has voted to leave interest rates relatively high so far this year, but investors and economists widely expect it to reduce rates at next week's meeting. Rate cuts could lead to stronger economic growth, but at the risk of causing inflation to heat up.",
      "Mr. Trump has tangled with the Fed for months over its decision to keep rates steady, nicknaming Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" and arguing the rate-setting committee should overrule him. Powell's term ends in May.",
      "Amid that pressure, Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in late August. A Biden appointee, Cook's term on the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors is set to end in 2038. The allegations against Cook are not related to Mr. Trump's push against the Fed, but if she is removed from the board, the president could pick her replacement, giving him more influence over the central bank.",

      "Tariff policies are top of mind for many Americans, too, she said, noting that about 60% of consumers raised the topic in interviews.",
      "Inflation expectations for the year remained steady at 4.8%. Consumers' long-run inflation expectations, however, rose for a second straight month to 3.9% in September, according to the survey, as consumers become aware of \"what tariffs mean for them,\" High Frequency Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "A separate U. of Michigan report on trade policy and consumer spending found that most U.S. adults plan to spend less on goods that are subject to tariff-related price hikes. Just 24% of consumers surveyed said they expected to spend as usual on items that have large price increases, according to the August report.",
      "\"The corrosive uncertainty surrounding tariffs, other economic policies and immigration, continues to weigh on consumer sentiment, High Frequency Economics analysts said in a research note. \"Rising consumer prices and the reality of the consequences of tariffs are just starting to be felt by consumers.

      "For much of 2025, the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs defied forecasts\u00a0that the import duties would drive up inflation. But that reprieve appears to be over, with economic data this week showing the tariffs are now pushing prices higher.",
      "The Consumer Price Index in August rose at a rate of 2.9% from a year ago, accelerating from the previous month as President Trump's tariffs filtered through the economy. Heavily imported goods saw some of the steepest price hikes last month, the data show. The increase represents the fastest rate of inflation since January, when Mr. Trump was inaugurated for his second term.",
      "Although the tariffs were first announced in April on what Mr. Trump called \"Liberation Day,\" their implementation was largely delayed as the administration negotiated new trade deals with multiple nations over the ensuing months. That gave U.S. companies time to prepare for the new import duties, which are paid by U.S. businesses directly to the federal government.",
      "Facing the prospect of sharply higher tariffs, some American companies scrambled to stock up on the imported goods and parts they use in their business, postponing the need to raise customer prices. Others absorbed the levies instead of passing them along to consumers.",
      "But many companies are now pulling back from those strategies, economic data shows. According to the Federal Reserve's latest \"Beige Book\" survey, which includes responses from businesses, economists and other sources, tariff-related price hikes were visible across the U.S. in August.",
      "Beth Hammack, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland,\u00a0recently told CBS News that some companies facing a hit to their profit margins have no choice but to start passing on tariff-related costs to consumers.",
      "Among the companies to say they are raising prices for some goods as tariffs take effect are\u00a0home improvement giant Home Depot, retailer Macy's and camera maker Nikon.",
      "\"The pass-through from tariffs is gradual because some businesses may have held on to a greater share of the costs and may have shared a greater burden of tariffs,\" said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. \"But there is a limit to how long and how much of that they can do \u2014 so there may be more of a push to pass those costs onto consumers.\"",
      "The White House said inflation remains low and that Mr. Trump's policies are boosting the economy.",
      "\"Since President Trump took office, CPI is tracking at a 2.3% annualized rate, consistent with low and stable inflation,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Leavitt also noted that data on producer prices out this week point to a decline in wholesale inflation. \"As the Trump economic agenda continues to take effect, the trillions of dollars in private sector and foreign investments, historic tax cuts, massive deregulation and energy dominance that the president is spearheading will fuel an economic boom,\" she added.",

About 80% of unroasted coffee imports are sourced from Latin America, primarily from Brazil, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Products from Brazil that are shipped to the U.S. now face a 50% tariff, according to the White House. Once those import taxes kicked in, U.S. consumers in August shelled out 21% more for beans than a year earlier, according to CPI data.",

The situation will worsen in the coming months as more costs are passed along to American consumers.\"",

      "Some economists think tariffs are likely to continue pushing inflation higher throughout the rest of the year, putting more financial pressure on families. As a result, many consumers will spend with more restraint, according to Daco.",

      "The inquiry comes after OpenAI said it plans to make changes to ChatGPT safeguards for vulnerable people, including adding extra protections for those under 18 years old, after the parents of a teen boy who died by suicide in April sued, alleging the artificial intelligence chatbot led their teen to take his own life.",
      "More children are now using AI chatbots for everything \u2014 from homework help to personal advice, emotional support and everyday decision-making.

      "Meta declined to comment on the FTC inquiry. The company has been working on making sure its AI chatbots are safe and age appropriate for children, a spokesperson said.",
      "OpenAI said that it's prioritizing \"making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone, and we know safety matters above all else when young people are involved. We recognize the FTC has open questions and concerns, and we're committed to engaging constructively and responding to them directly.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News, Snap said, \"We share the FTC's focus on ensuring the thoughtful development of generative AI, and look forward to working with the Commission on AI policy that bolsters U.S. innovation while protecting our community.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Sep 2025 09:17:28 -0400",
    "summary": "Today's CPI report marks the last major piece of economic data before the Federal Reserve's Sept. 17 rate decision meeting.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index rose 2.9% in August from a year earlier, matching economists' forecasts that prices would pick up slightly as President Trump's tariffs filtered through the economy.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 2.9% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in prices on everyday items such as food and apparel over time. So far this year, inflation has stayed at 3% or lower, with July's CPI reading at 2.7%.",
      "Despite that, inflation has been creeping higher in recent months, edging away from the Federal Reserve's\u00a02% annual target.\u00a0That's causing some Americans to feel more sour about the economy, with a recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0finding that two-thirds of consumers said prices in the past few weeks have continued to rise.",
      "What economists say",
      "Some economists point to the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs as pushing prices higher. That's because U.S. businesses pay the import duties to the federal government and then pass on some of those costs to consumers in the form of costlier goods.",
      "So far in 2025, the Federal Reserve has held off on cutting rates due to the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation. Because rate reductions make it cheaper to borrow, they can spur businesses and consumers to open their wallets, adding to inflationary pressures.",
      "Yet with the labor market showing signs of strain, Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month signaled that the door may be open for a rate cut at the central bank's Sept. 17 meeting. Cutting rates can spur hiring by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow, and therefore easier to expand and add employees.",
      "Under the Fed's so-called \"dual mandate,\" the central bank is required to promote full employment while keeping inflation in check.",
      "Despite the rise in inflation, the Fed is likely still on track for a rate cut next week, said Seema Shah, Chief Global Strategist at Principal Asset Management, noting that the weaker jobs data will likely outweigh concerns about higher prices.",
      "\"While the CPI report is a tad hotter than expected, it will not give the Fed a moment of hesitation when they announce a rate cut next week,\" she said in an email.",
      "What's getting pricier",
      "Some items getting more expensive are products that are largely imported, such as coffee, which soared 21.7% from a year ago, and furniture, which rose 4.7%. Imports are subject to U.S. tariffs based on country of origin, with the Trump administration adding new duties that start at 10% and scale higher.",
      "\"There were once again some signs of tariff effects putting upward pressure on goods prices,\" noted Capital Economics in a research note, pointing to higher costs for appliances and other home products.",
      "Day-to-day costs also increased at a faster pace, with food prices rising by 3.2% from a year ago, largely driven by higher restaurant prices, the data showed.",
      "Those pressures are being felt by many consumers, with some telling CBS News that their expenses have only increased in the past year. Some say that they're cutting back on discretionary spending to cope with a rise in household costs.",
      "\"Everything overall is more expensive \u2014 my groceries for example \u2014 and I hope for things that are on sale. I plan everything we're going to have for the week,\" said Kali Daugherty, 40, an executive director of a nonprofit in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.",
      "She said she's spending about $275 to $300 every two weeks on groceries for her family, up from about $175 to $200 a year ago. \"There's no wiggle room anymore,\" she added.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence is poised to change how businesses and consumers interact in virtually every industry, including travel, which is ripe for disruption by AI.",
      "When the first online trip planning sites emerged in the mid-1990s, they let consumers act as their own travel agents. Decades later, artificial intelligence tools are able to take over that role, and plan and book trips on behalf of travelers, saving them time and even money.",
      "\"It takes a lot of research and clicking around. It takes an average of 30 days between when you start planning a trip and when it's fully finished,\" Skylar Erickson, co-founder of Gondola AI, which helps consumers maximize their loyalty points, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You have 40 tabs open on your browser, so it takes a lot of work to get to that right answer.\"",
      "Also, because airfares and hotel room rates fluctuate constantly based on demand, shoppers could save a lot of time using a chatbot or other AI-powered tool to track and compare prices rather than manually refreshing their browsers.",
      "\"You log into a site, and you're trying to find the right price based on what other airlines are charging \u2014 that's the ultimate goal,\" Ram Reddy, an AI expert and chief technology officer at Nagarro, a consulting firm, said. \"AI tools that know you well can get you to the right place at the right time, when prices, which aren't static, are changing every minute.\"",
      "Consumers booking trips are already seeing AI's value: 41% of more than 2,000 consumers\u00a0surveyed\u00a0by Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm, said they had recently used AI tools for travel inspiration or itinerary planning.",
      "From inspiration to booking",
      "There are a range of AI-powered apps and bots at consumers' fingertips that can help plan a trip \u2014 from inception to booking. AI-powered bots can help travelers dream up trip ideas, turn visual inspiration into ready-to-go itineraries, and complete bookings and payments while maximizing the consumer's own loyalty points and other rewards so that they save money. In other words, AI provides the services in which travel agents at brick-and-mortar travel agencies once specialized.",
      "Ways AI can assist travel planning",
      "Did you see a social media post of a trip you'd like to be on? Send it to Expedia to book your own version through a feature called Trip Matching, which can turn social media reels into bookable trip itineraries.",
      "Don't know what to plan for the kids while on a family vacation? ChatGPT can generate a list of free activities in any locale.",
      "Not sure how many loyalty points or rewards you've accrued, or what they're worth? A company called Gondola AI can figure that out, helping users maximize their loyalty points so their dollars take them further.",
      "Trip planning and booking is prime territory for AI agents to test their skills, and hopefully, make the process easier for consumers, according to AI leaders.",
      "\"These days, it's easier to identify where AI is not being used to help travelers. It is everywhere, from planning to booking,\" Melanie Fish, head of global PR for Expedia Brands, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Jennifer Yellin, travel expert at Points Path, a browser extension that helps consumers compare flight deals, said the more she utilizes AI for trip planning, the better the technology gets to know her, and the more useful it becomes.",
      "\"The more you use it, it starts to recognize your patterns and preferences. It gets to know you as a traveler,\" she said of a Gondola AI, one of her favorite new tools. \"If you've been booking stays at Ritz Carltons, it won't suggest a Marriott Residence Inn as a first option; it will suggest a stay of a similar caliber.\"",
      "\"I used it dozens of times\"",
      "Other travel industry pros say they see more value in AI's ability to help them navigate locales once they've arrived.",
      "\"ChatGPT totally revolutionized how we were able to get along in China \u2014 I used it to scan menus and translate them into English,\" Scott Keyes, founder of flight deals site Going.com, told CBS MoneyWatch.tytrf \"I used it dozens of times a day.\"",
      "As far as trip planning goes, Keyes said that while he's generally an AI optimist, \"the use case has not yet proven itself to me.\"",
      "Which tools are the most helpful? These are some popular trip planning tools. Here's how they can help, and where they fall short.",
      "AI travel planning tools",
      "ChatGPT:\u00a0The AI chatbot can suggest places to stay or things to do anywhere in the world. Tell it you're visiting New York City around Christmastime with young children and you're not sure what neighborhood to stay in. It can suggest parts of town and outline their pros and cons.",
      "Google Flight Deals: Enter a destination and desired dates, or describe the type of trip you'd like to take, such as \"beach escape,\" or \"Paris in the fall.\" Let the AI-powered search engine \u2014 designed for travelers who want to save money \u2014 try to find you the best deal based on such parameters. The tool is not an AI agent though, and can't book tickets for you.",
      "Expedia Trip Matching:\u00a0The AI tool lets you send a public Instagram travel reel, or video, to Expedia, which will create an itinerary based on the visual inspiration you provide. The reel must be publicly available on Instagram, and the AI tool can only suggest trips in the U.S. market.",
      "Gondola AI: Give the tool access to your email, and it will cull your loyalty points and rewards from airlines, hotels and credit card companies to let you know what they are worth. It will compare prices in cash versus combinations of points, and can save you hundreds of dollars.

      "The Department of Labor's internal watchdog is launching a review of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) approach to collecting and reporting economic data.",
      "Laura Nicolosi, assistant inspector general for audit in the Labor Department's Office of Inspector General, said in a September 10 letter to acting BLS commissioner William Wiatrowski that the watchdog will examine how the statistics bureau compiles and reports monthly inflation and jobs data.",
      "In the letter, Nicolosi pointed to the Labor Department recently announcing large downward revisions to its earlier estimates of payroll gains. BLS released figures on Tuesday showing that the U.S. labor market added more than 900,000 fewer jobs in the 12-month period ending March 2025 than had earlier been reported.",
      "The BLS produces its monthly employment report by conducting separate surveys of households and businesses. The Labor Department also taps other measures of how the job market is faring, including state unemployment claims. The Labor Department frequently issues revisions to figures from prior months as more complete or accurate data is collected over time.",
      "The internal review of BLS' methods also will examine how it collects, reports and revises data used in two closely watched gauges of inflation \u2014 the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index \u2014 Nicolosi said. Recent data show that inflation around the U.S. has risen this year.",
      "President Trump last month fired then BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer and accused her of political bias after the Labor Department's July employment report showed unexpectedly weak job growth and revised down payroll gains for the previous two months.",
      "\"I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes,\" the president\u00a0wrote\u00a0in an August 1 post on social media.",

      "Mr. Trump's move to oust McEntarfer and question the accuracy of federal labor data has sparked concern among economists and policymakers.",

      "McBlais' concerns and struggles come as the pace of inflation continues to creep higher, remaining well above the Federal Reserve's goal of driving it down to an annual 2% rate.

Despite the media's false narrative, core inflation has run at a 2.4% average pace since President Trump took office which is the lowest 6-month pace since March 2021. The so-called 'experts' have been wrong month after month: tariffs have not hiked prices and President Trump is delivering on his promise to make America affordable again,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Federal Reserve's complicated decision",

      "So far in 2025, the Fed has held its benchmark rate steady, with Chair Jerome Powell saying he wanted to keep the central bank's powder dry in case tariffs caused inflation to reignite. Because rate reductions make it cheaper to borrow, they can spur businesses and consumers to open their wallets, adding to inflationary pressures.",
      "But two consecutive disappointing jobs reports signal that the labor market is stalling out, putting pressure on the Fed to cut rates, which can help bolster hiring by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow and add more workers. Powell last month signaled the Fed may be open to a cut, pointing to the labor market's risks.",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point rate cut is pegged at 90% by CME FedWatch, which bases its forecast on 30-day Fed Funds futures prices. There's a slimmer 10% likelihood that the Fed could usher in a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, its data shows.",
      "A rate cut could help some consumers by lowering their borrowing costs, with interest fees on credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loans likely to drop after a reduction.

    "story": [
      "A federal Judge on Tuesday ruled that\u00a0Lisa Cook can remain in her role on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors while her lawsuit challenging President Trump's attempt to fire her from her post plays out.",
      "\"President Trump has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal,\" U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, wrote in her ruling, which is likely to be appealed.",
      "Mr. Trump said he is firing Cook over allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago, resulting in more favorable loan terms.",
      "\"President Trump's stated cause refers only to allegations regarding Cook's conduct before she began serving on the Federal Reserve Board,\" Cobb wrote. \"As discussed above, such allegations are not a legally permissible cause.\"",
      "In addition to casting doubt on whether Mr. Trump established cause for Cook's firing, in issuing the stay, Cobb also ruled that Cook's right to due process was violated and that she would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction was not granted.",
      "Abbe David Lowell, an attorney representing Cook in her lawsuit, said in a statement to CBS News on Tuesday night, \"This ruling recognizes and reaffirms the importance of safeguarding the independence of the Federal Reserve from illegal political interference. Allowing the President to unlawfully remove Governor Cook on unsubstantiated and vague allegations would endanger the stability of our financial system and undermine the rule of law. Governor Cook will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor.\"",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Tuesday's ruling \"will not be the last say on the matter.\"",
      "\"President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause due to credible allegations of mortgage fraud from her highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,\" Desai said.",
      "Under federal law, Fed board members\u00a0serve for 14-year terms\u00a0and can only be fired by the president \"for cause.\" Cook has served on the Fed since being appointed to complete another member's unexpired term in 2022, and her current term would run until 2038.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook on Aug. 26, writing in a letter\u00a0terminating her\u00a0from the Fed Board of Governors that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited a previous letter from Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that was sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, an appointee of Mr. Trump's, alleged that Cook in 2021 claimed two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her primary residence on mortgage documents to get better lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers have previously said in court filings that Mr. Trump's \"unsubstantiated allegation that Governor Cook 'may have' or 'seems' to have erred in filling out a mortgage form in her capacity as a private citizen-does not amount to 'cause' for removal within the meaning of the FRA [Federal Reserve Act].\"",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In court arguments Friday, Lowell said Cook was not given notice of the allegations or a chance to respond to them, violating, he argued, her due process rights.",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" noting it would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb appeared to agree with their argument, writing in her ruling on Tuesday, \"Taken to its logical conclusion, the Government's argument leads to an absurd result: While admitting that the President cannot remove an official for policy disagreements, the Government claims that under Reagan, a removal on the grounds of a policy disagreement would nevertheless be unreviewable. ... This cannot be the case. Such a rule would provide no practical insulation for the members of the Board of Governors. It would mean that the President could, in practice, 'remove a member ... merely because he wanted his own appointees.'\"",
      "Cobb also wrote that Mr. Trump \"does not address her [Cook's] in-office conduct at all, let alone provide any examples of how Cook's performance or personal conduct since assuming the role has been in any way deficient in carrying out her statutory duties,\" adding that Mr. Trump's termination letter \"does not identify any conduct that Cook has engaged in while serving as a member of the Board that indicates that Cook lacks the competence or trustworthiness for the role.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook came amid his repeated\u00a0attacks on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over the central bank's handling of interest rates.",
      "Cook, Powell and 10 other Fed officials sit on a committee that controls the nation's monetary policy and sets target interest rates, with a dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment levels high. This work is typically done independently, with little to no input from political leaders.",

    "story": [
      "Getting cash from an ATM is growing increasingly expensive as fees reach record highs.",
      "Americans are now paying an average of $4.86 for out-of-network ATM withdrawals, up 1.9% from $4.77 last year, according to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0from Bankrate.com. That's the highest on record, according to the personal finance website, which starting tracking ATM fees 27 years ago.",
      "\"ATM fees are just one of those avenues that the bank can very freely continue to charge fees,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Those costs include charges from both ATM owners and banks. According to the survey, the average fee from cash machine providers is $3.22. Banks charge $1.64 on average, up 3.8% from 2024 \u2014 the highest since 2018. As a result, Americans in certain metro areas could see average combined fees of more than $5.",
      "For its survey, Bankrate polled a total of 10 banks and financial institutions in 25 of the nation's largest metro areas. Atlanta topped the list for highest ATM costs, with an average out-of-network fee of $5.37. Behind Atlanta are Phoenix and San Diego, where ATM charges average $5.35 and $5.31, respectively.",
      "Boston and Seattle had the lowest average rates among the metro areas surveyed \u2014 $4.37 and $4.42, respectively.",
      "What's behind the rising charges?",
      "The problem, said Kates, is that while there have been regulatory rumblings around curbing overdraft fees, resulting in voluntary caps by financial institutions, there are no limits on how much banks can charge for ATM withdrawals, giving them free rein to hike fees as much as they want. And since the charges apply to people outside the bank's network, there's no risk of it losing customers.",
      "\"It's one of the ways for the bank to certainly make money, and it's one of the ways to do so that doesn't really hurt their own customers,\" Kates said.",
      "Higher fees also help ATM owners and banks make up for lost revenue as consumers gravitate away from using cash and toward digital payments, said Kates. Also, online banking has nearly eliminated the need for automated bank tellers. According to a\u00a0survey\u00a0conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of the American Bankers Association last year, only 5% of customers relied on ATMs to manage their bank accounts.",
      "To be sure, reliance on cash hasn't disappeared altogether. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found that cash was still Americans' primary form of payment as of October 2024 \u2014 whether for a trip to an old-school laundromat or a vexingly cash-only restaurant.",
      "\"Fewer and fewer people need to use cash for certain things, but there are some times when you have to have it,\" said Kates.",
      "How to avoid high ATM fees",
      "Avoiding high ATM fees requires a bit of strategy and forethought, as you may not always be near a bank-affiliated ATM when you need to withdraw cash.",
      "In such a situation, one option is to get cash back at a local store. Kates also encourages people to look at their banking app to see which ATMs are close to them.",
      "If you need to withdraw cash on a regular basis, but live in an area where there aren't any ATMs in-network, you may want to consider changing where you bank to accommodate your needs. Certain online financial services like Fidelity, for instance, reimburse customers for ATM fees \u2014 making them a more attractive option.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it will decide whether President Trump can impose his most sweeping tariffs, setting up a major test of one of the pillars of the president's economic agenda.",
      "The high court agreed to review lower court decisions\u00a0that found Mr. Trump did not have the authority to issue many of his global tariffs under an emergency powers law. The Justice Department appealed one of those rulings, from a federal appeals court, to the Supreme Court last week and asked it to move swiftly.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that upholding the ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit would put the United States at a disadvantage and expose the nation to retaliatory trade policies.",
      "The case is the first in which the Supreme Court will directly decide the legality of one of Mr. Trump's second-term policies. The high court has been asked roughly two dozen times to intervene in challenges to many of the president's initiatives, but on an interim emergency basis.",
      "The justices said arguments in the tariffs case would take place in the first week of November.",
      "The tariffs case",
      "One of the disputes before the Supreme Court was brought by a group of small businesses and 12 states. They argued that he did not have the authority to impose many of the global tariffs under the emergency powers law that he invoked, called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "A federal trade court ruled in May that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he issued the tariffs under IEEPA, and the Federal Circuit upheld that decision late last month. In its 7-4 decision, the appeals court agreed that the tariffs are illegal.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the appeals court wrote. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "The appeals court did not decide whether IEEPA authorizes any tariffs at all. Instead, it only resolved whether sweeping duties that Mr. Trump imposed through a series of executive orders earlier this year are allowed under the law.",
      "The second case involves a pair of Illinois-based companies that sell educational toys and products. A federal district judge in Washington, D.C., ruled in May that IEEPA \"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders. The decision from U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras was more narrow, barring the Trump administration only from collecting any tariff from the two companies. Contreras paused his decision while the Justice Department appealed to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "The two companies asked the Supreme Court in June to fast track the case and leap frog the appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "A spokesperson for one of the companies, Learning Resources, said in a statement it was \"gratified\" that the Supreme Court would hear the case.",
      "\"There is a lot riding on this historic case,\" the spokesperson said. \"The unlawful IEEPA tariffs have wreaked havoc in our economy for too long now.\"",
      "The duties at issue include those announced by Mr. Trump in early April \u2014 which he refers to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 that set a 10% baseline rate for nearly every country, and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners. It also involves a set of levies on imports from Canada, Mexico and China in response to what Mr. Trump said is their failure to address the trafficking of fentanyl across U.S. borders.",
      "The president has used the tariffs, and the threat of additional duties, to try to force trading partners to negotiate trade deals with his administration. So far, \u00a0he has announced frameworks of trade agreements with the European Union and six countries: the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "Mr. Trump is the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, though it has been used by his predecessors to hit foreign nations with economic sanctions. His administration has argued that a denial of tariff authority would put the U.S. on the brink of \"economic catastrophe\" and make the nation poorer.",
      "In urging the Supreme Court to move quickly, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing that the Federal Circuit's \"erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the President's efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign-policy crisis.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that IEEPA gives the president broad powers to regulate trade, including imposing tariffs, \"to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to U.S. national security, foreign policy or the economy.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that trade deficits and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. constituted threats to the national security and economy of the U.S., and invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs to address them.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have remained in effect, since the Federal Circuit put its decision on hold until Oct. 14 to give the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "The plaintiffs \u2014 the five small businesses and 12 states \u2014 agreed that the Supreme Court needs to resolve the legality of Mr. Trump's tariffs, calling it an issue of \"great\" and \"undoubted importance.\" They argued that the tariffs are illegal and urged the high court to affirm the Federal Circuit's decision.",
      "\"The government's case rests entirely on the notion that the phrase 'regulate \u2026 importation' in IEEPA constitutes a boundless power to impose tariffs on the American people whenever the President wants, at whatever level he wants, for whatever countries and products he wants, and for as long as he wants, merely by declaring that longstanding U.S. trade deficits are a national 'emergency' and an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' \u2014 assertions the government claims are effectively unreviewable,\" lawyers for the small businesses wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"There are no limits.\"",
      "The states, meanwhile, said that the Constitution gives Congress the power to collect taxes, and the Trump administration is claiming that the president has sweeping authority to impose tariffs \"on any country, at any rate, and for however long he likes.\"",
      "\"The President's chaotic implementation of that purported authority, which changed by the day and wreaked havoc on capital markets and the economy, illustrates both the breadth of powers that the President claims and the danger of unlimited authority in this domain,\" they warned in court papers.",
      "The legal challenge to Mr. Trump's tariffs is likely to be one of several involving the president's second-term policies that the Supreme Court takes up. Other cases involving his immigration policies and efforts to remove members of independent agencies have progressed through the lower courts, and the Trump administration is likely to seek Supreme Court review of decisions against it.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. labor market added 911,000 fewer jobs in the 12-month period that ended March 2025 than had earlier been reported, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Tuesday. The major downward revision signals that the labor market was slowing more last year than had earlier been reported.",
      "The so-called preliminary benchmark revision, produced annually by the BLS, was bigger than a decline of roughly 800,000 that economists had forecast prior to the release. The revision aims to better account for businesses that have opened or closed in the 12-month period it covers, as these changes are sometimes missed by the BLS' monthly jobs report.",
      "The downward revision comes as the labor market appears to be ailing, with Friday's\u00a0disappointing August jobs report\u00a0sending warning signals about the pace of hiring across the U.S. At the same time, the BLS is in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, with the president last month\u00a0questioning the validity\u00a0of the monthly jobs report after the data included a significant downward revision, prompting him to\u00a0fire the commissioner\u00a0of the BLS.",
      "Revisions are a normal part of the statistical process at the BLS, economists note. That's because the monthly jobs data is based on a survey of businesses, and some companies respond after the agency's initial jobs report has been issued. Because of that, the BLS updates its data to reflect the new information.",
      "The sharp downward annual revision signals that the job market was facing bigger headwinds in 2024 and early 2025 than earlier reported, and could add to the Federal Reserve's case for cutting its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17 meeting, economists said.",
      "\"Today's data suggests cooling in the labor market is more dramatic than previously thought,\" said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, in an email.",
      "She added, \"This strengthens the likelihood that the Fed will cut rates next week, as it's additional evidence that the labor market side of the dual mandate needs some attention.\"",
      "Less momentum in job gains",
      "With the new revisions, job growth in 2025 has averaged 44,000 per month, down from 75,000 prior to the revamped numbers, Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. In 2024, payroll gains factoring in the revisions averaged 106,000, down from 168,000 previously.",
      "\"The revision shows the economy entered 2025 with less momentum than previously understood,\" he said. \"It's now a lock that the Fed will cut interest rates at their meeting next week and that further rate cuts will follow in the months ahead. The question is by how much.\"",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point rate cut at the Fed's Sept. 17 meeting is now projected at 94%, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The annual revisions are based on fresh data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which tracks employment and wages reported by employers that cover more than 95% of U.S. jobs, or about 11 million workplaces.",
      "The QCEW tracks when businesses open or close, something that is difficult for the monthly jobs report to track. For instance, if a business doesn't respond to the monthly survey, the BLS doesn't immediately know if the company simply isn't responding or if it has shut down.",
      "The large revision is likely due to the QCEW's tracking of businesses that have either been newly created or recently closed, with some of those new companies likely having slower hiring than the BLS had earlier estimated, Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs said in a research note.",
      "\"Probably about two-thirds of the downward benchmark revision looks set to be due to weaker job creation at new firms than the BLS initially inferred from its model,\" he said.",

That includes the higher deduction cap for state and local taxes, which will give more of a lift to people in states with high property taxes, such as New Jersey and New York.",
      "\"Places with higher incomes are going to have higher nominal tax cuts,\" Watson said. \"The largest tax benefits are going to the mountain states \u2014 it's due to a subgroup of higher-income business owners.\"",
      "Residents of Mississippi and West Virginia are likely to see the smallest tax cuts next year, the analysis found. Incomes in those states tend to be lower than the national average, with median household income in Mississippi standing at about $55,000 as of 2023 and $60,000 for West Virginians, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The national household median income is about $80,600.",
      "The Tax Foundation analysis projects the average tax cut in tax year 2026, meaning that these numbers reflect the reductions for the next calendar year. Although many of the law's provisions are effective in 2025, the IRS is still working out the details on some of them, which means lower tax withholding for the new provisions won't be fully in place until 2026, Watson said.",
      "Bigger refunds?",
      "Tax refunds are also likely to be larger in early 2026, when people file their taxes for the 2025 calendar year, Watson said, although he hasn't calculated the potential impact.",
      "Seniors who can claim a new $6,000 deduction for people over 65 under the law may get a bigger refund, as well as taxpayers across the board due to the higher standard deduction, said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt.",
      "Because of the tax changes in the new law, Steber recommends that people start preparing now. For example, workers who are newly eligible for tax breaks on tips and on overtime pay should keep track of such income.",
      "\"Having this much time left in the year allows taxpayers to make any necessary adjustments to help increase a refund or lower an amount due, and can be as simple as adjusting the withholding on a W-4,\" Steber told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The top 1% of earners around the U.S. \u2014 those with incomes over $1.1 million \u2014 will receive a $75,410 annual tax break from the new law in 2026, according to a\u00a0separate analysis\u00a0from the Tax Policy Center, nonpartisan think tank. That compares with an average tax break of $150 for households in the bottom 20% of the income distribution, or people earning less than $36,000 a year, and of $1,780 for earning $66,801 to $119,200.",
      "To be sure, many of new law's tax cuts will depend on an individual's financial circumstances. For instance, a low-income worker who earns tips or overtime could see a much bigger tax cut due to the law's \"no tax on tips\" and \"no tax on overtime\" provisions, Watson noted.",
      "\"If a taxpayer isn't taking tips or overtime or new car loan deduction, they may see a lower benefit,\" he said.",

      "Cracker Barrel is shelving plans to remodel its restaurants as it continues to backtrack on overhauling its brand image.",
      "The move comes after the chain already reverted to its old logo in response to an uproar around a refreshed brand symbol that caused the company's stock\u00a0to lose as much as $200 million in market value.",
      "\"Your Old Country Store is Here to Stay,\" the company said in a statement on its website Tuesday, adding that it would no longer seek to modernize the restaurant's interiors.",
      "\"Today, we're suspending our remodels. If your restaurant hasn't been remodeled, you don't need to worry, it won't be,\" Cracker Barrel said. The decision to halt remodeling plans was based on opinions customers shared \"not just on our logo, but also on our restaurants,\" it added.",
      "Cracker Barrel conceded in its statement that its planned store redesign did \"not reflect what you love about Cracker Barrel.\"",
      "To date, the Southern-themed restaurant chain has remodeled just four of its 660 store locations. It is suspending plans to remodel any additional stores.",
      "\"With our recent announcement that our 'Old Timer' logo will remain, along with our bigger focus in the kitchen and on your plate, we hope that today's step reinforces that we hear you,\" the company said Tuesday.",
      "Marketing experts said that while Cracker Barrel may have had solid business reasons for revamping its brand, the company's execution of that strategy was flawed.",
      "\"I'm sure there was a lot of deep thought that went into both the logo and store redesigns,\" Vanderbilt University marketing professor Kelly Goldsmith told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They needed to turn the ship around financially and thought the logo and store redesign would help.\"",
      "While Cracker Barrel's growth soared in the 1990s, it has slowed in recent years. For 2024, the company\u00a0reported\u00a0revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up less than 1% from the previous year. Net income fell to $40.9 million, down from $99 million in 2023.",
      "\"It's existing plan wasn't working for the company financially, and that was the impetus for this change,\" Goldsmith said.",
      "Goldsmith suspects Cracker Barrel may have wanted to appeal to a broader audience by presenting a more flexible brand, opening the door for the chain to expand into new food categories.",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Sep 2025 13:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies are deterring manufacturers from hiring, according to the Center for American Progress.",
    "story": [
      "Manufacturers in the U.S. are cutting thousands of jobs even as President Trump pushes economic policies that he says will revitalize the industry.",
      "Employers shed 12,000 manufacturing jobs\u00a0in August, while payrolls in the sector have shrunk by 42,000 since April, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP) that draws on government labor data.",
      "The nonpartisan policy institute attributes that decline to the Trump administration's steep new tariffs; hardline stance on immigration; and the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill,\" a tax and spending package enacted by Mr. Trump in July that CAP says hurts renewable energy companies by phasing out certain tax credits.",
      "For all of 2025, manufacturing employment in the U.S. has sunk by a total of 33,000 jobs, according to Labor Department\u00a0figures. Most of those job losses have been among companies that make durable goods, such as cars, household appliances and electronics. The drop comes as hiring overall has slowed sharply in recent months, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs in August, well below forecasts.",
      "The number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has declined for the past six decades, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In 1960, manufacturing represented about 34% of total employment, while the number of jobs in the sector peaked in 1970 at 19.5 million. As of August this year, 12.7 million Americans were employed in manufacturing, while the industry lost 87,000 jobs in 2024,\u00a0data shows.",
      "Uncertainty hurting businesses",
      "When Mr. Trump in April announced a range of levies on dozens of other countries, the White House said tariffs would protect American workers by reducing the U.S. trade deficit with its economic partners and spurring employers to move manufacturing jobs to the U.S.",
      "For now, however, confusion over the scale and scope of U.S. tariffs has put manufacturers on the defensive, increasing their costs and discouraging them from hiring, economist Sara Estrep, one of the authors of the CAP report, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Companies are uncertain about what's happening,\" she said. \"Everything has been changing on a day-to-day basis, so it's not clear what production should look like. That's why they aren't hiring.\"",
      "In August, for example, farm equipment giant John Deere cited tariffs in announcing that its sales and operating profits had dipped from a year ago. In an earnings call, an executive with the company noted that it had racked up roughly $300 million in tariff-related costs, including on steel and aluminum imports. John Deere also announced it was laying off more than 200 workers at plants in Illinois and Iowa, according to AgWeb, a trade publication.",
      "Automakers pointed partly to tariffs in announcing nearly 5,000 job cuts in July, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, while it noted that the retail sector has also stepped up layoffs and store closures because of economic uncertainty.",
      "Another factor fueling uncertainty for manufacturers are the ongoing legal challenges to the Trump tariffs, making it hard to plan and invest for the future, according to experts.",
      "A federal appeals court in August ruled that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on September 3\u00a0asked the Supreme Court\u00a0to review the lower court's decision before it takes effect in October.",
      "The outcome of the case leaves many manufacturers in doubt about how to proceed, making them reluctant to expand their workforce as they seek to control costs, Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The slowdown is symptomatic of an environment where purchasing managers are all under stress, and they are being squeezed by higher costs of goods and reduced demand,\" said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. \"And so in that squeeze, they are having to find ways to offset the higher costs, and one of the avenues to do that is to streamline their operations and make sure that they only have the essential talent on hand.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to several requests for comment on CAP's findings. The Office of the United States Trade Representative and National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Immigration effect",
      "The Trump administration's crackdown on U.S. immigrants is also weighing on hiring in manufacturing, said Daniel Altman, an economist and author of the High Yield Economics newsletter.",
      "\"Immigration has been an important source of employment in manufacturing for some industries, and if you take away some of their labor supply, that's just gives them more incentive to pursue automation and other forms of capital intensive manufacturing,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The government stepped up its campaign last week when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents\u00a0detained 475 immigrants, most of them Korean, at a Hyundai plant in Georgia because they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Border patrol agents have also\u00a0conducted raids targeting immigrants working in retail, according to CBS News. In sectors like farming, food processing and construction, undocumented immigrants make up to 20% of the workforce, according to\u00a0Goldman Sachs.",
      "White House \"border czar\" Tom Homan on Sunday said the White House will expand such efforts.",
      "\"We're going to do more worksite enforcement operations,\" Homan told CNN. \"No one hires an illegal alien out of the goodness of their heart. They hire them because they can work them harder, pay them less, undercut the competition that hires U.S. citizen employees.\"",
      "Other long-term factors that go beyond the Trump administration's policies are also contributing to the ongoing contraction in manufacturing jobs. During the pandemic, manufacturers invested heavily in technologies to automate their operations, Altman noted.",
      "\"We've seen a lot of automation, which means companies do not need as many workers to provide the same output,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Output per worker has been increasing, and when we see that kind of increase in labor productivity, it usually means workers have access to more capital, or better technology or both, and that's what you'd expect with automation.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Sep 2025 07:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to revise its jobs data downward for the year ended in March 2025. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "The latest jobs report\u00a0points to a labor market that's faltering, but the slowdown may have begun much earlier. Economists expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to issue a major downward revision today, showing the nation added hundreds of thousands fewer jobs than first reported.",
      "On Sept. 9, the BLS will release its preliminary benchmark revision to labor market data at 10 a.m. ET, which aims to better account for businesses that have opened or closed. Economists say the revision, covering the 12-month period through March 2025, could show that hiring during that time was about 800,000 jobs lower than previously reported.",
      "The report could draw attention from the Trump administration, as the president last month questioned the validity of the monthly jobs report \u2014 and fired the commissioner\u00a0of the BLS \u2014 after the data included a significant downward revision. Hiring experts and economists point to a job market that's stalling out as some businesses are bearing increased tariff costs while others are tapping artificial intelligence as a way to lower labor costs and\u00a0replace workers.",
      "\"The labor market will likely look even worse after the release of the preliminary benchmark revision to payrolls on Sept. 9,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, noted in an email.",
      "The revision could show that employment was reduced by about 775,000 for the 12 months through March, Adams estimated. That would indicate that the average monthly job growth in 2024 actually stood at 100,000 per month, down from the 165,000 previously reported, he added.",
      "The revision would cover only the first three months of Mr. Trump's second administration, with the bulk of the timeframe occurring in the last year of former President Biden's administration.",
      "Job growth has slowed dramatically in recent months, with the employers adding an average of 29,000 jobs each month from June through August, the most recent BLS data shows.",
      "Why does the government revise its jobs data?",
      "Jobs revisions occur each month, with the BLS updating its data to reflect more recent information it has received from businesses about the pace of hiring. That's because some companies respond late to the BLS' surveys, which means the agency receives an influx of new information after it has issued its initial monthly jobs report, prompting the fresh numbers.",
      "But once a year, the BLS also issues an annual revision based on fresh data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which tracks employment and wages reported by employers that cover more than 95% of U.S. jobs.",
      "While the monthly jobs report relies on about 50,000 responses for each period, the QCEW covers 11 million workplaces \u2014 but that scope requires more time for collecting the data versus the BLS' monthly report, Adams of Comerica said.",
      "\"The QCEW's detail lets it directly measure jobs added at newly-opened workplaces and lost at closing ones, which account for several millions of employment churn each year,\" he added.",
      "What happened in the last annual revision?",
      "The BLS issued a\u00a0major downward\u00a0revision last year for the same annual data, showing that employers added 818,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months ended March 2024 than previously estimated. That lowered the average monthly job growth for the period to 174,000, down from the initial estimate of 242,000.",
      "At the time, the downward revision was seen as evidence that the labor market was showing cracks, and it was viewed as paving the way for the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its September 2024 meeting.",
      "What does this mean for a Fed rate cut?",
      "The Fed will be focused on analyzing recent economic data, such as the latest jobs report and the next Consumer Price Index, which will be issued on Sept. 11. Economists expect the CPI to show an annualized increase of 2.9% in August, higher than the prior month's 2.7% and well above the Fed's goal of reaching a 2% annual rate.",
      "With the labor market hitting a wall in recent months, economists now expect the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17 meeting. The only question is whether the Fed might usher in a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, or opt for the typical cut of 0.25 percentage points.",
      "\"Market odds currently see a 100% chance of a Fed rate cut this month, with a small constituent seeing an outsized 50-basis-point cut on Sept. 17 within the realm of possibility,\" Anthony Saglimbene, Ameriprise chief market strategist, wrote in a Sept. 8 research note.",
      "But, he added, if August's Consumer Price Index comes in hotter than expected on Sept. 11, that \"would likely throw cold water on the idea that the Fed is considering an outsized September rate cut.\"",
      "President Trump has\u00a0repeatedly lashed out at Powell\u00a0this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over\u00a0whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority\u00a0to do so. Powell's term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026.",
      "Trump nominates replacement commissioner",
      "President Trump\u00a0in August announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Monday. Antoni, a fellow at conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, has\u00a0criticized the BLS, questioning its methodology.",
      "\"DOGE needs to take a chainsaw to the BLS...,\" he wrote in a November\u00a0post\u00a0on X.",
      "In a statement Monday backing the BLS, the National Association for Business Economics (NABE), a professional association of global economists, applied economists, data scientists and academics, said it \"stands firmly with the dedicated economists and statisticians at BLS and across the federal statistical agencies.\"",
      "The association went on to urge policymakers and others in the business and economics community \"to defend the integrity of the U.S. statistical system and ensure it remains the global gold standard,\" it said.",
      "\"The Bureau of Labor Statistics needs a knowledgeable and qualified commissioner who will uphold the agency's mission and protect its trusted professional staff from political pressure.

      "At the same time, Americans are increasingly worried about losing their current job. Expectations that the U.S. unemployment rate will be higher a year from now crept up 1.7 percentage points to 39.1%, the New York Fed found.",
      "The data comes as Americans adopt a dimmer view of the economy. According to a\u00a0recent CBS News poll, a majority of respondents continue to say the economy is getting worse.",
      "The labor market has been under a microscope since July employment data showed weaker-than-expected job growth and sharp downward revisions for the months of June and May. August's data, released Friday, pointed to a slump in U.S. hiring, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs. Unemployment also ticked up to 4.3%, the highest rate since October 2022.",
      "\"Employers may be holding onto their current workers amid uncertainty, but they are not adding new positions,\" Allison Shrivastava, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In turn, employees have taken the hint, staying in their current jobs rather than seeking new opportunities.\"",
      "According to a recent Bankrate survey, about half of Americans are planning to search for a new job in the next year. At the same time, data shows that the number of people changing jobs has slowed significantly since 2022, when millions of people quit their jobs during the \"Great Resignation.\"",
      "During this period, workers had more negotiating power because labor supply disruptions created heightened demand for workers. That balance, however, has started shifting back in favor of employers in recent years.",
      "A recent analysis from Bank of America shows that the percentage of its customers leaving their jobs has largely trended downward from a more than 26% peak in 2022, and is now just slightly above the job change rate in 2019, at 3.3%. Experts say that's mainly because there are fewer opportunities for people to switch jobs and general unease with the state of the labor market.",
      "\"If this stagnation continues, unemployment \u2014 and layoffs \u2014 will increase, further weakening the labor market,\" said Shrivastava.",
      "The Fed, which is tasked with maintaining a robust job market and low inflation, has acknowledged that the downside risks to employment are rising. This strengthens the likelihood that the central bank will cut rates at its next meeting, which is scheduled for Sept. 16 to 17.",

      "Robinson's father owns a business installing kitchen countertops and cabinets and his mother is a licensed social worker, according to public records and their social media accounts. Robinson is the oldest of three brothers.",
      "\"They are very supportive parents who loved their boys and are involved in the community,\" a neighbor who said she knew the Robinson family well but had not seen Robinson in a few years told CBS News. She also said the parents were supportive of the country and of President Trump.",
      "State records show that Robinson registered to vote as unaffiliated. He is listed as an inactive voter in state records, meaning he didn't vote in the last two elections. He was not old enough to vote in 2020.",
      "Robinson had no prior felony or misdemeanor convictions and no prior violent offenses, according to a Public Safety Assessment Report filed in Utah state court.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said he was taken into custody at 10 p.m. local time Thursday night, though Utah officials said it was in the early hours of Friday. Records from the Utah County Sheriff's Office Corrections Division show he was booked into jail at 7:58 a.m. local time (9:58 a.m. ET).",
      "Mr. Trump first broke the news on \"Fox and Friends\" that someone had been taken into custody.",
      "\"With a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody. Everyone did a great job,\" the president said.",
      "Cox said messages on Discord, an instant messaging and social media platform, that were reviewed by investigators referenced a rifle wrapped in a towel that was left in the woods and engravings on bullets. The messages came from a person named \"Tyler\" and were shared with an unidentified individual, Cox said.",
      "A spokesperson for Discord later said it removed an account associated with Robinson and said the company will continue to coordinate closely with law enforcement.",
      "The governor said authorities believe Robinson acted alone and said there is currently no information that would lead to additional arrests. He told reporters Friday morning he can't answer questions about the possible motive of the suspect.",
      "Robinson is currently on \"special watch\" at the Utah County Jail while he is being evaluated to determine if he is a risk to himself or others, Utah County Sheriff's Spokesperson Sgt. Raymond Ormond told CBS News. Inmates are held in a special housing unit while on special watch.",
      "All inmates are given an initial screening after booking, but some are put on the more intensive special watch until they're screened, depending on the crimes they committed or things they said, Ormond said.",
      "How the suspect was captured",
      "Cox said Robinson's father recognized his son as the subject of photos that were released by law enforcement and urged him to turn himself in.",
      "Robinson admitted to his father that he was the person in the photos, two federal law enforcement sources told CBS News. Robinson said he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, the federal law enforcement sources said.",
      "Robinson's father called a youth pastor who knows the 22-year-old and is close to the family, and he and the pastor tried to calm Robinson down. The sources said the pastor, who also serves as a court security officer, called the U.S. Marshals Service and other law enforcement agencies. Marshals  then detained Robinson and kept him secure while waiting for the FBI. The FBI later took him into custody.",
      "Investigators reviewed video footage and said they identified Robinson arriving on Utah Valley University's campus in a gray Dodge Challenger at around 8:29 a.m. local time Wednesday, the day of the shooting, according to the governor. Robinson was wearing a plain maroon T-shirt, light-colored shorts, a black hat with a white logo and light-colored shoes, Cox said.",
      "He is believed to have changed clothing on the roof, where the shot was fired from, before changing back into what he was originally wearing. When investigators encountered Robinson, he was wearing clothing consistent with that outfit, the governor said.",
      "Tracking the suspect",
      "On Thursday, Utah Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason described the suspect they were seeking as a male who \"blended in\" with the college community and appeared to be college age.",
      "The public safety department and the Salt Lake City FBI office posted images of someone they called a \"person of interest,\" showing an individual appearing to wear a dark long-sleeve shirt, a hat and sunglasses. More photos posted later on Thursday showed the person wearing a backpack.",
      "Mason said investigators were able to track the shooter's movements before and after the assassination.",
      "According to a probable cause statement filed by investigators after Robinson's arrest, investigators were able to track his movements on campus starting at approximately 11:50 a.m. local time on Wednesday. He was observed entering a building called the Losee Center near where Kirk's event was taking place, which was the shooting location, and going up to the roof, according to the statement.",
      "Mason said the shooter moved to the other side of the building after firing a single shot, then jumped off and fled into a neighborhood off campus. Investigators contacted homeowners with cameras and witnesses to identify leads, he said.",
      "In a news briefing Thursday evening in Orem, Utah, with Patel in attendance, officials released security video that showed a man \u2014 who Mason called a suspect \u2014 running across the roof and then climbing down the side of the building immediately after the shooting.",
      "As he climbed off the edge of the building and dropped down, he \"left some palm impressions, some smudges, some places we're looking to collect DNA,\" along with a shoe print that indicated he was wearing Converse tennis shoes, Mason told reporters while showing the video.",
      "\"It's important to note his black t-shirt, his black pants, and there appears to be some white on the soles of those Converse tennis shoes,\" Mason said. \"Those are all identifiable items that we're looking for.\"",
      "After dropping off the building, the video showed the man moving across a grassy area before entering traffic. Mason said he crossed the street into a wooded area, where the firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was later found.",
      "The FBI said it was offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information that leads law enforcement to identify and arrest the person or people involved in Kirk's assassination. Patel said authorities had received more than 11,000 leads as of Friday morning.",
      "Gun and bullet casings recovered",
      "FBI special-agent-in-charge Robert Bohls said Thursday that investigators recovered a \"high-powered, bolt-action rifle,\" which they believe was the weapon used in the assassination. It was found in a wooded area where the shooter fled and was wrapped in a towel, according to Bohls. The rifle was determined to be a Mauser .30-06-caliber bolt-action rifle, according to the probable cause statement.",
      "Cox said that there were inscriptions on the casings of the bullet that was fired, as well as on the casings of three bullets that were not fired.",
      "According to the probable cause statement, the fired bullet casing contained the inscription, \"Notices Buldge OWO what's this?\" An unfired bullet casing read, \"hey fascist! CATCH!\" followed by an up arrow symbol, a right arrow symbol and three down arrow symbols. And a second unfired casing read, \"O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!\" A third unfired casing said, \"If you read This, you are GAY Lmao.\"",
      "Cox didn't speculate on the meaning of the inscriptions.",
      "Investigators also have a footwear impression, palm print and forearm imprints that will be analyzed, the FBI official said.",
      "Timeline of \"targeted attack\"",
      "The event where Kirk was speaking was scheduled to begin in the UVU courtyard at noon.",
      "A CBS News review of livestream footage and video metadata indicates Kirk was shot around 12:23 p.m., which is also when the FBI's Patel said Kirk was shot. He was struck in the neck by a single gunshot.",
      "A map produced by CBS News' Confirmed team shows where Kirk was when he was shot \u2014 in the central courtyard of Utah Valley University, which is surrounded by campus buildings.",
      "A university spokeswoman said Wednesday that they believed the shot was fired from the Losee Center. A law enforcement source told CBS News that the gunman appeared to have fired from the building's roof.",
      "The FBI released a video\u00a0\u2014 timestamped at 12:23 p.m. local time \u2014 that appears to show a person climbing off a roof at Utah Valley University and fleeing the scene. Dispatch audio reviewed by CBS News described a person on the roof of a nearby building wearing black clothing and carrying a long rifle.",
      "Video captured at 2:37 p.m. shows officers searching an area around a quarter mile north of the campus.",
      "At 2:40, more than two hours after the shooting, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that Kirk had died.",
      "While authorities have not specified a potential motive for the shooting, Mason said they believe it was a \"targeted attack toward one individual.\" Only one shot was fired, and Kirk was the only victim, the commissioner said.",
      "Cox called the shooting \"a political assassination,\" while Mr. Trump, in a video posted to Truth Social, blamed it on \"radical left political violence,\" which he said \"has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.\"",
      "Charlie Kirk's influence in politics",
      "Kirk was shot while he was speaking at a \"Prove Me Wrong\" debate, a trademark event for Kirk's Turning Point USA, which is a conservative organization focused on young people. He would hold political debates with a group that usually consisted of left-leaning attendees.",
      "Kirk had visited the Utah university as part of a nationwide tour of college campuses that was scheduled to continue for the next two months. About 3,000 people attended the outdoor event where he was assassinated, the Utah Department of Public Safety said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump called Kirk legendary, saying, \"No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.\"",
      "Kirk was a close Trump ally and was credited with galvanizing younger voters during his campaign. He made it his mission to engage more young people in politics and register them to vote. Kirk was also a close friend of the president's son, Donald Trump Jr.",
      "Kirk was the host of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" a daily conservative talk radio show and amassed millions of followers on social media.",
      "Kirk's politics, however, weren't without controversy. He pushed false claims about voter fraud after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, stoked skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic and spread anti-trans rhetoric. He also amplified the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy, which is based on the belief that there's a plot to replace White people with minorities.",
      "He was a friend of JD Vance, who said Kirk advocated \"in public and private\" for Mr. Trump to pick him as his running mate last year.",
      "\"So much of the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene,\" Vance said after Kirk was killed. \"He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said he believes the more than three-year war in Ukraine would end if all NATO countries stopped buying oil from Russia and placed tariffs on China for its purchases of Russian petroleum.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social on Saturday a letter purportedly sent to NATO in which he said he is \"ready to do major Sanctions on Russia\" on the condition that all NATO countries stop buying Russian oil. The president said the military alliance's commitment to winning the war in Ukraine \"has been far less than 100%\" and the purchase of Russian oil by some members is \"shocking.\"",
      "\"It greatly weakens your negotiation position, and bargaining power, over Russia,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Since 2023, NATO member Turkey has been the third largest buyer of Russian oil, after China and India, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Other members of the 32-state alliance involved in purchasing Russian oil include Hungary and Slovakia.",
      "Mr. Trump's letter comes at a tense moment in the conflict for NATO after the recent incursion by\u00a0multiple Russian drones into the airspace of alliance member Poland. It's being seen as an escalatory move by Russia and Poland shot down several of the drones.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump appeared to play down the significance of the incident, saying the incursion may not have been deliberate",
      "\"It could have been a mistake,\" he told journalists late Thursday. A day earlier, Mr. Trump issued a brief reaction on his Truth Social platform: \"What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Here we go!\"",
      "The White House did not offer any clarification of Mr. Trump's remarks and Poland's most senior officials dismissed his suggestion\u00a0it had been a mistake on Friday.",

      "The U.S. president has already placed an additional 25% import tax on goods from India, which he has said is to punish it for buying Russian energy products.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Missouri state legislature on Friday passed a plan to redraw the state's congressional maps and potentially add another Republican-leaning House seat, the latest state to join a nationwide redistricting push backed by President Trump.",
      "The state Senate passed the redistricting plan Friday, sending it to the desk of Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who says he will sign it into law. The state House passed the plan on Tuesday. Kehoe called a special session to take up redistricting last month.",
      "The new map would split up the Kansas City area, making longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver's district more conservative. Missouri would then be left with seven GOP-leaning House districts and one Democratic-leaning seat, a shift from the state's current House delegation, which has six Republicans and two Democrats.",
      "The redistricting push follows similar mid-decade redistricting moves by California and Texas. The nationwide gambit to reshape congressional maps comes as Republicans fight to hold onto a razor-thin majority in the House in next year's midterm elections.",
      "At Mr. Trump's urging, Texas officials passed a plan to create five new GOP-leaning districts last month. California lawmakers quickly responded by passing a map that would move five Republican-held seats toward Democrats, though the California plan still needs to be approved by voters in a special election this fall.",
      "Mr. Trump lauded Missouri lawmakers for advancing the new map, which he said in a Truth Social post \"will, hopefully, give us an additional Seat in Congress\" and \"will help send an additional MAGA Republican to Congress.\"",
      "\"A new, much fairer, and much improved, Congressional Map, has now overwhelmingly passed both Chambers of the Missouri Legislature,\" the president wrote.",

      "The lawsuit argued the intent of the new maps is \"to transform what has long been a seat anchored in the Democratic-leaning Kansas City metropolitan area into a district dominated by rural, Republican-leaning counties, an outcome accomplished by splitting Kansas City's Black and white residents along stark racial lines.\"",

    "story": [
      "A suspect has been arrested in the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah, officials said Friday morning. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said the suspect had been identified as Tyler Robinson, 22.",
      "An inmate booking sheet from the Utah County Sheriff obtained by CBS News shows that Robinson is being held on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm. Formal charges are expected to be filed on Tuesday, the Utah County Attorney's Office said.",
      "Robinson resides in southern Utah and confessed to his father, Cox said.",
      "Two federal law enforcement sources told CBS News that Robinson's father saw the photos released by authorities and confronted his son. Robinson admitted to being the person in the photos and his father encouraged him to turn himself in, the sources said. Robinson responded to his father, saying he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, prompting his father to call a youth pastor close to the family, the sources said. The pastor and Robinson's father tried to calm him, according to the sources.",
      "The pastor, who is also a court security officer, also called the U.S. Marshals Service, which arrived and detained Robinson, the sources said.",
      "The sources said the Marshals called the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who took Robinson into custody. Robinson was taken into custody late Thursday night, FBI Director Kash Patel said Friday.",
      "Cox said he believed Robinson acted alone, and that there is no information at this time \"that would lead to any additional arrests.\"",
      "Cox thanked the family members of the suspected shooter, who he said \"did the right thing\" in bringing him to law enforcement.",
      "President Trump was the first to announce the suspect was in custody during an appearance on \"Fox and Friends\" on Friday morning.",
      "Cox said a family member told investigators that Robinson had become more political in recent years, and referenced an incident where Robinson had come to dinner and mentioned Kirk's upcoming appearance.",
      "State records show that Robinson registered to vote as unaffiliated. His registration status is listed as inactive, which means he did not vote in 2024 or 2022.",
      "Robinson is a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College in Utah, the Utah Board of Higher Education said in a statement. He also attended Utah State University for one semester in 2021.",
      "The 22-year-old is the oldest of three brothers. His father owns a business installing kitchen countertops and cabinets and his mother is a licensed social worker, according to public records and their social media accounts.",
      "CBS News obtained video Friday of FBI personnel searching the home of Robinson's parents.",
      "Kirk shot while engaging in campus debate",
      "Kirk, who was 31, was engaging in one of his signature \"Prove Me Wrong\" debates at Utah Valley University when he was shot and killed on Wednesday afternoon. The event was part of Turning Point USA's \"The American Comeback Tour,\" and there were over 3,000 people in attendance when Kirk was shot, police said.",
      "Kirk's next event had been set for Utah State University. The university confirmed that Robinson had attended the school as a pre-engineering major for one semester in 2021 before taking a leave of absence.",
      "Kirk had just\u00a0begun to debate someone in the audience\u00a0about gun violence when he was shot, witnesses said. Just one shot was fired, Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason said on Wednesday night. Kirk was struck in the neck.",
      "A university spokeswoman said the single shot is believed to have been fired from the Losee Center for Student Success, which houses a number of services and resources. A law enforcement source told CBS News the gunman appeared to have fired from the building's roof.",
      "Details on evidence emerge",
      "After the shooting, the shooter jumped off the building and fled into a neighborhood off campus, Mason said. Photos released by law enforcement showed a person wearing a dark baseball cap, black glasses, a long-sleeved dark shirt that appeared to feature an American flag and an eagle, and dark-colored pants.",
      "Investigators recovered a high-powered, bolt-action rifle that they believe was used in the assassination, Robert Bohls, the FBI special agent in charge of the bureau's Salt Lake City field office, said Thursday. The gun was found wrapped in a dark towel in a wooded area where the shooter fled, Bohls said.",
      "Cox also said investigators reviewed messages on the messaging platform Discord from a person named \"Tyler\" that referenced a rifle wrapped in a towel that was left in the woods and engravings on bullets. A Discord spokesperson confirmed the platform had identified an account associated with Robinson, but said it has \"found no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence on Discord.\" The spokesperson said the messages Cox referenced do not appear to have been sent on the platform, and described them as \"communications between the suspect's roommate and a friend after the shooting, where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere.\"",
      "Cox said that there were inscriptions on the casings of the fired bullet and three unfired ones. The fired bullet casing contained the inscription, \"Notices bulges OwO what's this?\" An unfired bullet casing read, \"Hey fascist, catch!\" And a second unfired casing read, \"oh bella ciao, bella cio, bella ciao, ciao, ciao.\" A third unfired casing said, \"If you read this, you are gay.\"",
      "Cox declined to speculate on the meaning of the inscriptions.",
      "\"I will leave that up to you to interpret what those engravings mean,\" Cox said. He added that the \"Hey fascist, catch!\" inscription \"speaks for itself.\"",
      "The arrest comes after two people were briefly taken into custody, then released, on Wednesday. Neither individual had ties to the shooting, the Utah Department of Public Safety said on Wednesday night. The second person taken into custody was charged with obstruction of justice, the department said.",
      "Kirk was a close ally of Mr. Trump and a friend of Donald Trump Jr.",
      "The president, who ordered flags be flown at half-staff until Sunday evening, announced plans to honor Kirk with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, calling him \"a giant of his generation, a champion of liberty, and an inspiration to millions and millions of people.\" He also released a video statement\u00a0blaming the \"radical left\" for the killing. Politicians and figures on both sides of the aisle have condemned Kirk's killing.",

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency plans to end a federal reporting rule that tracks the quantities of greenhouse gases like methane, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide released into the air by industrial facilities, according to an agency news release.",
      "Ending the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which has been in place since 2009, would affect over 8,000 facilities, including power plants, electronic, chemical and mineral processing facilities and oil refineries.",
      "The program's data are used to guide federal policy, and the data also help companies demonstrate they're hitting emissions-cutting benchmarks for the public, shareholders and investors.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in the release that the plan would save American businesses as much as $2.4 billion in regulatory costs but would still comply with the Clean Air Act. He first raised the idea of ending the reporting program in March.",
      "\"Unlike other mandatory information collections under the CAA, the GHGRP is not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment,\" Zeldin said in the release.",
      "He said it would be \"a significant step toward streamlining operations, cutting unnecessary red tape, unleashing American energy, and advancing EPA's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.\"",
      "Certain fossil fuel facilities would be required to keep reporting emissions if the rule is ended, including some natural gas and offshore oil facilities, under the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted during the Biden administration. The EPA has proposed a delay of nearly a decade in implementing the data collection requirement, though, putting it off until 2034.",
      "But environmental experts say ending the program would prevent the public from knowing how much major industrial polluters are emitting into the atmosphere.",
      "\"Cutting the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses, and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health,\" said Joseph Goffman, who served as assistant administrator for the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation during the Biden administration, in a statement.",
      "Groffman now works with the Environmental Protection Network, a volunteer organization of former EPA employees.",
      "Health experts are also concerned that ending the program could jeopardize public health.",
      "\"Measuring and reporting climate pollution is a critical step in reducing the deadly impacts of climate-driven extremes that cause more pollution, catastrophic weather events, health emergencies, and deaths. Ignoring this reality is a deadly choice, and not one that EPA should be making for American families,\" Will Barrett of the American Lung Association said in a statement.",
      "Ending the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program aligns with the Trump administration's efforts to cut support for climate research and will make it more difficult to produce studies on the economic and societal impact of greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "The EPA will solicit input on the plan to end the greenhouse gas reporting program in a public comment period before it's finalized."

    "summary": "The Trump administration wants an appeals court to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook before an interest rate meeting next week.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration asked a federal appeals court Thursday to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, in time for a crucial meeting next week when Fed officials will decide whether to lower interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook from the Federal Reserve's powerful Board of Governors last month, accusing her of falsely claiming two different homes as her principal residence in mortgage documents. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb blocked the firing on Tuesday, concluding that the president \"has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal.\" Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be removed \"for cause.\"",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to stay that ruling while the government appeals it. The Justice Department argued that the president has broad discretion to remove federal officials, including to decide whether \"cause\" exists, and courts have \u2014 at most \u2014 extremely narrow authority to review those decisions.",
      "\"Here, the evidence\u2014which Cook has yet to offer contrary explanation for\u2014was that she applied for two loans for her personal benefit, and was able to obtain favorable interest rates by misrepresenting where she lived,\" the government argued Thursday. \"Regardless of whether that misconduct occurred before or during office, it indisputably calls into question Cook's trustworthiness and whether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy for the whole Nation.\"",
      "Those allegations surfaced in a letter from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee who cited mortgage papers for homes that Cook bought in Georgia and Michigan in 2021. Abbe Lowell, an attorney representing Cook, called the government's accusations \"unsubstantiated and vague.\"",
      "The government requested that the appeals court act by the end of the day on Monday, noting that the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Cook's attorneys asked the appellate court to deny the Trump administration's request, calling it \"wholly unwarranted.\"",
      "\"An administrative stay would threaten Governor Cook's participation in next week's meeting and potentially plunge the FOMC's vote into turmoil,\" Cook's attorneys wrote in court papers. \"In addition, it has the real potential of impacting domestic and foreign markets. The Government has provided no justification for such a grave disruption of the status quo.\"",
      "The appeals court directed the government to reply to Cook's filing by Sunday at 3 p.m., making a ruling before then unlikely.",
      "Why does the Fed committee matter?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 which includes Cook, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and 10 other top central bank officials \u2014 is responsible for setting the Fed's interest rate targets, which have a major impact on economic growth, inflation and borrowing costs. The panel typically acts independently, with little input from elected officials.",
      "The committee has voted to leave interest rates relatively high so far this year, but investors and economists widely expect it to reduce rates at next week's meeting. Rate cuts could lead to stronger economic growth, but at the risk of causing inflation to heat up.",
      "Mr. Trump has tangled with the Fed for months over its decision to keep rates steady, nicknaming Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" and arguing the rate-setting committee should overrule him. Powell's term ends in May.",
      "Amid that pressure, Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in late August. A Biden appointee, Cook's term on the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors is set to end in 2038. The allegations against Cook are not related to Mr. Trump's push against the Fed, but if she is removed from the board, the president could pick her replacement, giving him more influence over the central bank.",

    "story": [
      "In an interview on \"Fox and Friends\" Friday morning, President Trump said he is no longer sending the National Guard to Chicago, saying instead that they'll be deployed to Memphis, Tennessee.",
      "The White House has been sending mixed signals over whether they would be sending troops to Chicago for some time, even as immigration activity has ramped up under the banner of \"Operation Midway Blitz.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump appeared to already be backtracking on plans to send the guard to Chicago, saying he would be announcing he'd be sending troops to another city \"very shortly.\" He appeared to make that announcement on the Fox News morning show Friday.",
      "\"I'll be the first to say it now, we're going to Memphis,\" the president said. \"I would have preferred going to Chicago.\"",
      "Mr. Trump then said he had spoken to a man he refused to name but said is the president of Union Pacific railroad, who told him he should send the National Guard to Memphis instead. The president said this man told him when he visited Memphis he was not allowed to even walk a single block and instead had to be driven in armored vehicles because the city is so unsafe.",
      "The CEO of Union Pacific is Jim Vena; the company's most recent president, Beth Whited, stepped down at the beginning of July and the company doesn't list a replacement.",
      "The president appeared to still be considering sending troops to Chicago one day, saying the same executive told him not to \"lose\" the city.",
      "\"He said 'Don't lose Chicago,'\" Mr. Trump told the \"Fox and Friends\" hosts. \"'You're gonna lose Chicago, sir. It's a great city. You're gonna lose Chicago.'\"",
      "The president did not say what he, or the executive, meant by saying he would \"lose\" Chicago. He also lashed out at Gov. JB Pritzker, calling him \"loud\" and once again claiming crime in Chicago is \"out of control\" as he spoke about shooting numbers.",
      "Pritzker has vocally opposed having the National Guard deployed to Chicago. As rumors swirled of a deployment he warned Mr. Trump, \"Do not come to Chicago. You are neither wanted here, nor needed here.\"",
      "This past weekend, Pritzker responded to Trump's \"Chipocalypse Now\" post on his Truth Social account with a post on X, writing, \"The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city. This is not a joke. This is not normal. Donald Trump isn't a strongman, he's a scared man. Illinois won't be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.\"",
      "Friday morning, Pritzker tweeted in response to the Memphis news, \"It's disturbing that the President is hellbent on sending troops onto America's streets.  Using those who serve in uniform as political props is insulting.  None of this is normal.\"",
      "In his \"Fox and Friends\" appearance, Trump claimed the deployment of the National Guard to Memphis had the support of both Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, and Memphis Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat.",
      "Young released a statement Thursday, writing in part, \"I am committed to working to ensure any efforts strengthen our community and build on our progress. We agree with Governor Lee that effective support for Memphis comes through focused initiatives that deliver results like we have seen with the FBI, state troopers, and other law enforcement partnerships. What we need most are financial resources for intervention and prevention, additional patrol officers, and case support to strengthen MPD's investigations.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Charlie Kirk, a right-wing political activist and influential voice for young conservatives in the digital age, died Wednesday after he was shot in the neck at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. He was 31.",
      "Kirk, a father of two, was shot as he was speaking to students at an event for Turning Point USA, an organization for young conservatives he co-founded in 2012.",
      "\"The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead,\" President Trump wrote. \"No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.\"",
      "According to video shared on social media, an audience member asked Kirk about mass shootings in the U.S. before Kirk was hit in the neck and slumped in his chair. Two eyewitnesses told CBS News a large volume of blood poured from his neck. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.",
      "Two days after his killing, officials announced the arrest of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson and said they believe he acted alone.",
      "Mr. Trump, who survived an assassination attempt at an outdoor political event last year, told the New York Post that Kirk \"was a very, very good friend of mine and he was a tremendous person.\" Democrats and Republicans alike expressed their outrage, prayers and concern on social media upon news of the shooting.",
      "Kirk, a close Trump ally, was the key to energizing and mobilizing the youth vote for the president throughout his campaigns. He was critical to the Trump ground game effort for voter turnout and built out significant parts of the Trump campaign in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Kirk stood by the president during what could be described as his political winter, soon after he announced his second presidential campaign, when skeptics doubted he could become president again.",
      "Kirk also made it his mission to engage more young people in politics, and register them to vote. Kirk was also a close friend of the president's son, Donald Trump, Jr.",
      "Kirk spoke at Mr. Trump's inauguration parade in January, and the president appointed him to the Air Force Academy Board of Visitors in March.",
      "\"For those of you that have always had the president's back throughout these last couple of years, when we were at our darkest moment four years ago, this is your victory,\" Kirk said as he opened his speech at Mr. Trump's inaugural parade.",
      "But Kirk's politics weren't without controversy. Kirk pushed false claims about voter fraud after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, stoked skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic and spread anti-trans rhetoric. He also amplified the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy, which is based on the belief that there's a plot to replace White people with minorities.",
      "After casting doubt early on about mail-in voting, Kirk pushed GOP voters to embrace the methods in 2024.",
      "He pointed to\u00a0Kari Lake's loss\u00a0in the 2022 Arizona gubernatorial race as a moment where he realized that Republicans must embrace \"Election Month,\" as he put it, not just Election Day.",
      "\"It triggered a lot of introspection on our team. And I was like, why are we not embracing, you know, this sort of methodology, we might not love it, but losing feels a lot worse,\" Kirk said. \"I think that the movement is looking at it the same.\"",
      "Born Oct. 14, 1993, Kirk grew up in the Chicago suburbs and briefly attended community college, but dropped out to pursue political activism full time.",
      "Kirk was the host of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" a daily conservative talk radio show and amassed millions of followers on social media.",
      "Kirk is survived by his wife, Erika, and their two young children.",
      "Jacob  Rosen and \n                                                  \n                                  Olivia  Rinaldi\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Boston \u2014 A U.S. appeals court panel on Thursday allowed President Donald Trump's administration to block Medicaid funds to Planned Parenthood while legal challenges continue.",
      "A federal judge in July ruled Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide must continue to be reimbursed with Medicaid funding as the nation's largest abortion provider fights the administration's efforts to defund the organization in his signature tax legislation.",
      "Medicaid is a government health care program that serves millions of low-income and disabled Americans. Nearly half of Planned Parenthood's patients rely on Medicaid.",
      "A provision in Mr. Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" instructed the federal government to end Medicaid payments for one year to abortion providers that received more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023, even those like Planned Parenthood that also offer medical services like contraception, pregnancy tests and STD testing.",
      "Federal Medicaid dollars\u00a0already can't be used\u00a0to cover abortions except in cases of rape, incest or risk to a mother's life. But Planned Parenthood argues the provision in the tax bill would make it harder for patients to access the non-abortion services it provides.",
      "Planned Parenthood Federation of America and its member organizations in Massachusetts and Utah filed a lawsuit in July against Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "\"While the Trump administration wants to rip away reproductive freedom, we're here to say loud and clear: We will not back down,\" Dominique Lee, President and CEO of Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts said in a statement. \"This is not over.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services didn't immediately respond to an online request for comment.",
      "Planned Parenthood said Thursday's ruling means more than 1.1 million patients can't use their Medicaid insurance at its health centers. That also puts as many as 200 of those health centers at risk of closure, Planned Parenthood said in a statement.",
      "Planned Parenthood says it's the nation's leading provider and advocate of affordable sexual and reproductive health care, as well as the nation's largest provider of sex education.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 More than 300 lawsuits challenging many of President Trump's second-term plans and his administration's actions have been winding through the federal courts over the past few months. But a handful now may be poised for review by the Supreme Court, or are getting close to it.",
      "The cases involve major policies enacted by Mr. Trump in the months since he returned to the White House, and several of them have already been before the high court, though during earlier stages in the proceedings.",
      "In those instances, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to grant it emergency relief, allowing it to enforce its immigration policies, in some instances, or terminate officials at independent agencies, in others.",
      "In the wake of those interim decisions, lower courts have continued to hold proceedings and issue rulings addressing the merits of the Trump administration's actions. If the Supreme Court agrees to step into these disputes, they will present the initial opportunities for the justices to address the legality of Mr. Trump's plans.",
      "\"I'm expecting this to be the term of Trump,\" Dan Epps, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said of the new Supreme Court term set to begin Oct. 6.",
      "The justices are already set to hear blockbuster cases on redistricting, campaign finance and state laws barring transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "Many of the disputes involving Mr. Trump's actions test the limits of the president's power, and rulings could have massive implications for his policies on the economy and immigration, as well as his reshaping of the executive branch.",
      "The Trump administration has sought emergency intervention from the Supreme Court roughly two dozen times so far, and it has fared well in its bids to continue enforcing its plans while legal challenges continue.",
      "But whether the president will prevail when the Supreme Court examines the lawfulness of his actions remains to be seen. Still, in some instances \u2014 like his efforts to fire certain executive officers \u2014 the Supreme Court has signaled that Mr. Trump may have the power to terminate members of certain independent agencies.",
      "\"What's at stake is the country's commitment to the rule of law,\" Epps said. He added that the new term could also bring a \"huge sweeping victory\" for executive power, particularly if the Supreme Court finds that courts should give broad deference to the president on matters like immigration.",
      "Tariffs",
      "The dispute over Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed on nearly every U.S. trading partner will be the first in which the Supreme Court will decide the legality of one of Mr. Trump's key policies.",
      "The high court said Tuesday that it is taking up two cases involving the global tariffs, which question whether Mr. Trump has the power to impose the sweeping duties under a federal emergency powers law. The justices will hear arguments in early November, a rapid timeline for the court.",
      "The Justice Department had asked the Supreme Court to step into the legal battle after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled late last month that many of Mr. Trump's tariffs issued under the emergency powers law are illegal.",
      "The Federal Circuit divided 7-4 in finding that the law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, did not authorize the president's global tariffs. But the duties remain in place for now, as the Federal Circuit wiped away a permanent injunction granted by a lower court that blocked the Trump administration from imposing the levies.",
      "The dispute tests a major centerpiece of the president's economic agenda, and the Justice Department has warned that a ruling against the government would put the frameworks of trade deals negotiated with half a dozen countries at risk.",
      "Termination of temporary legal protections for Venezuelan migrants",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump took office, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem took steps to end legal protections that had been granted to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants by the Biden administration through a program known as Temporary Protected Status.",
      "In response to a lawsuit filed by the National TPS Alliance and seven individuals who were shielded from threat of deportation, a federal judge granted preliminary relief and postponed the date Noem's plan was set to take effect.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined to put that decision on hold while proceedings moved forward, but the Supreme Court granted the Trump administration emergency relief, allowing Noem to end the legal protections for now.",
      "Meanwhile, the 9th Circuit heard arguments in July on the Trump administration's effort to terminate the TPS designation for Venezuela, and late last month, a three-judge panel sided with the plaintiffs.",
      "The judges found that the TPS holders were likely to succeed in their argument that Noem lacked the authority to set aside an earlier extension of the program for Venezuelan migrants.",
      "The impact of that decision, however, is limited because the interim relief granted by the Supreme Court at an earlier stage in the case is still in place.",
      "Alien Enemies Act removals",
      "Mr. Trump issued a proclamation in March that invoked the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport Venezuelan migrants who are suspected of being members of the gang Tren de Aragua. The Trump administration has deported hundreds of migrants it claims are gang members under the wartime law, which gives the president the authority to remove citizens of a \"hostile nation\" if it is engaged in an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",
      "A \"60 Minutes\" investigation found that many migrants deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act didn't have criminal records.",
      "The proclamation immediately sparked litigation, including two court fights that have already been up to the Supreme Court on its emergency docket. In the first case, brought in federal district court in Washington, D.C., the high court said any challenges to removals under the Alien Enemies Act must be brought in the judicial district where a migrant is being held.",
      "But the Supreme Court also said that migrants at risk of deportation under the 1798 law must receive notice that they are subject to removal and the opportunity to challenge it.",
      "In the wake of that decision, judges in Texas, Colorado, New York and California have blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants being held in their regions.",
      "The second case to reach the Supreme Court arose when Venezuelan migrants detained by immigration officials at a facility in the Northern District of Texas sued to challenge their removals under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The high court temporarily blocked the migrants' deportations in April and later\u00a0sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit for further review after finding the Trump administration had not provided the migrants with enough notice \u2014 24 hours \u2014 of their impending deportations.",
      "The Supreme Court did not address the lawfulness of the removals under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "After holding additional proceedings, a divided three-judge panel on the 5th Circuit rejected Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove Venezuelan migrants in the Northern District of Texas. The court said in its 2-1 decision that there was no predatory incursion or invasion by Tren de Aragua \u2014 preconditions to invoking the law.",
      "The 5th Circuit is the first appeals court to address whether Mr. Trump properly invoked the 18th century-law.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson suggested the Trump administration will appeal, saying the 5th Circuit's decision \"will not be the final say on the matter.\"",
      "Firings of members of independent agencies",
      "Mr. Trump has spent his months back in the White House pushing the bounds of executive power, including by firing officials at independent agencies appointed by former President Joe Biden.",
      "Mr. Trump's attempts to remove members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Trade Commission, to name a few, have all led to legal challenges by the ousted officials.",
      "In cases brought by Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, members of the NLRB and MSPB, respectively, a lower court ordered them to be reinstated to their roles. Federal judges in Washington, D.C., ruled their firings violated federal laws that shielded them from being terminated without cause and cited a 1935 Supreme Court decision that said Congress could enact removal protections for members of multi-member boards that met certain criteria.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court for emergency relief allowing it to fire Wilcox and Harris while their cases proceed, and the court gave the president the green-light to remove the officials for now.",
      "Meanwhile, the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., heard oral arguments on Mr. Trump's bid to fire Wilcox and Harris in May but has not yet issued a decision.",
      "But in a different case, involving Mr. Trump's attempt to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to decide whether the removal protections for members of the trade commission violate the separation of powers. The administration wants the high court to take up the dispute over Slaughter's removal before the appeals court has ruled.",
      "At least one justice, Brett Kavanaugh, believes it's time for the Supreme Court to address the legality of removal restrictions for members of independent agencies. In a concurring opinion in a case involving Mr. Trump's firing of three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Kavanaugh said there is a \"at least a fair prospect\" that the Supreme Court will either narrow or overrule Humphrey's Executor v. United States, that 1935 decision that upheld removal protections for certain executive officers.",
      "\"[W]hen the question is whether to narrow or overrule one of this Court's precedents rather than how to resolve an open or disputed question of federal law, further percolation in the lower courts is not particularly useful because lower courts cannot alter or overrule this Court's precedent,\" he wrote.",
      "Birthright citizenship",
      "The president's plan to end birthright citizenship has already been before the Supreme Court, but the justices did not address the constitutionality of his executive order. Instead, the dispute involved whether federal judges have the ability to issue nationwide injunctions, or orders that universally block enforcement of a policy beyond the plaintiffs in a case.",
      "The high court said judges are limited in their ability to grant that sweeping relief, but left open other avenues like class-action lawsuits or challenges to an agency rule brought under the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law governing the agency rule-making process.",
      "Following that June decision, several groups of plaintiffs amended their initial lawsuits and asked district courts to certify as classes children covered by Mr. Trump's executive order and would be denied birthright citizenship.",
      "In one of those cases, brought by a group of four states \u2014 Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon \u2014 a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled 2-1 in July that Mr. Trump's executive order is unconstitutional.",
      "The White House said in response to the decision that it looks forward to \"being vindicated on appeal.\"",
      "The ruling from the 9th Circuit was the first from an appeals court to address the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's executive order.",

      "The president also ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff until Sunday evening to honor Kirk.",
      "Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump released a video statement about Kirk, blaming the \"radical left\" for his killing. \"For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals,\" he said in a video posted to Truth Social. \"This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.\"",
      "Democratic and Republican politicians alike condemned Kirk's murder, although among some in Congress, there were disagreements about how to observe his death on the House floor.

      "A suspect on trial for trying to assassinate President Trump while he played golf in South Florida last year forfeited his right to continue making an opening statement on Thursday when he veered off topic and talked about Adolf Hitler and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.",
      "Ryan Routh, who is representing himself, was warned by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to stay on topic. The judge twice asked jurors to leave the courtroom so she could deal with the unconventional turn in Routh's opening statement.",
      "Both Routh and prosecutors had been given 40 minutes each to make opening statements, but Routh's initial argument, read from a written statement, lasted less than 10 minutes before the judge said he had forfeited the right to continue because he was addressing unrelated matters.",
      "In his rambling speech, Routh, seemingly on the verge of tears, spoke about a \"magical old cloth,\" and a \"wooden peg whittled.\"",
      "He asked questions such as \"Why are we here? ... What is our intent every day? ... How did we get so derailed and filled with hate?\" He also mentioned Hitler, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "Routh did not follow the judge's instructions, leading the judge to cut him off.",
      "\"I gave you one more chance and you continued to read what has no relevance for this case,\" Cannon said.",
      "During the prosecution's opening statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Shipley told jurors that Routh wanted to make sure that Mr. Trump wasn't reelected to the White House.",
      "\"He needs to go away,\" Shipley told jurors that Routh said about Mr. Trump.",
      "\"This plot was carefully crafted and deadly serious,\" Shipley said.",
      "Routh had military grade rifles, 10 phones, stolen license plates and a \"trail of lies that extended all the way from Honolulu, Hawaii to West Palm Beach, Florida,\" Shipley said.",
      "Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations.",
      "Prosecutors have said Routh, 59, methodically plotted to kill Mr. Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Mr. Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club. A Secret Service agent spotted Routh before Mr. Trump came into view. Officials said Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot.",
      "Just nine weeks earlier, Mr. Trump had survived another attempt on his life while campaigning in Pennsylvania. That gunman had fired eight shots, killing an audience member and grazing Mr. Trump's ear, before being shot by a Secret Service counter sniper.",
      "Five witnesses testified Thursday, including two Secret Service agents, two FBI agents and a witness who followed Routh in his car after the incident so he could write down his license plate.",
      "Tommy McGee, the witness, testified that he was driving by the golf course when he heard the gunshot and saw a man running out of bushes into the street, almost hitting his car. McGee said the suspect looked at him straight in the eye. Once the suspect jumped in a car and fled, McGee said, he followed him out of a desire to help the police, not realizing that Mr. Trump was involved.",
      "Routh's cross-examination was unorthodox and brief. He asked only a few questions of the witnesses and when he did, he referred to himself in the third person, leading to some awkward exchanges with Secret Service Agent Robert Fercano, who had spotted him in the bushes. Routh asked the agent if he had been harmed by what happened, and Fercano replied, \"I wasn't physically harmed, but I was mentally harmed from you pointing a gun at me.\"",
      "Fercano described being in a golf cart only five feet from Routh when he saw him pointing a gun from the bushes.",
      "The trial began nearly a year after prosecutors say Fercano thwarted the attempt to shoot the Republican presidential nominee. It's\u00a0expected to run two or three weeks. The trial's start comes as police search for the gunman who killed conservative influencer Charlie Kirk at a campus in Utah on Wednesday in what political leaders are calling an assassination.",
      "Cannon is a Trump-appointed judge who drew scrutiny for her handling of a criminal case accusing Trump of illegally storing classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach.",
      "Routh was a North Carolina construction worker who in recent years had moved to Hawaii. A self-styled mercenary leader, Routh spoke out to anyone who would listen about his dangerous, sometimes violent plans to insert himself into conflicts around the world, witnesses have told The Associated Press.",
      "In the early days of the war in Ukraine, Routh tried to recruit soldiers from Afghanistan, Moldova and Taiwan to fight the Russians. In his native Greensboro, North Carolina, he was arrested in 2002 for eluding a traffic stop and barricading himself from officers with a fully automatic machine gun and a \"weapon of mass destruction,\" which turned out to be an explosive with a 10-inch fuse.",

    "summary": "Democrats ultimately pushed for more time to iron things out and secure support as the day stretched on, but Republicans refused.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans moved ahead Thursday with a\u00a0change to Senate rules to make it easier to confirm President Trump's nominees amid a blockade from Democrats, who have warned against the move to go \"nuclear.\"",
      "For months, Republicans have criticized Democrats' efforts to slow the confirmation process, which they have taken to new extremes in recent months in protest to the president's policies. And after weeks of discussion among Senate Republicans, Senate Majority Leader John Thune kickstarted the rule change process earlier this week, announcing a proposal to consider non-cabinet executive branch nominees in groups.",
      "\"We've got a crisis, and it's time to take steps to restore Senate precedent and codify in Senate rules what once was understood to be standard practice, and that is the Senate acting expeditiously on presidential nominations to allow a president to get his team into place,\" Thune said as he announced he would take procedural steps to change the rules.",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has touted the proposal as one with \"a Democrat pedigree,\" citing a 2023 proposal to codify en bloc nominations of up to 10 nominees in Senate rules. Thune argued the GOP measure is \"not as extensive,\" noting that it applies to subcabinet level nominees and not judicial nominees. \"But the proposals share the same objective \u2014 and that is providing for confirming groups of nominees all together so the president can have its team in place and so the Senate can focus on the important legislative work in its charge.\"",
      "The majority leader filed a resolution Monday to authorize the \"en bloc,\" or all at once, consideration of 48 nominees. Heading into the day Thursday, the Senate was set to take a procedural vote on the resolution, which was expected to fall short of the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most measures in the upper chamber. Senate Republicans then planned to move to overrule the chair, lowering the threshold to a simple majority.",
      "But the possibility of a last-minute bipartisan deal began emerging Thursday, bringing the Senate floor to a standstill amid talks.",
      "\"It's in their court,\" Thune told reporters of a possible deal with Democrats, which he said \"basically\" resembled a proposal that Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine introduced in 2023.",
      "\"If they aren't willing to do that, then we'll proceed with the other plan,\" Thune said.",
      "Though a deal appeared within grasp early Thursday afternoon, Democrats ultimately pushed for more time to iron things out and secure support as the day stretched on. Republicans refused, teeing up the vote that would kickstart the rule change and resuming their original plan.",
      "After a procedural vote on the resolution fell short of 60 votes, Thune made a point of order before appealed the ruling of the chair. In a 53 to 45 vote along party lines, the Senate voted to overrule the chair.",
      "Because the Senate often relies on unanimous consent to speed up floor consideration, any single senator can delay the process. And in recent years, both Democrats and Republicans have made pushes to change the confirmation process, including by cutting down the time requirements for the nominations and reducing the number of votes needed to a simple majority.",
      "Still, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has pushed back on the GOP effort, telling Senate Republicans to \"think carefully before taking this step.\"",
      "\"If you go nuclear, it's going to be a decision you will come to regret,\" Schumer said.",
      "The minority leader has repeatedly criticized the White House for walking away from a deal before the August recess involving the release of already appropriated funds in exchange for cooperation from Democrats to swiftly approve a group of nominees. Schumer has said Democrats were working \"in good faith with Republicans\" on a nominations package, noting that Thune was very involved and seemed willing to come to an agreement, before Mr. Trump torpedoed the talks.",
      "\"Now, rather than giving those talks another chance, Republicans would rather change how the Senate operates to weaken this chamber's traditional and powerful sense of deliberation, Schumer said. \"And if Republicans go nuclear, the historically bad nominees we've seen so far under Donald Trump will get only worse.\"",
      "With more than 1,000 positions requiring Senate confirmation, the process is an arduous one that has become more cumbersome in recent years. According to the Center for Presidential Transition, the average time to confirm a president's nominee has nearly quadrupled during the last six administrations.",
      "In 2023, Klobuchar and King introduced a proposal that would have allowed up to 10 nominees reported by the same Senate to be quickly confirmed. Senate Republicans have repeatedly cited the legislation in recent days as they pursue their rule change, and Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, attempted to secure passage of a similar resolution on Tuesday under unanimous consent, saying \"if Democrats were really interested in solving the problem\u2026 they wouldn't object, they would agree \u2014 it's their idea.\" But one Democrat, Sen. Alex Padilla of California, objected, suggesting the effort should take effect in the next administration.",
      "King told CBS News that his and Klobuchar's legislation was intended for future administrations, saying \"we designed that for the next president.\"",
      "\"That would take it out of the politics of the moment,\" King said. \"Now, all of a sudden, they're dusting it off for use today.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Sep 2025 15:09:00 -0400",
    "summary": "California lawmakers are weighing whether to ban a group of chemicals known as PFAS, which are often called \"forever chemicals\u200b,\" in cookware.",
    "story": [
      "California lawmakers are weighing whether to ban a group of chemicals known as PFAS, which are often called \"forever chemicals,\" in cookware. The move has pulled in celebrity chefs on one side and environmentalists, including actor Mark Ruffalo, on the other.",
      "The proposal, Senate Bill 682, would prohibit PFAS in cookware, cleaning products, dental floss, ski wax, food packaging and certain children's products. The state Senate has already passed the bill and sent it to the state Assembly for consideration. Lawmakers face a Friday deadline to finalize the measure and send it to Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "It's the latest move to limit PFAS, which are a class of thousands of chemicals that have been around for more than 70 years and are widely used in a variety of consumer, commercial and industrial products due to their ability to withstand heat and repel water and stains. They are called \"forever chemicals\" because they are\u00a0extremely persistent in the environment\u00a0and can accumulate in humans and animals.",
      "Exposure to PFAS is linked to many negative health effects, including but not limited to kidney and testicular cancer, liver and kidney damage, and harm to the nervous and reproductive systems.",
      "The legislation specifically points to health risks as the reason for phasing out PFAS from cookware and other products. \"Exposure to PFAS poses a significant threat to the environment and public health,\" the bill states.",
      "Nearly everyone in the United States has been exposed to PFAS and has it in their blood, according to the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention. California and more than a dozen other states have in recent years taken a more cautionary stance by limiting PFAS in products.",
      "California has already banned PFAS in carpets, textiles and firefighting foam. Now, the latest debate centers on nonstick pans. Many are treated with a chemical compound called PTFE, a type of PFAS better known as Teflon, which coats millions of pans.",
      "Chefs push back",
      "The Cookware Sustainability Alliance, which describes itself as a group of cookware manufacturers, designers and engineers, has rallied high-profile culinary stars to oppose the bill. Chefs including Rachael Ray, Thomas Keller of the famed French Laundry restaurant in Napa, Marcus Samuelsson of Red Rooster in Harlem, and David Chang of Momofuku in New York City all submitted letters to lawmakers arguing nonstick pans are safe when manufactured and used correctly.",
      "\"I respect and share the desire to protect Californians and our planet, but I urge you to look closely at the science before moving forward with legislation that could unintentionally do more harm than good,\" Ray wrote. \"PTFEs, when manufactured and used responsibly, are proven to be safe and effective.\"",
      "Some chefs also argue that banning nonstick pans could make cooking more difficult and costly for families. \"Alternatives often do not perform with the same consistency, which can undermine the very goal of helping people cook nourishing meals at home,\" chef Einat Admony of Balaboosta in New York City wrote in her letter.",
      "\"We base everything on chemistry, on science,\" Steve Burns, executive director of the Cookware Sustainability Alliance, said in an interview with CBS News. \"The Teflon coating around a nonstick pan is a fluoropolymer. Technically it falls under the PFAS family, but fluoropolymers have been shown for decades to be inert and non-harmful.\"",
      "The cookware industry says the bill unfairly targets a material that regulators, like the Food and Drug Administration, have repeatedly approved and deemed safe. \"Since the 1960s, the FDA has authorized PTFE\u00a0and other fluoropolymers for use in food-contact applications,\" Burns said. \"As recently as early 2025, the FDA reaffirmed that PTFE in nonstick coatings remains approved.\"",
      "The environmental community responds",
      "Environmental groups including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Working Group have pushed back against the industry, saying everyday use of Teflon-coated cookware can release PFAS particles or fumes, especially when pans are scratched or overheated.",
      "\"PTFE is basically a plasticized version of PFAS,\" said Anna Reade, the NRDC's director of PFAS advocacy. She disagrees with industry claims that Teflon is safe because when nonstick cookware is overheated, she says, PFAS emissions come off the pans and can be inhaled or absorbed by the food cooking in the pan. A small scientific study supports Reade's claim.",
      "\"The other concern is that when you flake off and scrub off PTFE, you're breaking it into really small pieces,\" Reade said. Studies also suggest scratched pans may shed microplastics that could end up in food.",
      "Actor Mark Ruffalo, who starred in the 2019 film \"Dark Waters\" about PFAS contamination and is an outspoken critic of \"forever chemicals,\" weighed in on social platform X with an open letter to Ray. \"Independent science shows that the PFAS in cookware can wind up in our food,\" Ruffalo wrote. He went on to urge her to support the bill \"from the bottom of my heart.\"",
      "California state Sen. Ben Allen, a Democrat from Southern California who proposed the legislation, has also been vocal on social media pushing back against criticisms of the bill. \"PFAS have invaded every part of the world around us, including our very bodies and the food and water we consume,\" he told CBS News. \"SB 682 is a modest attempt to phase out more PFAS in California by focusing only on products which already face bans across the nation because safer alternatives widely exist in the marketplace.\"",
      "Allen emphasizes that the legislation aims to phase out PFAS in cookware and other items where substitutes exist. In place of nonstick cookware, stainless steel and cast-iron pans are possible replacements because they do not include Teflon coatings.",

    "summary": "Exoplanet TRAPPIST-1 e may contain an atmosphere and liquid water, NASA scientists said. Research into the exoplanet is ongoing.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists are observing an Earth-like exoplanet that may contain water using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, the space agency said in a news release.",
      "The exoplanet, known as TRAPPIST-1 e, orbits the red dwarf star TRAPPIST-1. The system was discovered in 2017. There are seven Earth-sized worlds orbiting the star, but planet e is the only one that is at a distance where water on the surface is \"theoretically possible,\" NASA said. However, astronomers still need to determine if the planet has an atmosphere.",
      "To look for an atmosphere, NASA scientists directed the Webb telescope's Near-Infrared Spectrograph instrument at the TRAPPIST-1 system as planet e passed in front of the star. If the planet has an atmosphere, the starlight that passes through it will be partially absorbed. That will create dips in the light spectrum that reaches the spectrograph. Those dips will allow scientists to determine if the planet has an atmosphere and what chemicals it might be made of.",
      "Scientists are also studying the light spectrum of another exoplanet in the system called TRAPPIST-1 b. Researchers have determined that planet has no atmosphere, NASA said, so comparing its output to that of TRAPPIST-1 e allows for a fuller picture of the potential atmosphere on that planet.",
      "\"Webb's infrared instruments are giving us more detail than we've ever had access to before, and the initial four observations we've been able to make of planet e are showing us what we will have to work with when the rest of the information comes in,\" said N\u00e9stor Espinoza of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, a principal investigator on the research team. Espinoza and the research team recently published two\u00a0scientific\u00a0papers\u00a0outlining their initial results.",
      "Researchers \"feel confident\" that TRAPPIST-1 e does not have a primary atmosphere. A primary atmosphere would be made of hydrogen and helium that would have been present when the planet was formed. But the star the planet orbits is \"very active,\" with \"frequent flares,\" NASA said, which create stellar radiation that may have \"stripped off\" that primary atmosphere. However, TRAPPIST-1 e may have built up a \"heavier secondary atmosphere.\" Many planets, including Earth, have done this, NASA said. Further research with the Webb telescope and its instruments will determine the types of atmosphere and its makeup.",
      "There are also many possibilities for water on the planet. There may be none at all, NASA said. TRAPPIST-1 e might also contain an ocean or wide swath of water. One side of the planet is always in darkness, so there may also be ice, NASA said. If there is liquid water on the planet, the NASA researchers say there would also be a greenhouse effect, where gases like carbon dioxide keep the atmosphere stable and warm the planet.",
      "\"We are really still in the early stages of learning what kind of amazing science we can do with Webb. It's incredible to measure the details of starlight around Earth-sized planets 40 light-years away and learn what it might be like there, if life could be possible there,\" said Ana Glidden, a post-doctoral researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, who led the research on possible atmospheres for planet e, in NASA's news release. \"We're in a new age of exploration that's very exciting to be a part of,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed on Wednesday while speaking an event at Utah Valley University.",
    "story": [
      "Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University on Wednesday as he addressed a large crowd at an outdoor debate. Officials described it as a \"targeted attack,\" and it drew\u00a0condemnation from both sides of the political aisle as authorities launched a massive search for the suspect.",
      "On Friday, officials announced they have a person in custody for the fatal shooting. They identified him as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who resides in southern Utah. Robinson was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, according to an inmate booking sheet from the Utah County Sheriff's Office. Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray plans to file formal charges in the case on Tuesday, according to a spokesperson.",
      "Kirk, who co-founded the right-wing advocacy group Turning Point USA, was 31. He is survived by his wife, Erika, and two young children.",
      "Here is what we know so far about the assassination and ongoing investigation.",
      "Who is the suspect?",
      "More details about Robinson and what happened before and after the attack are emerging.",
      "Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Robinson is not a student at Utah Valley University, where the attack took place, and has been living with his family in Washington County, located in the southwestern corner of the state. Family members said Robinson had \"become more political\" in recent years, the governor said.",
      "Utah State University said Robinson briefly attended the school for one semester in 2021. According to the Utah System of Higher Education, Robinson was a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College in St. George, Utah.",
      "Robinson's father owns a business installing kitchen countertops and cabinets and his mother is a licensed social worker, according to public records and their social media accounts. Robinson is the oldest of three brothers.",
      "\"They are very supportive parents who loved their boys and are involved in the community,\" a neighbor who said she knew the Robinson family well but had not seen Robinson in a few years told CBS News. She also said the parents were supportive of the country and of President Trump.",
      "State records show that Robinson registered to vote as unaffiliated. He is listed as an inactive voter in state records, meaning he didn't vote in the last two elections. He was not old enough to vote in 2020.",
      "Robinson had no prior felony or misdemeanor convictions and no prior violent offenses, according to a Public Safety Assessment Report filed in Utah state court.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said he was taken into custody at 10 p.m. local time Thursday night, though Utah officials said it was in the early hours of Friday. Records from the Utah County Sheriff's Office Corrections Division show he was booked into jail at 7:58 a.m. local time (9:58 a.m. ET).",
      "Mr. Trump first broke the news on \"Fox and Friends\" that someone had been taken into custody.",
      "\"With a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody. Everyone did a great job,\" the president said.",
      "Cox said messages on Discord, an instant messaging and social media platform, that were reviewed by investigators referenced a rifle wrapped in a towel that was left in the woods and engravings on bullets. The messages came from a person named \"Tyler\" and were shared with an unidentified individual, Cox said.",
      "A spokesperson for Discord later said it removed an account associated with Robinson and said the company will continue to coordinate closely with law enforcement.",
      "The governor said authorities believe Robinson acted alone and said there is currently no information that would lead to additional arrests. He told reporters Friday morning he can't answer questions about the possible motive of the suspect.",
      "Robinson is currently on \"special watch\" at the Utah County Jail while he is being evaluated to determine if he is a risk to himself or others, Utah County Sheriff's Spokesperson Sgt. Raymond Ormond told CBS News. Inmates are held in a special housing unit while on special watch.",
      "All inmates are given an initial screening after booking, but some are put on the more intensive special watch until they're screened, depending on the crimes they committed or things they said, Ormond said.",
      "How the suspect was captured",
      "Cox said Robinson's father recognized his son as the subject of photos that were released by law enforcement and urged him to turn himself in.",
      "Robinson admitted to his father that he was the person in the photos, two federal law enforcement sources told CBS News. Robinson said he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, the federal law enforcement sources said.",
      "Robinson's father called a youth pastor who knows the 22-year-old and is close to the family, and he and the pastor tried to calm Robinson down. The sources said the pastor, who also serves as a court security officer, called the U.S. Marshals Service and other law enforcement agencies. Marshals  then detained Robinson and kept him secure while waiting for the FBI. The FBI later took him into custody.",
      "Investigators reviewed video footage and said they identified Robinson arriving on Utah Valley University's campus in a gray Dodge Challenger at around 8:29 a.m. local time Wednesday, the day of the shooting, according to the governor. Robinson was wearing a plain maroon T-shirt, light-colored shorts, a black hat with a white logo and light-colored shoes, Cox said.",
      "He is believed to have changed clothing on the roof, where the shot was fired from, before changing back into what he was originally wearing. When investigators encountered Robinson, he was wearing clothing consistent with that outfit, the governor said.",
      "Tracking the suspect",
      "On Thursday, Utah Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason described the suspect they were seeking as a male who \"blended in\" with the college community and appeared to be college age.",
      "The public safety department and the Salt Lake City FBI office posted images of someone they called a \"person of interest,\" showing an individual appearing to wear a dark long-sleeve shirt, a hat and sunglasses. More photos posted later on Thursday showed the person wearing a backpack.",
      "Mason said investigators were able to track the shooter's movements before and after the assassination.",
      "According to a probable cause statement filed by investigators after Robinson's arrest, investigators were able to track his movements on campus starting at approximately 11:50 a.m. local time on Wednesday. He was observed entering a building called the Losee Center near where Kirk's event was taking place, which was the shooting location, and going up to the roof, according to the statement.",
      "Mason said the shooter moved to the other side of the building after firing a single shot, then jumped off and fled into a neighborhood off campus. Investigators contacted homeowners with cameras and witnesses to identify leads, he said.",
      "In a news briefing Thursday evening in Orem, Utah, with Patel in attendance, officials released security video that showed a man \u2014 who Mason called a suspect \u2014 running across the roof and then climbing down the side of the building immediately after the shooting.",
      "As he climbed off the edge of the building and dropped down, he \"left some palm impressions, some smudges, some places we're looking to collect DNA,\" along with a shoe print that indicated he was wearing Converse tennis shoes, Mason told reporters while showing the video.",
      "\"It's important to note his black t-shirt, his black pants, and there appears to be some white on the soles of those Converse tennis shoes,\" Mason said. \"Those are all identifiable items that we're looking for.\"",
      "After dropping off the building, the video showed the man moving across a grassy area before entering traffic. Mason said he crossed the street into a wooded area, where the firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was later found.",
      "The FBI said it was offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information that leads law enforcement to identify and arrest the person or people involved in Kirk's assassination. Patel said authorities had received more than 11,000 leads as of Friday morning.",
      "Gun and bullet casings recovered",
      "FBI special-agent-in-charge Robert Bohls said Thursday that investigators recovered a \"high-powered, bolt-action rifle,\" which they believe was the weapon used in the assassination. It was found in a wooded area where the shooter fled and was wrapped in a towel, according to Bohls. The rifle was determined to be a Mauser .30-06-caliber bolt-action rifle, according to the probable cause statement.",
      "Cox said that there were inscriptions on the casings of the bullet that was fired, as well as on the casings of three bullets that were not fired.",
      "According to the probable cause statement, the fired bullet casing contained the inscription, \"Notices Buldge OWO what's this?\" An unfired bullet casing read, \"hey fascist! CATCH!\" followed by an up arrow symbol, a right arrow symbol and three down arrow symbols. And a second unfired casing read, \"O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!\" A third unfired casing said, \"If you read This, you are GAY Lmao.\"",
      "Cox didn't speculate on the meaning of the inscriptions.",
      "Investigators also have a footwear impression, palm print and forearm imprints that will be analyzed, the FBI official said.",
      "Timeline of \"targeted attack\"",
      "The event where Kirk was speaking was scheduled to begin in the UVU courtyard at noon.",
      "A CBS News review of livestream footage and video metadata indicates Kirk was shot around 12:23 p.m., which is also when the FBI's Patel said Kirk was shot. He was struck in the neck by a single gunshot.",
      "A map produced by CBS News' Confirmed team shows where Kirk was when he was shot \u2014 in the central courtyard of Utah Valley University, which is surrounded by campus buildings.",
      "A university spokeswoman said Wednesday that they believed the shot was fired from the Losee Center. A law enforcement source told CBS News that the gunman appeared to have fired from the building's roof.",
      "The FBI released a video\u00a0\u2014 timestamped at 12:23 p.m. local time \u2014 that appears to show a person climbing off a roof at Utah Valley University and fleeing the scene. Dispatch audio reviewed by CBS News described a person on the roof of a nearby building wearing black clothing and carrying a long rifle.",
      "Video captured at 2:37 p.m. shows officers searching an area around a quarter mile north of the campus.",
      "At 2:40, more than two hours after the shooting, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that Kirk had died.",
      "While authorities have not specified a potential motive for the shooting, Mason said they believe it was a \"targeted attack toward one individual.\" Only one shot was fired, and Kirk was the only victim, the commissioner said.",
      "Cox called the shooting \"a political assassination,\" while Mr. Trump, in a video posted to Truth Social, blamed it on \"radical left political violence,\" which he said \"has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.\"",
      "Charlie Kirk's influence in politics",
      "Kirk was shot while he was speaking at a \"Prove Me Wrong\" debate, a trademark event for Kirk's Turning Point USA, which is a conservative organization focused on young people. He would hold political debates with a group that usually consisted of left-leaning attendees.",
      "Kirk had visited the Utah university as part of a nationwide tour of college campuses that was scheduled to continue for the next two months. About 3,000 people attended the outdoor event where he was assassinated, the Utah Department of Public Safety said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump called Kirk legendary, saying, \"No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.\"",
      "Kirk was a close Trump ally and was credited with galvanizing younger voters during his campaign. He made it his mission to engage more young people in politics and register them to vote. Kirk was also a close friend of the president's son, Donald Trump Jr.",
      "Kirk was the host of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" a daily conservative talk radio show and amassed millions of followers on social media.",
      "Kirk's politics, however, weren't without controversy. He pushed false claims about voter fraud after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, stoked skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic and spread anti-trans rhetoric. He also amplified the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy, which is based on the belief that there's a plot to replace White people with minorities.",
      "He was a friend of JD Vance, who said Kirk advocated \"in public and private\" for Mr. Trump to pick him as his running mate last year.",
      "\"So much of the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene,\" Vance said after Kirk was killed. \"He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 13 Sep 2025 10:00:44 -0400",
    "summary": "Fourteen animal shelter workers were evacuated and went to the hospital. The shelter's 75 dogs and cats were relocated or put into foster homes.",
    "story": [
      "The future of a Montana animal shelter remains uncertain after a cloud of smoke from two pounds of methamphetamine seized and incinerated by the FBI filled up the building and sent workers to the hospital.",
      "The smoke started to fill the building of the nonprofit Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter in Billings on Wednesday while the FBI used an incinerator at the animal shelter to burn the drugs, city officials said.",
      "Assistant City Administrator Kevin Iffland said Friday that the smoke was sucked in apparently because of negative pressure. A fan was supposed to be on hand in such situations to reverse the pressure so smoke would flow out of the building, but it wasn't readily available.",
      "The incinerator is used primarily to burn carcasses of animals euthanized or collected by the city's animal control division. But every couple of months, local law enforcement or FBI agents use it to burn seized narcotics, Iffland said.",
      "Fourteen animal shelter workers were evacuated and went to the hospital. The shelter's 75 dogs and cats were relocated or put into foster homes, said Iffland and shelter director Triniti Halverson.",
      "The shelter shares space with Billings' animal control division. When smoke started filling parts of the building, Halverson assumed it was from burning carcasses because she said they had never known about the drug burns.",
      "Halverson said she had a very intense headache and sore throat, and others had dizziness, sweating and coughing.",
      "\"Not a party,\" she said.",
      "The workers found out it was methamphetamine smoke through a call from a city official while they were in the hospital, Halverson said. Most of the staff spent several hours in an oxygen chamber for treatment.",
      "Symptoms have lingered for some workers, Halverson said.",
      "They were also closely monitoring four litters of kittens that got more heavily exposed because they were in a closed room with lots of smoke, she said.",
      "The FBI routinely uses outside facilities to conduct controlled drug evidence burns, agency spokesperson Sandra Barker said. She referred further questions to Billings officials.",
      "A city animal control supervisor who was present for Wednesday's burn declined to go to the hospital, Iffland said. The FBI agents were told to go to the hospital by their supervisor.",
      "The incinerator is meant to operate at a certain temperature, so it doesn't emit toxins. Iffland said officials were trying to determine if it was at the appropriate temperature on Wednesday.",
      "The shelter will remain closed until it can be tested for contamination. Shelter workers were tested for potential exposure, and Iffland said he did not know the results.",
      "\"We have no idea of how much we've lost,\" shelter board member and attorney Frans Andersson told CBS affiliate KTVQ. \"We don't have inventory at the moment of what was in there.\"",
      "The company hired to assess and clean up the building told the station that they are doing air quality tests before any remediation can happen.",
      "\"This is a unique situation and project,\" said Andrew Newman, owner and CEO of Newman Restoration. \"Typically, what we'll see is more on the residential side with, you know, kind of a meth lab that either caused a fire or triggered some type of needing remediation. With this being a larger commercial facility and what the intentions were, it makes it a unique situation and cleanup.\"",
      "Newman expects the lab results to come back by next week.",
      "Billings resident Jay Ettlemen went to the shelter on Friday to donate dog food and said he was angry when he found out about the drug burns.",
      "\"Why the hell are they destroying drugs inside the city limits?\" Ettlemen asked. \"There's so many other places in the middle of nowhere.\"",

      "The department said Uber violated the\u00a0Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination based on disability, by routinely\u00a0refusing to serve individuals\u00a0with disabilities, charging cleaning fees because of service animal shedding, and charging cancellation fees to riders who are \"unlawfully denied service.\" Uber said in a statement that it disagrees with the DOJ's allegations.",
      "The ADA requires ride-sharing companies to allow service animals accompany people with disabilities on rides and provide rides and assistance to people with stowable wheelchairs and mobility devices, the Justice Department said.",
      "The lawsuit, reviewed by CBS News, highlighted that Uber is the largest ride-share service in the U.S., and said that \"many individuals with disabilities increasingly rely on Uber's services to meet their transportation needs\u2014including to travel to work, medical appointments, religious services, and other important places.\"",
      "The department said the company has refused to reasonably modify its policies \"to avoid discriminating against riders with disabilities\" or train drivers in ADA compliance. The issues mean \"individuals with disabilities have experienced significant delays, missed appointments, and have been left stranded in inclement weather,\" the department said.",
      "In a statement in response to the lawsuit, Uber said every driver must acknowledge and agree to the service animal policy and \"all applicable accessibility laws.\" Drivers who violate Uber policies face \"decisive action,\" including \"permanent account deactivation,\" the company said. Uber said it also invests in technology, training and dedicated reporting channels, including a 24/7 service animal denial hotline, to \"ensure riders can quickly alert us so we can investigate and address issues.\"",
      "\"Riders who use guide dogs or other assistive devices deserve a safe, respectful, and welcoming experience on Uber\u2014full stop,\" the company said. \"We have a clear zero-tolerance policy for confirmed service denials, and we fundamentally disagree with the DOJ's allegations.\"",
      "The Justice Department previously sued Uber for charging disabled passengers a fee when they need extra time to reach a vehicle, even when they need more time because of their disability. Uber settled the lawsuit in 2022, compensating more than 65,000 users.",
      "The new lawsuit includes allegations from over a dozen people with disabilities, including blind passengers who alleged they experienced frequent ride denials and people who use wheelchairs or mobility aids who said Uber drivers refused to assist them or stow their devices.",
      "\"Uber denies service to hundreds, and potentially even thousands, of individuals with disabilities who travel with service animals, who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices, or whose appearance or involuntary behavior because of their disabilities may offend, annoy, or inconvenience drivers,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "Ryan Honick, who has cerebral palsy and uses a service dog for some tasks, including opening doors, is named in the lawsuit. Honick told CBS News in a statement that the incidents are not isolated, but \"evidence of a widespread civil rights failure.\"",
      "\"When companies like Uber consistently fail to comply with the law, it is disabled riders who are left behind. This lawsuit underscores a longstanding pattern that people with disabilities have called out for years, often at great personal and emotional cost, only to be met with automated responses and institutional inaction,\" Honick told CBS News.",
      "\"No one should be forced to choose between their mobility and their legal rights,\" Honick added.",
      "The lawsuit is seeking a court order to stop Uber from discriminating against customers with disabilities, force the company to modify its policies to comply with the ADA and train its staff and drivers on the legislation. It also demands Uber pay monetary damages to riders who have been affected and a civil penalty \"to vindicate the public's interest in eliminating disability discrimination.\"",
      "\"For too long, blind riders have suffered repeated ride denials by Uber because they are traveling with a service dog,\" said Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division in the news release. \"This lawsuit seeks to end this persistent discrimination and allow riders with disabilities to use Uber. We will enforce the ADA's guarantee that people with disabilities have equal opportunity and full participation in all aspects of American society, including transportation.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 12 Sep 2025 21:10:40 -0400",
    "summary": "Missouri is the third state to seek to redraw its congressional maps ahead of next year's midterms.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Missouri state legislature on Friday passed a plan to redraw the state's congressional maps and potentially add another Republican-leaning House seat, the latest state to join a nationwide redistricting push backed by President Trump.",
      "The state Senate passed the redistricting plan Friday, sending it to the desk of Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who says he will sign it into law. The state House passed the plan on Tuesday. Kehoe called a special session to take up redistricting last month.",
      "The new map would split up the Kansas City area, making longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver's district more conservative. Missouri would then be left with seven GOP-leaning House districts and one Democratic-leaning seat, a shift from the state's current House delegation, which has six Republicans and two Democrats.",
      "The redistricting push follows similar mid-decade redistricting moves by California and Texas. The nationwide gambit to reshape congressional maps comes as Republicans fight to hold onto a razor-thin majority in the House in next year's midterm elections.",
      "At Mr. Trump's urging, Texas officials passed a plan to create five new GOP-leaning districts last month. California lawmakers quickly responded by passing a map that would move five Republican-held seats toward Democrats, though the California plan still needs to be approved by voters in a special election this fall.",
      "Mr. Trump lauded Missouri lawmakers for advancing the new map, which he said in a Truth Social post \"will, hopefully, give us an additional Seat in Congress\" and \"will help send an additional MAGA Republican to Congress.\"",
      "\"A new, much fairer, and much improved, Congressional Map, has now overwhelmingly passed both Chambers of the Missouri Legislature,\" the president wrote.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, called the new maps \"rigged\" in a statement Friday.",
      "\"Bowing to the demands of Donald Trump, corrupt Missouri Republicans advanced their mid-decade gerrymandering scheme today to try and rig the midterm elections in order to salvage the weak GOP House majority,\" he said.",
      "Before the new maps passed, University of Missouri professor Peverill Squire told CBS News that Republicans have weighed splitting up Cleaver's district for years \u2014 but \"none of this comes without any cost.\" He noted that the redrawn maps are based on years-old data that may have changed, and legal challenges could follow.",
      "\"There's a lot of risk for the Republicans, and the only thing at the moment that they stand to gain is maybe one more House seat,\" Squire said.",
      "Within hours of the Senate passing the redistricting plan, opponents\u00a0filed a legal challenge in state court calling the new map \"unconstitutional in a host of ways\" and the process \"slapdash and rushed.\" The lawsuit \u2014 filed by the ACLU of Missouri and the Campaign Legal Center \u2014 argued the Missouri Constitution only allows one redistricting per decade after new census figures are released, and requires House districts to be as compact as possible.",
      "The lawsuit argued the intent of the new maps is \"to transform what has long been a seat anchored in the Democratic-leaning Kansas City metropolitan area into a district dominated by rural, Republican-leaning counties, an outcome accomplished by splitting Kansas City's Black and white residents along stark racial lines.\"",

    "summary": "X's AI chatbot Grok, the AI-search engine Perplexity and Google's AI summaries all provided false information in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination.",
    "story": [
      "False claims, conspiracy theories and posts naming people with no connection to the incident spread rapidly across social media in the aftermath of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing on Wednesday, some amplified and fueled by AI tools.",
      "CBS News identified 10 posts by Grok, X's AI chatbot, that misidentified the suspect before his identity, now known to be southern Utah resident Tyler Robinson, was released. Grok eventually generated a response saying it had incorrectly identified the suspect, but by then, posts featuring the wrong person's face and name were already circulating across X.",
      "The chatbot also generated altered \"enhancements\" of photos released by the FBI. One such photo was reposted by the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Utah, which later posted an update saying, \"this appears to be an AI enhanced photo\" that distorted the clothing and facial features.",
      "One AI-enhanced image portrayed a man appearing much older than Robinson, who is 22. An AI-generated video that smoothed out the suspect's features and jumbled his shirt design was posted by an X user with more than 2 million followers and was reposted thousands of times.",
      "On Friday morning, after Utah Gov. Spencer Cox announced that the suspect in custody was Robinson, Grok's replies to X users' inquiries about him were contradictory. One Grok post said Robinson was a registered Republican, while others reported he was a nonpartisan voter. Voter registration records indicate Robinson is not affiliated with a political party.",
      "CBS News also identified a dozen instances where Grok said that Kirk was alive the day following his death. Other Grok responses gave a false assassination date, labeled the FBI's reward offer a \"hoax\" and said that reports about Kirk's death \"remain conflicting\" even after his death had been confirmed.",
      "Most generative AI tools produce results based on probability, which can make it challenging for them to provide accurate information in real time as events unfold, S. Shyam Sundar, a professor at Penn State University and the director of the university's Center for Socially Responsible Artificial Intelligence, told CBS News.",
      "\"They look at what is the most likely next word or next passage,\" Sundar said. \"It's not based on fact checking. It's not based on any kind of reportage on the scene. It's more based on the likelihood of this event occurring, and if there's enough out there that might question his death, it might pick up on some of that.\"",
      "X did not respond to a request for comment about the false information Grok was posting.",
      "Meanwhile, the AI-powered search engine Perplexity's X bot described the shooting as a \"hypothetical scenario\" in a since-deleted post, and suggested a White House statement on Kirk's death was fabricated.",
      "Perplexity's spokesperson told CBS News that \"accurate AI is the core technology we are building and central to the experience in all of our products,\" but that \"Perplexity never claims to be 100% accurate.\"",
      "Another spokesperson added the X bot is not up to date with improvements the company has made to its technology, and the company has since removed the bot from X.",
      "Google's AI Overview, a summary of search results that sometimes appears at the top of searches, also provided inaccurate information. The AI Overview for a search late Thursday evening for Hunter Kozak, the last person to ask Kirk a question before he was killed, incorrectly identified him as the person of interest the FBI was looking for. By Friday morning, the false information no longer appeared for the same search.",
      "\"The vast majority of the queries seeking information on this topic return high quality and accurate responses,\" a Google spokesperson told CBS News. \"Given the rapidly evolving nature of this news, it's possible that our systems misinterpreted web content or missed some context, as all Search features can do given the scale of the open web.\"",
      "Sundar told CBS News that people tend to perceive AI as being less biased or more reliable than someone online who they don't know.",
      "\"We don't think of machines as being partisan or bias or wanting to sow seeds of dissent,\" Sundar said. \"If it's just a social media friend or some somebody on the contact list that's sent something on your feed with unknown pedigree ... chances are people trust the machine more than they do the random human.\"",
      "Misinformation may also be coming from foreign sources, according to Cox, Utah's governor, who said in a press briefing on Thursday that foreign adversaries including Russia and China have bots that \"are trying to instill disinformation and encourage violence.\" Cox urged listeners to spend less time on social media.",
      "\"I would encourage you to ignore those and turn off those streams, and to spend a little more time with our families,\" he said.",

Robinson admitted to being the person in the photos and his father encouraged him to turn himself in, the sources said. Robinson responded to his father, saying he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, prompting his father to call a youth pastor close to the family, the sources said. The pastor and Robinson's father tried to calm him, according to the sources.",

      "Kirk's next event had been set for Utah State University. The university confirmed that Robinson had attended the school as a pre-engineering major for one semester in 2021 before taking a leave of absence.",
      "Kirk had just\u00a0begun to debate someone in the audience\u00a0about gun violence when he was shot, witnesses said. Just one shot was fired, Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason said on Wednesday night. Kirk was struck in the neck.",

      "After the shooting, the shooter jumped off the building and fled into a neighborhood off campus, Mason said. Photos released by law enforcement showed a person wearing a dark baseball cap, black glasses, a long-sleeved dark shirt that appeared to feature an American flag and an eagle, and dark-colored pants.",
      "Investigators recovered a high-powered, bolt-action rifle that they believe was used in the assassination, Robert Bohls, the FBI special agent in charge of the bureau's Salt Lake City field office, said Thursday. The gun was found wrapped in a dark towel in a wooded area where the shooter fled, Bohls said.",
      "Cox also said investigators reviewed messages on the messaging platform Discord from a person named \"Tyler\" that referenced a rifle wrapped in a towel that was left in the woods and engravings on bullets. A Discord spokesperson confirmed the platform had identified an account associated with Robinson, but said it has \"found no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence on Discord.\" The spokesperson said the messages Cox referenced do not appear to have been sent on the platform, and described them as \"communications between the suspect's roommate and a friend after the shooting, where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere.\"",
      "Cox said that there were inscriptions on the casings of the fired bullet and three unfired ones. The fired bullet casing contained the inscription, \"Notices bulges OwO what's this?\" An unfired bullet casing read, \"Hey fascist, catch!\" And a second unfired casing read, \"oh bella ciao, bella cio, bella ciao, ciao, ciao.\" A third unfired casing said, \"If you read this, you are gay.\"",

Its words were shaped by quills fashioned from the feathers of molting geese. Secure the blessings of liberty. Its lofty, momentous ideas came from the minds of men, long since dead, and from the books they read. To ourselves and our posterity. Of the nearly two hundred written constitutions, the Constitution of the United States\u2014\u00adthe most influential constitution in the world\u2014\u00adis also among the oldest, a relic, as brittle as bone, as hard as stone. Do ordain and establish.",
      "But the U.S. Constitution is neither bone nor stone. It is an explosion of ideas. Parchment decays and ink fades, but ideas endure; they also change. The Constitution attempted to solve ancient problems having to do not only with the people and their rulers, the structure of government, and the nature of rights, but also with the knowability and endurance of law. Ingeniously, it accounted for the passage of time.",

      "Millions of consumers who used Facebook over a 15-year period were eligible to file a claim back in 2023, with the settlement stemming from multiple lawsuits filed against the social media platform by users who claimed the company improperly shared their information with third-party sources such as advertisers and data brokers.",
      "The litigation was sparked by Facebook's privacy scandal in 2018 with Cambridge Analytica, which\u00a0scraped user data\u00a0from the site as part of an effort to profile voters. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has denied any liability or wrongdoing under the settlement.",

      "A Sept. 5 court filing discloses that the average payment amount is approximately $29.43, with the maximum payout rising to $38.36.",
      "Facebook users are receiving a portion of the $725 million after administrative costs and lawyers' fees are paid out.",
      "The payments are based on how many people filed claims, as well as how long each claimant was using Facebook during the 15-year period covered by the settlement.",
      "Each claimant receives one \"allocation point\" for each month they had an \"activated\" Facebook account between May 24, 2007, and December 22, 2022. The settlement administrator adds up all the points assigned to all eligible claimants and then divides the net settlement amount by that number.",
      "Because the payments are based on the number of points assigned to each claimant, people who were on Facebook for shorter periods of time are likely to receive a lower settlement amount. The maximum payment of $38.36 would be given to people who were on Facebook for the entire 15-year period covered by the settlement, the Sept. 5 document notes.",

      "At one point, the larger crowd stretched from Big Ben across the River Thames and around the corner beyond Waterloo train station, a distance of three-quarters of a mile (around a kilometer).",
      "While the crowd was large, it fell far short of one of the biggest recent marches when a pro-Palestinian rally drew an estimated 300,000 people in November 2023.",
      "Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon and is known for his nationalist and anti-migrant views, billed the march as a demonstration for free speech, and also said it was in defense of British heritage and culture.",
      "The marches come at a time when the U.K. has been riven by debate over migrants crossing the English Channel in overcrowded inflatable boats to arrive on shore without authorization.",
      "Numerous anti-migrant protests were held this summer outside hotels housing asylum-seekers following the arrest of an Ethiopian man who was later convicted of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in a London suburb. Some of those protests became violent and led to arrests.",
      "Participants in the \"Unite the Kingdom\" march carried the St. George's red-and-white flag of England and the Union Jack, the state flag of the United Kingdom, and chanted, \"We want our country back.\" U.K. flags have proliferated this summer across the U.K. \u2014 at events and on village lampposts \u2014 in what some have said is a show of national pride and others said reflects a tilt toward nationalism.",
      "Some Robinson supporters held signs saying \"stop the boats,\" \"send them home,\" and \"enough is enough, save our children.\"",
      "At the counterprotest, the crowd held signs saying \"refugees welcome\" and \"smash the far right,\" and shouted \"stand up, fight back.\"",
      "Robinson supporters chanted crude refrains about U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and also shouted messages of support for slain U.S. conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "Kirk was shot and killed on Wednesday at Utah Valley University as he addressed a large crowd at an outdoor debate. Officials described it as a \"targeted attack,\" and it drew\u00a0condemnation from both sides\u00a0of the political aisle as authorities launched a massive\u00a0search\u00a0for the suspect.",
      "Officials announced they have a person in custody for the fatal shooting and identified him as 22-year-old\u00a0Tyler Robinson, who resides in southern Utah. Robinson was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, according to an inmate booking sheet from the Utah County Sheriff's Office.",
      "One demonstrator held a sign saying: \"Freedom of speech is dead. RIP Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "Robinson had planned a \"Unite the Kingdom\" rally last October, but couldn't attend after being jailed for contempt of court for violating a 2021 High Court order barring him from repeating libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee who successfully sued him. He previously served jail time for assault and mortgage fraud.",

      "The U.S. has relied on Qatar to act as a go-between with Hamas, with which it has long had ties. Working through Hamas' political office in Doha, both the Trump administration and the Biden administration before that have pushed hard, along with Egypt, to broker a ceasefire in the nearly two-year\u00a0war between Israel and Hamas, sparked by the Palestinian group's Oct. 7, 2023 attack. Senior Israeli officials have also traveled to Qatar many times to take part in these negotiations since the war began.",

      "Al Thani spoke as thousands of Palestinians continued to flee Gaza City ahead of Israel's ongoing offensive there.

    "summary": "South Africa's racist apartheid regime said no one was to blame for activist Steve Biko's death in prison. 48 years later, his family wants the truth to come out.",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0South African activist and anti-apartheid leader Steve Biko died almost five decades ago at the age of 30 in police custody. Family members and others who saw his body that day said he was tortured and killed by South African police, and that he had not died from the effects of a hunger strike, as officers claimed at the time.",
      "Prosecutors announced on Friday that they would be reopening a formal inquest into Biko's death, exactly 48 years to the day after he died.",
      "Biko, a liberation leader who founded and led South Africa's Black Consciousness Movement, became one of the most globally recognized victims of the apartheid era following his 1977 death in a prison cell.",
      "The country's National Prosecuting Authority, in a landmark decision, confirmed it would reopen an inquest to allow judges to rule on whether an offense had been committed.",
      "Nobody has ever been held to account for Biko's death, and several police officers requested, but did not receive, amnesty for their alleged involvement during the hearings of South Africa's post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).",
      "Biko was arrested at a roadblock in what was then called Grahamstown, now Makhanda, in August 1977. He was accused of violating a so-called \"banning order,\" a measure in the apartheid-era's racial segregation laws that allowed authorities to restrict the movement of individuals deemed a threat.",
      "Twenty days after his arrest he was driven over 600 miles, naked, with his legs in shackles in the back of a police vehicle, to Pretoria. He died in prison the day after arriving.",
      "According to reports from family members and others who saw his body soon after he died, Biko was brutally tortured by apartheid regime police during his incarceration and eventually died of a brain hemorrhage.",
      "The only government inquest into Biko's death was carried out in 1977, decades before the end of apartheid rule, and a judge came to the conclusion that no one was to blame.",
      "But his death was met by an international outcry, and calls for sanctions against the apartheid government and its leaders helped fuel the global movement against the racist regime.",
      "Biko's life was immortalized in music by Peter Gabriel's \"Biko,\" just three years after his death, and then again by reggae dancehall artist Beenie Man's \"Steve Biko\" in 1997. Denzel Washington played the anti-apartheid icon in the 1987 Hollywood movie \"Cry Freedom.\"",
      "Five former police officers from the South African regime's feared Special Branch testified at the TRC that Biko had attacked one of their colleagues with a chair, and that during an ensuing scuffle to restrain him, he hit his head against the wall, causing his death.",
      "They admitted under cross-examination, however, that they had colluded and submitted false affidavits during the initial 1977 investigation.",
      "\"My dad was a very healthy man, and we know he died of a severe brain hemorrhage,\" Biko's son Nkosinathi Biko said in an interview this week with the broadcaster Newzroom Africa. \"During the TRC process it was clear under intense cross-examination that one of the men admitted that they grabbed his head and rammed it into the wall which caused his death. They were denied amnesty at the TRC because of course they lied.\"",
      "The TRC, which conducted its work between 1996 and 2001, recommended more than 300 cases for prosecution by the National Prosecuting Authority. To date, no one has been prosecuted for those alleged apartheid-era offenses, however, leaving many families, including Biko's, frustrated.",
      "\"It's very clear that the history books of this country need to be corrected,\" Nkosinathi Biko said in the interview. \"The body of my father is a living testament to his last minutes and the torture and violence that was visited upon him. We should by now have dealt with these matters 30 years into our democracy, and it should have been handled better.\"",
      "In April, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa ordered an inquiry into whether previous governments had intentionally blocked investigations and prosecutions of apartheid-era crimes.",
      "The National Prosecuting Authority has been under pressure to bring formal charges for apartheid-era crimes allegedly committed by individuals who did not receive amnesty through the TRC process, as well as to bring accountability and answers to unresolved cases of gross human rights violations during the apartheid regime.",
      "Nkosinathi Biko said his father's legacy was about giving and investing in a shared society, and he said setting the record straight was a vital step forward for the nation.",
      "\"I think that our sense of triumph, our sense of healing, rests in the prosecution, which is necessary in the inquests,\" he said. \"But it also rests in ensuring that we correct the history of this country and we accentuate the value of human life and human dignity.\"",

    "summary": "Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right politician who governed Brazil between 2019 and 2022, was found guilty on five counts.",
    "story": [
      "A panel of Brazilian Supreme Court justices sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison Thursday after convicting him of attempting a coup to remain in office despite his 2022 electoral defeat.",
      "Bolsonaro, who has always denied any wrongdoing, is currently under house arrest in Brasilia. He can appeal the ruling.",
      "Four of the five justices reviewing the case in the panel found the far-right politician guilty on five counts, in a ruling that will deepen political divisions and was expected to prompt a backlash from the U.S. government. It makes Bolsonaro is the first former Brazilian president to be convicted of attempting a coup.",
      "The far-right politician governed Brazil between 2019 and 2022.",
      "President Trump said hours later that he was \"very unhappy\" with the conviction. Speaking to reporters as he departed the White House, he said he always found Bolsonaro to be \"outstanding.\"",
      "The conviction, he added, is \"very bad for Brazil.\"",
      "And later, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on his X account that the Trump administration \"will respond accordingly to this witch hunt.\"",
      "The sentence doesn't mean he will immediately go to prison. The court panel has now up to 60 days to publish the ruling. Once it does, Bolsonaro's lawyers have five days to file motions for clarification.  Lawyers for Bolsonaro have said they will appeal the verdict to the full Supreme Court of 11 justices.",
      "Bolsonaro has not attended the court proceedings, and on Thursday morning he was seen at his house's garage but didn't speak to reporters.",
      "Justice C\u00e1rmen L\u00facia Thursday said she was convinced by the evidence the Attorney General's Office presented against the former president.",
      "\"He is the instigator, the leader of an organization that orchestrated every possible move to maintain or seize power,\" she said.",
      "On Wednesday, Justice Luiz Fux disagreed and voted to acquit the ex-president of all charges.",
      "The trial has been followed by a divided society, with people backing the process against the former president, while others still support him. Some have taken to the streets to back the far-right leader who contends he is being politically persecuted.",
      "Bolsonaro's trial got renewed attention after Mr. Trump linked a 50% tariff on imported Brazilian goods to his ally's legal situation, calling it a \" witch hunt.\" Observers say the U.S. might announce new sanctions against Brazil after the trial, further straining their fragile diplomatic relations.",
      "Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing the case, said Tuesday that Bolsonaro was the leader of a coup plot and of a criminal organization, and voted in favor of convicting him.",
      "Lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro, one of the former president's sons, on Thursday talk about his father on his social media platforms. But instead of mentioning his father's conviction, he pushed for his amnesty, which he is seeking through Congress.",
      "\"It is time to do nothing less than what is correct, just,\" he said.",
      "Fux, in his dissenting opinion on Wednesday, disagreed with de Moraes and the other two justices.",
      "\"No one can be punished for cogitation,\" Fux said. \"A coup d'\u00e9tat does not result from isolated acts or individual demonstrations lacking coordination, but rather from the actions of organized groups, equipped with resources and strategic capacity to confront and replace the incumbent power.\"",
      "Earlier Thursday, L\u00facia also voted to convict Bolsonaro of organized crime in connection with the alleged coup attempt.",
      "L\u00facia allowed de Moraes to interrupt her vote and play several videos that showed Bolsonaro in front of thousands of supporters between 2021 and 2023 urging him to leave the Supreme Court. De Moraes also showed footage of some destruction inside the court's headquarters after the riots on Jan. 8, 2023.",
      "Bolsonaro faced accusations he attempted to illegally hang onto power after his 2022 electoral defeat to current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.",
      "Prosecutors charged Bolsonaro with counts including attempting to stage a coup, being part of an armed criminal organization, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, as well as being implicated in violence and posing a serious threat to the state's assets and listed heritage.",
      "\"Bolsonaro attempted a coup in this country, and there is hundreds of pieces of evidence,\" Lula said early Thursday in an interview with local TV Band, ahead of the trial.",
      "Despite his legal woes, Bolsonaro remains a powerful political player in Brazil.",
      "The far-right politician had been previously banned from running for office until 2030 in a separate case. He is expected to choose an heir who is likely to challenge Lula next year.",
      "The ruling may push Bolsonaro's allied lawmakers to seek some amnesty for him through Congress.",
      "The embattled former leader could now faced increased pressure to pick a political heir to likely challenge Lula in the general elections next year.",

    "story": [
      "More than 300 South Korean nationals detained by federal agents in a massive immigration raid last week on a Hyundai plant in Georgia for alleged visa violations were released from a detention center early Thursday and boarded a charter flight back to their country.",
      "The flight, which departed Atlanta, is expected to land in South Korea on Friday afternoon, according to The Associated Press.",
      "The South Korean workers were among some 475 people detained on Sept. 4 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at a still-under construction joint Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery facility near Savannah. ICE said they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Earlier Thursday, CBS News photographer Darrall Johnson watched as the Koreans boarded eight buses that then left for the airport, where a Korean Air charter flight was waiting to fly them home. Johnson said a cart full of documents was loaded onto one of the buses.",
      "South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, in an address delivered Thursday in Seoul, said 316 South Koreans would be on the flight, including 10 women. He said one South Korean had decided to remain in the U.S. as they have family members in the country.   The Foreign Ministry said there were also 14 non-Korean nationals boarding the plane, three Japanese, 10 Chinese and one Indonesian.",
      "The ministry had said the flight was expected to take off on Wednesday, but that it was delayed due to unspecified circumstances in the U.S. On Thursday, President Lee said the delay was caused by discussion that was ongoing Wednesday over the details of the transport arrangements for the South Korean nationals between the ICE detention facility and the Atlanta airport.",
      "The detention of hundreds of South Koreans in an ICE facility tested U.S.-South Korea ties that are important politically, militarily and economically. South Korea is the biggest foreign direct investor in the U.S. and the sixth biggest trading partner overall.",

      "\"Are we giving our money, technology, and investment to the United States only to be treated like this?,\" Kim asked.",
      "Cho replied by saying he would try to negotiate with Rubio to increase the number of visas issued to highly skilled Korean nationals to work in specialty occupations in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the ICE raid was the biggest single-site enforcement action in the agency's history. ICE alleges that the South Korean workers either overstayed their visa waiver permits, known as ESTAs, which allow business visits of up to 90 days, or were holding visas that did not permit them to perform manual labor, called B-1 business visas.",
      "Kim, at the American Chamber in Seoul, called it a \"blip\" in U.S.-Korea ties and said he was \"very, very optimistic about a much brighter future between the two\" countries.",
      "South Korea's president, however, took a more critical tone.",
      "\"As the president who is in charge of national safety, I feel a great responsibility,\" Lee said Tuesday. \"I hope that the unfair infringement of our people and corporate activities for the joint development of both Korea and the United States will not happen again.\"",
      "A poll conducted in South Korea found that almost 60% of respondents said they were disappointed by the U.S. crackdown and called the measures \"excessive,\" while about 31% said the ICE action was \"inevitable\" and that they could understand the reasoning.",

      "\"An opportunity to really fix some things\" with a key U.S. ally",
      "Industry experts caution, however, that it may be difficult to maintain investment levels under those guidelines, as securing visas can take years, while many projects face strict deadlines and delays can drive up costs. There is a shortage of highly skilled workers in the U.S., meanwhile, for battery manufacturing, semiconductor and modern shipbuilding industries \u2014 all arenas in which South Korea has been investing heavily for years.",
      "Such jobs can require years of experience, not just a few months of on-the-job training.",

      "He said that, given Seoul's importance as an investor in the U.S., it may be a good time for Washington to consider adopting a new policy that allows South Koreans to more easily come and work in the U.S.",
      "\"I think that in the past, Korea may not have been a significant investor in the United States, but now they are,\" he said. \"So I think it's worthy and deserving of that kind of a new status.\"",
      "Mr. Trump gave a nod in his Truth Social post to the notion that the U.S. does need foreign expertise, saying foreign companies should bring people over to help train American workers \u2014 and then hire them to do the work themselves.",

      "Rubio and Cho discussed advancing U.S.-South Korean ties \"through a forward-looking agenda\" that \"revitalizes American manufacturing through ROK investment in shipbuilding and other strategic sectors, and promotes a fair and reciprocal trade partnership,\" the State Department said.",
      "According to South Korea's Foreign Ministry, \"Cho expressed deep concern over the public disclosure of the detention of Korean workers who came to the United States to share technology and know-how and contribute to the Trump administration's efforts to revitalize American manufacturing, which has deeply hurt and shocked all Koreans.\"",
      "The ministry's statement said Cho had \"strongly requested the U.S. administration's special attention and support to ensure that these workers, who are not criminals, can quickly depart the US without physical restraint, such as handcuffs, and that they will not face any disadvantages in future visits to the U.S. He also proposed the establishment of a working group between the U.S. and South Korea to discuss various measures, including the creation of new visa categories, to prevent similar incidents from recurring.\"",

    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand\u00a0\u2014 A New Zealand court has rejected the latest bid by internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom to halt his deportation to the United States on charges related to his file-sharing website Megaupload.",
      "Dotcom had asked the High Court to review the legality of an official's August 2024 decision that he should be surrendered to the U.S. to face trial on charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering. It was the latest chapter in a protracted 13-year battle by the U.S. government to extradite the Finnish-German millionaire from New Zealand.",
      "The Megaupload founder had applied for what in New Zealand is called a judicial review, in which a judge is asked to evaluate whether an official's decision was lawful.",
      "A judge on Wednesday dismissed Dotcom's arguments that the decision to deport him was politically motivated and that he would face grossly disproportionate treatment in the U.S. In a written ruling, Justice Christine Grice also rejected Dotcom's claim that New Zealand's police were wrong to charge his business partners, but not him, under domestic laws - which likely yielded laxer sentences than if the men had been tried in the U.S.",
      "The latest decision could be challenged in the Court of Appeal, where a deadline for filing is Oct. 8. It wasn't immediately clear if Dotcom would do so.",
      "One of his lawyers, Ron Mansfield, told Radio New Zealand that Dotcom's team had \"much fight left in us as we seek to secure a fair outcome,\" but he didn't elaborate.",
      "Neither Dotcom nor Mansfield responded to a request for comment from The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "New Zealand's government hasn't disclosed what will happen next in the extradition process or divulged an expected timeline for Dotcom to be surrendered to the United States.",
      "The saga stretches back to the January 2012 arrest by New Zealand authorities of Dotcom in a dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion, along with other company officers, at the request of the FBI. U.S. prosecutors said Megaupload raked in at least $175 million, mainly from people who used the site to illegally download songs, television shows and movies, before the FBI shut it down earlier that year.",
      "Lawyers for Dotcom and the others arrested argued that it was the users of the site, founded in 2005, who chose to pirate material, not its founders. But prosecutors said the men were the architects of a vast criminal enterprise, with the Department of Justice describing it as the largest criminal copyright case in U.S. history.",
      "He has been free on bail in New Zealand since February 2012.",
      "Interviewed at his sprawling home by 60 Minutes in 2014, Dotcom told correspondent Bob Simon that he was inspired to seek his riches by the James Bond movies, \"where, you know, some characters had private islands and super tankers converted into yachts and space stations and underwater homes. So, you know, I got inspired by that.\"",
      "\"But you're not playing James Bond, you're playing Dr. No,\" suggested Simon.",
      "\"That's what everybody says,\" replied the web entrepreneur.",
      "Dotcom and his business partners fought the FBI's efforts to extradite them for years, including by challenging New Zealand law enforcement's actions during the investigation and arrests. In 2021, however, New Zealand's Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be surrendered.",
      "Under New Zealand law, it remained up to the country's justice minister to decide if the extradition should proceed. The minister, Paul Goldsmith, ruled in August 2024 that it should. \u00a0 \u00a0  But by then, Dotcom was the only person whose fate remained in question. Two of his former business partners, Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk, pleaded guilty to charges against them in a New Zealand court in June 2023 and were sentenced to two and a half years in jail.",
      "In exchange, U.S. efforts to extradite them were dropped. Part of Dotcom's latest legal bid challenged the police decision not to extend a plea deal under New Zealand laws to him, too.",
      "Grice rejected that, saying the choice to only charge Ortmann and van der Kolk in New Zealand was \"a proper exercise of the Police's discretion.\" The jurist also dismissed Dotcom's claim that Goldsmith's extradition decision was politically motivated.",
      "Prosecutors earlier abandoned their extradition bid against a fourth Megaupload officer, Finn Batato, who was arrested in New Zealand. Batato returned to Germany, where he died from cancer in 2022.",
      "In November 2024, Dotcom said in a post on X that he had suffered a stroke. He wrote on X in July that he was making \"good progress\" in his recovery but still suffered from speech and memory impairments.",
      "Goldsmith's decision that Dotcom should be extradited was made before the stroke. But Grice said the minister had considered other \"significant health conditions\" Dotcom faced and wasn't wrong to conclude that these shouldn't prevent him from being deported.",

      "The first of the stealthy, long-range \"Ghost Sharks\" will be delivered to the Australian navy in January next year under a five-year contract with Sydney-based Anduril Australia, Marles said.",
      "\"Australia is leading the world in terms of autonomous, underwater military capabilities,\" Marles told reporters in Sydney.",
      "The large, autonomous underwater vehicles would significantly boost Australia's undersea warfare capabilities, complementing a fleet of submarines powered with U.S. nuclear technology, Marles said.",
      "The first of those submarines provided under the AUKUS partnership with the United States and Britain won't be delivered to Australia until 2032.",
      "Marles would not say precisely how many Ghost Sharks would be built. But he said the Australian navy would be provided with \"dozens\" over the next five years.",
      "He also wouldn't comment on the Ghost Sharks' range other than to describe it as \"very long range.\"",
      "As an island continent and a trading nation, Australia sees the possibility of its sea routes being blocked by an enemy as a major strategic threat.",
      "A Chinese navy flotilla conducted a live-fire exercise in the sea between Australia and New Zealand in February in what was widely regarded as a demonstration of China's growing military reach.",
      "The flotilla almost completely circumnavigated Australia. The Chinese navy rarely travels so far south.",
      "California-based Anduril Industries was contracted in 2022 to produce three Ghost Shark prototypes for the Australian navy.",
      "The Ghost Shark is designed to perform intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance roles as well as strike operations, a government statement said.",
      "Chief of Navy Vice Adm. Mark Hammond said the drones could be launched from the shore and from surface ships.",
      "Hammond said he expected the \"undersea battlespace\" will become increasingly congested and contested.",
      "\"I believe our allies and partners will continue to enjoy a capability advantage in that space provided we invest in capabilities like Ghost Shark and others as well as our crewed systems for years to come,\" Hammond said.",
      "Last year, the partnership announced that\u00a0Japan would work with AUKUS\u00a0on maritime autonomy and, according to the official, there are also conversations with Canada, South Korea, and New Zealand about potential projects on emerging capabilities.",

      "An activist group sending a flotilla of aid boats to try to reach Gaza \u2014 the Global Sumud Flotilla \u2014 said a second one of its vessels was attacked by a drone while docked in Tunisia one day after it reported a similar strike.",
      "\"The Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) confirms that on September 9, another boat in our fleet \u2014   the 'Alma' \u2014   was attacked by a drone as it was docked in Tunisian waters,\" the group said in a statement on Wednesday. \"The boat, sailing under the British flag, sustained fire damage on its top deck. The fire has since been extinguished, and all passengers and crew are safe. An investigation is currently underway and when more information is available it will be released immediately.\"",
      "The group shared a video clip that it said showed the moment of the second attack. The video appeared to show a fireball hitting the deck of the boat from above.",
      "A day earlier, GSF shared a security camera video that appeared to show the first drone strike on another one of its vessels.",
      "\"This marks the second such attack in two days. These repeat attacks come during intensified Israeli aggression on Palestinians in Gaza, and are an orchestrated attempt to distract and derail our mission. The Global Sumud Flotilla continues undeterred. Our peaceful voyage to break Israel's illegal siege on Gaza and stand in unwavering solidarity with its people presses forward with determination and resolve,\" the group said.",
      "Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who took part in a separate Gaza flotilla that was\u00a0stopped by Israeli forces\u00a0earlier this year, is among those traveling with the GSF flotilla.",
      "After the first alleged attack, Tunisian officials initially dismissed the allegations. GSF later said Tunisia was investigating.",
      "Tunisia's Ministry of the Interior said in a statement on Wednesday that it was in fact investigating the incidents, and that it considered the second one a deliberate attack.",
      "\"The attack which took place yesterday on one of the ships docked at the Port of Sidi Bou Said was a deliberate act,\" the ministry said. \"The Ministry's departments are conducting all necessary investigations and inquiries to uncover the full facts, so that public opinion \u2014 not only in Tunisia but also worldwide \u2014 will be informed about who planned this attack, who colluded in it, and who carried out its execution.\"",
      "Israel maintains a blockade of Gaza, including its maritime border in the Mediterranean, so the flotilla would not have permission to dock there.",
      "Israeli forces have previously boarded and seized vessels taking part in activist flotillas to prevent them from breaching its blockade, including in a raid on a boat in 2010 that left at least nine activists dead.",
      "Israel has dismissed the flotillas as publicity stunts, and says its maritime blockade is necessary to prevent weapons and other materials being smuggled into the war-torn Palestinian territory, which has long been ruled by the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist group Hamas.",

    "summary": "Britain's Ambassador to the U.S., Peter Mandelson, has been fired by Prime Minister Keir Starmer over new information about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "British Prime Minster Keir Starmer has fired his ambassador to the United States, long-time Labour Party politician Peter Mandelson, after days of revelations about Mandelson's years-long friendship with the late financier and convicted sex offender\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"In light of the additional information in emails written by Peter Mandelson, the Prime Minister has asked the Foreign Secretary to withdraw him as Ambassador,\" the British government said in a statement released Thursday. \"The emails show that the depth and extent of Peter Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment. In particular Peter Mandelson's suggestion that Jeffrey Epstein's first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged is new information. In light of that, and mindful of the victims of Epstein's crimes he has been withdrawn as Ambassador with immediate effect.\"",
      "Pressure began mounting on the U.K. government to take action when messages written by Mandelson,were released by the House Oversight Committee earlier this month as part of a redacted 2003 \"birthday book\" for Epstein.",
      "They included a series of short notes accompanied by photos.",
      "\"Once upon a time, an intelligent, sharp-witted man they call 'mysterious' parachuted into my life,\" Mandelson wrote. \"You would spend many hours just waiting for him to turn up\u2026 and often, no sooner were you getting used to having him around, you would suddenly be alone... again\u2026\"",
      "With a photo of Mandelson setting a table alongside two women, whose faces were obscured, he wrote: \"Leaving you with some 'interesting' friends to entertain instead.\"",
      "Mandleson wrote that Epstein was known for \"taking you by surprise... in one of his glorious homes he likes to share with his friends (yum yum),\" and that \"whenever he is in the world, he remains my best pal!\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported the existence of Epstein's \"birthday book\" in July, prompting President Trump, who is also alleged to have written a message for Epstein in the book, to file a lawsuit against the newspaper and the owner of its parent company, Rupert Murdoch, seeking $10 billion in damages. Mr. Trump denies he wrote the message.",
      "Epstein was first criminally indicted in 2006 on state felony charges of solicitation of prostitution in Florida, three years after the book was written.",
      "Last week, when questioned about Mandelson's \"birthday book\" message, Prime Minister Starmer said Mandelson had \"repeatedly expressed his deep regret\" for his relationship with Epstein and \"he is right to do so. I have confidence in him, and he is playing an important role in the UK-US relationship.\"",
      "New revelations about Mandelson's communications with Epstein",
      "On Wednesday, Bloomberg published a report based on 100 emails sent between Mandelson and Epstein between 2005 and\u00a0 2010.",
      "In those emails, which CBS News has not been able to verify itself, Epstein and Mandelson discussed his legal cases, and Mandelson expressed support for Epstein, offering to raise his situation with at least one of his contacts and encouraging Epstein to fight back using strategies from Sun Tzu's \"Art of War.\"",
      "In one email from 2008, published by Bloomberg, Mandelson wrote: \"You have to be incredibly resilient, fight for early release and be philosophical about it as much as you can. The whole thing has been years of torture and now you have to show the world how big a person you are, and how strong.\"",
      "In a podcast interview published Wednesday, Mandelson expressed his regret over his relationship with Epstein.",
      "\"I regret very much that I fell for his lies. I fell and accepted assurances that he had given me about his indictment, his original criminal case in Florida, like very many people, I took at face value what he said. With hindsight, with fresh information many years later, we realized that we had been wrong to believe him \u2014  he's a charismatic, criminal liar, we now see \u2014 and I regret very much indeed\u2026 I felt it like an albatross around my neck since his death,\" Mandelson said.",
      "Mandelson said he had never witnessed Epstein committing any crimes.",
      "\"During all the time I was an associate of his, I never saw the wrongdoing. I never saw any evidence of criminal activity. I never sought and nor did he offer any introductions to women in the way that he allegedly did for others. Perhaps it's because I'm a gay man. Perhaps when I knew him all those years ago\u2026When I was associated with him all those years ago, as I did with my then partner and now husband Reinaldo, we never, ever saw any evidence or sign of this activity which has since come to light,\" Mandelson said. \"That's why I feel so profoundly upset by what has now been revealed about what he did to women and why I feel profoundly upset that I was taken in by him and continued my association with him for far longer than I should have done.\"",
      "The now-former British ambassador said during his interview for the podcast that he expected his correspondence with Epstein to be made public.",
      "\"I have no doubt at all that there's a lot of traffic, correspondence, exchanges between us, absolutely, and we know those are going to surface, we know they're going to come out, we know they're going to be very embarrassing, and I know that I'm going profoundly to regret ever having met him and being introduced to him in the first place,\" Mandelson said. \"But I can't rewrite history. What I can do is express my profound sympathy for those who were badly treated by him and secondly I can accept, yes I can accept, that I continued my association with him for too long.\"",

      "Harry has said previously that he wants to rebuild his relationship with his family, which has been strained since he and his wife Meghan formally stepped down from their roles as working royals and moved to California.",
      "This meeting was at Buckingham Palace, the monarch's official residence in London. CBS News has been told they met privately, for tea, but that all other details of the encounter were private.",
      "Speaking to reporters at an event later, Prince Harry said only that his father was \"doing great\" amid his ongoing treatment for an unspecified form of cancer.",

      "Absent on this trip were Harry's wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and their children, Archie and Lilibet.",
      "In an interview with CBS News' partner network BBC News in May, Harry said he couldn't envision bringing them all back to the U.K. with him since he has lost a legal bid to have his downgraded state security detail restored.",

      "\"Last night the Polish airspace was violated by a huge number of Russian drones,\" Prime Minister Donald\u00a0Tusk said in a social media post. \"Those drones that posed  a direct threat were shot down. I am in constant communication with the Secretary General of NATO and our allies.\"",
      "Poland's military said it scrambled aircraft to shoot down \"hostile objects\" in Polish airspace, a first for a NATO country during the war. The military, in\u00a0a post on X, called it \"an unprecedented violation of Polish airspace by drone-type objects\" and an \"act of aggression that posed a real threat to the safety of our citizens.\"",
      "The European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said early indications suggested the Russian drone incursion into Poland's airspace was intentional.",
      "\"Last night in Poland we saw the most serious European airspace violation by Russia since the war began, and indications suggest it was intentional, not accidental,\" Kallas said in a statement. \"The EU stands in full solidarity with Poland. Russia's war is escalating, not ending. We must raise the cost to Moscow, strengthen support for Ukraine, and invest in Europe's defense.\"",
      "Russia's Ministry of Defense said its drones had not targeted Poland, but Moscow's close ally, Belarus, said it tracked some drones that \"lost their course\" after being jammed, according to The Associated Press. Polish officials have said some of the drones were launched from Belarus, which Russian forces have used as a base for both ground and aerial attacks on Ukraine throughout the war.",
      "In a statement posted on social media, a NATO spokesperson said fighter jets from the Netherlands were deployed and helped to shoot down the drones, confirming it was \"the first time NATO aircrafts have engaged potential threats in Allied airspace.\"",
      "In addition to the direct response by Polish and Dutch fighter jets, German Patriot missiles based in Poland \"were placed on alert,\" and an Italian airborne early warning aircraft and a NATO refueler aircraft were also launched, according to the statement from NATO spokesperson, Col. Martin L. O'Donnell.",
      "\"NATO responded quickly and decisively to the situation, demonstrating our capability and resolve to defend Allied territory,\" Gen. Alexus G. Grynkewich, NATO's commander for Europe, said in a statement shared with CBS News.",
      "\"My thanks and congratulations to the Polish Operational Command and our NATO pilots for shooting down Russian drones over Poland,\" Poland's Prime Minister\u00a0Tusk said in a later social media post. \"Actions speak louder than words.\"",
      "\"We stand by our NATO Allies in the face of these airspace violations and will defend every inch of NATO territory,\" U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said Wednesday in a social media post, in the first reaction from a senior American official to the Russian incursion into Poland's airspace.",
      "A White House official later told CBS News that President Trump was tracking the reports out of Poland, and there were plans for him to speak with the country's newly-elected President Karol Nawrocki later in the day. Mr. Trump then issued his own brief reaction to the incident, saying on his Truth Social platform: \"What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Here we go!\"",
      "Apparent Russian drones and missiles have entered the airspace of NATO members previously, including Poland's, several times during\u00a0Russia's three-and-a-half-year war, but no NATO country had ever tried to shoot them down.",
      "A cornerstone of the Western NATO military alliance is the principle that an attack on any member is considered an attack on all. A NATO source told the Reuters news agency that the alliance wasn't treating the Russian drone incursion into Polish territory as an attack, but that it did appear to have been deliberate.",
      "Tusk told Poland's parliament that authorities had identified 19 violations of the country's airspace overnight and shot down at least three drones, adding that no one was harmed in the \"Russian action.\"",
      "Tusk said Poland had made a \"formal request to invoke Article 4\" of the NATO alliance's founding treaty. Under Article 4, any member can call urgent talks when it feels its \"territorial integrity, political independence or security\" are at risk.",
      "The Polish case marked the eighth time the article has been invoked since the alliance was founded in 1949, and the third time Article 4 has been invoked to address Russia's incursions into and invasion of Ukraine.",
      "NATO's collective security is based on its Article 5 principle, which states that if one member is attacked, the entire alliance will come to its defense. That article has only been invoked once in the history of NATO, by the United States, following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.",
      "Poland's military said efforts were \"underway to search for and locate the possible crash sites of these objects\" and \"the Operational Command of the Polish Armed Forces is monitoring the current situation, and Polish and allied forces and assets remain fully prepared for further actions.\"",
      "Polish police said officers had discovered a damaged drone in the eastern Polish village of Czosnowka, according to Reuters, and there were reports that a building was damaged by a falling drone or debris in another eastern Polish town, but there were no reports of any injuries.",
      "Hours later, Poland's military said on X that the operations had concluded but the search for downed drones was continuing. \"We urge that in the event of observing an unknown object or its debris, do not approach, touch, or move it. Such elements may pose a threat and contain hazardous materials. They must be thoroughly inspected by the appropriate services,\" the military cautioned.",
      "The Polish government announced it would hold an \"extraordinary\" meeting Wednesday morning.",
      "The incursion came as Russia unleashed a barrage of strikes across Ukraine, including in the western city of Lviv, around 50 miles from the Polish border.",
      "Warnings of further Russian aggression",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that eight Russian drones were \"aimed toward\" Poland in an overnight barrage that forced Warsaw to scramble air defenses. \"It was not just one Shahed that could be called an accident, but at least eight strike drones aimed toward Poland,\" Zelensky said, referring to Iranian-designed drones deployed by Moscow, adding that the incident represented \"An extremely dangerous precedent for Europe.\"",
      "Ukraine's foreign minister, Andriy Sybiga,\u00a0warned on X that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"just keeps escalating, expanding his war, and testing the West. The longer he faces no strength in response, the more aggressive he gets. A weak response now will provoke Russia even more - and then Russian missiles and drones will fly even further into Europe.\"",
      "Poland's President Nawrocki issued a warning along the same lines Tuesday, saying at a news conference in Helsinki that, \"We do not trust Vladimir Putin's good intentions. We believe that Vladimir Putin is ready to also invade other countries.\"",
      "European Union chief Ursula said Moscow had carried out a \"reckless and unprecedented\" violation of Polish airspace.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-season-statistical-peak-atlantic-quiet/",
    "published": "Wed, 10 Sep 2025 14:28:00 -0400",
    "summary": "This year has been quieter than expected for tropical systems in the Atlantic, making some wonder: Where are all the hurricanes?",
    "story": [
      "The summer and fall months often see menacing storms roaring through the Atlantic Ocean \u2014 with the Atlantic hurricane season starting on June 1 and continuing through Nov. 30. Historically, on average, hurricane and tropical storm activity peaks on Sept. 10.",
      "But this year has been quieter than expected when it comes to tropical systems in the Atlantic, making some wonder: Where are all the hurricanes?",
      "Looking at the Atlantic Ocean Basin, most tropical waves that eventually strengthen into tropical systems come off of the coast of Africa and travel across the warm ocean waters. But this year,\u00a0Saharan dust has continued to move over the open waters, preventing the thunderstorm development that is needed to form a tropical cyclone.",
      "Dust from Africa typically moves across the Atlantic every year, usually peaking from late June to the middle of August. However, high pressure in place over the North-Central Atlantic is allowing for fewer storms to develop in Northern Africa which creates the perfect conditions for dry dust to move through.",
      "The planet is also in a cycle of what is known as \"ENSO Neutral,\" which means that neither El Nino nor La Nina are present. During El Nino, the winds near the equator weaken which allows warmer water to be pushed eastward. La Nina has the opposite effect of El Nino. During La Nina events, winds around the equator are stronger than usual, bringing colder water eastward.",
      "When La Nina is present, fewer Eastern Pacific hurricanes occur and more Atlantic hurricanes form, and vice versa for El Nino periods. Since neither is currently present, we do not have a typical hurricane season.",
      "According to the World Meteorological Organization, we are forecast to transition back into La Nina in the coming fall and winter months, and the current lack of hurricane activity signals the start of the transition period.",
      "Hurricane season far from over",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, updated its forecast for the season back in August from its original analysis in May, predicting slightly fewer named storms. But it maintains that the Atlantic will see an above-average season.",
      "Hurricane season is still far from over. As of Sept. 10, 60% of it is remaining.",
      "NOAA predicts the Atlantic will see between 13 and 18 named storms this season, with as many as nine strengthening into hurricanes and as many as five growing into Category 5 storms, which are the strongest.",
      "So far this year, six named tropical systems have developed in the Atlantic \u2014 Andrea, Barry, Chantal, Dexter, Erin and Fernand. Erin was the only one that made it to hurricane strength. In the U.S., only one system made landfall this season \u2014 the remnants of Chantal.",
      "By this time last year, the same number of storms that we've seen this year \u2014 six \u2014 had formed. But three of them made landfall in the U.S.: Beryl, Debby and Francine.",
      "After last year's Sept. 10 statistical peak, other major hurricanes developed: Helene and Milton, later in the season. Milton made landfall in the U.S. and devastated parts of the Southeast.",
      "In total last year, 19 tropical systems formed in the Atlantic.",

      "Dr. Dubrow, a board-certified plastic surgeon and TV personality, shares how microdosing GLP-1 medications can help improve many aspects of health.",
      "They may have gained popularity for diabetes and weight loss, but GLP-1 medications like Ozempic and Wegovy have been linked to ever-expanding health benefits.",
      "In fact, some doctors \u2014 including Dr. Terry Dubrow, a plastic surgeon and TV personality based in Newport Beach, California \u2014 recommend that everyone takes a low daily dose, even if they don\u2019t need to lose weight.",
      "Dubrow spoke on camera with Fox News Digital about the benefits of \"microdosing\" these medications.\u00a0(See the video at the top of this article.)",
      "How GLP-1s work",
      "GLP-1 receptor agonists work by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1, which is released from the gut after eating.",
      "The drugs help to regulate blood sugar, slow down emptying of the stomach and diminish appetite, and have also been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease.",
      "Dr. Terry Dubrow, a plastic surgeon and TV personality based in Newport Beach, California, recommends that everyone takes a low daily dose of a GLP-1, even if they don\u2019t need to lose weight. (Terry Dubrow)",
      "\"Sugar's the enemy, and these drugs affect sugar in your blood,\" Dubrow told Fox News Digital. \"They affect the way insulin reacts.\"",
      "GLP-1s help insulin move the glucose (sugar) out of the bloodstream and into the body\u2019s cells, where it can be used for energy or stored, the doctor said. The drugs also help to prevent the inflammation and damage sugar can cause in the blood vessels, nerves and organs.",
      "'NEXT OZEMPIC' AIMS TO DELIVER 30% WEIGHT LOSS WITH FEWER SIDE EFFECTS",
      "\"I don't think anyone would argue that if there was a way to manipulate the amount of sugar and inflammation your body's exposed to, that is something we want to lean into. And that's exactly what these drugs do,\" Dubrow added.",
      "In addition to regulating blood sugar and triggering weight loss, GLP-1s have also been approved to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and kidney disease in certain patients.",
      "\"I have never seen a drug in the history of medicine be on such a rapid path to approval.\"",

      "GLP-1s are also being studied for potential cognitive benefits in Parkinson\u2019s patients.",
      "\"I have never seen a drug in the history of medicine be on such a rapid path to approval,\" Dubrow said.",
      "The case for microdosing",
      "Along with other experts, Dubrow is an advocate for microdosing, which is where people take low, steady doses of GLP-1s every day, even if they don\u2019t need them for diabetes or obesity.",
      "While patients with diabetes take doses that increase every four weeks, microdosing entails using a low-level dose that doesn\u2019t go up.",
      "WEIGHT LOSS TOUGHER WITH ULTRA-PROCESSED FOODS LURKING IN NEARLY EVERY MEAL, SAY EXPERTS",
      "A younger population on TikTok has zeroed in on microdosing, Dubrow pointed out \u2014 and he thinks everyone should be doing it.",
      "\"I am obsessed with the concept of microdosing,\" he said. \"I think maybe half the starting dose for diabetes is the way to go \u2014 and you probably don't need it every seven days, it's probably every 10 days, just to sort of modulate the amount of sugar in the blood.\"",
      "\"Even if you\u2019re not overweight, being on these GLP-1 drugs \u2026 helps to minimize and prevent a repeat recurrent heart attack,\" Dubrow said. (iStock)",
      "The doctor noted that there are still a lot of unknowns with GLP-1 medications.",
      "\"We are just figuring out now how to use these drugs for different indications, for different reasons,\" he said. \"We're learning as we're using it.\"",
      "\"I am obsessed with the concept of microdosing.\"",
      "As with other drugs, like Botox, Dubrow said there is a bit of \"human experimentation\" at play.",
      "\"We're figuring it out, and we're teaching the medical profession how to do it. The patients are telling us how to use these drugs.\"",
      "Potential risks",
      "GLP-1 medications have been linked to several potential risks. The most prevalent is gastrointestinal issues, such as nausea and vomiting.",
      "Others have reported an increased risk of pancreatitis, muscle loss and thyroid tumors.",
      "\"I read every study that comes out on these drugs, and I can tell you, it's very clear they don\u2019t cause pancreatitas,\" Dubrow said.",
      "OZEMPIC PUSH FOR SENIORS? SOME DOCTORS SAY MORE PEOPLE AGE 65 AND OVER SHOULD BE ON IT",
      "\"In fact, if you really look at the populations who have been using it, pancreatitis is less in those populations.\"",
      "Dubrow confirmed, however, that the drug has been linked to an increased risk of the very rare medullary cancer of the thyroid.",
      "Those who experience severe side effects from GLP-1s should talk to a doctor, Dubrow advised.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"If you have a family history of that, that's a contraindication to you using these drugs,\" he said.",

      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The severity of side effects is linked to the dose amount, Dubrow noted.",
      "\"The low dose, particularly the microdose, really has a low propensity toward the constipation, the nausea, the potential diarrhea, the GERD (reflux),\" he said. \"I think those side effects are less significant for people who microdose.\"",
      "To counteract the risk of muscle loss, Dubrow recommends increasing protein intake and incorporating resistance training as a core component of an exercise routine.",
      "Those who do experience severe side effects should talk to a doctor, he advised.",

      "Drugmakers weigh in",
      "When contacted by Fox News Digital, manufacturers of GLP-1 medications warned against microdosing the products.",
      "\"Lilly does not have any data on the benefits or risks of microdosing of Zepbound and Mounjaro,\" said a spokesperson for Eli Lilly, maker of the GLP-1 drugs Mounjaro and Zepbounda. \"Both autoinjectors and Zepbound vials are approved for single-use only \u2014 dose-splitting or \u2018microdosing\u2019 is not contemplated by the FDA label. As such, off-label use of Zepbound and Mounjaro may pose patient safety risks.\"",
      "\"Off-label use of Zepbound and Mounjaro may pose patient safety risks.\"",
      "Novo Nordisk, maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, said it does not condone \"misuse\" of its products.",
      "\"It\u2019s important to understand that for Wegovy, only the marked doses on the single-use, fixed-dose pens (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.7 and 2.4 mg) are approved for use and represent an authentic FDA-approved medicine,\" a spokesperson told Fox News Digital. \"The starting dose of Wegovy\u00ae\u00a0is 0.25 mg once a week, and the dose will gradually increase every four weeks. Patients should work with their healthcare professional to select either 1.7 mg or 2.4 mg for the maintenance dose.\"",
      "CHEAP OZEMPIC KNOCK-OFFS HAVE RISEN IN POPULARITY",
      "\"It is also important to note that the authentic Wegovy\u00a0injectable pen is designed as a single-use pen, the dose is already set, and should not be altered or tampered with, and the pen must be disposed after one use.\"",
      "\"Ozempic\u00a0is a multi-use pen with one pen and multiple needles,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Accessing GLP-1s",
      "Dubrow said he\u2019s not concerned about supply issues amid the growing popularity of GLP-1s, as major drug companies have the resources to \"scale up\" to meet the demand.",
      "Off-label use of GLP-1s, such as for microdosing, is common, Dubrow said \u2014 \"but finding a doctor willing to prescribe can be difficult.\"",

      "The doctor cautioned against buying these drugs from online marketplaces, which he referred to as the \"wild wild west.\"",
      "\"It's hard to find these drugs online from compounding pharmacies, because essentially they're going rogue \u2014 it's illegal. They're not allow to do it,\" he warned.",
      "\"These drugs are natural hormones that occur in our small intestine, and you get used to the side effects.\"",
      "\"So if you're getting it from rogue pharmacies that aren't allowed to do it or are willing to bend the rules, what is it? You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting.\"",
      "\"It may be an adulterated, weird version that has side effects or that's not effective.\"",
      "Looking ahead",
      "There are several next-generation drugs in development that combine multiple hormone pathways, Dubrow said.",

      "For more Health articles, visit\u00a0www.foxnews.com/health",
      "Overall, Dubrow said, GLP-1s are \"here to stay.\"",
      "\"They\u2019re just going to get better, and we're going to learn how to use them in a more appropriate and clinically effective way,\" he said. \"So fasten your seatbelt. If you're not on them now, you will be later.\"",

      "Mamdani\u2019s positions and past comments on Israel have been a hot button issue in the race as he has faced criticism from many in the Jewish community for refusing to explicitly denounce the phrase \"globalize the intifada,\" supporting economic boycotts of Israel,\u00a0surrounding himself with advisers that hold anti-Israel views, and a\u00a0social media post last year that critics say was mocking Jewish people.",

      "The FBI's success in apprehending Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin came one day after Director Kash Patel initially misreported that the suspect was in custody, a move that sparked consternation and criticism as the nation reeled over Kirk's violent death.",
      "Patel's misstep during the fast-moving investigation was overshadowed Friday by the breakthrough news that a 22-year-old Utah man had been detained and will face charges for the deadly shooting. But the flaws during the whirlwind 33-hour manhunt did not go unnoticed.",

      "A White House spokesman said in a statement that \"Patel and his team worked night and day to find this murderer and bring him to justice.\"",
      "\"Anyone who doubts his resolve and dedication - especially when Charlie was such a close friend to him - simply is using this extremely sad moment in a disgusting act of political gamesmanship,\" Communication Director Steven Cheung said, adding the suspect will \"face the full wrath of the justice system.\"",
      "The backlash began after Patel said Wednesday that \"the subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody,\" before saying less than two hours later that he had the wrong person. It was the second time that day authorities had arrested someone in the case then let them go.",

      "The blips during the manhunt for the person responsible for Kirk's killing also put a spotlight on Patel's and Bongino's apparent fixation on social media, a point that a lawsuit against Patel and the Department of Justice laid out in thorough detail days prior.",
      "The lawsuit was brought by three top FBI officials who alleged their constitutional rights were violated when they were fired without explanation. One of the fired officials said Patel and Bongino lamented the \"political capital\" they had to spend to keep the official on the job, a reference to pressure Patel and Bongino were getting on social media about the official. Patel's and Bongino's actions were often dictated by social media comments, the lawsuit said.",
      "Also fueling the fire was a delayed news conference on Thursday that offered little new detail as the investigation was underway. Patel appeared at the news conference but did not speak. Upon announcing the suspect's arrest Friday morning, the FBI director gave remarks of gratitude to the agency, local law enforcement, the media and public for contributing to the arrest. Patel made clear that he had been directing the FBI behind the scenes during the past couple days.",
      "\"Warroom\" podcast host Steve Bannon, a former Trump advisor, said on his show that he didn't \"know why Kash Patel flew out there, thousands of miles\" merely to thank people. Bannon suggested he wanted more details about the suspect and any possible accomplices.",

      "Hackers who break into one account often attempt to use the same password across your other logins. This tactic becomes even more dangerous when AI is involved because a chatbot can quickly test stolen credentials across hundreds of sites. The best defense is to create long, unique passwords for every account you have. Treat your passwords like digital keys and never reuse the same one in more than one lock.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "The hacker who abused Claude didn't just steal files; they organized and analyzed them to find the most damaging details. That illustrates the value of your personal information in the wrong hands. The less data criminals can find about you online, the safer you are. Review your digital footprint, lock down privacy settings, and reduce what's available on public databases and broker sites.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Even if a hacker obtains your password,\u00a02FA\u00a0can stop them in their tracks. AI tools now help criminals generate highly realistic phishing attempts designed to trick you into handing over logins. By enabling\u00a02FA, you add an extra layer of protection that they cannot easily bypass. Choose app-based codes or a physical key whenever possible, as these are more secure than text messages, which are easier for attackers to intercept.",
      "AI-driven attacks often exploit the most basic weaknesses, such as outdated software. Once a hacker knows which companies or individuals are running old systems, they can use automated scripts to break in within minutes. Regular updates close those gaps before they can be targeted. Setting your devices and apps to update automatically removes one of the easiest entry points that criminals rely on.",
      "One of the most alarming details in the Anthropic report was how the hacker used AI to craft convincing extortion notes. The same tactics are being applied to phishing emails and texts sent to everyday users. If you receive a message demanding immediate action, such as clicking a link, transferring money or downloading a file, treat it with suspicion. Stop, check the source and verify before you act.",
      "The hacker in this case built custom malware with the help of AI. That means malicious software is getting smarter, faster and harder to detect. Strong antivirus software that constantly scans for suspicious activity provides a critical safety net. It can identify phishing emails and detect ransomware before it spreads, which is vital now that AI tools make these attacks more adaptive and persistent.",

      "A dangerous new malware campaign is targeting Mac users worldwide. Security researchers at CrowdStrike uncovered Shamos, a new variant of the Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS), developed by a cybercriminal group called COOKIE SPIDER.",
      "The attack relies on ClickFix tactics, where victims searching for Mac troubleshooting help are lured to fake websites or GitHub repositories. These spoofed sites trick users into copying and pasting a one-line command in Terminal, supposedly to fix an error. Instead, the command silently downloads Shamos, bypasses macOS Gatekeeper protections, and installs the malware.",
      "Once inside, Shamos searches for sensitive data, Apple Notes, Keychain items, browser passwords, and even cryptocurrency wallets. The stolen information is zipped and sent directly to attackers, often alongside additional malware like botnet modules or fake Ledger wallet apps.",

      "How Shamos malware spreads on macOS",
      "Cybercriminals distribute these fake \"fixes\" through so-called \"malvertising\" campaigns and spoofed tech help sites with names like mac-safer[.]com or rescue-mac[.]com. These pages pose as trusted troubleshooting guides and appear in search results for common Mac issues, such as \"how to flush resolver cache.\"",
      "The websites encourage victims to copy and paste commands that download malicious Bash scripts. These scripts grab the user's password, remove file protections, and launch Shamos. With persistence tools installed, the malware can even restart alongside the system, keeping control long after the initial infection.",

      "A fake help page provides victims with false instructions about how to fix problems with their Mac computer. (CrowdStrike)",
      "Tips to stay safe from Shamos malware",
      "You can avoid falling victim to Shamos and similar threats with these proactive steps:",
      "Copy-pasting commands into Terminal may seem like an easy fix, but it's also one of the easiest ways for attackers to bypass Apple's built-in protections. If you see a command on a website, forum, or GitHub repository, don't execute it unless you fully understand what it does. Instead, confirm with Apple's official support site or the Apple Community forums, where experienced users and moderators can verify safe troubleshooting steps.",
      "Hackers know that when your Mac has a problem, you'll search for a quick solution. That's why they buy sponsored ads like the one below to push fake troubleshooting websites higher in search results. Clicking the top link may feel natural, but it could be a trap.

      "GitHub is an amazing resource for developers, but it's also become a hotspot for malicious repositories that mimic legitimate software. Attackers often clone popular apps or tools, then hide malware inside. Before downloading anything, check the publisher's name, stars, and activity history. If the account looks suspicious, inactive, or brand-new, avoid it.",
      "Mac malware is evolving fast, and Apple's built-in security features can't catch everything. A strong antivirus adds another layer of defense by scanning downloads, blocking malicious scripts, and detecting suspicious behavior in real time.

      "Since Shamos is designed to steal personal information and send it to cybercriminals, reducing your online footprint can help limit the fallout. A personal data removal service scans data broker sites and removes your exposed information, making it harder for attackers to resell or exploit it after a breach. While this won't stop malware from stealing what's on your Mac, it adds another layer of protection by minimizing the data criminals can use against you.",

Enable automatic updates, so your Mac receives the latest patches as soon as they're available. Pairing this with good digital hygiene, like avoiding shady downloads, dramatically lowers your risk of infection.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Cybercriminals know that when your Mac breaks, you'll look for quick answers. Shamos takes advantage of that urgency by disguising itself as help. Staying safe means slowing down before you copy, paste, or download anything. If something feels off, it probably is.",

It's all done through text: just describe the scene or story, and the AI gets to work.

      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss a new iPhone update that will filter out spam messages and tips to protect yourself from A.I. cyberattacks.",
      "Apple's big annual event on Tuesday delivered a polished and tightly produced showcase. The company's CEO, Tim Cook, led the presentation with sweeping visuals, confident pacing and a clear message: Apple is still betting big on premium innovation. But the real headline wasn't so much the tech; it was the prices.",
      "Earlier this year, President Donald Trump granted Apple a tariff break. Still, the company raised prices across its iPhone lineup. The new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, which Apple positioned as a reinvention of last year's iPhone 16 Plus, jumps to $999. The iPhone 17 Pro begins at $1,099, while the Pro Max tops out at $1,199. The entry-level iPhone 17 starts at $799.",
      "Apple positioned the price hikes as a reflection of breakthrough innovation. The company spotlighted the iPhone Air's sleek redesign, the powerful A19 chip and major camera upgrades. Yet the takeaway was clear: tariff relief didn't lead to consumer savings. Instead, Apple leaned into its premium identity, signaling that cutting-edge tech now comes with a steeper price tag.",

      "Apple unveiled the iPhone 17 Air, its slimmest model yet at 5.6mm and 165 grams, built with recycled aluminum, glass and titanium. (Apple)",
      "Apple calls the iPhone 17 Air a game-changer. At just 5.6mm thin and weighing around 165 grams, it stands as the slimmest iPhone the company has ever made. The design uses recycled aluminum, glass and titanium to reduce weight while staying durable. Engineers reinforced the frame and applied new drop-test algorithms to make sure it holds up in daily use.",
      "The Air debuts silicon anode battery technology, which allows Apple to shrink the device without cutting power. During the presentation, Apple promised \"all-day battery life,\" but never gave an exact hour count. That vague description raised questions. Moments later, Apple introduced a new low-profile MagSafe battery accessory. When paired with the iPhone 17 Air, Apple says the combo delivers up to 40 hours of video playback. The timing of that announcement made it clear that battery life could still be a concern.",
      "Apple also pushed the Air forward with a new ultra-wide 48MP fusion camera system, which uses advanced image processing to improve detail and low-light performance. The display gained a ProMotion 120Hz refresh rate that makes scrolling and animations feel smoother. Outdoor use should also improve, thanks to 3,000 nits of peak brightness, making it easier to see in direct sunlight. On the durability side, the Air features Ceramic Shield 2 coating, which Apple claims resists scratches and accidental drops better than before.",

      "The iPhone 17 Pro starts at $1,099 and comes with 256GB of base storage. (Apple)",
      "The iPhone 17 Pro introduces a striking unibody design that relies on laser-welded vapor chamber cooling to keep performance steady even under heavy use. Apple gave the back a ceramic shield finish, while the front now features its upgraded seven-layer coating. That change reduces glare both indoors and outdoors, making the display easier on the eyes in all conditions.",
      "At the core of the Pro sits the new A19 Bionic chip built on 3nm architecture. Apple paired it with a 16-core Neural Engine and an updated display engine to push speed and efficiency even further. The company claims this is the most power-efficient iPhone yet and promises the longest battery life ever offered in a Pro model.",
      "Apple also turned its attention to the camera system. The Pro camera lineup includes a 48MP main sensor and a 12MP ultra-wide, with ProRes support for high-quality video recording. It even offers Genlock syncing, which professionals can use to line up multiple cameras in studio and live production setups.",
      "To complement the new design, Apple introduced TechWoven cases that feel more like premium accessories than traditional covers. Some versions include optional cross-body straps, a nod to the growing trend of blending technology with fashion.",

      "Apple positioned the iPhone 17 Pro Max as the ultimate model in the lineup. It shares the same unibody design, ceramic shield finish and seven-layer front coating as the Pro, but it stretches everything to a larger scale. The Pro Max delivers the biggest display Apple has ever put on an iPhone, paired with enhanced brightness that makes it more usable outdoors and in direct sunlight.",
      "Inside, it runs on the same A19 Bionic chip with the 16-core Neural Engine, so performance and efficiency mirror the Pro. What sets the Max apart is its endurance. Apple claims it offers the best battery life of any iPhone to date, making it the go-to choice for people who rely heavily on their phone throughout the day.",
      "The Pro Max also carries the full Pro camera system, including the 48MP main sensor and advanced video features like ProRes and Genlock. With its extra size, it appeals most to creators, gamers and anyone who wants the biggest screen possible in an iPhone.",
      "Like the Pro, the Max is available in deep blue, cosmic orange and silver finishes.",

      "The iPhone 17 inherits many of the Pro's features. It comes in five colors and has a thinner profile that feels more refined in hand. The display includes the upgraded coating to cut glare, and the front camera has a square AI-driven sensor with Center Stage for better video calls.",
      "The main camera system also makes a leap forward. The iPhone 17 now carries a 48MP main sensor, supported by Apple's fusion technology to improve clarity and low-light results. Combined with the updated display engine and improved durability from Ceramic Shield 2, the iPhone 17 delivers a more polished experience than previous entry models.",

      "Apple didn't stop with iPhones. The company used its event to refresh its wearables and audio lineup, bringing new features to AirPods and multiple Apple Watch models. Each product builds on familiar designs while adding functions aimed at health, fitness and convenience.",
      "The new AirPods Pro 3 deliver up to eight hours of listening time on a single charge. (Apple)",
      "Apple unveiled the third-generation AirPods Pro, priced at $249, and available starting Sept. 19. The design keeps the iconic stem but introduces foam-infused ear tips that come in five sizes. Apple said it studied 100,000 ear shapes to make them fit more securely.",
      "The new AirPods Pro 3 extend listening time, offering up to eight hours on a single charge, compared with six hours in the previous generation. With the charging case, total listening time stretches to 10 hours with hearing-AI features enabled.",
      "One of the standout additions is heart rate sensing, which turns the AirPods into another health-tracking accessory in Apple's ecosystem. The earbuds also use AI-driven hearing enhancements to improve clarity in noisy environments. Apple said the AirPods Pro 3 now deliver up to four times stronger active noise cancellation (ANC) than the originals, making them far more effective in crowded or loud spaces.",
      "For workouts, users can also track over 50 activity types with the Fitness app on iPhone while wearing them. Perhaps most notably, Apple added live translation. When two people wear AirPods Pro 3 paired with iPhones, conversations can be translated in real time, breaking language barriers in a way that once seemed impossible.",
      "Apple Watch Series 11 expands the company\u2019s push into advanced health technology. (Apple)",
      "The Apple Watch Series 11 continues Apple's push into health technology. It runs on watchOS 26 and introduces monitoring for possible hypertension and sleep apnea, with alerts designed to prompt users to seek medical care. Apple noted that FDA clearance is still pending for hypertension notifications, but the company clearly sees the watch as a serious medical tool.",
      "The watch also includes Sleep Score, which breaks down sleep stages such as core, deep and awake to give users a clearer picture of rest quality. Battery life reaches up to 24 hours, and the watch remains efficient even with 5G connectivity.",
      "Apple built the Series 11 with 100% recycled aluminum and titanium cases, expanding its sustainability pledge. Color options bring a refreshed look, while pricing\u00a0starts around $399, depending on configuration.",

      "Apple also refreshed its budget-friendly model, the Apple Watch SE 3. At\u00a0$249, it remains the lowest-priced entry into the lineup. The SE 3 uses the new S10 chip, giving it faster performance and support for Apple's expanding gesture controls.",
      "It also delivers sleep apnea notifications, a feature previously limited to more expensive models. Charging is now up to two times faster, ensuring the watch is ready to go with less downtime. Apple added more health and convenience tools, including wrist temperature sensing for deeper insights in the Vitals app, retrospective ovulation estimates and an Always-On display. It also supports double-tap and wrist flick gestures, plus on-device Siri. Available in two colors, the SE 3 carries forward Apple's strategy of making core health features more accessible.",
      "Apple Watch Ultra 3 debuts with the largest and brightest display ever on a Watch. (Apple)",
      "At the top end, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Ultra 3, starting at $799 and shipping September 19. This model pushes the limits of durability and outdoor performance. The Ultra 3 features the largest and brightest display ever put on an Apple Watch, making it easier to read data during workouts or in direct sunlight.",
      "It includes a redesigned radio and antenna system capable of connecting with satellites orbiting 800 miles above Earth. That means users can send messages or use Find My features even without cell service, making it a true companion for extreme adventures.",
      "The Ultra 3 packs a larger battery that runs up to 42 hours on a single charge. With Low Power Mode enabled, Apple says the battery can extend to as much as 72 hours, making it the longest-lasting Apple Watch to date. It also introduces new Workout Buddy tools for training and enhanced hypertension notifications, further pushing Apple's reputation in health tech. Available in black or natural titanium, the Ultra 3 blends rugged design with cutting-edge features.",
      "iPhone 17 accessories: small add-ons with big impact",
      "Apple showcased new accessories for its iPhones, including a low-profile MagSafe battery pack. (Apple)",
      "Apple used the event to highlight a series of accessories that show how the company expects people to use its new iPhones. The most talked about was the\u00a0low-profile MagSafe battery pack, created to address the iPhone 17 Air's biggest weakness: vague \"all-day\" battery claims. When attached, the Air can stretch to 40 hours of video playback, turning what could have been a limitation into a selling point for Apple's ecosystem.",
      "To complement the Air's slim profile, Apple also revealed a\u00a0new translucent case and a\u00a0lightweight bumper. The translucent case keeps the 5.6mm design visible while still protecting it, while the bumper adds shock resistance around the edges without adding bulk. Both aim to reassure buyers who worry that the thinnest iPhone yet might be more fragile.",
      "For the Pro and Pro Max models, Apple introduced\u00a0TechWoven cases made from a durable fabric blend. What stood out was the addition of an\u00a0optional cross-body strap, giving users a hands-free way to carry their phones. Apple leaned into the idea of the iPhone as not just a device but also a lifestyle accessory that blends technology with personal style.",
      "Together, the MagSafe battery, translucent Air case, protective bumper and fashion-forward TechWoven cases with cross-body straps showed Apple's strategy clearly. Accessories are no longer secondary; they are central to how Apple expects customers to protect, power and personalize their iPhones.",

Icon's builds include entire neighborhoods of single-story houses in Austin, as well as experimental multi-level projects. However, most of Icon's multi-story designs rely on a hybrid approach, with 3D printing for the ground floor and timber or steel frames for the upper levels.",
      "That's what makes the Tapping project stand out. Contec printed the structural walls for both stories in just 18 hours of active printing time, something not yet widely seen in the U.S. This could signal the next step for American 3D printing: scaling beyond single-story housing into more complex multi-story designs.",

Contec hasn't shared the exact cost of the Tapping home, but the company says it delivered the structural walls 22% cheaper than a standard masonry build. That saving adds up when you consider how much of a home's budget goes toward labor and materials.",
      "In the U.S., companies like Icon have priced 3D printed homes starting around $100,000 to $150,000, depending on size and finishes.

      "An Amazon package with a QR code. (Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Now the practice has shifted from harmless free items to deliberate fraud. Instead of receiving a product, many victims find only a printed QR code.

The lesson here is that a mystery package with a QR code is not some fun puzzle to figure out. It is a red flag. The safest move is to step back, resist the urge to scan and if something feels off, report it instead of interacting with it.",

      "Why it helps: Turning your router off for 30 seconds and back on helps clear out temporary issues and refreshes the connection. It's a simple fix that can solve slow Wi-Fi or connectivity problems.",
      "3) Keep your router updated for optimal performance",
      "Updating your router\u2019s software ensures you get the latest speed and security improvements.",
      "Why it helps: Router manufacturers often release updates that fix bugs and improve performance. Make sure your router\u2019s firmware is always up-to-date to get the most reliable connection.",

      "4) Limit the number of devices on your network",
      "Fewer devices connected to your Wi-Fi means more bandwidth for the devices that matter most.",
      "Why it helps: Each device connected to your network uses bandwidth. If multiple devices are hogging the connection (like smart TVs or game consoles), it can slow things down. Disconnect any unused devices to keep your Wi-Fi fast.",
      "From placing your router in the right spot to upgrading your hardware, these proven fixes can keep your internet running smoothly. (Wolf von Dewitz/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "5) Change your Wi-Fi channel or band",
      "If your neighbors are on the same Wi-Fi channel, switching to a less crowded one can help.",
      "Why it helps: Choosing a clearer channel or using the 5 GHz band instead of 2.4 GHz reduces interference and boosts your connection.",

      "7) Secure your network",

      "Why it helps: Using strong passwords and WPA3 or WPA2 encryption prevents freeloaders from connecting and using your bandwidth. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.",

      "Your devices may run apps or updates in the background that eat up bandwidth.",
      "Why it helps: Streaming updates, cloud backups or large downloads can slow your Wi-Fi for everyone. Pausing them during peak times frees up bandwidth for the things you actually want to do.",
      "10) Upgrade your router for faster speeds",
      "Old routers can slow you down. Upgrading to a newer model can provide a significant speed boost.",
      "Why it helps: Newer routers support faster speeds and more devices, which is essential if your home has multiple users streaming, working or gaming at the same time. The FBI recently alerted that hackers are actively targeting outdated routers, so make sure yours is updated and secure.",

      "6 ways to protect your Wi-Fi router from hackers",
      "Keeping your home network secure is essential to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Follow these steps to safeguard your Wi-Fi router:",
      "Most routers come with default passwords that hackers can easily find online. To secure your router, change both the admin password (used to access settings) and the Wi-Fi network password. Use a strong password with at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid simple options like \"password123\" or personal details such as your name or birth date.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "The default network name, or SSID, often includes the router's brand or model, making it easier for hackers to identify vulnerabilities. Rename your network to something unique that doesn't reveal personal information. Avoid using names, addresses or other identifiers. Instead, opt for a neutral or creative name that's easy for you to recognize but hard for others to associate with you.",
      "Router manufacturers release firmware updates to patch security flaws and enhance performance. Check your router's admin panel regularly for updates or enable automatic updates, if supported. Keeping your firmware up to date ensures you're protected against the latest threats. If your router is too old to receive updates, it might be time to upgrade to a newer, more secure model.",
      "Unauthorized devices on your network can slow it down and expose you to risks. Log into your router's admin settings to view all connected devices. If you see anything suspicious, disconnect it and immediately change your Wi-Fi password. You can also enable MAC address filtering to control which devices can access your network or disable features like WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) that may leave you vulnerable.",
      "Use the strongest encryption protocol available for your router, preferably WPA3 or at least WPA2. Encryption scrambles the data transmitted over your network, making it much harder for hackers to intercept and decipher your information.",
      "Schedule routine reboots to clear the system memory and refresh all connections, which may disrupt potential malware.",
      "A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, making it much harder for hackers to intercept your data. This protection works anywhere, whether you're at home, in a coffee shop or on public Wi-Fi. Choose a reputable VPN provider with a no-logs policy and strong encryption standards to keep your information private.",
      "For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "To further protect your devices from malware and other threats, consider using reputable antivirus software. Antivirus programs can detect and remove malicious software, provide real-time protection and alert you to potential threats. Keeping your devices secure helps ensure your entire network remains safe from cyberattacks.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

    "story": [
      "The suspect accused of fatally shooting conservative activist Charlie Kirk left behind ammunition engraved with a reference to fascism and obscure internet memes and video games, officials said Friday.",
      "Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said inscriptions were found on at least four shell casings linked to Tyler Robinson, 22, who was arrested early Friday in connection with the killing. One engraving read, \u201cHey fascist! Catch! \u2191 \u2192 \u2193\u2193\u2193,\u201d a seeming reference, at least in part, to a video game that's been interpreted as a satire of fascism.",
      "Authorities said the rounds were found with a Mauser Model 98 bolt-action rifle, fitted with a scope, that investigators recovered in a wooded area on the edge of Utah Valley University\u2019s campus. The gun was wrapped in a dark-colored towel.",
      "In addition to the engraving referencing fascists, Cox also referred to engravings that contained more obscure references.",
      "On the fired casing, for instance, a message read: \u201cnotices, bulges, OWO, what\u2019s this?\u201d",
      "The writing appears to be a reference to a meme about the online furry subculture and online role-play, said Jamie Cohen, an assistant professor of media studies at Queens College who researches memes. The meme has largely been used as a method of mockery and trolling, though its relevance to Kirk or the shooting is unclear.",
      "Experts urged caution in interpreting the engravings, citing a long history of shooters using misleading or ironic messages, often mixing politics and internet culture in ways that defy easy categorization.",
      "Cohen said he believes the messages on most of the recovered rounds were left purposely vague by a person who is \u201cextremely online.\u201d",
      "The suspect may have specifically used terms that are difficult to decipher \u201cto remain in the undercurrent of the internet,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThis type of meme is designed specifically to kind of make sure that the news can\u2019t report on it because it comes from an extremely online approach,\u201d he said.",
      "Bond Benton, a Montclair State University professor who studies social media, branding, popular culture and online hate groups, said the memes come off as incoherent to most people but are embraced by those in niche online spaces.",
      "\u201cThis sort of messaging could be sort of a wink to those people because notoriety, being the most talked about in that space, is really, really valuable to members that are of these communities,\u201d he said.",
      "Lindsay Hahn, a University at Buffalo associate professor who researches ideological extremism and the ways in which perpetrators of violence justify their actions, said the suspect was likely seeking fame.",
      "His messages, she said, do not necessarily indicate a specific ideology. \u201cBut what they do indicate,\u201d she said, \u201cis that the shooter wanted to get a message across and therefore be talked about online.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt sort of seems like these messages, at the very minimum, were selected because he knew they were going to be talked about,\u201d Hahn added.",
      "At the Friday-morning news conference, when asked by a reporter what the messages meant, Cox said: \u201cI will leave that up to you to interpret what those engravings mean.\u201d",
      "The governor said the one referring to fascists \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d",
      "That particular unfired casing was also inscribed with additional symbols \u2014 an up arrow, a right arrow and three down arrows. The order of directional arrow symbols is a code used in the hit video game Helldivers 2 to summon a bomb on the player\u2019s position.",
      "The video game challenges players to work together as an elite team of soldiers to save Earth by pushing back invading hordes of space bugs, cyborgs and robots. Last year, it reinvigorated a long-running debate about fascism and satire.",
      "Cox said another message read, \u201cOh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao ciao ciao.\u201d Cohen said this may be a reference to lyrics in a somewhat controversial Italian song that is anti-fascist in nature.",
      "A fourth casing appeared simply to mock investigators. \u201cIf you read this, you are gay LMAO,\u201d it read, using a well-known abbreviation for \u201claughing my a-- off.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not clear what political perspectives Robinson held from other publicly available materials. In 2021, Robinson registered to vote with no party affiliation. Photos posted by Robinson\u2019s mother on Facebook show him dressed up in a Halloween costume in 2017 riding on Trump\u2019s shoulders.",
      "Robinson joins a long list of shooting suspects from the last decade who have referenced memes, online subcultures and video games in their writings. Some have been explicit in their ideological messaging, while others have engaged in the online practice of trolling, using sarcasm and deliberately confusing references that make their ideologies hard to interpret.",
      "The texts of many shooters who have been radicalized online are highly referential to each other.",
      "The person who killed 51 people at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, left behind writings that mixed political ideologies with memes and jokes attributing his radicalization to child video games. Another portion of the writings credited Candace Owens with his radicalization, which has widely been interpreted as satire. The gunman in a 2022 Buffalo, New York, mass shooting mixed racist memes with racist ideology, like the \u201cgreat replacement theory,\u201d and also plagiarized materials from other writings of mass shooters, making the line between his views and the views of others blurry.",
      "In August, the suspect in a Minneapolis Catholic school shooting left a video referencing a hodgepodge of political messages and memes, from \u201crelease the files!\u201d to skibidi toilet, that don\u2019t appear to represent a coherent ideology.",
      "\u201cOftentimes this extremely online disguise is meant to be doublespeak,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cIt\u2019s meant specifically for someone like me to dive into what they would call meme culture and declare them something so that they get more press. So it could just be another bait and switch for researchers who are falling into the same trap that they are designing for more viral exposure.\u201d",
      "Similarly, the practice of writing on ammunition and weaponry has also become a theme among shooters.",
      "Officials say the person accused of shooting and killing a health care CEO in Manhattan appeared to have left an explicit reference \u2014 \u201cdeny,\u201d \u201cdefend\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d \u2014 to a 2010 book that was critical of the health insurance industry on the ammunition used to kill the CEO of UnitedHealth Group.",
      "Robinson was detained Thursday night, FBI Director Kash Patel said. Cox said one of the suspect\u2019s family members reached out to a family friend Thursday night, who then contacted the Washington County Sheriff\u2019s Office with information that Robinson had either confessed or implied that he had carried out the shooting.",
      "Investigators interviewed a member of the suspect\u2019s family, who said he had become more political in recent years, according to Cox. The person said Robinson recently told them that Kirk was coming to UVU and the pair discussed how they didn\u2019t like Kirk and the viewpoints he held.",
      "Robinson has not yet been charged. He is expected to be charged with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury and obstruction of justice, according to a probable cause affidavit."

      "At least a dozen faculty and staff, from school board officials to classroom teachers, have been met with fallout over insensitive posts about Kirk\u2019s death. In at least two instances, universities fired staff members entirely for posts deemed inappropriate.",
      "Many other educators have been suspended or are under investigation, and the number is likely to grow as conservative online influencers share screenshots.",
      "At East Tennessee State University, two faculty members have been placed on administrative leave pending further review, school spokesperson Jess Vodden said. Complaints sent to the university included screenshots of Facebook comments, according to copies the school shared with NBC News, that one faculty member allegedly made in response to Kirk\u2019s death, including \u201cyou reap what you sow.\u201d Another allegedly wrote, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a tragedy. It\u2019s a victory.\u201d",
      "Vodden said the university had received \u201cnumerous complaints\u201d about the posts. \u201cBecause this is a personnel issue, we cannot offer further comment at this time,\u201d she said.",
      "Middle Tennessee State University fired a staff member, according to a statement shared Wednesday by President Sidney McPhee.",

      "\u201cIt has been brought to my attention that some Florida educators have posted despicable comments on social media regarding the horrific assassination of Charlie Kirk,\u201d said the memo, signed by Florida education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas. \u201cI will be conducting an investigation of every educator who engages in this vile, sanctionable behavior.\u201d",
      "Oklahoma\u2019s state superintendent, Ryan Walters, similarly promised to investigate teachers making incendiary comments on social media about Kirk\u2019s death, and he confirmed his department is investigating one middle school educator called out on X.",
      "Kirk, the 31-year-old co-founder of conservative activist organization Turning Point USA, was killed Wednesday during an event at Utah Valley University, a public school south of Salt Lake City. Officials on Friday identified a 22-year-old Utah resident, now in custody, as the suspect in the shooting.",
      "Kirk was shot and killed during one of his regular events on college campuses hosted by Turning Point USA. The organization grew since 2012 to claim over 800 college campus chapters and 1,000 high school clubs, and it is credited with helping Donald Trump win a higher share of young voters.",
      "Kirk was known for taking contentious stances, including the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen and comments he made about Black people, the LGBTQ community, feminism, and immigration.",
      "Turning Point USA hosts a \u201cProfessor Watchlist\u201d and \u201cSchool Board Watchlist,\u201d websites that called out faculty and school board members, respectively, over allegedly promoting far-left ideology. The sites have faced criticism.",
      "In recent years, right-wing activists have followed in the group\u2019s footsteps of pinpointing academics and teachers over comments they make in classes or online. And in the two days since Kirk\u2019s death, they\u2019ve circulated examples of school and university employees celebrating or making light of his death, often tagging the district or college where they work.",
      "University of Mississippi Chancellor Glenn Boyce said in a statement on X that a staff member was let go due to comments the individual had \u201cre-shared\u201d on social media. The school did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for further details.",
      "\u201cThese comments run completely counter to our institutional values of civility, fairness, and respecting the dignity of each person,\u201d Boyce wrote Thursday. \u201cWe condemn these actions, and this staff member is no longer employed by the university.\u201d",
      "Several K-12 school staff from Mariposa, California, to Orange Park, Florida, have also been placed on leave as school officials investigate social media posts, according to multiple reports. The school board in Oskaloosa, Iowa, plans to consider one teacher\u2019s employment at the next school board meeting, after they allegedly posted, \u201c1 Nazi down,\u201d regarding Kirk\u2019s killing.",
      "At Newport News Public Schools in Virginia, an unidentified staff member was suspended after allegedly writing on Facebook, \u201cI hope he suffered through all of it,\u201d in regard to Kirk\u2019s death, according to NBC affiliate WAVY of Portsmouth.",
      "\u201cGiven that employees have a unique responsibility to serve as role models, leaders, and caretakers for students in the school division, certain behaviors are deemed inconsistent with employment in the division,\u201d Robert C.

    "story": [
      "A stew of hypertoxic rhetoric has surged through social media and American discourse after the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, inflaming a political environment that was already deeply polarized.",
      "The most concerning messages, experts told NBC News, are proclamations from far-right activists, Republican politicians and conservative influencers about a coming civil war and the need for retribution or payback against the left for Kirk\u2019s killing. The phrase \u201ccivil war\u201d has spiked on social media and in Google searches.",
      "\u201cThe Left is the party of murder,\u201d Elon Musk posted on X to his 226 million followers, shortly after the shooting and before the gunman\u2019s identity was known. He separately posted, \u201cIf they won\u2019t leave us in peace, then our choice is fight or die,\u201d without saying who \u201cthey\u201d were.",
      "While there had not been any known acts of violence connected to the Kirk killing as of Friday afternoon, the shooting sent a wave of fear across much of the U.S. political landscape. Many politicians are adding security in response to an uptick in death threats, and some canceled events and said they would be holding off on public appearances. The Democratic National Committee headquarters received bomb threats on Thursday and Friday, which authorities said turned out not to be credible.",
      "On Friday, authorities said they arrested Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old Utah resident, in connection with Kirk\u2019s killing. Authorities also said he left behind bullet casings engraved with messages that included \u201cHey fascist! Catch! \u2191\u2192\u2193\u2193\u2193\u201d in an apparent reference to a video game, among other references to obscure internet memes.",
      "Hours after Robinson\u2019s arrest, with his motive still unclear, former Trump adviser and right-wing podcaster Steve Bannon called for mass arrests and for taking a \u201cblowtorch\u201d to colleges and universities.",
      "A spokesperson for Bannon responded to NBC News\u2019 request for comment with an expletive. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The inflammatory language took off on Wednesday, immediately after the shooting. On social media platforms such as X, Truth Social and TikTok, as well as on Fox News, some personalities called for national law enforcement to target Democrats. Others compared Democrats to animals, demanded National Guard troops in more cities, declared themselves to have been \u201cradicalized,\u201d called for other forms of vengeance and repeatedly invoked the language of war as they reacted to Kirk\u2019s killing.",
      "The rush to judgment about the shooter\u2019s motives, before a suspect was identified, went all the way up to President Donald Trump. In an Oval Office address on Wednesday evening, he blamed \u201cradical left\u201d rhetoric and said his administration would pursue anyone whose language he believes may have contributed to Kirk\u2019s killing.",
      "\u201cThis kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we\u2019re seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMy administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence including the organizations that fund it and support it.\u201d",
      "Other Republican politicians also pointed the finger at the left for the incident. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., echoed \u201cwar\u201d rhetoric percolating on the far right after the incident: \u201cThe left and their policies are leading America into a civil war. They want it,\u201d he wrote in one X post, adding: \u201cThe gloves are off.\u201d Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., wrote on X. \u201cEVERY DAMN ONE OF YOU WHO CALLED US FASCISTS DID THIS,\u201d she added. \u201cYOU ARE THE HATE you claim to fight. Your words caused this. Your hate caused this.\u201d Neither of their offices responded to requests for comment.",
      "High-profile influencers on the right pushed similar rhetoric. Libs of TikTok, an account on X with more than 4 million followers, posted, \u201cTHIS IS WAR.\u201d Enrique Tarrio, the onetime Proud Boys leader who was sentenced to 22 years in prison for seditious conspiracy related to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack and then granted clemency this year by Trump, posted on X: \u201cI\u2019m labeling half the country murderers because that\u2019s exactly what they are.\u201d And he shared a post from another user who said: \u201cFOR THE LIBS, WE\u2019RE COMING FOR YOU!!! ITS WAR!!\u201d",
      "In an interview with NBC News on Thursday, Tarrio said that although he believed the country is deeply divided, he did not support an actual civil war, mass arrests or other violence against political opponents. Instead, he said he would pursue other tactics against social media users who were celebrating Kirk\u2019s death \u2014 including trying to get them fired from their jobs or publicly shamed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always been an advocate against cancel culture, but at this point, fighting dirty is the only way to win, you know?\u201d Tarrio said.",
      "Others on the right also highlighted comments from the left celebrating Kirk\u2019s death, with some companies firing staffers who had been found to have posted insensitive statements online. MSNBC commentator Matthew Dowd was fired from the network after he said that Kirk pushed hate speech, and that \u201chateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions.\u201d In a statement on Bluesky on Wednesday afternoon, Dowd said he did not intend to blame Kirk for the shooting. (NBCUniversal is the parent company of MSNBC and NBC News.)",
      "A website seeking to collect examples of people celebrating Kirk\u2019s killing in order to get them fired from their jobs sprung up quickly, and by Friday, it said it had received more than 20,000 submissions. \u201cThis is the largest firing operation in history,\u201d the website stated.",
      "A.J. Bauer, an assistant professor of journalism at the University of Alabama who studies conservative media, said such language threatens to inflame a nation on the edge because some people on the far right may interpret it as permission to carry out attacks on those they perceive as disloyal.",
      "\u201cIn my view, this increases the likelihood of vigilante violence against people who are not supporters of the right,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very dangerous time to not be an ardent supporter of right-wing politics in the United States.\u201d",
      "Kirk emerged in recent years as one of the leading voices of a Republican Party reshaped by Trump. Kirk built a massive audience through a willingness to argue extreme and provocative positions online and in frequent on-campus appearances. Kirk has called a trans person \u201can abomination to God,\u201d said prominent Black women including Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson had taken white people\u2019s jobs and \u201cdo not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously,\u201d and that the U.S. \u201cmade a huge mistake when we passed the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s.\u201d His political arm, Turning Point Action, participated in \u201cStop the Steal\u201d efforts after Trump lost the 2020 election, and he continued defending Trump\u2019s post-election strategy at least through 2023, calling the 2020 election \u201crigged,\u201d though Kirk last year began to back off Trump\u2019s stolen-election claims.",
      "Kirk also encouraged open debate, once saying, \u201cWhen people stop talking that\u2019s when you get violence.\u201d",
      "Some conservatives closely identified with him speaking his mind and hailed his strategy of reaching out to college students. Those on the left found many of his positions polarizing and deeply offensive.",
      "The response to Kirk\u2019s death is playing out in a fractured media environment where people across the political spectrum have grasped for explanations. Polling has found increasing gaps between the left and right, particularly on hot-button issues such as diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, leaving even local leaders to struggle against the negative effects of polarization. Those divisions have been routinely stoked by U.S. rivals, most notably Russia.",
      "Fox News host Jesse Watters asserted in a broadcast hours after the killing that a war was already in progress: \u201cThey are at war with us. Whether we want to accept it or not, they are at war with us. And what are we going to do about it?\u201d He did not say specifically who \u201cthey\u201d were.",
      "Watters went on to warn \u201crats\u201d about their language.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s accountable, and we\u2019re watching what they\u2019re saying on television and who\u2019s saying what: the politicians, the media and all these rats out there. This can never happen again,\u201d he said. Fox News also did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "As the right trumpeted retribution, some on the left showed little sympathy for Kirk and implied that his own rhetoric had led to his killing.",
      "Hasan Piker, a leftist streamer on Twitch with 2.9 million followers, expressed horror at the killing, but also partly blamed Kirk for his own death. \u201cHe has played a formative role in his own demise by playing a part in a media landscape, in a media environment, that normalizes this death and destruction,\u201d he said on a livestream shortly after the shooting. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Aside from Piker, though, such comments were generally limited to accounts with small followings and did not come from people with platforms as large as Musk\u2019s or Bannon\u2019s. High-profile Democrats condemned political violence, with some seeking to draw a distinction between their reaction and how conservatives responded when people on the left have been targeted with political violence.",
      "Daniel Karell, an assistant professor of sociology at Yale University who has studied the relationship between online rhetoric and real-world action, said it matters that powerful figures such as Musk are pushing warlike rhetoric in a crowded media ecosystem.",
      "\u201cWhen it\u2019s an elite figure or somebody with standing or respect or status in a group, they have a greater effect on realigning norms or standards or persuading people than just a random person from that group,\u201d he said.",
      "The rise of social media, where engaging content is algorithmically incentivized, has given extreme statements greater prominence. Some of the posts calling for civil war received millions of views on X, the platform that Musk owns.",
      "\u201cConsidering the volume of extreme speech online, it\u2019s almost surprising how rare these events are,\u201d Karell said."

    "story": [
      "At a news conference in the days after the assassination of Charlie Kirk in Utah, Gov. Spencer Cox took to the podium to deliver updates about the case \u2014 and to urge Americans to find a way, together, out of this dark moment.",
      "\"There is one person responsible for what happened here, and that person is now in custody and will be charged soon and will be held accountable,\" Cox said. \"And yet, all of us have an opportunity right now to do something different.\"",
      "\"We can always point the finger at the other side,\" Cox added later, \"and at some point we have to find an off-ramp, or it's going to get much, much worse.\"",
      "Kirk's assassination has sparked national mourning but also vitriol, with some Republican leaders including President Donald Trump blaming the \"radical left\" for the shooting.",
      "But Cox has stepped forward as healer-in-chief.",
      "In days filled with division, disparagement and calls for revenge by some other politicians and public figures, Cox\u2019s civil but sober tone brought moral clarity to a moment of angst and broke through the rancor, members of both parties said in interviews.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s who he is,\u201d said Lincoln Shurtz, a partner at Utah-based lobbying firm Lincoln Hill Holdings who has known Cox, a Republican, for two decades. \u201cHe thinks we can disagree but still collaborate on things we do disagree on.\u201d",
      "After the 31-year-old Kirk was shot and killed at a public event on a college campus in his state, Cox stepped into the lead role in televised news conferences during and after the ensuing manhunt. He commanded the stage as top national law enforcement officials like FBI Director Kash Patel looked on.",
      "In addition to providing updates on the case, Cox used his speaking time to urge Americans to look in the mirror and seek their better angels. He told them to shut off their social media, which he referred to as a \u201ccancer,\u201d and instead hug a family member and \u201ctouch grass.\u201d",
      "\u201cYour generation has an opportunity to build a culture very different than what we are suffering through right now, not by pretending differences don\u2019t matter, but by embracing our differences and having those hard conversations,\u201d Cox said, directing his remarks to younger people.",
      "\u201cI hear all the time that words are violence, words are not violence,\u201d Cox added. \u201cViolence is violence.\u201d",
      "Even as Trump took on a sharp-edged approach in the immediacy after Kirk's death, it was notable that no one from the White House or law enforcement moved to diminish Cox\u2019s role, allowing lengthy remarks each day, even as they clashed with aspects of Trump\u2019s message. A senior White House official told NBC News they felt Cox has done a \u201ctremendously good job\u201d handling the aftermath of Kirk\u2019s killing.",
      "Members of both parties have offered accolades for Cox, saying he offered refreshing ideas as the nation\u2019s political discourse has turned increasingly toxic. That included Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat and friend of Cox who spoke to the Utah governor by phone after the tragedy and told NBC News they share some important values.",
      "\u201cI pray for Governor Cox as he leads his state following a heinous act of political violence. Even though we belong to different parties, he and I share a common vision for this country \u2014 one where we resolve our differences peacefully at the ballot box and strive to work together, regardless of ideology,\u201d Moore said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cI know he will do everything in his power to bring leadership, comfort, unity, and justice in this moment, as we seek healing.\u201d",
      "Cox has had an evolving relationship with Trump. He endorsed Marco Rubio during the 2016 presidential race, when Cox was Utah's lieutenant governor, and then backed Ted Cruz when Rubio dropped out. At the time, Cox criticized Trump\u2019s \u201cdecorum.\u201d",
      "Cox has said he did not vote for Trump in either of his first two campaigns, but he did support the president in 2024.",
      "Cox has long sought opportunities to inject a bipartisan approach into politics, including launching an ad campaign in 2020 in which he and his Democratic opponent for governor both agreed they'd accept the results of the 2020 presidential election. He has partnered with Sen. Chris Murphy to tackle social issues like the loneliness epidemic and social media's impact on children. He also launched a \"disagree better\" campaign that aimed to keep opposing sides talking to each other.",
      "Through it all, he remained politically popular in his state. In July, Morning Consult polling found that he had a 54% approval rating among all registered voters in Utah, a number that jumped to 74% with the state\u2019s Republicans.",
      "Cox is broadly viewed as a consistent Republican, but has done things that have angered the party\u2019s right flank.",
      "Most notably, Cox vetoed legislation in 2022 that banned transgender students from playing girls\u2019 sports, saying that he wanted to be on the side of acceptance. He cited statistics showing that out of 75,000 high school students participating in athletics, just one was a transgender student who played girls sports.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t understand what they are going through or why they feel the way they do,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cBut I want them to live. And all the research shows that even a little acceptance and connection can reduce suicidality significantly.\u201d",
      "The veto was later overturned by the Utah's Republican-dominated state legislature.",
      "Those kinds of positions have created pockets of conservative opposition to Cox, even though he is generally well-regarded in his party.",
      "\u201cThrough the national lens, Spencer Cox is a conservative Republican, but in Utah politics it would put him within the party he is in on the moderate side,\u201d Shurtz said. \u201cAmong Republicans in the state he is seen as widely successful and well-supported. But there are factions in the base that feel like he is maybe not as forceful on, and \u2014 these are my words \u2014 fringe issues.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s when the governor does stuff like he did today,\u201d he added of Cox\u2019s unifying tone. \u201cThere are some folks on the right who don\u2019t like that. Their answer is always \u2018go kick them in the teeth.\u2019\u201d",
      "In that vein, Steve Bannon, a conservative commentator and an architect of Trump\u2019s first run for office, expressed anger and disappointment at Cox on Friday, calling him \u201cwoke\u201d and a \u201cgovernor who\u2019s also known to be, I think, particularly obnoxious.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t need a governor, a political figure, to step up \u2026 and give us a political pep talk and a rally and \u2018let\u2019s all come together,\u2019\u201d Bannon said on his War Room podcast on Friday, saying that Kirk was killed \u201cin cold blood.\u201d",
      "Still, there is some hunger in the Republican Party for a leader who doesn\u2019t stoke anger.",
      "\u201cA leader should be seeking unity, not retribution,\u201d former Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said in an interview before Cox\u2019s appearance at the Friday morning news conference. \u201cAnd it\u2019s unity in opposing all political violence. It\u2019s a tragic situation. But out of the tragedy comes an opportunity to make this point clearly on both sides: We need to change the trajectory.\u201d",
      "Portman, who after retiring from the Senate in 2022 launched a center at the University of Cincinnati that focuses on finding civility and common ground in government, said Trump\u2019s initial response to the crisis might have been colored by the \u201cpersonal anguish and sorrow\u201d of losing a friend.",
      "Democrats also chimed in to praise Cox\u2019s remarks.",
      "\u201cI know this guy is a Republican and all but I swear you could win all the electoral votes with this message in 28,\u201d said Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii.",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said he appreciated Cox \u201ccalling for moral clarity at a time of uncertainty.\u201d",
      "And Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro reached out to Cox to offer any assistance he could, a person familiar with their conversation said.",
      "\u201cI think his words have been healing,\u201d Shapiro told CBS News. \u201cI think you can contrast not just with the president\u2019s words, but with some of the dangerous rhetoric that we\u2019ve seen online, the dangerous rhetoric we\u2019ve seen some from some elected leaders.\u201d"

    "summary": "Tax credits made Affordable Care Act plans accessible to middle-class families. Enhanced subsidies are set to expire at the end of 2025, which could result in major price jumps.",
    "story": [
      "Leighanne Safford and her husband, Lorry, pay just $278 a month for health insurance. But starting Jan. 1, their monthly premium could jump to as much as $1,800.",
      "Safford\u2019s family is among the millions who could be forced to pay hundreds of dollars more for their health insurance premiums next year as enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies expire at the end of December.",
      "The enhanced subsidies were put into place under the 2021 American Rescue Plan, which made ACA plans affordable for many middle-class families. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 extended the subsidies through 2025.",
      "The Republican-controlled Congress, however, didn\u2019t extend the subsidies in either of the two major funding bills passed so far this year. It\u2019s uncertain whether Republicans will extend them later this month in a bill to keep the government funded.",
      "For Safford, the effect could be compounded by rollbacks to Medicaid expansion in President Donald Trump\u2019s sprawling legislative bill signed into law over the summer. She fears her 13-year-old son, Adam, could lose his Medicaid coverage, so the family is also planning to pay for his health insurance in 2026.",
      "Safford said they can\u2019t afford the $1,800 monthly premium \u2014 which only accounts for coverage for her and her husband \u2014 without cutting back on essentials like food or dental care. So instead, they\u2019re looking to switch to a cheaper, high-deductible plan that would cover the entire family. The trade-off: While the monthly premiums are typically lower, they\u2019d have to shoulder higher out-of-pocket costs before coverage kicks in.",
      "\u201cRight now, we\u2019re making a decision based on the three of us being relatively healthy,\u201d Safford said. \u201cBut I mean, as we all know, with health, that could change any day.\u201d",
      "More than 24 million people got their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act in 2025, according to data from the health policy research group KFF. Of those, more than 9 in 10  \u2014 22.3 million people \u2014 qualified for the enhanced subsidies. (That figure includes people who also qualify for the ACA\u2019s standard subsidies for very low incomes, which went into effect in 2014 and are expected to continue.)",
      "In Mississippi, Florida, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Utah and Alabama, at least 96% of ACA enrollees received enhanced subsidies. New Hampshire and Washington state had the lowest rates, at 71% and 73%, respectively.",
      "If the enhanced subsidies expire, nearly 4 million people are projected to go without coverage in 2026 because they won\u2019t be able to afford the premiums, according to a 2024 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency that advises Congress on budget and economic issues. That number is expected to balloon to almost 7 million people by 2034.",
      "If Congress doesn\u2019t act, \u201cmillions of people will become uninsured,\u201d said Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy. \u201cWithout these subsidies, it\u2019ll be much more costly.\u201d",
      "A double whammy",
      "Open enrollment for next year\u2019s ACA plans begins Nov. 1.",
      "But for many families, the \u201csticker shock\u201d will come in October, when formal notices land in their mailboxes outlining next year\u2019s monthly premiums, said Jessica Altman, executive director of Covered California, a state-based marketplace for ACA coverage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether that\u2019s someone who has cancer or a chronic condition who knows that they need it, or someone who thinks, \u2018I may just have to go without and just cross my fingers.\u2019\u201d",
      "In Sacramento County, Altman said as an example, a family of four earning $113,000 a year could see its monthly premium jump by about $1,550 if the government subsidies expire, compared to just $112 if subsidies remain.",
      "On top of the subsidies expiring, states must also factor in expected premium hikes from insurers next year.",
      "It\u2019s \u201ca double whammy of premiums going up and then tax credits potentially going down,\u201d Altman said. A report from KFF found that insurers that offer ACA plans are planning an average premium increase of around 18% across the U.S. for 2026. Combined with the loss of subsidies, people could pay an average of 75% more in premiums, according to KFF.",
      "People who still qualify for the standard ACA subsidies won\u2019t be spared, either, said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director of the program on the ACA at KFF. Without the enhanced subsidies, the amount the government pays toward their monthly premiums will shrink.",
      "\u201cThe effects are going to be pretty widespread,\u201d Cox said. \u201cPretty much everyone who buys their own health insurance is going to be affected by this one way or another.\u201d",
      "In Safford\u2019s home of Washington state, Dr. David Zonies said many of his patients will be directly affected. Zonies is the medical director at the University of Washington\u2019s Harborview Medical Center, a safety net hospital that in large part cares for Medicaid and ACA patients.",
      "The loss of the enhanced subsidies, along with the Medicaid cuts, means many patients will go uninsured and delay the care they need until it becomes much more serious, he said.",
      "\u201cThe greatest concern I have right now is the loss of these tax credits,\u201d Zonies said. \u201cWe anticipate that we\u2019re basically going to go back to what it looked like before the Affordable Care Act was passed, and that\u2019s going to be really devastating.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for AHIP, the main industry trade group that represents insurers, including those that sell ACA plans, did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "A fight to extend subsidies",
      "Park said it\u2019s still possible that Congress could extend the enhanced subsidies \u2014 either as part of a government funding package or a separate bill. The latest government spending bill expires on Sept. 30.",
      "\u201cIt is very difficult to predict,\u201d he said.",
      "Democrats have continued to advocate for extending the subsidies, and many Republicans remained opposed.",
      "But Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told NBC News earlier this month he is keeping the door open to a potential extension.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that, yeah, some of our members are paying attention to,\u201d Thune said, though he blamed Democrats for both expanding the size of the program and including phaseouts for the subsidies.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has been noncommittal on the issue, but he similarly kept the door open to a funding extension.",
      "Altman said Congress needs to figure out what it wants to do quickly, noting that an extension would provide not only \u201cpeace of mind\u201d for many families, but also security in their health care and economic freedom.",
      "A June report from KFF finds that 3 in 4 adults support extending the enhanced subsidies, including two-thirds of Republicans.",
      "Park said that the enhanced subsidies passed by Republicans, however, may not be the same as what the Democrats previously had in place.",
      "\u201cI do expect that if there is any congressional Republican willingness to negotiate on an extension of the enhanced credits, they may seek to reduce the generosity of the enhanced subsidies,\u201d he said.",
      "Cox said some families may decide to keep their coverage by making sacrifices to their household budgets, but most, like Safford\u2019s family, will likely transition to high-deductible plans. While people on these plans need to pay more out of pocket before coverage kicks in, the plans are designed to protect against huge medical bills that can be financially devastating.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s say that you end up getting hit by a bus, you get cancer or some really expensive medical treatment you need. That kind of plan would shelter you from those very, very high hospital costs,\u201d Cox said.",
      "Safford said she continues to \u201cknock on wood\u201d that the subsidies will be extended.",
      "\u201cIt would take away from our life\u201d if they aren\u2019t extended, she said."

      "Laura visits Daniel and drugs his drink. All she needs is a moment to play the recording, she says. That, of course, is not what happens.

      "Bibb spoke their origins during a 2012 interview with Rosie O\u2019Donnell. \u201cI just smiled and he smiled at me and I go, \u2018Oh no, what\u2019s that?\u2019 Sometimes you just get struck,\u201d she said.",
      "Just one week after their first greeting, Rockwell took Bibb out for a \u201cday date\u201d at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. But what Bibb didn\u2019t know was that Rockwell had another date lined up with someone else that evening.",
      "\u201cI had a plan B, yeah,\u201d he admitted during a 2025 visit to TODAY with Jenna & Friends. \u201c(Leslie) wanted to continue on into the night, because the day date went really well. ... So, I had to kind of figure out what to do.\u201d",
      "What he did was cancel that second date, thus kicking off a whirlwind romance. Bibb told O\u2019Donnell that three weeks after that museum outing, she\u2019d already told Rockwell, \u201cI love you so much.\u201d",

      "2018: An Oscar and a Sweet Mention",
      "Rockwell earned an Oscar for his supporting role in the crime drama \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u201d at the 90th Academy Awards. But when he took the stage, it was clear that he was thankful for much more than the golden statuette in his hands.",

      "2020: Building a (Fur) Family Together",
      "In February 2020, Rockwell and Bibb adopted a rescue dog together, a German Shepherd named Gus.",
      "Gus was actually the second dog to enter their household. Bibb had another pooch, named Sadie, since before her days dating Rockwell. Sadly, Sadie passed away shortly after Gus joined the family.",
      "As for starting a human family, Bibb has stated that she has no interest in it.",

      "2025: They Open Up About Not Being Married",
      "During that same visit to TODAY, Bibb addressed whether or not she would ever consider swapping vows with her partner of 18 years.",
      "\u201cListen, I love Sam Rockwell,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI would put him in my pocket and carry him with me all the time. I love him. I do not want to get married.\u201d",
      "Why? First, she explained that she already feels as if they are married. Then she added that saying \u201cI do\u201d simply isn\u2019t needed.",
      "\u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Bibb put it bluntly.",

      "The single-camera and interview style show became a hit, running for nine seasons before it concluded in 2013. It also won five Emmy Awards, including outstanding comedy series.",
      "Now, over a decade later, Daniels, along with Michael Koman (\u201cNathan For You\u201d), has returned with \u201cThe Paper,\u201d a spinoff that is set in the same universe but takes on a whole new crew of quirky characters \u2014 and one familiar face.",

As the years went by, viewers got to see office romances start, fizzle and more.",

      "Tatiana said she wasn\u2019t home when he was taken because she had been taken to the Russian commandant\u2019s office to write a statement about her mother, Rudenko Tamara, 53, who died in an attack the previous day. They wanted her to say \u201cthat Ukraine killed my mother,\u201d she said.",
      "On the call, Tatiana said, Vlad told her he was in the city of Olezhky and was \u201cgoing to Crimea to rest,\u201d which left her bewildered. \u201cAt that moment we just had a little fight,\u201d she added. \u201cI simply told him, \u2018How could you leave your family at such a difficult time?\u2019 I didn\u2019t know any details.\u201d",
      "Along with other parents, she only realized much later that Russian soldiers had been coaching children to say they were being evacuated from bombing and sent to summer camps.",
      "With fighting intense in Kherson, even after Russian forces were pushed out of the city in November 2022, Tatiana said that the month after the kidnapping, she decided to move west to the city of Mykolaiv.",
      "Together with her husband, Olexsandr, 43, who is also Vlad\u2019s stepfather, she left the city with her other five biological children, including baby Stefania, who was less than a year old at the time. NBC News agreed not to use Oleksandr\u2019s last name as he was called up to Ukraine\u2019s army in February 2023 and is still serving. Her sister and her cousin joined them as they made their way west to the city of Mykolaiv.",
      "Although Vlad\u2019s phone was routinely checked by his Russian captors, Tatiana said, she was able to keep in touch with her son through occasional text messages, but she \u201ctold him not to create problems.\u201d",
      "\u201cI said when you can, if you are there alone or no one is escorting you, then write,\u201d she said, adding that she was able to establish he was being held in a camp in Lazurne in southeast Ukraine.",
      "After a friend told her about Save Ukraine, Tatiana said, she reached out to the organization, which after several months of planning arranged for her to travel to Russia along with six other women whose children had been taken.",
      "With no direct route across the front lines, Tatiana said, she traveled through Poland, Belarus and Russia\u2019s capital, Moscow, before she was eventually able to travel to the camp via Crimea.",
      "No one from Save Ukraine accompanied the group, she said, but its representatives were in touch by phone and arranged for her to be put up by a volunteer in a temporary home.",
      "Although she was roughly searched by masked men on arrival, Tatiana said, things initially seemed to be going well. But on the second day, she said, agents from the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the KGB spy agency, came around, put a mask over her head and took her somewhere for questioning, after \u201cconfiscating my documents and my phone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey interrogated me, maybe six or seven hours,\u201d she said, adding that she was locked in a basement cell overnight before further questioning the following morning. Her interrogators were particularly interested in Save Ukraine, she said.",
      "They also brought a cameraman and a journalist, who she said expected her to say \u201chow great Russia is, how it helps us and how bad Ukraine is for us.\u201d",
      "While she was initially reluctant, she said, she was able to use Vlad\u2019s phone to consult with Save Ukraine via text message. Tatiana said the group told her: \u201cDo what is necessary, just for you to leave from there.\u201d",
      "The FSB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "After giving the interview on camera, she said, she was released with Vlad and allowed to make the arduous journey home.",
      "\u201cIt was just happiness after the horror. \u2026 I was simply amazed,\u201d Tatiana said.",
      "Kidnapped children are now spread out across approximately 200 locations from the Black Sea to Russia\u2019s Pacific coast, according to Nathaniel Raymond, the executive director of the Yale School of Public Health\u2019s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL), the leading body tracking kidnapped Ukrainian children.",
      "The group has monitored the movement of children by analyzing satellite photos and photographing airplanes and vehicles apparently used to transport the kids, among other techniques.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t all come from the same place. They don\u2019t all go to the same place. They don\u2019t all have the same purpose,\u201d Raymond said in a telephone interview last month.",
      "Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., have floated the possibility of introducing a bill in the Senate that, if passed, could designate Russia and Belarus as state sponsors of terrorism over the kidnapping of Ukrainian children, a source familiar with the bill told NBC News in mid-August. A draft of the bill says that Belarus \u201chas directly supported the kidnapping of Ukrainian children and supported their relocation.\u201d",
      "But both Save Ukraine and the HRL took a financial hit last spring after the Trump administration cut funding for their programs.",
      "As Russia pushes to take control of more Ukrainian territory, rescuing the Ukrainian children has become an even more urgent issue, experts say.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s all the more reason to get all the kids we can back before the door closes,\u201d Raymond said.",
      "\u201cNow is the decisive moment when America cannot allow itself to step back,\u201d added Kuleba, of Save Ukraine.",
      "As for Vlad, who is now 19, he said thinking about his family kept him going during his time in captivity, and he rushed to see his baby sister Stefania as soon as he got home.",
      "Now in Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, he is hoping to become a sports trainer.",
      "\u201cWhat helped me all the time was probably that I had family in Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I could return to Ukraine and build a normal future.",
      "Daryna Mayer reported from Kyiv and Babak Dehghanpisheh from New York."

      "The organizers of a Gaza aid flotilla said Tuesday that two of their boats had been attacked by drones in Tunisian waters.",
      "The Global Sumud Flotilla said Alma, a British-flagged boat in the civilian fleet, was hit by a drone while it was docked in the second such strike in two days. On Monday, the group said that one of its main boats, which is Portuguese-flagged, was also hit.",
      "Both incidents caused fire damage but no injuries, according to GSF.",
      "The attacks are an \u201corchestrated attempt to distract and derail\u201d the group\u2019s mission to deliver aid for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, GSF said in a statement, stressing that members were \u201cundeterred.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur peaceful voyage to break Israel\u2019s illegal siege on Gaza and stand in unwavering solidarity with its people presses forward with determination and resolve,\u201d it added.",
      "While a \u201cfull investigation\u201d is ongoing, Alma crew members have recovered a charred electronic device from the deck that further indicates the boat was \u201cdeliberately targeted,\u201d GSF said in a separate statement on Instagram.",
      "A spokesperson for the Tunisian Coast Guard did not respond to a call on the latest reported attack from Reuters on Wednesday.",
      "Officials earlier denied that the first boat had been attacked by a drone, saying the explosion came from inside the vessel. A National Guard spokesperson told local media that claims of the first drone attack on the flotilla \u201chave no basis in truth,\u201d Reuters reported Tuesday.",
      "With around 20 boats and participants from 44 countries, including activist Greta Thunberg, the group is the largest civilian maritime attempt to break the Israeli blockade of the Palestinian territory.",
      "Miguel Duarte, a crew member, said the suspected drone stopped close to the flotilla, moved slowly to the front and then dropped \u201cwhat was obviously a bomb\u201d on the forward part of the deck.",
      "\u201cLet me be clear 100%. It was a drone dropping a bomb on the forward deck of our ship,\u201d Duarte said when he was asked whether the team was \u201cabsolutely certain that this was a drone attack,\u201d a video he posted on Instagram shows.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m OK, but we could have been killed, right?\u201d Duarte said, citing the deaths during the Israel-Hamas war of humanitarian and medical workers.",
      "\u201cWe know the dangers that we\u2019re facing,\u201d he said.",
      "After the explosion, crew members repeatedly yelled for help and sounded the fire alarm, according to a CCTV video shared by Francesca Albanese, the U.N. special rapporteur for the West Bank and Gaza.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s confirmed that this is a drone attack, it will be an assault and aggression against Tunisia and against Tunisian sovereignty,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cAnd again, we cannot keep on tolerating this and normalizing the illegal.\u201d",
      "Demonstrators gathered at the port of Tunis around 2 a.m. local time (10 p.m. Monday ET), some waving Palestinian and Turkish flags and chanting \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d according to a video reposted by GSF.",
      "In 2010, Israeli forces stormed a Turkish aid ship bound for Gaza and killed at least nine pro-Palestinian activists, sparking global outrage.",
      "In June, Israel intercepted a vessel of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla and detained all 12 people on board, including Thunberg.",
      "Starvation deaths in Gaza surged after Israel\u2019s blockade in March, and aid was resumed in May under a system backed by the United States and Israel. Since then, nearly 1,400 people have died and 4,000 more have been injured seeking food, with at least 859 killed near aid sites, the United Nations says."

      "\u201cAttacking our territories while we were busy with negotiations has uncovered the intention of Israel. It is trying to undermine any prospect of peace.

      "While more than 300 South Korean nationals were finally on the way home Thursday, these images had already left a searing impression in this key U.S. ally.

      "The issue has also highlighted a long-standing South Korean concern: the murky rules surrounding work visas. The government is seeking improvements to the U.S. visa system, which presents challenges to companies that send skilled workers on a temporary basis to help set up factories and train Americans.",

      "Hundreds of South Korean nationals arrested in an immigration raid last week were en route to the airport in Atlanta where they will leave for Seoul later Thursday, the South Korean foreign ministry said, after their flight was previously delayed on what the ministry said were orders from President Donald Trump.",
      "More than 300 South Koreans \u2014 307 men and 10 women \u2014 were detained in the Sept. 4 raid on a Hyundai plant in Georgia, the ministry said, one of whom has decided to remain in the U.S. rather than agree to \u201cvoluntary departure.\u201d The 316 others will be on the flight to Seoul, along with 14 employees of South Korean companies from other Asian countries: 10 from China, three from Japan and one from Indonesia.",
      "The workers were released from the Folkston ICE Processing Center in rural Georgia at 2:18 a.m. ET, the foreign ministry said, and were being driven several hours to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport where a plane sent by the South Korean government is waiting for them.",
      "The Korean Air plane is scheduled to leave Atlanta at noon ET and arrive in Seoul on Friday around 4 p.m. local time (3 a.m. ET).",
      "South Korean officials originally hoped the plane would leave Atlanta as early as Wednesday afternoon local time, shortly after it arrived from Seoul. But the foreign ministry said its departure was likely to be delayed \u201cdue to circumstances on the U.S. side,\u201d and an airport spokesperson later said the charter flight had been canceled.",
      "At a meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on Wednesday, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun learned that Trump had ordered the suspension of the repatriation process in order to discuss with South Korea whether its detained nationals \u2014 all of them skilled workers who were helping set up an electric vehicle battery plant \u2014 should remain in the U.S. to continue their work rather than be sent home.",
      "Cho told Rubio that it would be better for them to return home first and then re-enter the U.S. \u201csince these individuals were already in shock and are exhausted,\u201d a South Korean government official said.",
      "The official said that the U.S. agreed to repatriate the South Koreans and that Trump had instructed that they be transported to the airport without physical restraints such as handcuffs, in a departure from standard U.S. practice.",
      "Images of South Koreans being shackled at the wrists and ankles have caused outrage in South Korea, a key U.S. ally in Asia that has pledged hundreds of billions in U.S. investment as part of tariff negotiations. The raid came weeks after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung reinforced that commitment at a meeting with Trump at the White House.",
      "\u201cWe believe that President Trump\u2019s consideration in this regard stems from the deep bonds formed between the two leaders at the successful South Korea-U.S. summit, as well as the consistent position our government has maintained on this detention issue,\u201d the South Korean government official said.",
      "Lee said all but one of the 317 detained South Koreans had elected to fly home.",
      "\u201cEach person was allowed to choose, and the U.S. government said essentially, \u2018If you want to go, you may go; if you want to stay, you may stay,\u2019\u201d Lee said at a news conference in Seoul marking his 100th day in office.",
      "The raid has raised concerns about the potential impact on U.S.-South Korea relations, though Lee said his government had \u201cnot considered it to that depth yet.\u201d",
      "He said the incident could make South Korean companies more hesitant to invest in the U.S., where they have long sent employees on a temporary basis to provide training or assistance in areas where U.S. expertise is lacking.",
      "\u201cIf this is not allowed, companies will inevitably worry: \u2018If setting up factories in the U.S. brings endless restrictions and difficulties, should we even proceed?\u2019\u201d Lee said.",
      "What happened?",
      "The South Korean nationals were among the 475 people federal and immigration agents arrested in the raid on a construction site in the town of Ellabell, where the South Korean companies Hyundai and LG Energy Solution are jointly building an electric vehicle battery plant.",
      "U.S. officials, who said the arrested people were working or living in the country illegally, have described the raid as the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. No criminal charges have been filed.",
      "Of the detained South Koreans, 47 were employed by LG Energy Solution and the rest were hired by subcontractors. Hyundai, South Korea\u2019s largest automaker, said none of its direct employees were detained.",
      "Most of the detained South Koreans either were engineers or they worked in after-sales services and installation, said Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-based immigration attorney who is representing at least seven of them. He said they were in the U.S. under various visa programs that South Koreans and other foreign nationals have long used to do business in the country in the face of U.S. bureaucratic delays and murky regulations.",
      "Sarah Park, president of the Korean American Coalition, said Monday that the detained workers should not be blamed for the challenges companies face trying to secure the proper U.S. visas for employees who are key to getting new facilities up and running.",
      "James S. Kim, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea, said Wednesday in an interview in Seoul: \u201cI wish that Americans in America would be a little bit more sympathetic to what the Koreans have witnessed. And as long as they do that, I think the two countries can work together to kind of mitigate what had happened and move forward.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s behind the raid?",
      "Federal authorities showed up at the Hyundai-LG plant to execute a judicial search warrant in connection with what they said was a criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices.",
      "According to the warrant, agents were authorized to seize employment records and immigration documents, as well as ownership and management records related to the construction site. Authorities were also looking for four people, but the reasons the federal government was specifically interested in them remain under seal.",
      "On Sunday, U.S. and South Korean government officials reached a deal to release the workers from immigration custody and return them to their home country.",
      "Consulate officials and other South Korean officials met with those detained at the Folkston ICE Processing Center over the weekend, Meredyth Yoon, a litigation director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, which has been assisting detainees and their families seeking legal help, told NBC News on Tuesday.",
      "Yoon said that, as part of the deal, most of the South Korean nationals had agreed to \u201cvoluntary departure,\u201d avoiding formal deportation orders.",
      "She said that about 175 of the remaining detainees \u2014 who hail from Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela \u2014 remain in immigration detention and that her organization is working to connect the affected families to aid."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A bipartisan group of House lawmakers will make an official trip to China later this month, lawmakers told NBC News on Tuesday, the first such official visit by members of the House since 2019.",
      "The trip comes at a moment of fraught political and economic tensions between Washington and Beijing, and weeks after the leaders of China, Russia and North Korea met in Tiananmen Square and observed a massive military parade.",
      "The U.S. congressional delegation or CODEL to China, which has not previously been reported, is being organized by Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the former chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and current top Democrat on the panel. Smith confirmed the trip to NBC News on Tuesday afternoon.",
      "A second lawmaker confirmed they were attending the CODEL as well. Smith said that both Democratic and Republican members of the House Armed Services Committee would participate, but that Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., would not be part of the delegation.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s fairly significant. It\u2019s part of wanting to try to open up a dialogue between the U.S. and China. And I personally think it\u2019s important that you do that,\u201d Smith said in an interview just off the House floor.",
      "\u201cMerely talking with China is not endorsing everything that they do. It\u2019s like China is a big, powerful country. We are a big, powerful country. I think we need to talk about that,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo there\u2019s no significance at the timing. I think it should happen more often, on a frequent basis.\u201d",
      "Asked if the lawmakers would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Smith replied: \u201cWe\u2019re asking. We don\u2019t know yet.\u201d",
      "Some high-level U.S.-China talks are already happening. On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spoke to his Chinese counterpart, Admiral Dong Jun, by video teleconference in their first publicly known conversation, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the call. The Pentagon on Wednesday confirmed that the phone call happened, saying they \"exchanged views in a candid and constructive manner\" and agreed to more talks.",
      "\"Secretary Hegseth made clear that the United States does not seek conflict with China nor is it pursuing regime change or strangulation of the PRC,\" chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said. \"At the same time, however, he forthrightly relayed that the U.S. has vital interests in the Asia-Pacific, the priority theater, and will resolutely protect those interests.\"",
      "Details of the lawmakers' visit are being tightly held, and even senior members of the committee were unaware it was happening. A Rogers spokesperson did not respond to questions about the trip.",
      "Smith declined to provide the names of lawmakers who will be attending or the exact dates of the travel. However, the House will be on a recess the week of Sept. 22 for the Rosh Hashanah holiday.",
      "The CODEL will also include a stop in Cambodia, Smith said, but Taiwan will not be on the itinerary.",
      "The visit comes as the Trump administration and Beijing continue negotiating a trade deal. Trump has imposed significant tariffs on China and other trading partners, but he extended the deadline to Nov. 10 for those tariffs to kick in, to give the two sides more time to strike a deal.",
      "\"My important message is, you know, we have to have dialogue and communication,\" Smith said. \"I am deeply worried that, yes, China is a major rising power that we seem to be talking less and less to. We need to figure out a way to resolve our differences and can't do it by not talking to each other.\"",
      "In 2023, then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., led a bipartisan delegation of senators to China, where they met with Xi and discussed issues such as trade, economic competition and fentanyl, according to Schumer.",
      "But House lawmakers had not visited China since March 2019, when Reps. Rick Larsen, D-Wash., and Darin LaHood, R-Ill. \u2014 then the co-chairs of the U.S.-China Working Group \u2014 led a bipartisan group to Beijing. Unlike an official government-funded CODEL, that 2019 trip was sponsored by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations.",
      "The Covid-19 pandemic struck a year later, and official House travel to the region has since focused on Taiwan, Japan and other U.S. allies.",
      "In 2022, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., made an unannounced visit to Taiwan during a CODEL to Asia, angering Beijing and sparking live-fire military exercises around the self-governing island that China claims as its own.",
      "A year later, then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., led a House delegation to Taiwan and met with then-President Tsai Ing-wen, just as Pelosi\u2019s group did.",
      "And in 2024, then-Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul, R-Texas, led a House delegation to meet with Taiwan\u2019s new president, Lai Ching-te, promising that more weapons were on the way."
