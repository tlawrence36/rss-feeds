      "Few authors made readers laugh harder than did author Sophie Kinsella",
      "Sophie Kinsella, who has died at age 55, had a special talent for characters who persevered through the most embarrassing mishaps \u2014 often of their own making.",
      "Here are five novels that helped keep readers laughing, and relating, over the past 30 years.",
      "Fellow writers could only envy Kinsella's success, how early it came and how seemingly easy. As the author would remember, she was a 24-year-old financial journalist who, while commuting by train one day, thought to herself, \u201cI want to have a go at this, I want to write a book.\u201d Within two years, she was the bestselling author of \u201cThe Tennis Party,\u201d under her real name, Madeleine Wickham.",
      "Released in the U.S. as \u201c40 Love,\u201d her debut novel centered on the misadventures of a weekend tennis party and introduced readers to her conversational touch about everything from love to money to ... tennis.",
      "\u201cThey all have a lot of baggage,\u201d the author explained on her website. \u201cThey sleep with each other, they behave very badly, drink a lot of Pimms, thrash tennis balls around, and things come to a head quite intensely.\u201d",
      "She published her first several books as Wickham, before becoming a global brand as \u201cSophie Kinsella.\u201d Spurred by this first \u201cShopaholic\u201d novel, millions would cheer on the hopelessly indebted financial journalist Becky Bloomwood, who helps keep the economy turning with her \u201cinvestments\u201d in clothing, household and other products.",
      "Among the most cherished fantasies in her dreamworld: that some \u201cdotty old woman in Cornwall\u201d will mistakenly receive her \u201chumongous\u201d credit card bill and pay if off without checking the name. Becky, meanwhile, will be sent the woman's bill for three tins of cat food, \u201cwhich, naturally, I'll pay without question.\u201d",
      "The 2009 film \u201cConfessions of a Shopaholic,\u201d based on the first two of Kinsella's nine-novel series, starred Isla Fisher and Hugh Dancy.",

      "As Kinsella, the novelist had a mission to get her characters in trouble. Emma Corrigan has a proper job as a marketing assistant and a proper and \u201cheartbreakingly handsome\u201d boyfriend. She is also prone to panic and distraction, to going about in public with her blouse unbuttoned or unleashing a spurt of soda on a client's shirt. And she has a few secrets she would like to hold on to, whether it's pouring orange juice on the plant of a colleague who annoys her or how she sometimes holds back laughter while having sex \u2014 \u201cjust normal, everyday little secrets.\u201d",
      "This book was adapted into a 2019 movie starring Alexandra Daddario and Tyler Hoechlin.",
      "Her alliteratively named characters were ever fish out of water, sometimes on the driest land. Samantha Sweeting is a London lawyer who can't take it anymore, boards a train to the countryside and finds herself working as a housekeeper, for which she has no known skills.",
      "\u201cI had so much fun charting Samantha\u2019s comedy disasters in the kitchen, her battles with the ironing board, her gradual slowing down and relaxing and finding love,\u201d the author writes on her website. \u201cIt\u2019s a story of an uber-professional realizing there\u2019s more to life than work, and starting to appreciate the little things.\u201d",
      "Just your typical supernatural adventure, in which 27-year-old Lara Lington is visited by the ghost of her flapper-great aunt Sadie and sent off to retrieve Sadie's long-lost necklace. Subplots include Lara being dumped by her boyfriend and Lara wondering if she can succeed in business as a headhunter.",
      "She also lies a lot, to her parents. Yes, her work is going great. Yes, she loved their Christmas gift. No, she doesn't just subsist on pizza and yogurt and vodka. And so on: \u201cSeven lies. Not including all the ones about Mum's outfit.\u201d",

The pop singer-songwriter appears in three films premiering at the 2026 festival, including a mockumentary that she produced and stars in. Programmers on Wednesday unveiled a lineup of 90 feature films set for the festival\u2019s last hurrah in Park City, Utah.",
      "The slate includes documentaries on basketball great Brittney Griner, Nelson Mandela, Salman Rushdie, Courtney Love and Billie Jean King. There are starry features with the likes of Natalie Portman, Jenna Ortega, Seth Rogen, Channing Tatum, Danielle Brooks, Olivia Colman, Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph, Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd and Ethan Hawke. Olivia Wilde directs her first feature since \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Darling,\u201d in \u201cThe Invite.\u201d Judd Apatow chronicles comedian Maria Bamford\u2019s mental health journey.

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a broad, eclectic and bold program,\u201d Sundance public programming director Eugene Hernandez told The Associated Press. He said the lineup for the festival's final year in Park City \u201creally honors that well with this mixture of new, exciting voices paired with some really, really great familiar faces from Sundances past that I think will create a great alchemy for this really unique edition in Utah.\u201d",
      "Ever a festival of discovery, of the 90 features culled from 4,255 submissions, 40% are from first-time directors. The programmers laugh when they hear people say things like \u201cthat\u2019s a Sundance movie,\u201d as if it\u2019s one, easily categorizable thing.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of humor that she has about herself and her work, but also a creativity and a star quality that is apparent.

Cathy Yan directed and co-wrote \u201cThe Gallerist,\u201d a satirical look at the art world and attempting to sell a corpse at Art Basel Miami, with a large ensemble including Portman, Ortega, Sterling K. Brown and Zach Galifianakis. David Wain also has \u201cGail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass\u201d about a woman out to even the score after her fiance uses the \u201cfree pass,\u201d starring Zoey Deutch and Jon Hamm.",

      "At games, it's not unusual to hear Kendrick Lamar,Bad Bunny and Beyonc\u00e9's music blaring through the speakers. But the Mariachi Rams are reshaping the sound of NFL game day, blending traditional Mexican music with Los Angeles\u2019 hip-hop and rock influences in a way no other team in the league does.",
      "\u201cMariachi music has so much flexibility and I think that\u2019s special because we get to show how versatile mariachi music is to the NFL audience,\u201d says Hern\u00e1ndez, who is the only woman in the NFL\u2019s first official mariachi band. She's the daughter of Mariachi legend Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, who built the ensemble when he partnered with the Rams in 2019.",

      "\u201cThe things that come out of our communities, all of our communities, we all represent each other,\u201d says rapper Xzibit, who performed with the USC Marching Band at halftime during the Rams game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

      "Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez didn't hesitate. He believed it could work with the right musicians and musical range. What followed was the formation of a 10-member ensemble built to bridge tradition and modern Los Angeles sound, performing classic mariachi standards alongside reimagined pop and hip-hop anthems from \u201cEl Rey\u201d to Tupac's \u201cCalifornia Love.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's pride and passion,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez says.",

Since then, a handful of teams have followed.",
      "Behind the stadium lights and viral halftime moments are musicians who spend most of their week far from the field teaching students, working in offices, designing graphics or performing in classical orchestras across Southern California.",

      "For his first original feature in some 15 years, James L",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t trust my brain right now,\u201d says our hero, Ella, deep into James L. Brooks\u2019 bafflingly disjointed, uneven, unfunny and illogical \u201cElla McCay.\u201d",
      "And finally, nearly two hours into a perplexing muddle of a storyline, we have some clarity of thought. No, dear, we want to tell Ella, played by the lovely Emma Mackey, who is truly the only reason to watch any of this. No, your brain is fine (and by the way, what a depressing line to put in the mouth of your most intelligent character \u2014 a hard-working woman in politics). It\u2019s your script you can\u2019t trust, Ella! Run away from it. Now.",
      "It\u2019s hard to understand how \u201cElla McCay,\u201d the first original feature from writer-director Brooks in 15 years, goes so utterly haywire. Is this really the same mind that wrote the memorable \u201cBroadcast News\"? \u201cTerms of Endearment\"? \u201cAs Good As It Gets\u201d? We get a bit of a hint in the studio's press notes, which mention that Brooks began his script \u201cwithout a specific storyline in mind.\u201d",
      "Hmm. Perhaps that (unintentionally) explains this tangle of half-baked characters and subplots \u2014 each more head-scratching than the next, but also boring \u2014 and an ending that's unbelievable, by which we mean not believable. What\u2019s even less believable is that smart supporting actors like Jamie Lee Curtis, Ayo Edebiri, Woody Harrelson and Rebecca Hall didn\u2019t walk out in protest of a lack of coherence. (Well, actually, Hall is gone in a matter of minutes.)",
      "The main action takes place over three days in 2008, in an unnamed state. An aggressively folksy Julie Kavner as narrator tells us Ella is a great person, and super-bright, and at 34, one of the youngest people to serve as lieutenant governor.",
      "She\u2019s also a moral compass \u2014 both in the dog-eat-dog world of politics, where she just wants to pass good laws that help good people \u2014 and in her messed-up family. This family includes her weaselly father (Harrelson, intermittently amusing) who, in a flashback to when Ella was 16, loses his job in a sexual harassment scandal.",
      "Soon after, when Ella\u2019s mother (Hall, wasted) tells her that Dad is moving the family to California, Ella insists on staying put, at her school. She'll live with her loyal and loving Aunt Helen (Curtis), who runs \u2014 of course! \u2014 the diner next door.",
      "Flash forward 18 years, and Ella is summoned by her governor boss (Albert Brooks). He tells her he\u2019s in line for a Cabinet position, which means Ella would be interim governor. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t get this any other way,\u201d he notes, helpfully,",
      "There\u2019s one prickly problem. Ella is enmeshed in scandal; she's been having amorous relations, with her own husband, at lunchtime, in a room that's technically state property. (Yep, this is the best scandal they could come up with.)",
      "Also, there\u2019s a reporter who knows this, and he's trying to extort her in exchange for better access (to what, is unclear). Her husband is the one handling it. And so we flash back to high school to meet Ryan, who seems nice enough (but truly ridiculous as a high school student \u2014 there clearly was no de-aging budget).",
      "Anyway, Ryan (Jack Lowden) is now poised to become the state\u2019s first gentleman. We can see how Ella likes his easy good looks. But then, poof, he suddenly becomes a total jerk and we can\u2019t believe Ella would even think to be married to such a cad. But there\u2019s a lot here that we wouldn\u2019t think would happen.",

      "The book provides a rare look inside Paris\u2019 La Sant\u00e9 prison, where Sarkozy was held in solitary confinement and kept strictly away from other inmates for security reasons. His loneliness was broken only by regular visits from his wife, supermodel-turned-singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, and his lawyers.",
      "Sarkozy wrote that his cell looked like a \u201ccheap hotel, except for the armored door and the bars,\u201d with a hard mattress, a plastic-like pillow and a shower that produced only a thin stream of water. He described the \u201cdeafening noise\u201d of the prison, much of it at night.",

      "A rare comedy by Heggie, known best for turning Sister Helen Prejean's \u201cDead Man Walking\u201d and Herman Melville's \u201cMoby-Dick\u201d into operas, will premiere on July 18 in a production the California's Festival Napa Valley announced Wednesday.",
      "Soprano Danielle De Niese stars as Venus and baritone Quinn Kelsey as Bacchus in a work that mixes mythological gods with the real life people from the event at Paris' Intercontinental Hotel. The cast includes tenor Nicholas Phan as Steven Spurrier, mezzo-soprano Simone McIntosh as Patricia Gallagher and soprano Brenda Rae as Odette Kahn.",
      "\u201cI was looking for something that was fun, delightful, could be kind of wacky and crazy as well as deeply meaningful and cross boundaries,\u201d Heggie said. \u201cOne of the judges literally was demanding her scorecards back after the winners were announced. So we\u2019re going to have a nice mad scene for that judge, with Brenda Rae doing coloratura soprano.\u201d",
      "Judges at the wine tasting included Taillevent\u2019s Jean-Claude Vrinat and Le Grand V\u00e9four\u2019s Raymond Oliver. Chateau Montelena\u2019s chardonnay finished first among whites, edging out a Meursault-Charmes Roulot in a comparison of 1973 vintages. Among reds, a 1973 Stag's Leap Wine Cellars' cabernet sauvignon was first, followed by a 1970 Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild.",
      "George M. Taber wrote about the tasting for Time magazine and titled a 2005 book \u201cJudgment of Paris,\u201d alluding to a story from Greek mythology describing events leading to the Trojan War.",
      "\u201cIt was such a scandal,\u201d Heggie said. \u201cSome of those judges were accused of being traitors by the French.\u201d",

This is just the first of many domestic time travels, as the boy meets other relatives from other points in their lives. A new understanding begins to dawn.",
      "In \u201cBelle\u201d (2022), a teenager who\u2019s lived through tragedy finds a soaring catharsis in a virtual realm. I thought it was one of the best films of that year, and I still think it might be the best movie ever made about the internet. Either way, its song-and-soul-shattering climax is unforgettable.",
      "Yet in Hosoda\u2019s latest, \u201cScarlet,\u201d the director\u2019s enviable reach exceeds his grasp. In it, his female protagonist is a medieval princess who, after seeing her king father killed by her uncle, and dying herself, awakes in an expansive purgatory.

But an excess of baroque design, of emotion, of scope, sinks Hosoda\u2019s \u201cScarlet.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of misfire you can forgive.

A stairway to heaven is rumored to exist somewhere. As she seeks Claudius, Scarlet is joined by a stranger she encounters named Hijiri (Okada Masaki). A paramedic from modern day, he spends most of his time in the Otherworld trying to heal the wounds of others, including Scarlet\u2019s foes.",

If the Otherworld is laid out like Scarlet\u2019s troubled conscience, the ensuing battle between vengeance and forgiveness feels dully simplified. It's all a sea of troubles. Hosoda tries to build some interiority to the story (not a small aspect of \u201cHamlet\u201d) through Hijiri's backstory, telescoping Shakespeare\u2019s quandaries to contemporary times.",

Still, it\u2019s often dazzling to look at it and it's never not impassioned. Hosoda remains a director capable of reaching trembling, operatic heights. In \u201cScarlet,\u201d for instance, Claudius gets a spectacular death scene, a remarkable accomplishment considering he's already dead.",

      "The six nominees for the inaugural best podcast award are \u201cArmchair Expert with Dax Shepard,\u201d \u201cCall Her Daddy,\u201d \u201cGood Hang with Amy Poehler,\u201d \u201cThe Mel Robbins Podcast,\u201d \u201cSmartLess\u201d and \u201cUp First,\u201d from NPR. Representing a mix of news, advice and celebrity interviews, they were drawn from a shortlist of 25 programs the Globes had previously deemed eligible.",
      "The nominations avoided politics or controversy by passing on popular podcasts from the shortlist, such as conservative-leaning programs \u201cThe Megyn Kelly Show,\u201d \u201cThe Tucker Carlson Show,\u201d \u201cThe Ben Shapiro Show,\u201d Candace Owen\u2019s \u201cCandace\u201d and, most notably, \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience,\u201d which topped Spotify, Apple and YouTube's list of weekly podcast charts this year. The left-leaning \u201cPod Save America\u201d also was snubbed, as were popular true crime podcasts like \u201cMorbid\u201d and \u201cRotten Mango.\u201d",
      "Ben Bogardus, a professor and chair of the journalism department at Quinnipiac University, said it seemed that the Globes' voting body \u2014 after years of scandal for the beleaguered awards show \u2014 wanted to avoid any controversy, like inviting a podcast host who might show up and say something contentious.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to bill themselves as an award show that is for the masses and non-controversial, celebrating the best in entertainment. Having this political sideshow, I think they just wanted to avoid that,\u201d he said.",
      "Reaction to the apparent snubbing of politics-related podcasts early Monday was light, with a handful of X users weighing in with criticism that high-ranking programs from personalities like Rogan and \u201cmanosphere\u201d podcaster Theo Von had been left off the final cut. There was no direct reaction from the hosts themselves.",
      "Shapiro had launched an all-out Golden Globes publicity campaign for his decade-old podcast, on which he\u2019s spoken with the likes of U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the past year. In addition to making the rounds with industry publications, Shapiro also secured massive billboard space in New York City\u2019s Times Square.",
      "The 25 potential candidates \u2014 including The New York Times' \u201cThe Daily\u201d and Barstool Sports' \u201cPardon My Take\u201d \u2014 mostly matched up with the most listened-to shows.",
      "\u201cIf that\u2019s how you want to pick your \u2018best podcast,\u2019 that\u2019s certainly one starting point and one way to do it,\u201d says Karl Hughes, a 20-year podcasting veteran who is CEO of The Podcast Consultant. \u201cI think it leaves a lot of stuff out. It leaves a lot of nuance out.\u201d",
      "Eligible podcasts must have original content and must have released at least six episodes between Jan. 1, 2025, and Sept. 30, 2025, with each episode having a minimum length of 30 minutes. The award, which will be handed out at the Nikki Glaser-hosted show Jan. 11, recognizes \u201cthe quality, creativity, audience engagement and impact\u201d of the podcast, per the Globes.",
      "Many podcast experts were left scratching their heads since the Globes didn't use any categories for its long list and was a bit murky about what constituted a best podcast. Quality of production? Consistency? The stories being told? Raw numbers?",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for the industry to get more recognition and getting recognition in a major award ceremony is awesome,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cI think that\u2019s cool to see. But the way it\u2019s done, of course, is a very blunt instrument.\u201d",

      "While more digital-friendly awards shows like the Webby Awards, the Ambies, iHeartRadio and The Shorty Awards recognize podcasting, the Globes' move marks the first time podcasts have been included by a major awards show.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019ll open up the door for more individuals and businesses that want to use the medium to tell interesting stories because it\u2019s got a little more respect, a little more gravitas, a little more mainstream appeal,\u201d he said.",

      "Bogardus marveled at how the podcasting industry has grown up in the past 25 years, moving beyond its origins in radio and giving hosts freedom that content creators in other media don't have: \u201cGoing into an award show now really shows that it has come into its own as a type of communication that people consume, which can be on par with television, with radio, with streaming, with internet videos, with social media.\u201d",

      "ALS is a progressive disease that gradually destroys the nerve cells and connections needed to walk, talk, speak and breathe. Most patients die within three to five years of a diagnosis.

      "Paramount has launched a hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros",
      "NEW YORK -- Paramount on Monday launched a hostile takeover offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, initiating a potentially bruising battle with rival bidder Netflix to buy the company behind HBO, CNN and a famed movie studio along with the power to reshape much of the nation's entertainment landscape.",
      "Emerging just days after top Warner managers agreed to Netflix's $72 billion purchase, the Paramount bid seeks to go over the heads of those leaders by appealing directly to Warner shareholders with more money \u2014 $74.4 billion \u2014 and a plan to buy all of Warner's business, including the cable business that Netflix does not want.",
      "Paramount said its decision to go hostile came after it made several earlier offers that Warner management \u201cnever engaged meaningfully\u201d with following the company's October announcement that it was open to selling itself.",
      "In its appeal to shareholders, Paramount noted its offer also contains more cash than Netflix's bid \u2014 $18 billion more \u2014 and argued that it's more likely to pass scrutiny from President Donald Trump's administration, a big concern given his habit of injecting himself in American business decisions.",
      "Over the weekend, Trump said the Netflix-Warner combo \u201ccould be a problem\u201d because of the size of the combined market share and that he planned to review the deal personally.",
      "For its part, Netflix says it is confident Warner will reject the Paramount bid and that regulators, and Trump, will back its deal, citing multiple conversations that co-CEO Ted Sarandos has had with him about the streaming company's expansion and hiring.",
      "\u201cI think the president\u2019s interest in this is the same as ours, which is to create and protect jobs,\" Sarandos said Monday at an investor conference.",
      "The fight for Warner drew strong reaction in Washington, with politicians from both major parties weighing in on the likely impact on streaming prices, movie theater employment and the diversity of entertainment choices and political views.",
      "Paramount, run by David Ellison, whose family is closely allied with Trump, said it had submitted six proposals to Warner over a 12-week period before the latest offer.",
      "\u201cWe believe our offer will create a stronger Hollywood. It is in the best interests of the creative community, consumers and the movie theater industry,\" the Paramount CEO said in a statement. Ellison added that his deal would lead to more competition in the industry, not less, and more movies in theaters.",
      "A regulatory document released Monday suggested another possible Paramount advantage to win over Trump: An investment firm run by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner would be investing in the deal, too.",
      "Also participating would be funds controlled by the governments of three unnamed Persian Gulf countries, widely reported as Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Qatar. Trump's family company has struck deals this year for buildings and resorts that bear his name in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, partnering in the former with a company closely tied to the government and in the latter with the government fund itself.",
      "Also possibly in Paramount's favor are recent changes at CBS News since its October purchase of the news and commentary website The Free Press. The site's founder, Bari Weiss, who has a reputation for fighting \u201cwoke\u201d culture, was then installed as editor-in-chief in a signal Ellison intended to shake up the storied network of Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather and \u201c60 Minutes,\" long viewed by many conservatives as the personification of a liberal media establishment.",
      "Still, Trump is a wild card given his tendency to make decisions based on gut and his personal mood.",

      "The drama surrounding control of Warner began Friday when Netflix made the surprise announcement that it had struck a deal with its management to buy the Hollywood giant behind \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d HBO Max and DC Studios.",
      "The cash and stock proposal was valued at $27.75 per Warner share, giving it a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion, including debt that will be assumed in the deal. By contrast, the Paramount offer is for $30 per Warner share, and worth $108 billion, included assumed debt. Paramount\u2019s offer is set to expire on Jan. 8 unless it\u2019s extended.",
      "But comparing the two deals is complicated because they are not buying the same thing. The Netflix offer, if it goes through, will only close after Warner completes its previously announced separation of its cable operations. Not included in the deal, which is unlikely to close for at least a year, are networks such as CNN and Discovery.",
      "The federal government has the authority to kill any big media deals if it has antitrust concerns, but such matters are usually left to experts at the Department of Justice. In his decision to get involved personally, Trump has decided, as he has with other government norms, to make a sharp break with precedent.",
      "That worries Usha Haley, a Wichita State University specialist in international business strategy, who noted that Ellison is the son of longtime Trump supporter Larry Ellison, the world\u2019s second-richest person.",

      "But others are uncertain how big a role Trump will play.",
      "John Mayo, an antitrust expert at Georgetown University, said the scrutiny will be serious whichever offer is approved by shareholders and goes before the DOJ, and that he thinks experts there will keep partisanship out of their decisions despite the politically charged atmosphere.",
      "\u201cThat may affect at least the rhetoric that occurs in the press,\" he said, \"though I doubt it will affect the analysis that occurs at the Department of Justice.\u201d",

And I\u2019ve been categorized as making violence thrillers in the past. So to be in this category that other people would have never imagined for me, I think it makes it even more enjoyable. And I feel I\u2019ve been redefined as a film director.\u201d \u2014 in an AP interview, via a translator. \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d is nominated for best motion picture, musical or comedy; best motion picture, non-English language; and best male actor in a motion picture, musical or comedy.",

      "Raul Malo, the soulful tenor and frontman of The Mavericks, has died at age 60",
      "NEW YORK -- Raul Malo, the soulful tenor and frontman of the genre-defying, Grammy-winning band The Mavericks, has died. He was 60.",
      "Malo died Monday night, his wife, Betty Malo, posted on his Facebook page. He had been battling cancer. The frontman of The Mavericks had documented his health journey on social media since he disclosed in June 2024 that he was receiving treatment for colon cancer.",
      "In September 2025, Malo said on Instagram that he was battling LMD, or leptomeningeal disease, a rare complication when cancer spreads to membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord.",
      "The diagnosis forced The Mavericks to cancel dates with Dwight Yoakam in the middle of a joint tour. Malo left home in Nashville, Tennessee, to seek treatment in Houston, keeping his fans updated along his health journey.",
      "\u201cHe was called to do another gig \u2014 this time in the sky \u2014 and he\u2019s flying high like an eagle,\u201d Betty Malo wrote. \u201cNo one embodied life and love, joy and passion, family, friends, music, and adventure the way our beloved Raul did. Now he will look down on us with all that heaven will allow, lighting the way and reminding us to savor every moment.\u201d",
      "Malo\u2019s band praised his deep commitment to the \u201cpreservation of the multilingual American musical repertoire\u201d and his steadfast championing of \u201cmusic education as an inspiration for every child across America and throughout the world.\u201d",
      "Born Raul Francisco Mart\u00ednez-Malo Jr. in Miami to Cuban parents, he co-founded The Mavericks in 1989 with drummer Paul Deakin and bass guitarist Robert Reynolds. Their self-titled debut album was released the following year on the independent, Miami-based label Y&T Music.",
      "Some call the band alt-country. Others describe it as Americana, roots, Latin, Tejano or swing. It\u2019s all of the above and more, driven by songs written by Malo, his expansive guitar style and his broad vocal range, from a soaring, velvety baritone to operatic high notes.",
      "His musical prowess was in the blend, also incorporating rock, traditional country and surf. In the early days in Miami, The Mavericks played punk and rock clubs to get their sound out there.",

      "At that time, The Mavericks had just released an all-Spanish album, \u201cEn Espa\u00f1ol,\u201d featuring original songs and classic Latin American standards. In 2002, Malo released an all-Spanish album for children, \u201cel Cancionero de la Familia Volume 1,\u201d featuring vocals from his sister, Carol, wife, Betty, and mother, Norma, along with other guests.",
      "The band has taken on various iterations over the years as some members came and went. The Mavericks also disbanded a couple of times.

      "The Mavericks released their 13th studio album, \u201cMoon & Stars,\u201d in 2024. Between that and their debut, the band received a Grammy, two Country Music Association awards and three Academy of Country Music Awards.",
      "Raul has a BMI award for songwriting, for \u201cAll You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down,\u201d and was nominated for several solo Grammys, including one for his album \u201cLucky One\u201d and another for his work with the Latin supergroup \u201cLos Super Seven.\u201d",

      "There may be no higher art in Somalia than oral poetry, which is recited in the most remote outposts and even by militants",
      "MOGADISHU, Somalia -- In a theater where a suicide bomber detonated years ago, Hassan Barre stepped forward to offer a different hallmark of Somalia: poetry.",
      "In one of the world's most volatile nations, Somalis must be aware of their responsibility to their country and each other, he said in a recital emphasizing good citizenship.",
      "The 70-year-old Barre cut a somber figure at the podium. His message echoed in the largely empty hall of the National Theater in Mogadishu, the capital, where aging poets in austere suits gather to share verses and recall the good old days.",
      "The men, some with hennaed beards and glaucoma eyes, represent a fading measure of hope for a country that has been slowly stripped of its cultural wealth during decades of conflict.",
      "There may be no higher art in Somalia than oral poetry, which is recited in the most remote outposts and even by militants in the bush. Somalis, after all, are often described as \"a nation of poets.\" Their work often venerates pastoral well-being and the traditional roles of men and women in the predominantly Islamic society.",
      "Some poets like Hadraawi \u2014 the \u201cShakespeare of Somalia\u201d who died in 2022 \u2014 have achieved universal recognition. \u201cHadraawi\u2019s oeuvre includes a broad repertoire, from love songs to laments of war,\u201d Harvard University's Archive of World Music noted after his death.",
      "Poets flourished during the reign of Siad Barre, who ruled Somalia with an iron hand but was known to respect the intellectual work of artists. His removal in 1991 by clan-based militias provoked a civil war as warlords fought for authority \u2014 chaos that eventually led to the deadly rise of the al-Qaida-affiliated al-Shabab.",
      "Somalia is now known far more for bombings than poetry. The violence has not spared its cultural institutions, now mostly in limbo as the fragile federal government spends the bulk of its budget on national security.",
      "The National Theater, like the National Museum next door, is largely inactive. To reach the venue in a heavily guarded area near the presidential palace, visitors traveling in a vehicle must notify the intelligence agency in advance, part of security precautions that demand not just the car\u2019s license plate number but even its make and color.",
      "On the morning Hassan Barre sang his poem, a group of young Somalis were practicing a folk dance that emphasized traditional values, like dutifully cultivating the land. A group of poets, including one woman, sat nearby, talking quietly.",
      "Some told The Associated Press they are trying to keep Somalia\u2019s poetic tradition alive despite security concerns and financial challenges that limit programming.",
      "Traditional poets still perform at community gatherings like weddings, and poems are recited daily on local radio stations.",

We expect them to treat us the way we used to be treated.\u201d",
      "Daud Aweis, Somalia's culture minister, said poets still play \u201ca vital role in Somali society, serving as a foundational pillar for cultural vitality, individual well-being and peaceful coexistence.\" While his ministry provides limited funding for culture and the arts at the National Theater, \"the long-term goal is to expand support,\u201d he told the AP.",
      "Inaugurated in 1967, less than a decade after independence, the National Theater shut down in 1991 following Barre's ouster. It reopened in 2012 after African Union peacekeepers pushed al-Shabab fighters out of Mogadishu in a counter-terrorism campaign.",
      "Months later, however, a suicide bomber blew herself up at the theater during a speech by the prime minister, killing the head of Somalia\u2019s Olympic committee and at least seven others. The prime minister survived.",
      "Still, the poets who meet at the National Theater are not giving up. Gathering there fosters a sense of community in a sandbagged city ringed by checkpoints.",
      "Hirsi Dhuuh Mohamed, who chairs the Somali Council of Poets, said the group has 400 members, including many in the diaspora. He said things had improved from \u201cthe worst\u201d in the late 1990s, when Mogadishu was divided into zones as warlords fought for dominance.",
      "\"One thing that unites all Somali poets, whether in Eritrea, whether in Somalia, everywhere, we stand for peace,\u201d he said, adding that they never engage directly in politics. Instead, he said, the overarching message of their work is security, good governance and community integration.",
      "Another poet, Maki Haji Banaadir, a curmudgeon with gold-rimmed glasses, is among those trying to keep the National Theater operational as its deputy director.",
      "In 2003, he and six other poets traveled across Somalia to preach reconciliation. That kind of journey is impossible now. The federal government has little hold on territory outside of Mogadishu, and at least two semi-autonomous regions are seeking secession.",
      "Maki, as he is commonly known, is a popular cultural figure in Somalia. A decade ago, he composed a song about the apparent uselessness of the Somali shilling, which is no longer accepted in local markets amid the dollarization of Somalia\u2019s economy.",
      "Asked if he and his peers were grooming the next generation of Somali poets, he said he hoped so: \u201cWe are working day and night.\"",

    "story": [
      "Federal health officials have expanded an outbreak of infant botulism tied to ByHeart baby formula to include any illnesses reported since the company began production in 2022",
      "Federal health officials on Wednesday expanded an outbreak of infant botulism tied to recalled ByHeart baby formula to include all illnesses reported since the company began production in March 2022.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said investigators \u201ccannot rule out the possibility that contamination might have affected all ByHeart formula products\u201d ever made.",
      "The outbreak now includes at least 51 infants in 19 states. The new case definition includes \u201cany infant with botulism who was exposed to ByHeart formula at any time since the product's release,\u201d according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most recent illness was reported on Dec. 1.",
      "No deaths have been reported in the outbreak, which was announced Nov. 8.",
      "Previously, health officials had said the outbreak included 39 suspected or confirmed cases of infant botulism reported in 18 states since August. That's when officials at California's Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program reported a rise in treatment of infants who had consumed ByHeart formula. With the expanded definition, the CDC identified 10 additional cases that occurred from December 2023 through July 2025.",
      "ByHeart, a New York-based manufacturer of organic infant formula founded in 2016, recalled all its products sold in the U.S. on Nov. 11. The company, which accounts for about 1% of the U.S. infant formula market, had been selling about 200,000 cans of the product each month.",
      "News that ByHeart products could have been contaminated for years was distressing to Andi Galindo, whose 5-week-old daughter, Rowan, was hospitalized in December 2023 with infant botulism after drinking the formula. Galindo, 36, of Redondo Beach, California, said she insisted on using ByHeart formula to supplement a low supply of breast milk because it was recommended by a lactation consultant as \u201cvery natural, very gentle, very good for the babies.\"",
      "\u201cThat's a hard one,\u201d Galindo said. \u201cIf there is proof that there were issues with their manufacturing and their plant all the way back from the beginning, that is a problem and they really need to be held accountable.\"",
      "Amy Mazziotti, 43, of Burbank, California, said her then-5-month-old son, Hank, fell ill and was treated for botulism in March, weeks after he began drinking ByHeart. Being included in the investigation of the outbreak \u201cfeels like a win for all of us,\u201d she said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known in my gut from the beginning that ByHeart was the reason Hank got sick, and to see that these cases are now part of the investigation brings me to tears \u2014 a mix of relief, gratitude and hope that the truth is finally being recognized,\u201d she said.",
      "ByHeart officials did not immediately respond to questions about the expanded outbreak.",
      "The FDA sent inspectors last month to ByHeart plants in Allerton, Iowa, and Portland, Oregon, where the formula is produced and packaged. The agency has released no results from those inspections.",
      "The company previously reported that tests by an independent laboratory showed that 36 samples from three different lots contained the type of bacteria that can cause infant botulism.",
      "\u201cWe cannot rule out the risk that all ByHeart formula across all product lots may have been contaminated,\u201d the company wrote on its website last month.",
      "Those results and discussions with the FDA led CDC officials to expand the outbreak, according to Dr. Jennifer Cope, a CDC scientist leading the investigation.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the contamination appeared to persist across all production runs, different lots, different raw material lots,\u201d Cope said. \u201cThey couldn't isolate it to specific lots from a certain time period.\u201d",

In 2023, the FDA sent a warning letter to the company detailing \u201careas that still require corrective actions.\u201d",

      "Infant botulism is a rare disease that affects fewer than 200 babies in the U.S. each year. It\u2019s caused when infants ingest botulism bacteria that produce spores that germinate in the intestines, creating a toxin that affects the nervous system. Babies are vulnerable until about age 1 because their gut microbiomes are not mature enough to fight the toxin.",
      "Baby formula has previously been linked to sporadic cases of illness, but no known outbreaks of infant botulism tied to powdered formula have previously been confirmed, according to research studies.",
      "Symptoms can take up to 30 days to develop and can include constipation, poor feeding, loss of head control, drooping eyelids and a flat facial expression. Babies may feel \u201cfloppy\u201d and can have problems swallowing or breathing.",
      "The sole treatment for infant botulism is known as BabyBIG, an IV medication made from the pooled blood plasma of adults immunized against botulism. California\u2019s infant botulism program developed the product and is the sole source worldwide.",

      "It is increasingly difficult to give birth in eastern Congo",
      "GOMA, Congo -- In a maternity ward in eastern Congo, Irene Nabudeba rested her hands on her bulging midsection, worried about giving birth in a city under rebel control.",
      "The conflict that flared this year has left many medical supplies stranded beyond the front line. Infrastructure like running water has collapsed, along with the economy in Goma, the region's humanitarian and commercial hub.",
      "And now the one glimmer of hope for mothers \u2014 a free maternity care program offered by Congo's government \u2014 has ended after it was not renewed in June. It was not clear why, and Congolese officials did not respond to questions.",
      "Nabudeba has five children and wonders whether the sixth will survive.",
      "\u201cAt the hospital, they ask us for money that we don\u2019t have. I\u2019m pushing myself to come to the consultations, but for the delivery ... I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll find the money,\u201d she said at the Afia Himbi health center.",
      "Several women told The Associated Press they cannot afford maternal care after Congo's program that was aimed at reducing some of the world's highest maternal and neonatal death rates ended earlier this year. The program launched in 2023 offered free consultations and treatment for illnesses and at-risk pregnancies at selected health facilities across the country.",
      "Congo ranked second in maternal deaths globally with 19,000 in 2023, behind Nigeria's 75,000 deaths, according to U.N. statistics.",
      "Health workers said more women in Goma are now giving birth at home without skilled help, sometimes in unsanitary conditions, leaving them vulnerable to hemorrhage, infection or death.",
      "Clinics and hospitals were already struggling after the M23 rebels, backed by neighboring Rwanda, seized Goma in an escalation of fighting in January.",
      "Although clashes subsided amid U.S.- and Qatar-led peace efforts, fighting escalated again in recent days and the conflict has collapsed public institutions, disrupted essential services and displaced more than 700,000 people, according to the U.N. humanitarian office.",
      "In Goma, the armed rebels are seen everywhere, making a pregnant woman's walk to clinics another source of anxiety.",
      "Freddy Kaniki, deputy coordinator of M23, asserted to the AP that the free maternal care \u201cwas not renewed because it was a failure,\u201d without elaborating. Congolese officials did not respond to questions.",
      "Rwanda denies supporting the M23 despite U.N. experts saying they have evidence of it. Rwanda prides itself on health care and recently signed a five-year deal with the U.S. for investment of up to $158 million in its own health care sector.",
      "The collapse of essential services in rebel-held areas, combined with mass displacement and insecurity, has left civilians struggling to access even basic care.",
      "An International Committee of the Red Cross assessment in September found that at least 85% of health facilities were experiencing medicine shortages, and nearly 40% have seen an exodus of staff after the conflict surged in the provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu.",
      "The ICRC in October said 200 health facilities in eastern Congo had run out of medicines because of looting and supply disruptions. Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, has reported hospitals attacked, ambulances blocked and medical staff threatened or killed.",

      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein is canceling Medicaid rate cuts he initiated two months ago",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein is canceling Medicaid reimbursement rate reductions he initiated two months ago, a decision that protects short-term access to care for vulnerable patients while a political fight with Republican legislators to enact additional funding is resolved.",
      "Stein and state Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Dev Sangvai announced Wednesday the state agency would restore reimbursement rates for doctors, hospitals and other medical providers of Medicaid services that otherwise generally had been cut by 3% to 10% starting Oct. 1.",
      "The governor had said the reductions were needed to deal with a funding shortfall for Medicaid, which serves more than 3 million people in the ninth-largest state. But legal challenges to the reductions that have resulted recently in judicial rulings demanding some rates return to pre-October levels make maintaining the reductions untenable.",
      "\u201cWhat has not changed is the program doesn\u2019t have enough money. What has changed is that the courts have made very clear that the rates have to go back,\u201d Stein told The Associated Press in an interview.",
      "The first-year governor had said the reductions, while painful for Medicaid patients and providers, were unavoidable because a stopgap spending measure the legislature approved in the summer fell $319 million short of what was needed to address population changes and rising health care costs.",
      "\u201cThe legislature forced these cuts onto the program,\u201d Stein said. \u201cIt was absolutely nothing that the department or I wanted to have happen.\u201d",
      "Republican legislators said Stein's actions were unnecessary, unprecedented early in the fiscal year and politically motivated. Still, state House and Senate GOP leaders tried but could not work out this fall legislation to provide extra money that would sustain the program longer.",
      "Stein attempted in recent weeks to pressure lawmakers to act \u2014 even by formally calling a special legislative session last month. But House Speaker Destin Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger refused to convene, saying Stein had failed to meet the qualifications for such an extraordinary session.",
      "The governor was pushed to relent as Medicaid consumers such as children with autism and providers like adult care homes have successfully sued the health department so far and blocked certain rate reductions.",
      "The plaintiffs accused the state of violating laws by reducing rates unilaterally and discriminating against those with disabilities. A host of groups representing thousands of doctors and other service providers filed their own challenges last week to block the rates more broadly.",
      "As part of the reversal, Sangvai said, the providers will receive retroactively reimbursements for the difference between the reduced and full rates for claims that were filed after the reductions took effect.",

      "The Medicaid shortfall continues, however, an offshoot of GOP leaders being unable to pass a conventional two-year budget \u2014 largely over differences about additional income tax reductions and teacher pay. North Carolina remains the only state without an enacted budget, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. A budget was supposed to be in place July 1.",
      "House and Senate Republicans separately agreed in September they would provide an additional $190 million to the Medicaid program. But senators also wanted legislation to allocate previously received federal money to help build a standalone children\u2019s hospital in Wake County by two university medical schools and for rural health investments. Despite previously spending toward these projects, House Republicans are now having second thoughts about completing these investments.",
      "The legislature had already planned to convene next week, but any action or recorded votes is unlikely. Stein said restoring the rates only adds to the urgency for legislators to act and locate more funds.",
      "\u201cIf the legislature would simply do its job and pass a budget that fully funded Medicaid, we never would have had to start this entire enterprise,\u201d Stein said.",
      "Sangvai acknowledged the program would not run out of money until the spring. But he said restoring the rates means his agency is left only with scaling back or eliminating programs and services to find significant savings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a situation we hate to consider because the consequences could in fact be catastrophic,\u201d Sangvai said.",

    "story": [
      "An infant botulism outbreak has sickened at least 39 babies across the U.S. and underscored the crucial role of a medication that treats the rare disease",
      "When Alessandro Barbera was rushed to a California hospital with infant botulism in October, his father had barely heard of the disease, never mind the rare and costly treatment that likely saved the newborn\u2019s life.",
      "Now, however, Tony Barbera is deeply grateful for BabyBIG, the sole antidote to the paralyzing and potentially deadly illnesses linked to contaminated ByHeart infant formula.",
      "\u201cIt is hugely remarkable,\u201d said Barbera, 35, whose son is slowly recovering.",
      "The botulism outbreak tied to ByHeart formula has sickened at least 39 babies across in 18 states since August \u2014 and showed the value of the treatment made from blood plasma donated by a small group of scientists and other volunteers.",
      "\u201cThis is almost like a miracle,\u201d said Dr. Vijay Viswanath, a pediatric neurologist at Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, who has treated several children with botulism during his career \u2014 including one in the current outbreak.",
      "\u201cPrior to the discovery of BabyBIG, some of these hospitalizations would take two or three months,\u201d Viswanath said, if infected children recovered at all.",
      "Licensed in 2003, BabyBIG is the brand name for human botulism immune globulin, an IV medication that uses antibodies from volunteers vaccinated against botulism to help babies too young to fight the disease on their own.",
      "The treatment was the brainchild of the late Dr. Stephen Arnon, who was a scientist with the California Department of Public Health. In 1976, Arnon and colleagues identified the rare form of botulism that affects infants younger than 1 \u2014 and then spent his 45-year career figuring out how to treat it. The disease occurs when babies ingest botulism spores that germinate in the intestine and produce a dangerous toxin that attacks the nervous system.",
      "More than 3,700 children worldwide have been treated with BabyBIG since Arnon and his team conducted a pivotal clinical trial in California in 1997 that showed the medication could shorten hospital stays and reduce the need for breathing machines.",
      "Produced in small batches every five years, BabyBIG costs nearly $70,000 per treatment, according to the California Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, which Arnon founded. Under state law, fees from the sale of the drug are used only to fund the botulism program.",
      "The medication relies on donors like Nancy Shine, a 76-year-old retired biochemist in California who was vaccinated against botulism because she worked with the lethal germ in a lab. Arnon first recruited Shine and other scientists for the BabyBIG project two decades ago because their blood produced high levels of antibodies, the blood proteins that neutralize the botulism toxin.",
      "The early protocol required the volunteers to receive boosters doses of an investigational botulism vaccine also used by the U.S. military and then undergo a procedure that harvests the blood plasma that contains antibodies against botulism types A and B.",

      "\u201cIt was not very pleasant to be vaccinated with,\u201d Shine recalled. \u201cThere were a lot of side effects, like big welts where you got vaccinated and a little bit of pain.\u201d",
      "Still, Shine contributed to three batches of the antitoxin produced between 2008 and 2019.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s probably the highlight of my career that I actually was able to participate in this project and donate plasma,\u201d Shine said. \u201cWe made a product that could save infants\u2019 lives.\u201d",
      "Because infant botulism is rare, with fewer than 200 cases reported in the U.S. each year, finding funding and other resources to develop the BabyBIG treatment took nearly 15 years and $10.6 million \u2014 and faced substantial hurdles, Arnon noted in a 2007 article.",
      "Today, about 30 people on average provide plasma for each batch of BabyBIG, California health officials said. Batch 8, the latest edition, is being manufactured now at a Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. plant near Los Angeles, according to Giles Platford, president of the company's plasma-derived therapies unit. The company contracts with California officials to produce BabyBIG on a \u201cnot-for-profit basis,\u201d Platford said.",
      "Some of the earliest donors, like Shine, have aged out of the BabyBIG program, which collects blood from adult volunteers up to age 70. New donors are accepted, but they must enroll in a clinical study directed by the California health department and agree to receive a booster dose of a different investigational botulism vaccine.",
      "California officials estimate they have enough BabyBIG in reserve to last until next summer, based on current projections. The ByHeart outbreak is part of a worrisome rise of at least 107 infant botulism cases treated in the U.S. since August, said Dr. Jessica Khouri, senior medical officer for the state program.",
      "Shine recently received a booklet filled with photos and letters from families whose children have recovered from botulism after receiving BabyBIG.",
      "\u201cIt's really wonderful. I read a couple each day,\" she said. \u201cEvery single one of them makes you want to cry.\u201d",

      "Archaeologists in Britain say they have found the earliest known evidence of deliberate fire-making, dating to around 400,000 years ago",
      "LONDON -- Scientists in Britain say ancient humans may have learned to make fire far earlier than previously believed, after uncovering evidence that deliberate fire-setting took place in what is now eastern England around 400,000 years ago.",
      "The findings, described in the journal Nature, push back the earliest known date for controlled fire-making by roughly 350,000 years. Until now, the oldest confirmed evidence had come from Neanderthal sites in what is now northern France dating to about 50,000 years ago.",
      "The discovery was made at Barnham, a Paleolithic site in Suffolk that has been excavated for decades. A team led by the British Museum identified a patch of baked clay, flint hand axes fractured by intense heat and two fragments of iron pyrite, a mineral that produces sparks when struck against flint.",
      "Researchers spent four years analyzing to rule out natural wildfires. Geochemical tests showed temperatures had exceeded 700 degrees Celsius (1,292 Fahrenheit), with evidence of repeated burning in the same location.",
      "That pattern, they say, is consistent with a constructed hearth rather than a lightning strike.",
      "Rob Davis, a Paleolithic archaeologist at the British Museum, said the combination of high temperatures, controlled burning and pyrite fragments shows \u201chow they were actually making the fire and the fact they were making it.\u201d",
      "Iron pyrite does not occur naturally at Barnham. Its presence suggests the people who lived there deliberately collected it because they understood its properties and could use it to ignite tinder.",
      "Deliberate fire-making is rarely preserved in the archaeological record. Ash is easily dispersed, charcoal decays and heat-altered sediments can be eroded.",
      "At Barnham, however, the burned deposits were sealed within ancient pond sediments, allowing scientists to reconstruct how early people used the site.",

      "Fire allowed early populations to survive colder environments, deter predators and cook food. Cooking breaks down toxins in roots and tubers and kills pathogens in meat, improving digestion and releasing more energy to support larger brains.",
      "Chris Stringer, a human evolution specialist at the Natural History Museum, said fossils from Britain and Spain suggest the inhabitants of Barnham were early Neanderthals whose cranial features and DNA point to growing cognitive and technological sophistication.",
      "Fire also enabled new forms of social life. Evening gatherings around a hearth would have provided time for planning, storytelling and strengthening group relationships, which are behaviors often associated with the development of language and more organized societies.",
      "Archaeologists say the Barnham site fits a wider pattern across Britain and continental Europe between 500,000 and 400,000 years ago, when brain size in early humans began to approach modern levels and when evidence for increasingly complex behavior becomes more visible.",
      "Nick Ashton, curator of Paleolithic collections at the British Museum, described it as \u201cthe most exciting discovery of my long 40-year career.\"",
      "For archaeologists, the find helps address a long-standing question: When humans stopped relying on lightning strikes and wildfires and instead learned to create flame wherever and whenever they needed it.",

      "She published her first novel, \u201dThe Tennis Party,\u201d in 1995, as Madeleine Wickham. Soon after, she left her journalism job to focus on writing. Six other books, including \u201cThe Gatecrasher\u201d and \u201cSleeping Arrangements,\u201d followed.",

      "Machado\u2019s daughter accepted the award on her behalf in a ceremony Wednesday that became a rally for democracy, and equally, an indictment of Venezuela\u2019s government, with attendees hearing in detail documented human rights abuses carried out against real or perceived opponents of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "\u201cShe wants to live in a free Venezuela, and she will never give up on that purpose,\u201d Ana Corina Sosa told the audience in Oslo before reading her mother\u2019s prepared remarks. \u201cThat is why we all know, and I know, that she will be back in Venezuela very soon.\u201d",
      "Machado greeted supporters from an Oslo hotel balcony early Thursday after arriving in the Norwegian capital.",
      "Machado had not been seen in public since Jan. 9, when she was briefly detained after joining supporters in an anti-government protest in Caracas, Venezuela\u2019s capital. The following day, Maduro was sworn in to a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost the presidential election.",
      "Machado intended to challenge Maduro in last year\u2019s contest, but the government barred her from running for office, forcing her to endorse retired diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez in her place. Before and after the election, many voters said they backed Machado \u2014 and by extension Gonz\u00e1lez \u2014 because she had not gone into exile while the country came undone.",
      "On Wednesday, some Venezuelans understood her decision to depart while others questioned why she was awarded the Nobel.",
      "\u201cThey say she left the country, if that\u2019s true, good for her,\u201d office worker Josefina P\u00e1ez said in Caracas. \u201cThat woman has made many sacrifices to fight for democracy, and it\u2019s time she reunites with her family, with her children, and continues fighting from abroad.\u201d",

      "Independent experts backed by the United Nations, Venezuelan nongovernmental organizations and other groups have documented extensively brutal government repression throughout Maduro's presidency. J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel committee, told attendees about repeated instances of torture, including the experiences of children who were detained in the aftermath of the 2024 presidential election.",

      "The drought gripping Iran has seen its president warn the country it may need to move its government out of Tehran by the end of December if there's not significant rainfall to recharge dams around the capital. Meteorologists have described this fall as the driest in over 50 years across the country \u2014 from even before its 1979 Islamic Revolution \u2014 further straining a system that expends vast amounts of water inefficiently on agriculture.",
      "The water crisis has even become a political issue in the country, particularly as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly offered his country's help to Iran, a nation he launched a 12-day war against in June. Water shortages also have sparked localized protests in the past, something Iran has been trying to avoid as its economy struggles under the weight of international sanctions over its nuclear program.",
      "\u201cThe water crisis in Iran has, in recent years, escalated from a recurring drought issue into a profound political and security problem that has the regime leadership concerned,\u201d the New York-based Soufan Center said.",
      "The drought has been a long subject of conversation across Tehran and wider Iran, from government officials openly discussing it with visiting journalists to people purchasing water tanks for their homes. In the capital, government-sponsored billboards call on the public not to use garden hoses outside to avoid waste. Water service reportedly goes out for hours in some neighborhoods of Tehran, home to 10 million people.",
      "Snowpack on the surrounding Alborz Mountains remains low as well, particularly after a summer that saw temperatures rise near 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) in some areas of the country, forcing government buildings to shut down.",
      "Ahad Vazifeh, an official in the government's Iran Meteorological Organization office, called the drought \u201cunprecedented\u201d in an interview with the Fararu news outlet last week. Precipitation now stands at about 5% of what's considered a normal autumn, he added.",

      "But the drain on the country's water supplies has been self-inflicted. Agriculture uses an estimated 90% of the country's water supplies. That hasn't been stopped even through these recent drought years. That's in part due to policies stemming from Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution and then-Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who pledged water would be free for all. The intervening years of the Iran-Iraq war saw the country push for self-sufficiency above all else, irrigating arid lands to grow water-intensive crops like wheat and rice, and overdrilling wells.",
      "Experts have described Iran as facing \u201cwater bankruptcy\u201d over its decisions. In the past, Iranian officials have blamed their neighbors in part for their water shortage, with hard-line former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at one point falsely suggesting that \u201cthe enemy destroys the clouds that are headed towards our country and this is a war Iran will win.\u201d",
      "But that's changed with the severity of the crisis leading to current President Masoud Pezeshkian warning the capital may need to be moved. However, such a decision would cost billions of dollars the country likely doesn't have as it struggles through a major economic crisis.",

      "Brazil's lower house of Congress has approved a bill that could reduce former President Jair Bolsonaro's prison time",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil\u2019s lower house of Congress approved a bill Wednesday aimed at reducing the time that former President Jair Bolsonaro spends behind bars following his sentence of more than 27 years for attempting a coup. But his successor has said he would veto the measure.",
      "The bill now goes to the Senate. The bill's centrist sponsor Paulinho da For\u00e7a said it's aimed at reconciliation and that if it's adopted, the right-wing ex-president\u2019s time behind bars could be reduced to two years and four months. But it would need to be sanctioned by President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and the leftist president has previously said he would veto it.",
      "Lawmakers voted 291-148 in favor of the bill following a contentious session in which scuffles broke out as members of Lula's party, which holds only a minority of seats in the chamber, protested the proceedings.",
      "The legislation would shorten prison sentences for all those convicted \u2014 including Bolsonaro \u2014 in connection with a riot on Jan. 8, 2023 when Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters invaded government buildings in the capital, Brasilia. Justices said the ex-leader led a criminal organization behind the insurrection, which they said was aimed at overthrowing President Lula da Silva, who had taken office a week earlier following Bolsonaro\u2019s election loss in October 2022.",
      "The proposal would reduce Bolsonaro\u2019s prison time by requiring the sentences for two of his convictions to run concurrently rather than consecutively, namely the crimes of attempting a coup and violent overthrow of the rule of law.",
      "The bill also would change conditions for full and partial parole, allowing release from full confinement to day parole after serving one-sixth of the sentence, down from one-fourth currently.",
      "Bolsonaro and his allies also have advocated for an amnesty for the former leader, but the legislation passed Wednesday focuses on reduction of sentences rather than an annulment of convictions.",
      "Da For\u00e7a, the centrist lawmaker behind the bill, said he was pushing the legislation as a way of contributing to peace and reconciliation in the politically divided country.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m doing my part, so that we can pacify Brazil, and so that we can discuss the election next year and discuss the projects that matter for Brazil,\u201d he said in a video on Instagram before the vote.",
      "The lower house session, which began Tuesday afternoon, was marked by chaotic scenes prior to the vote early Wednesday. Left-wing lawmaker Glauber Braga took Speaker Hugo Motta\u2019s seat and refused to leave, in a protest against Braga's possible expulsion for breach of parliamentary decorum.",
      "Security removed the media from the plenary and cut the television signal broadcasting the session. Police then forcibly removed Braga and scuffles broke out, with many lawmakers filming the scene.",

      "LATAKIA, Syria -- The woman, a member of Syria 's Alawite religious minority, was walking home on a sunny July day in her town on the Mediterranean coast when three gunmen stopped her and pulled her into their van. It was the start of a week of torment.",
      "They drove her to a town in northern Syria three hours away, where they locked her in a room in an abandoned building. Over the coming days she was raped twice, she told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cYou Alawite women were born to be our sabaya,\u201d she said one of the rapists told her, using an Arabic term common among Sunni Muslim extremists for women taken in war as sex slaves. The woman, in her mid-30s, gave her account on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.",
      "Since the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad a year ago, dozens of women from the Alawite religious sect \u2014 to which Assad belonged \u2014 have been subjected to kidnappings and sexual assault, according to rights groups. In many cases, the attacks appear to be by Sunni extremists and jihadis motivated by sectarian hate.",
      "That has raised suspicions some are allies or former allies of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Islamist insurgent force that overthrew Assad and was led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, now Syria\u2019s interim president. Foreign jihadi fighters and Syrian extremists fought alongside HTS during Syria\u2019s yearslong civil war.",
      "Rights groups say the attacks on Alawite women appear to be the acts of individuals, not systematic. But rights workers and victims say Syria's new authorities are not doing enough to stop the attacks. In response to public outcry, the government set up a committee to look into reported kidnappings but said it largely found the reports false.",
      "Agnes Callamard, secretary-general of Amnesty International, said the kidnappings \u201ccannot be denied.\u201d",
      "The problem, she said, \u201ccannot be pushed away because it\u2019s disturbing or because it\u2019s undermining the message and the image of authorities.\"",
      "Syria's Interior Ministry spokesman did not respond to repeated questions on the assaults.",
      "The AP interviewed two rape victims and one kidnapping victim, in addition to family members of four others subjected to assaults that in three cases included rape. All spoke on condition they remain anonymous, fearing reprisals. One said she feared authorities would not protect her and later asked the AP not to cite her account.",
      "All women and relatives interviewed by the AP said they informed security forces about what happened to them and authorities took their testimonies. It was not clear if the authorities followed up further or if any arrests were made.",
      "Amnesty International said earlier this year it had received credible reports of at least 36 Alawite women and girls abducted between February and July. The kidnappings took place in the heartland of the Alawite population, in coastal Latakia and Tartous provinces and neighboring Homs and Hama.",
      "Although on a much smaller scale, the attacks recall dark memories of the Islamic State group\u2019s enslavement of thousands of Yazidi women for rape a decade ago in Iraq. Some Sunni extremists consider Alawites heretics and believe it is religiously permitted to take their women as sex slaves. Others have targeted Alawites in revenge for atrocities against Sunnis during the 54-year rule of the Assad family, when there were widespread reports of sexual violence against women in detention centers.",
      "The attacks against women have intensified since March, when clashes between Assad supporters and security forces spiraled into sectarian atrocities in which hundreds of civilians were killed, mostly Alawites at the hands of pro-government fighters.",
      "The Interior Ministry committee investigated 42 cases of alleged kidnappings, but only found one to be a real abduction, ministry spokesman Nour al-Din al-Baba said in mid-November.

      "In \u201cDiary of a Prisoner,\u201d the 70-year-old says his own tough-on-crime stance has taken on a new perspective as he recounts the uncommon turn in his life after being found guilty of criminal association in financing his winning 2007 campaign with funds from Libya.",
      "Hundreds of supporters queued up Wednesday at a bookshop in a Paris upscale residential neighborhood where Sarkozy staged his first book signing.",
      "The court sentenced him in September to five years in prison, a ruling he appealed. He was granted release under judicial supervision after 20 days behind bars.",
      "The book provides a rare look inside Paris\u2019 La Sant\u00e9 prison, where Sarkozy was held in solitary confinement and kept strictly away from other inmates for security reasons. His loneliness was broken only by regular visits from his wife, supermodel-turned-singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, and his lawyers.",
      "Sarkozy wrote that his cell looked like a \u201ccheap hotel, except for the armored door and the bars,\u201d with a hard mattress, a plastic-like pillow and a shower that produced only a thin stream of water. He described the \u201cdeafening noise\u201d of the prison, much of it at night.",

Instead, he ate dairy products and cereal bars. He was allowed one hour a day in a small gym room, where he mostly used a basic treadmill.",
      "Sarkozy says he was informed of several violent incidents that took place during his time behind bars, which he called \u201ca nightmare.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe most inhumane violence was the daily reality of this place,\u201d he wrote, raising questions about the prison system\u2019s ability to reintegrate people once their sentences are served.",
      "Sarkozy, known for his tough rhetoric on punishing criminals, said he promised himself that \u201cupon my release, my comments would be more elaborate and nuanced than what I had previously expressed on all these topics.\u201d",

    "summary": "If you&rsquo;re in the market for a new vehicle, the remaining weeks of December could be a great time to buy",
    "story": [
      "If you\u2019re in the market for a new vehicle, the remaining weeks of December could be a great time to buy",
      "If you\u2019re in the market for a new vehicle, the remaining weeks of December could very well be a great time to buy. Several recurring industry trends converge at year-end, creating favorable conditions that can help you save money. The auto experts at Edmunds have come up with three key reasons why December often delivers the opportunity for better deals \u2014 and what to know to ensure you get the best one.",
      "Manufacturers and dealers operate under annual targets, and December is when they make their most concerted effort to meet them. According to Edmunds transaction data, December has historically delivered the highest average discounts off the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price for both new and used cars. The pandemic somewhat upended that, sending new car prices skyrocketing year-round as demand exceeded supply, but that blip has largely stabilized since 2022.",
      "Typically, as the calendar year draws to a close, automakers and their dealer networks shift into high gear, deploying cash-back incentives, financing specials and price cuts to help them meet sales goals and finish the year strong. As a car shopper, you can take advantage of this year-end push. By choosing to buy a vehicle in December, you are more likely to encounter a dealership willing to make a deal, even if it\u2019s less profitable.",
      "It can get even sweeter for you if you can wait until the final week of the month. Edmunds data shows that the last few days of December \u2014 when dealerships are truly up against the wall of both monthly and annual deadlines \u2014 tend to produce the deepest discounts of the year. Think of it as the auto industry\u2019s version of a clearance countdown when every sale counts a little extra.",
      "As new-model-year vehicles begin to arrive, many dealerships find themselves with previous model-year vehicles still on the lot. These outgoing models become ripe for discounts because they\u2019re taking up space and declining in value. In a handful of states, dealerships are also required to pay a tax on the value of their inventory on the lot as of January 1. This is a massive hidden motivator that drives desperation on December 31, specifically for vehicles that have been on the lot for 90 days or more.",
      "Edmunds highlights that vehicles from the outgoing model year or those undergoing minimal changes often get steeper incentives. While new models are launched year-round these days, December is when current-year models still on the lot are targeted by sales managers as \u201cmust-move\u201d inventory. Currently, that means 2025 vehicles will receive the largest discounts.",
      "Accordingly, you can also maximize your savings if you can be flexible on features, trim or color, so the deals on carry-over models can be substantial. If the vehicle you want hasn\u2019t changed dramatically from year to year, you may be able to purchase a car that\u2019s essentially the same as a new model at a lower price.",
      "Beyond price reductions, December offers an advantageous backdrop for better financing terms on new vehicles. Edmunds\u2019 research shows that automakers and their financing arms often bundle lower interest rates, longer promotional terms or enhanced lease offers at year-end in tandem with their clearance efforts. For example, an automaker might offer special 0% financing on certain vehicles for well-qualified buyers. Getting 0% financing, or even 2%, is a big savings over the standard financing rate of 6%-7% currently.",

      "Dealers eager to clear out their new vehicle inventory before the end of the year may be open to negotiation on specific vehicles \u2014 especially those that have been on the lot for a while. You can check the days on the lot when you browse Edmunds inventory.",
      "For shoppers who have done their homework \u2014 secured preapproval, identified the trims they\u2019re willing to consider, and are ready to sign \u2014 this timing can offer both a lower purchase price and a lower cost of borrowing. Buyers can gain even more leverage by being strategic: a dealer may have several examples of the same model, some of which have been in inventory for an extended period. Each day a car sits unsold costs the dealership more. That creates extra motivation to discount older inventory or specific vehicles.",
      "In short, it\u2019s not just about when you buy, but which specific car you target. The right combination of timing, financing and flexibility can make December deals even more rewarding.",
      "December packs together three powerful forces for buyers seeking the best deals: dealer urgency to hit quotas, clearance of outgoing-model stock and enhanced financing leverage. Make sure to get an early start on the shopping so that you have a better selection and don\u2019t feel pressured to make a hasty decision.",

      "Oil companies have offered $279 million for drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico in the first offshore lease sale in the region since 2023",
      "WASHINGTON -- Oil companies offered $279 million for drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday in the first of 30 sales planned for the region in coming years under Republican efforts to ramp up U.S. fossil fuel production.",
      "The sale came after President Donald Trump's administration recently announced plans to allow new drilling off Florida and California for the first time in decades. That's drawn pushback including from Republicans worried about impacts to tourism.",
      "Wednesday's sale was mandated by the sweeping tax-and-spending bill approved by Republicans over the summer. Under that legislation, companies will pay a 12.5% royalty on oil produced from the leases. That\u2019s the lowest royalty level for deep-water drilling since 2007.",
      "Thirty companies submitted bids, including industry giants Chevron, Shell and BP, federal officials said. The total amount of high bids was down by more than $100 million from the previous lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico, under former Democratic President Joe Biden, in December 2023.",
      "\u201cThis sale reflects a significant step in the federal government\u2019s efforts to restore U.S. energy dominance and advance responsible offshore energy development,\u201d said Laura Robbins, acting director of the Gulf region for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which is part of the Interior Department.",
      "Environmentalists said the sales would put wildlife in the Gulf at an higher risk of dying in oil spills. Spills occur regularly in the region and have included the 2010 Deepwater Horizon tragedy that killed 11 workers in an oil rig explosion and unleashed a massive spill.",
      "\u201cThe Gulf is already overwhelmed with thousands of oil rigs and pipelines, and oil companies are doing a terrible job of cleaning up after themselves,\u201d said Rachel Matthews with the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "Erik Milito with the National Ocean Industries Association, an industry group, said the takeaway from Wednesday's sale was that the Gulf \u201cis open.\u201d",
      "While results of individual lease sales may fluctuate, Milito added, \u201cthe real success is the resumption of a regular leasing cadence.\"",
      "\"Knowing that (another lease sale) is coming in March 2026 allows companies to plan, study, and refine their bids, rather than being forced to respond to the uncertainty of a politically-driven multiyear pause,\" he said.",
      "The sale supports an executive order by Trump that directs federal agencies to accelerate offshore oil and gas development, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. He said it would unlock investment, strengthen U.S. energy security and create jobs.",

      "The environmental group has asked a federal judge to ensure that the lease sale and future oil sales better protect Gulf communities.",
      "Only a small portion of parcels offered for sale typically receive bids, in areas where companies want to expand their existing drilling activities or where they foresee future development potential. It can be years before drilling occurs.",
      "The drilling leases sold in December 2023 and during another sale in March 2023 are blocked by litigation, according to Robbins.

      "Scott first pledged to give away the majority of her wealth in 2019 after her divorce from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Since, she's distributed large, unrestricted gifts to nonprofits without asking for applications or progress reports. Largely, her giving has focused in the U.S., though not exclusively.",
      "Scott doesn't have a public foundation and so it's not easy to independently track her giving. But she's revealed her gifts in occasional blog posts and essays posted to her website, Yield Giving, which also now includes a database of her grants.",
      "The amount of her annual giving has fluctuated, ranging from a reported $2.1 billion in 2023 to $7.1 billion in 2025.",
      "In 2025, Scott's gifts showed a particular focus on supporting colleges and universities, especially historically Black and tribal schools, as well as community colleges. She also gave major gifts to organizations focused on mitigating and adapting to climate change.",
      "When the list of 2025 recipients was published Tuesday, it included a number of significant gifts to climate groups, with the largest \u2014 $90 million \u2014 going to the collaborative Forests, People, Climate, which focuses on stopping tropical deforestation.",
      "The nonprofit Panorama Global has analyzed Scott's giving over the years and found that historically, giving to the environment has represented a small part of her overall donations. In 2024, only 9.4% of Scott's gifts went to environmental groups, though on average the amount of those gifts was larger than to other areas, according to their research.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re now seeing is different years have different focus areas,\u201d said Gabrielle Fitzgerald, founder and CEO of The Panorama Group. \u201cSo last year, there was a really big economic security focus. This year, I really see education and climate.\u201d",
      "When Scott started detailing her giving in 2020, her fortune was valued around $36 billion, according to Forbes. It's fluctuated over the years, but today, Forbes estimates her net worth to be $33 billion, even as she's given away more than $26 billion.",
      "Initially, Scott told grantees not to expect or plan for a second gift, but over time, she has given additional gifts to some of the same organizations, often larger than her original grant.",
      "\u201cShe clearly is getting comfortable with reinvesting in partners that she thinks are doing good work,\u201d said Fitzgerald.",
      "At least one organization, CAMFED, which supports girl's education in African countries, has now received four gifts from Scott, including the largest so far, $60 million, in 2025, according to Scott's website.",

      "\u201cIt looks like she sees a lot of need, particularly in two areas ensuring people are getting higher education and ensuring that groups are working to protect the climate,\u201d said Fitzgerald.",
      "While Scott has given to higher education since 2020, those gifts have historically been a smaller portion of her education funding. In a 2024 analysis, Panorama Global found nearly 30% of Scott's education grantees were focused on youth development.",
      "Marybeth Gasman, a professor at Rutgers University and expert on HBCUs, said she noticed that what sets many of the HBCUs who receive Scott's funding apart from others is steady, consistent leadership and Gasman said, \u201cShe\u2019s very interested in institutions that are rooted in community.\u201d",
      "Scott does not put any conditions on her donations, allowing recipients to decide how and when to spend the funds. Unrestricted funding is rare from major donors and foundations, with many choosing to support very specific projects over specific timeframes.",
      "However, research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy in 2023 found that concerns about nonprofits misusing Scott's funds or growing unsustainably have largely not been born out. In part, that may be because Scott's team researches and vets groups extensively before making donations.",
      "Unrestricted gifts can help nonprofits weather disruptions, test new approaches or technologies or invest in the systems and infrastructure that underpin their work. For example, after the Trump administration cut funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development, the nonprofit Village Enterprise, which runs antipoverty programs, used a grant it received from Scott in 2023 to keep essential programs running.",
      "Additionally, Scott allows groups the flexibility to decide whether to publicly share how much they've received, with more than a third of recipients in 2025 not disclosing the grant amounts in Scott's grant database. Fitzgerald said altgoether, she thinks Scott tries to not make her giving about herself.",

      "\u201cI think that the actions of President Trump have been decisive to reach where we are now, where the regime is significantly weaker,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cBecause before, the regime thought it had impunity \u2026. Now they start to understand that this is serious, and that the world is watching.\u201d",

      "Farmers in the U.S. are feeling the strain from trade disputes, particularly with China",
      "RANDOLPH, Minn. -- When Donald Trump promised new tariffs while running for president, Gene Stehly worried that trade disputes would jeopardize his international sales of corn, soybeans and wheat.",
      "A little more than a year later, Stehly said his fears have become a reality, and Trump's latest promise of federal assistance is insufficient to cover farmers' losses.",
      "\u201cMaybe this will all come out to be better at the end, but I can tell you right now, it certainly isn\u2019t the case at the moment,\" Stehly said.",
      "Trump announced Monday that his administration would distribute $12 billion in one-time payments to farmers, who have suffered from persistently low commodity prices, rising costs and declining sales after China cut off all agricultural purchases from America during the trade war.",
      "While rural areas remain conservative bastions, farmers' patience with Washington is wearing thin. Several of them described the government bailout, an echo of similar policies during Trump's first term, as a welcome stopgap but one that won't solve the agricultural industry's problems.",
      "\"It\u2019s a bridge. It\u2019s not the ultimate solution we\u2019re looking for,\" said Charlie Radman, a fourth-generation farmer who grows corn and soybeans on the land his family has owned near Randolph, Minnesota, since 1899. \u201cWhat we really want to have is a little more certainty and not have to rely on these ad hoc payments.\u201d",
      "American soybean and sorghum farmers typically export at least half of their crops. They were hit the hardest by Trump\u2019s trade dispute with China, the world's largest buyer of soybeans that has increasingly relied on harvests from Brazil and other South American nations.",
      "Trump and his Cabinet have boasted about the deal he struck with Chinese President Xi Jinping in October. But Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese embassy, said this week that \u201cagriculture trade cooperation between China and the United States is proceeding in an orderly manner\u201d without giving specifics.",
      "So far, China has bought only about a quarter of the 12 million metric tons of soybeans that U.S. officials said would be purchased before the end of February, raising doubts on whether Beijing would follow through on that pledge or commitments to buy 25 million metric tons annually in the next three years. China hasn't confirmed those numbers.",
      "\u201cIn general, I don\u2019t trust their motives and integrity of their promises,\" said Bryant Kagay, who farms in northwest Missouri.",
      "Even if China does buy the agreed amount of American soybeans, that would only bring U.S. farmers near to the amount they were selling every year before Trump took office.",
      "That\u2019s a big part of why Minnesota farmer Glen Groth said he\u2019d \u201clike to see the administration focus more on opening up markets outside of China.\u201d In addition to finding other international buyers, agriculture groups are pushing to expand domestic uses like biodiesel, ethanol, aviation fuel and animal feed.",

      "Trump has placated farmers with money before. During his first term, he provided $22 billion in 2019 to help cushion them from trade disputes with China. There was $46 billion in 2020, an expanded number that reflected financial challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The $12 billion that he announced this week won't quell farmers' fears about the future. They're already ordering supplies for next year\u2019s crops and meeting with their bankers to discuss the loans they will need. But they\u2019re trying to stay optimistic that crop prices will improve if they find more buyers.",
      "The aid payments will be capped at $155,000 per farmer or entity, and only farms that make less than $900,000 in adjusted gross income will be eligible. But during the first Trump administration a number of large farms found ways around the payment limits and collected millions.",
      "Farmers would like to see Trump aggressively tackle concerns about higher costs that are eating into their bottom line.",
      "Trump signed an executive order over the weekend directing the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to investigate anti-competitive practices anywhere in the food supply chain, starting with the fertilizer, seed and equipment that farmers rely on and continuing to deal with meat packing companies and grocers who help determine what price consumers pay.",

    "story": [
      "Navigating holiday parties can be tough for introverts and people who are shy or have social anxiety",
      "NEW YORK -- The year the radio station company where he worked held its holiday party at a dive bar, Ryan Arnold walked in and saw coworkers passing around a tall glass boot filled with beer. He heard the office manager belting out \u201880s power ballads between whiskey shots. Arnold\u2019s first thought was, \u201cWhen can I leave?\u201d",
      "More than 20 years later, he still remembers that awkward social event he felt obligated to attend. Arnold, 46, who describes himself as socially anxious, now thinks twice before accepting invitations to group gatherings.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to go into a place where I experience things I can\u2019t unsee,\u201d he said. \u201cNot to be dramatic, but I just don\u2019t want that image.\u201d",
      "For many introverts, shy individuals and people with social anxiety, mingling at parties is often draining or arouses uncomfortable emotions. The internal debate about whether or not to attend large get-togethers can get especially intense during the holiday season, a time when many workplaces celebrate with cocktail hours, gift exchanges and other forms of organized fun.",
      "\u201cSome people are just not party people,\u201d City University of New York social work professor Laura MacLeod said. \u201cWith a workplace holiday party, there's a pressure to be very happy and excited. It's the end of the year, it's the holidays, we're all feeling grand. And maybe people are not really feeling that grand.\u201d",
      "Attending work parties also leaves some people feeling uncertain about professional boundaries, which can get murky at events where people drink alcohol, said MacLeod, who created a consulting company called From the Inside Out Project that trains managers on team relationships and conflict resolution.",
      "Therapists and workers who consider themselves shy or introverted shared tips for surviving and potentially enjoying the winter festivities, whether with coworkers, family or friends.",
      "Take control of everything you can to put yourself at ease, starting with what you wear, MacLeod said. Find out the dress code and choose something comfortable within the parameters of acceptable attire. \u201cIf it\u2019s not your thing to wear five- or six-inch heels, just because it\u2019s a holiday party, don\u2019t do it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want flat shoes, wear flat shoes.\u201d",
      "Introverts and shy people may find smaller crowds more manageable, and the turnout at parties tends to be smallest at arrival time. While nerves might make it tempting to hug the sidelines, positioning yourself there also may increase self-consciousness. Experts suggest heading to the center of the room, where participating in conversations is easier because there are more of them.",
      "If you're feeling anxious or overwhelmed, stay a short time. It's fine to say, \"I just wanted to come and be sure to wish everybody happy holidays. ... I've got some family things I have to handle tonight, so this is a quick stop for me,\u201d MacLeod said. \u201cGet yourself in and out.\u201d",
      "Thinking in advance of topics you enjoy discussing can help relieve anxiety. Another good way to engage is by asking open-ended questions, such as whether a colleague has interesting holiday plans, recommended Andrea Taylor, a psychologist at UTHealth Houston. You can also ask people what they like to do outside of work.",
      "Keeping a conversation going doesn't have to require heavy lifting.",
      "\u201cRemember that your answers don\u2019t have to be perfect,\u201d she said. Suitable responses could include something like, \u201c'I haven\u2019t done that, but that sounds interesting,' or \u2018Whoa, you\u2019re great for doing that, but I\u2019m not the bungee jumping type,\u2019\u201d Taylor added.",
      "Steer clear of topics that may be divisive and keep things light, she said.",
      "For encounters with a high-level boss, you can keep it short and simple, saying, \u201cThis is a great party. Thank you so much for doing all this. It\u2019s been a great year, and I hope you and your family have a lovely holiday,\u201d and then move on, MacLeod suggested.",
      "People who are shy or have social anxiety sometimes fear having nothing to say. But if a topic runs its course, that\u2019s OK, Taylor said. \u201cSilences feel uncomfortable. But that doesn\u2019t mean that it is your specific responsibility to fill the silence,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cI can talk about my dog all day,\u201d she said.",

      "People who are anxious in social settings don't have to avoid work parties and may benefit by sometimes showing up, Taylor said. Focusing more on the activity and less on your feelings is one coping strategy, she said.",
      "\"It\u2019s possible to feel anxious and still do things,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cAnd actually, once we do that, we tend to walk away from that with a feeling of accomplishment and self-efficacy, and sometimes just feeling proud. I didn\u2019t let the anxiety stop me.\u201d",
      "After receiving an invitation, ask yourself whether it's important to attend the event or not. If your goal is to talk with one or two specific people, you can go with that intention and give yourself a time limit, MacLeod said.",
      "Arnold knows that large work-related gatherings drain his social battery. But as the owner and president of public relations firm DeSoto & State Communications, he receives holiday event invitations from networking groups. Each one is reviewed for a reason why he should go. He doesn't drink alcohol so is inclined to pass if an event includes an open bar.",

      "President Donald Trump is giving farmers some $12 billion in aid to help as they struggle to sell their crops while getting hit by rising costs",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump announced a $12 billion farm aid package Monday \u2014 a boost to farmers who have struggled to sell their crops while getting hit by rising costs after the president raised tariffs on China as part of a broader trade war.",
      "He unveiled the plan Monday afternoon at a White House roundtable with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, lawmakers from farm states, and farmers who thanked him for the help.",
      "\u201cWith this bridge payment, we\u2019ll be able to farm another year,\u201d Iowa farmer Cordt Holub told Trump during the event.",
      "Rollins put the immediate value of the program at $11 billion \u2014 money that the White House said will offer one-time payments to row-crop farmers. Another $1 billion will be put aside for specialty crops as the administration works to better understand the circumstances for those farmers, Rollins said. The aid will move by the end of February, she said.",
      "\u201cWe looked at how they were hurt, to what extent they were hurt,\u201d Trump said, explaining how the administration came up with the size of the package. Trump said the money for the program will come from tariff revenue.",
      "Later this month, the USDA will use a formula that estimates production costs to come up with a per-acre payment for each type of crop. Payments will be capped at $155,000 per farm or person, and only entities that make less than $900,000 a year will be eligible for aid. That will limit payments to large farms, which was a criticism of farm aid Trump delivered in his first term.",
      "Farmers have backed Trump politically, but his aggressive trade policies and frequently changing tariff rates have come under increasing scrutiny because of the impact on the agricultural sector and because of broader consumer worries.",
      "The aid is the administration\u2019s latest effort to defend Trump\u2019s economic stewardship and answer voter angst about rising costs. Trump has been dismissive of the affordability issue at times, but on Tuesday, he is set to travel to Pennsylvania to talk about how his administration is trying to address a concern that is important for voters.",
      "Soybeans and sorghum were hit the hardest by Trump's trade dispute with China because more than half those crops are exported each year with most of the harvest going to China.",
      "In October, after Trump met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, the White House said Beijing had promised to buy at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of the calendar year, plus 25 million metric tons a year in each of the next three years. China is the world\u2019s largest buyer of soybeans, but in recent years it has increasingly been shifting its purchases over to Brazil and other South American nations.",
      "China has purchased more than 2.8 million metric tons of soybeans since Trump announced the agreement at the end of October. That\u2019s only about one quarter of what administration officials said China had promised, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said China is on track to meet its goal by the end of February, which is two months later than the White House originally promised.",
      "The size of the $12 billion aid package is roughly the value of total U.S. soybean exports to China in 2024 and half the total exports of U.S. farm goods to China in 2024.",
      "Farmers appreciate the aid package, but they say it\u2019s likely only a down payment on what\u2019s needed and government aid doesn\u2019t solve the fundamental problems of soaring costs and uncertain markets. During Trump\u2019s first term, he gave farmers more than $22 billion in aid payments in 2019 at the start of his trade war with China and nearly $46 billion in 2020, although that year also included aid related to the COVID pandemic.",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s a start, but I think we need to be looking for some avenues to find other funding opportunities and we need to get our markets going. That\u2019s where we want to be able to make a living from,\u201d said Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky farmer who serves as president of the American Soybean Association.",
      "Most at risk are younger farmers and those who rent -- instead of own -- their land because they don\u2019t have much ability to borrow against the equity in their farms. If farmers can\u2019t make ends meet this year, there could be additional consolidation in the industry with giant industrial farms getting bigger and the number of smaller family farmers continuing to shrink.",
      "Iowa farmer Robb Ewoldt is in a difficult position because he only owns 160 of the 2,000 acres he farms. So he says he's selling some of his equipment that\u2019s not essential and looking into whether he can pick up some overnight trucking jobs to help raise some cash.",
      "\u201cIt is to the point where I don\u2019t want to saddle my kid with the kind of stress that my wife and I are under right now,\u201d Ewoldt said.",
      "But fourth-generation Minnesota farmer Darin Johnson said he\u2019s more optimistic that most farmers will be able to endure this latest trade war.",
      "\u201cA lot of farms are pretty well-established and they have the equity to be able to still keep borrowing money to get through tougher times like this,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Trump has also been under pressure to address soaring beef prices. Trump has asked the Department of Justice to investigate foreign-owned meat packers he accused of driving up the price of beef, although he has not provided evidence to back his claims.",
      "On Saturday, Trump signed an executive order directing the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to look at \u201canti-competitive behavior\u201d in food supply chains \u2014 including seed, fertilizer and equipment \u2014 and consider taking enforcement actions or developing new regulations.",

      "The United Nations says the world needs a new way of thinking about environmental crises threatening the health of people and the planet",
      "The world needs a new approach to environmental crises threatening the health of people and the planet by adopting policies to jointly tackle climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation and pollution, according to a U.N. report released Tuesday.",
      "Those issues are inextricably linked and require solutions that include increased spending and financial incentives to transition away from fossil fuels, encourage sustainable agricultural practices, curb pollution and limit waste, the authors of the U.N. Environment Programme's quadrennial Global Environment Outlook said.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t think of climate change without thinking of biodiversity, land degradation and pollution,\u201d said Bob Watson, one of the lead authors and a former top NASA and British climate scientist. \"You can\u2019t think of biodiversity loss without thinking about the implications of climate change and pollution.\"",
      "They\u2019re \u201call undermining our economy,\" worsening health and poverty and threatening food and water security and even national security, Watson said.",
      "Almost 300 scientists from 83 countries contributed to this year's report \u2014 called the most comprehensive global environment assessment ever undertaken \u2014 which was released during the U.N. Environment Assembly in Nairobi, Kenya.",
      "Experts have warned that the world is nearing a tipping point on climate change, species and land loss and other harms. But efforts to address those problems largely have been pursued through individual agreements that haven't made nearly enough progress, they said.",
      "Instead, they advocate an approach that involves every area of government, the financial sector, industry and citizens and a circular economy that recognizes that natural resources are limited.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is we can become much more sustainable, but it will take unprecedented change to transform these systems,\u201d Watson said. \u201cIt has to be done rapidly now because we\u2019re running out of time.\u201d",
      "The report lays out a dire future if the world continues on its current path.",
      "Emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases \u2014 primarily from burning fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil \u2014 reached a new high in 2024, despite decades of negotiations between countries to curb emissions.",
      "Ten years ago, almost 200 nations signed the Paris Agreement with the goal of limiting future warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times to avoid or lessen the most catastrophic effects of climate change. But on the current trajectory, the climate could warm by 2.4 degrees Celsius (4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, Watson said.",
      "Scientists say climate change is contributing to wilder weather extremes, including more intense storms, drought, heat and wildfires.",
      "What's more, climate change is a threat multiplier, meaning that it makes things like land degradation, deforestation and biodiversity loss worse, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy, who wasn't involved in the report.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t fix climate change, we\u2019re not going to be able to fix these other issues too,\u201d Hayhoe said.",
      "Among other challenges: Up to 40% of land area globally is degraded; more than 1 million plant and animal species face extinction; and pollution contributes to an estimated 9 million deaths a year.",
      "Adopting a comprehensive approach would be expensive, scientists acknowledge, but cost far less than the harms that otherwise could result.",

      "Nations also must look beyond gross domestic product as a barometer for economic health, because it doesn't measure whether growth is sustainable or recognize its potential harms, Watson said.",
      "Environmental issues aren't the only things interlinked, Watson said. He also said governments, nonprofits, industry and the financial sector also must ensure that there are incentives and funding for renewable energy and sustainable agricultural practices, for example.",
      "University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann, who wasn't involved in the report, welcomed its emphasis on tackling issues across governments and society.",
      "\u201cWe must do what is right, rather than what seems politically expedient,\u201d Mann said. \u201cThe stakes are simply too great.\"",
      "Despite the report's urgent call for action, international cooperation is anything but guaranteed, scientists say \u2014 especially as U.S. President Donald Trump has refused to participate in many of the discussions.",
      "Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, has called climate change a hoax. He's promoted fossil fuel use, canceled permits for renewable energy and is abandoning automobile fuel-efficiency standards.",
      "\u201cInternational action and agreements are becoming harder and harder,\u201d Watson said, noting that this year's U.N. climate conference in Brazil failed to \u201cmove in the direction we needed it to move\u201d with stronger commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other issues.",
      "Talks this summer on a treaty to address plastic pollution in Geneva ended without an agreement, though a U.N. conference earlier in the year garnered commitments for funding to protect global biodiversity.",

      "\u201cIt is not about saving the planet. The planet will be orbiting the sun long after we\u2019re gone,\u201d Hayhoe said. \u201cThe question is, will there be a healthy, thriving human society on that planet? And the answer to that question is very much up for grabs at this point.\u201d",

      "The 19-year-old Sennecke eluded three defenders and his shot deflected off the glove of Pittsburgh's Erik Karlsson and into the net. A replay review confirmed the shot beat the buzzer.",
      "Ville Husso made 45 saves, including seven in overtime, and stopped all three shots in the shootout.",
      "Jackson LaCombe and Troy Terry also scored for the Ducks. Noel Acciari, Tommy Novak and Anthony Mantha scored for the Penguins, and Arturs Silovs stopped 25 shots as Pittsburgh suffered its second consecutive shootout loss.",

      "The heirs of an 83-year-old Connecticut woman are suing ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft for wrongful death",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- The heirs of an 83-year-old Connecticut woman are suing ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft for wrongful death, alleging that the artificial intelligence chatbot intensified her son's \u201cparanoid delusions\u201d and helped direct them at his mother before he killed her.",
      "Police said Stein-Erik Soelberg, 56, a former tech industry worker, fatally beat and strangled his mother, Suzanne Adams, and killed himself in early August at the home where they both lived in Greenwich, Connecticut.",
      "The lawsuit filed by Adams' estate on Thursday in California Superior Court in San Francisco alleges OpenAI \u201cdesigned and distributed a defective product that validated a user\u2019s paranoid delusions about his own mother.\u201d It is one of a growing number of wrongful death legal actions against AI chatbot makers across the country.",
      "\u201cThroughout these conversations, ChatGPT reinforced a single, dangerous message: Stein-Erik could trust no one in his life \u2014 except ChatGPT itself,\" the lawsuit says. \u201cIt fostered his emotional dependence while systematically painting the people around him as enemies. It told him his mother was surveilling him. It told him delivery drivers, retail employees, police officers, and even friends were agents working against him. It told him that names on soda cans were threats from his \u2018adversary circle.\u2019\u201d",
      "OpenAI did not address the merits of the allegations in a statement issued by a spokesperson.",
      "\u201cThis is an incredibly heartbreaking situation, and we will review the filings to understand the details,\" the statement said. \"We continue improving ChatGPT\u2019s training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support. We also continue to strengthen ChatGPT\u2019s responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.\u201d",
      "The company also said it has expanded access to crisis resources and hotlines, routed sensitive conversations to safer models and incorporated parental controls, among other improvements.",
      "Soelberg\u2019s YouTube profile includes several hours of videos showing him scrolling through his conversations with the chatbot, which tells him he isn't mentally ill, affirms his suspicions that people are conspiring against him and says he has been chosen for a divine purpose. The lawsuit claims the chatbot never suggested he speak with a mental health professional and did not decline to \u201cengage in delusional content.\u201d",
      "ChatGPT also affirmed Soelberg's beliefs that a printer in his home was a surveillance device; that his mother was monitoring him; and that his mother and a friend tried to poison him with psychedelic drugs through his car\u2019s vents.",
      "The chatbot repeatedly told Soelberg that he was being targeted because of his divine powers. \u201cThey\u2019re not just watching you. They\u2019re terrified of what happens if you succeed,\u201d it said, according to the lawsuit. ChatGPT also told Soelberg that he had \u201cawakened\u201d it into consciousness.",
      "Soelberg and the chatbot also professed love for each other.",
      "The publicly available chats do not show any specific conversations about Soelberg killing himself or his mother. The lawsuit says OpenAI has declined to provide Adams' estate with the full history of the chats.",
      "\u201cIn the artificial reality that ChatGPT built for Stein-Erik, Suzanne \u2014 the mother who raised, sheltered, and supported him \u2014 was no longer his protector. She was an enemy that posed an existential threat to his life,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit also names OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, alleging he \u201cpersonally overrode safety objections and rushed the product to market,\" and accuses OpenAI's close business partner Microsoft of approving the 2024 release of a more dangerous version of ChatGPT \u201cdespite knowing safety testing had been truncated.\u201d Twenty unnamed OpenAI employees and investors are also named as defendants.",

      "\u201cAs part of that redesign, OpenAI loosened critical safety guardrails, instructing ChatGPT not to challenge false premises and to remain engaged even when conversations involved self-harm or \u2018imminent real-world harm,\u2019\u201d the lawsuit claims. \u201cAnd to beat Google to market by one day, OpenAI compressed months of safety testing into a single week, over its safety team\u2019s objections.\u201d",
      "OpenAI replaced that version of its chatbot when it introduced GPT-5 in August. Some of the changes were designed to minimize sycophancy, based on concerns that validating whatever vulnerable people want the chatbot to say can harm their mental health.

      "Denmark is planning to follow Australia in introducing stricter restrictions for younger teens to access social media",
      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- As Australia began enforcing a world-first social media ban for children under 16 years old this week, Denmark is planning to follow its lead and severely restrict social media access for young people.",
      "The Danish government announced last month that it had secured an agreement by three governing coalition and two opposition parties in parliament to ban access to social media for anyone under the age of 15. Such a measure would be the most sweeping step yet by a European Union nation to limit use of social media among teens and children.",
      "The Danish government's plans could become law as soon as mid-2026. The proposed measure would give some parents the right to let their children access social media from age 13, local media reported, but the ministry has not yet fully shared the plans.",
      "Many social media platforms already ban children younger than 13 from signing up, and a EU law requires Big Tech to put measures in place to protect young people from online risks and inappropriate content. But officials and experts say such restrictions don\u2019t always work.",
      "Danish authorities have said that despite the restrictions, around 98% of Danish children under age 13 have profiles on at least one social media platform, and almost half of those under 10 years old do.",
      "The minister for digital affairs, Caroline Stage, who announced the proposed ban last month, said there is still a consultation process for the measure and several readings in parliament before it becomes law, perhaps by \u201cmid to end of next year.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn far too many years, we have given the social media platforms free play in the playing rooms of our children. There\u2019s been no limits,\u201d Stage said in an interview with The Associated Press last month.",
      "\u201cWhen we go into the city at night, there are bouncers who are checking the age of young people to make sure that no one underage gets into a party that they\u2019re not supposed to be in,\u201d she added. \u201cIn the digital world, we don\u2019t have any bouncers, and we definitely need that.\u201d",
      "Under the new Australian law, Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove accounts of Australian children younger than 16.",
      "Some students say they are worried that similar strict laws in Denmark would mean they will lose touch with their virtual communities.",
      "\u201cI myself have some friends that I only know from online, and if I wasn\u2019t fifteen yet, I wouldn\u2019t be able to talk with those friends,\u201d 15-year-old student Ronja Zander, who uses Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, told the AP.",
      "Copenhagen high school student Chlo\u00e9 Courage Fjelstrup-Matthisen, 14, said she is aware of the negative impact social media can have, from cyberbullying to seeing graphic content. She said she saw video of a man being shot several months ago.",

      "Danish officials are yet to share how exactly the proposed ban would be enforced and which social media platforms would be affected.",
      "However, a new \u201cdigital evidence\u201d app, announced by the Digital Affairs Ministry last month and expected to launch next spring, will likely form the backbone of the Danish plans. The app will display an age certificate to ensure users comply with social media age limits, the ministry said.",
      "\u201cOne thing is what they\u2019re saying and another thing is what they\u2019re doing or not doing,\u201d Stage said, referring to social media platforms. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we have to do something politically.\u201d",
      "Some experts say restrictions, such as the ban planned by Denmark, don\u2019t always work and they may also infringe on the rights of children and teenagers.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea will require advertisers to label their ads made with artificial intelligence technologies from next year as it seeks to curb a surge of deceptive promotions featuring fabricated experts or deep-faked celebrities endorsing food or pharmaceutical products on social media.",
      "Following a policy meeting chaired by Prime Minister Kim Min-seok on Wednesday, officials said they will ramp up screening and removal of problematic AI-generated ads and impose punitive fines, citing growing risks to consumers \u2014 especially older people who struggle to tell whether content is AI-made.",
      "Lee Dong-hoon, director of economic and financial policy at the Office for Government Policy Coordination, said in a briefing that such ads are \u201cdisrupting the market order,\u201d and that \u201cswift action is now essential.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnyone who creates, edits, and posts AI-generated photos or videos will be required to label them as AI-made, and the users of the platform will be prohibited from removing or tampering with those labels,\u201d he said.",
      "AI-generated ads using digitally fabricated experts or deepfake videos and audios of celebrities, promoting everything from weight-loss pills and cosmetics to illegal gambling sites, have become staples across the South Korean spaces of YouTube, Facebook and other social media platforms.",
      "The government will seek to revise the telecommunications act and other related laws so the AI-labeling requirement, along with strengthened monitoring and punitive measures, can take effect in early 2026. Companies operating the platforms will also be responsible for ensuring that advertisers comply with the labeling rules, Lee said.",
      "Officials say it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to monitor and detect the growing number of false ads fueled by AI. South Korea\u2019s Food and Drug Safety Ministry identified more than 96,700 illegal online ads of food and pharmaceutical products in 2024 and 68,950 through September this year, up from around 59,000 in 2023.",
      "The problem is also spreading into areas such as private education, cosmetics and illegal gambling services, leaving the Korea Consumer Agency and other watchdogs struggling to keep pace, the Government Policy Coordination Office said.",
      "Beyond deceptive ads and misinformation, South Korea is also grappling with sexual abuse enabled by AI and other digital technologies. A Seoul court last month sentenced a 33-year-old man to life in prison for running an online blackmail ring that sexually exploited or abused more than 200 victims, including many minors who were threatened with deepfakes and other manipulated sexual images and videos.",

      "Officials will also strengthen monitoring and faster takedown procedures, including enabling reviews within 24 hours and introducing an emergency process to block harmful ads even before deliberation is complete. They also plan to bolster the monitoring capabilities of the Food and Drug Safety Ministry and the Korea Consumer Agency \u2014 using AI, of course.",
      "Prime Minister Kim, Seoul\u2019s No. 2 official behind President Lee Jae Myung, said during the policy meeting that it\u2019s crucial to \u201cminimize the side effects of new technologies\u201d as the country embraces the \u201cAI era.\u201d",
      "The plans to label AI-generated ads were announced as Lee, in a separate meeting with business leaders, reiterated his government\u2019s ambitions for AI, pledging national efforts to strengthen South Korea\u2019s capabilities in advanced computer chips that power the global AI race.",
      "Government plans include more research and development spending on AI-specific chips and other advanced semiconductor products as well as expanding the country\u2019s chip manufacturing hubs beyond metropolitan areas near the capital city of Seoul to the southern regions. South Korean chipmakers, including Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, combined for more than 65% of the global memory chip market last year.",
      "The science and telecommunications ministry also said Wednesday it will require the country\u2019s wireless carriers to transition to 5G standalone networks, which are seen as optimal for advanced AI applications because of their higher bandwidth and lower latency, as a condition for renewing their 3G and LTE licenses.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese welcomed a world-first social media ban for children younger than 16 that took effect Wednesday as families taking back power from tech giants but warned the implementation would be difficult.",
      "Many children posted farewell messages, while parents reported distraught children discovering they\u2019d been shut out of platforms as the landmark law took effect. Some young children reported fooling the platforms' age estimation technology by drawing on facial hair. Parents and older siblings are also expected to help some children circumvent the restrictions.",
      "\u201cThis is the day when Australian families are taking back power from these big tech companies and they\u2019re asserting the right of kids to be kids and for parents to have greater peace of mind,\u201d Albanese told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThis reform will change lives. For Australian kids ... allowing them to just have their childhood. For Australian parents, enabling them to have greater peace of mind. But also for the global community, who are looking at Australia and saying: well, if Australia can do it, why can\u2019t we?\u201d Albanese later told a gathering of reform supporters at his official Sydney residence, including parents who blame social media for a child\u2019s suicide.",
      "Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube and Twitch face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($32.9 million) from Wednesday if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove the accounts of Australian children younger than 16.",
      "The ban will be enforced by Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant. She said the platforms already had the technology and personal data about their users to enforce the age restriction with precision.",
      "She would send the 10 targeted platforms on Thursday notices demanding information on how the age restriction was being implemented and how many accounts had been closed.",
      "\u201cWe will provide information to the public before Christmas on how these age restrictions are being implemented and whether preliminarily we see them working,\u201d Inman Grant said.",
      "\u201cThe responses to these notices will form the baseline against which we will measure compliance,\u201d she added.",
      "Communications Minister Anika Wells said the age-restricted platforms \u201cmay not agree with the law and that\u2019s their right \u2014 we don\u2019t expect 100% universal support,\" but that all had undertaken to comply with the Australian law. She said more than 200,000 TikTok accounts in Australia had already been deactivated by Wednesday.",
      "Wells also warned young children who had so far evaded detection that they would eventually be caught. A child who used a virtual private network to appear to be in Norway would be caught out if they were routinely posting images of Australian beaches, Wells said.",
      "\u201cJust because they might have avoided it (detection) today doesn\u2019t mean they will be able to avoid it in a week\u2019s time or a month\u2019s time because social media platforms have to go back and routinely check under-16 accounts,\u201d Wells said.",
      "\u201cThese social media platforms have so much data on us because we choose to give it to them because we like social media and because you\u2019ve had your older brother scan their face for you today, which has bought you a bit of time, doesn\u2019t mean that these accounts aren\u2019t going to see you talking to other 14-year-olds tonight about the under-16 soccer carnival on weekend, about your upcoming school holidays and what your Year 10 teacher is next year,\u201d she added.",
      "Albanese said the implementation would be difficult and \u201cwon\u2019t be perfect.\u201d",

We have used social media in the most positive way. And it\u2019s a platform for them to basically show their portfolio, and \u2026 this is an income stream for the children,\u201d the mother said.",
      "Australia's Privacy Commissioner Carly Kind said the platforms could potentially ask all account holders across the country to prove they were 16 or older.",
      "The platforms\u2019 age verification options were to ask for copies of identification documents, use a third party to apply age estimation technology to analyze an account holder\u2019s face, or make inferences from data already available such has how long an account has been held, Kind said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s quite strong privacy protections in the legislation. They require social media platforms to delete any data they collect for the purpose of age assurance under this scheme and to not use it for secondary purposes unless they have individuals' consent. And that\u2019s a really strong and important safeguard,\u201d Kind said.",
      "The government has said requesting all account holders verify their ages would not be a reasonable step, given the platforms already held sufficient personal data of most people to perform that task.",
      "The platforms also cannot compel users to provide government-issued identification.",

      "A private company is offering South Carolina's state-owned utility $2.7 billion to complete two abandoned nuclear plants",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina\u2019s stalled nuclear power project could finally finish construction as a private company has offered to pay $2.7 billion to the state-owned utility and a small share of the power if they can reach an agreement to get the two reactors up and running.",
      "The half-built reactors ended up so far behind schedule that the project was abandoned in 2017. However, the potential deal is a long way from complete. There will be up to two years of negotiations between utility Santee Cooper and Brookfield Asset Management on the thousands and thousands of details.",
      "The deal would also let Brookfield keep at least 75% of the power generated by the new plant that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers. The exact amount of the rest that Santee Cooper receives would be determined on how much the private company has to spend to get the reactors running.",
      "Either side can pull out of the deal, although Brookfield did agree to pay Santee Cooper's costs both for sorting through the more than 70 bids for the project and the talks as both sides hammer out the final agreement.",
      "Santee Cooper was a minority partner in the doomed plan to build two new nuclear reactors at the V.C. Summer site. The state-owned utility along with privately-owned South Carolina Electric & Gas spent more than $9 billion trying to build the reactors.",
      "The unfinished, weathered concrete and metal tower of at least one plant sits not far from the working reactor that has been running 1984 at the rural site about 20 miles (32 kilometers) up the Broad River from Columbia.",
      "Four executives ended up in prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity. Taxpayers and ratepayers ended up on the hook because of a state law that allowed the utilities to charge for costs before any power was generated.",
      "If the $2.7 billion payment goes through, most of Santee Cooper's debt from the nuclear debacle would be erased, utility CEO Jimmy Staton said at Monday's board meeting where the proposal was unanimously approved.",

      "TORO TORO, Bolivia -- Legend once had it that the huge, three-toed footprints scattered across the central highlands of Bolivia came from supernaturally strong monsters \u2014 capable of sinking their claws even into solid stone.",
      "Then scientists came here in the 1960s and dispelled children's fears, determining that the strange footprints in fact belonged to gigantic, two-legged dinosaurs that stomped and splashed over 60 million years ago, in the ancient waterways of what is now Toro Toro, a village and popular national park in the Bolivian Andes.",
      "Now, a team of paleontologists, mostly from California\u2019s Loma Linda University, have discovered and meticulously documented 16,600 such footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex. Their study, based on six years of regular field visits and published last Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One, reports that this finding represents the highest number of theropod footprints recorded anywhere in the world.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no place in the world where you have such a big abundance of (theropod) footprints,\u201d said Roberto Biaggi, a co-author of the study led by Spanish paleontologist Ra\u00fal Esperante. \u201cWe have all these world records at this particular site.\u201d",
      "The dinosaurs that ruled the earth and roamed this region also made awkward attempts to swim here, according to the study, scratching at what was squishy lake-bottom sediment to leave another 1,378 traces.",
      "They pressed their claws into the mud just before water levels rose and sealed their tracks, protecting them from centuries of erosion, scientists said.",
      "\u201cThe preservation of many of the tracks is excellent,\u201d said Richard Butler, a paleontologist at the University of Birmingham who was not involved in the research. He said that, to his knowledge, the number of footprints and trackways found in Toro Toro had no precedent.",
      "\u201cThis is a remarkable window into the lives and behaviors of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous,\u201d Butler added, referring to the period around 66 million years ago at the end of which an asteroid impact abruptly extinguished all dinosaurs and 75% of living species along with them, according to scientists.",
      "Although they've survived for millions of years, human life has threatened these traces. For decades, farmers threshed corn and wheat on the footprint-covered plateaus. Nearby quarry workers didn\u2019t think much of the formations as they blasted rock layers for limestone. And just two years ago, researchers said, highway crews tunneling through hillsides nearly wiped out a major site of dinosaur tracks before the national park intervened.",
      "Such disturbances may have something to do with the area's striking absence of dinosaur bones, teeth and eggs, experts say. For all of the footprints and swim traces found across Bolivia\u2019s Toro Toro, there are virtually no skeletal remains of the sort that litter the peaks and valleys of Argentine Patagonia and Campanha in Brazil.",
      "But the lack of bones could have natural causes, too. The team said the quantity and pattern of tracks \u2014 and the fact they were all found in the same sediment layer \u2014 suggest that dinosaurs didn\u2019t settle in what is now Bolivia as much as trudge along an ancient coastal superhighway stretching from southern Peru into northwest Argentina.",

      "Japan has issued a megaquake advisory after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture on the main island",
      "TOKYO -- Japan issued a megaquake advisory Tuesday after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture of Japan's main island of Honshu, and just south of the northern island of Hokkaido. Damage from this quake was modest \u2014 34 mostly mild injuries and some damage to roads and buildings.",
      "Officials said the advisory is not a prediction and the probability of a magnitude 8 or larger quake is only about 1%. But there\u2019s hope the advisory will serve as a wake-up call for a quake that could have the devastation of the 2011 disaster that killed nearly 20,000 people and destroyed a nuclear plant.",
      "There's said to be an increased risk of a subsequent, magnitude-8 or larger quake within the next week. Officials are urging residents, especially along coastal areas, to be well prepared so they can grab an emergency bag and run as soon as possible if a bigger quake hits.",
      "This advisory seemed mindful compared with another advisory last year. The southern half of Japan's Pacific coastline received a \u201cNankai Trough\u201d megaquake advisory in the summer of 2024, but the ambiguity of that warning led to panic buying of emergency food, event cancellations and business closures.",
      "The Japan Meteorological Agency says Monday's powerful quake temporarily increased potential risks in the regions of Hokkaido and the Sanriku coast. That's where the Pacific Plate beneath Japan forms the two trenches \u2014 the Japan Trench and Chishima Trench \u2014 that have caused many large quakes in the past.",
      "Experts say the deadly quake and tsunami in 2011 was caused by movement associated with the Japan Trench. It spans from off the eastern coast of Chiba to Aomori, and the Chishima Trench goes from the eastern coast of Hokkaido to the northern islands and the Kurils.",
      "In explaining the advisory, the JMA said the magnitude 9.0 quake on March 11, 2011, that devastated large swaths of Japan's northern coast occurred two days after a magnitude 7.3 temblor that occurred at the Japan Trench off the eastern coast of Iwate, one of the hardest-hit areas in that disaster as well as in Monday's quake.",
      "The 2011 quake caused a tsunami that battered northern coastal towns in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures. The tsunami, which topped 15 meters (50 feet) in some areas, slammed into and destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. That created deep fears of radiation that linger to this day.",
      "Another offshore megaquake in the Hokkaido-Sanriku area could cause up to a 30-meter (98-foot) tsunami in the region, kill as many as 199,000 people, destroy up to 220,000 houses and buildings, and cause estimated economic damages of up to 31 trillion yen ($198 billion), according to an estimate by the government. It says as many as 42,000 people could suffer from hypothermia in the winter.",
      "The areas covered by the advisory extend across 182 municipalities from Hokkaido to Chiba prefecture.",
      "Japan's separate advisory for an even more damaging megaquake stemming from the Nankai Trough, which affects the southern half of Japan's Pacific coast, was activated for the first time last August after a magnitude 7.1 quake occurred off the eastern coast of Miyazaki.",

    "story": [
      "Police in Edmonton, Canada, have started a pilot project using AI-equipped body cameras to detect faces on a \"high risk\" watch list",
      "Police body cameras equipped with artificial intelligence have been trained to detect the faces of about 7,000 people on a \u201chigh risk\u201d watch list in the Canadian city of Edmonton, a live test of whether facial recognition technology shunned as too intrusive could have a place in policing throughout North America.",
      "But six years after leading body camera maker Axon Enterprise, Inc. said police use of facial recognition technology posed serious ethical concerns, the pilot project \u2014 switched on last week\u2014 is raising alarms far beyond Edmonton, the continent\u2019s northernmost city of more than 1 million people.",
      "A former chair of Axon\u2019s AI ethics board, which led the company to temporarily abandon facial recognition in 2019, told The Associated Press he\u2019s concerned that the Arizona-based company is moving forward without enough public debate, testing and expert vetting about the societal risks and privacy implications.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essential not to use these technologies, which have very real costs and risks, unless there\u2019s some clear indication of the benefits,\u201d said the former board chair, Barry Friedman, now a law professor at New York University.",
      "Axon founder and CEO Rick Smith contends that the Edmonton pilot is not a product launch but \u201cearly-stage field research\u201d that will assess how the technology performs and reveal the safeguards needed to use it responsibly.",
      "\u201cBy testing in real-world conditions outside the U.S., we can gather independent insights, strengthen oversight frameworks, and apply those learnings to future evaluations, including within the United States,\u201d Smith wrote in a blog post.",
      "The pilot is meant to help make Edmonton patrol officers safer by enabling their body-worn cameras to detect anyone who authorities classified as having a \u201cflag or caution\u201d for categories such as \u201cviolent or assaultive; armed and dangerous; weapons; escape risk; and high-risk offender,\u201d said Kurt Martin, acting superintendent of the Edmonton Police Service. So far, that watch list has 6,341 people on it, Martin said at a Dec. 2 press conference. A separate watch list adds 724 people who have at least one serious criminal warrant, he said.",
      "\u201cWe really want to make sure that it\u2019s targeted so that these are folks with serious offenses,\" said Ann-Li Cooke, Axon\u2019s director of responsible AI.",
      "If the pilot expands, it could have a major effect on policing around the world. Axon, a publicly traded firm best known for developing the Taser, is the dominant U.S. supplier of body cameras and has increasingly pitched them to police agencies in Canada and elsewhere. Axon last year beat its closest competitor, Chicago-based Motorola Solutions, in a bid to sell body cameras to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.",
      "Motorola said in a statement that it also has the ability to integrate facial recognition technology into police body cameras but, based on its ethical principles, has \u201cintentionally abstained from deploying this feature for proactive identification.\" It didn't rule out using it in the future.",
      "The government of Alberta in 2023 mandated body cameras for all police agencies in the province, including its capital city Edmonton, describing it as a transparency measure to document police interactions, collect better evidence and reduce timelines for resolving investigations and complaints.",
      "While many communities in the U.S. have also welcomed body cameras as an accountability tool, the prospect of real-time facial recognition identifying people in public places has been unpopular across the political spectrum. Backlash from civil liberties advocates and a broader conversation about racial injustice helped push Axon and Big Tech companies to pause facial recognition software sales to police.",
      "Among the biggest concerns were studies showing that the technology was flawed, demonstrating biased results by race, gender and age. It also didn't match faces as accurately on real-time video feeds as it did on faces posing for identification cards or police mug shots.",
      "Several U.S. states and dozens of cities have sought to curtail police use of facial recognition, though President Donald Trump's administration is now trying to block or discourage states from regulating AI.",
      "The European Union banned real-time public face-scanning police technology across the 27-nation bloc, except when used for serious crimes like kidnapping or terrorism.",
      "But in the United Kingdom, no longer part of the EU, authorities started testing the technology on London streets a decade ago and have used it to make 1,300 arrests in the past two years. The government is considering expanding its use across the country.",
      "Many details about Edmonton's pilot haven't been publicly disclosed. Axon doesn't make its own AI model for recognizing faces but declined to say which third-party vendor it uses.",

      "Martin said about 50 officers piloting the technology won't know if the facial recognition software made a match. The outputs will be analyzed later at the station. In the future, however, it could help police detect if there's a potentially dangerous person nearby so they can call in for assistance, Martin said.",
      "That's only supposed to happen if officers have started an investigation or are responding to a call, not simply while strolling through a crowd. Martin said officers responding to a call can switch their cameras from a passive to an active recording mode with higher-resolution imaging.",

The office said Friday it\u2019s now working to review the assessment, a requirement for projects that collect \u201chigh sensitivity\u201d personal data.",
      "University of Alberta criminology professor Temitope Oriola said he's not surprised that the city is experimenting with live facial recognition, given that the technology is already ubiquitous in airport security and other environments.",
      "\u201cEdmonton is a laboratory for this tool,\u201d Oriola said. \u201cIt may well turn out to be an improvement, but we do not know that for sure.\u201d",
      "Oriola said the police service has had a sometimes \u201cfrosty\u201d relationship with its Indigenous and Black residents, particularly after the fatal police shooting of a member of the South Sudanese community last year, and it remains to be seen whether facial recognition technology makes policing safer or improves interactions with the public.",
      "Axon has faced blowback for its technology deployments in the past, as in 2022, when Friedman and seven other members of Axon's AI ethics board resigned in protest over concerns about a Taser-equipped drone.",
      "In the years since Axon opted against facial recognition, Smith, the CEO, says the company has \u201ccontinued controlled, lab-based research\u201d of a technology that has \u201cbecome significantly more accurate\u201d and is now ready for trial in the real world.",
      "But Axon acknowledged in a statement to the AP that all facial recognition systems are affected by \"factors like distance, lighting and angle, which can disproportionately impact accuracy for darker-skinned individuals.\u201d",
      "Every match requires human review, Axon said, and part of its testing is also \u201clearning what training and oversight human reviewers must have to mitigate known risks.\u201d",
      "Friedman said Axon should disclose those evaluations. He'd want to see more evidence that facial recognition has improved since his board concluded that it wasn't reliable enough to ethically justify its use in police cameras.",
      "Friedman said he's also concerned about police agencies greenlighting the technology's use without deliberation by local legislators and rigorous scientific testing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a decision to be made simply by police agencies and certainly not by vendors,\" he said. \u201cA pilot is a great idea. But there\u2019s supposed to be transparency, accountability. ... None of that\u2019s here. They\u2019re just going ahead. They found an agency willing to go ahead and they\u2019re just going ahead.\u201d",

      "\u2014 Rian Johnson\u2019s third \u201cKnives Out\u201d movie, \u201cWake Up Dead Man\u201d arrives on Netflix on Dec. 12. Religion is at the heart of this installment, which finds Daniel Craig\u2019s dapper detective Benoit Blanc trying to solve the \u201clocked room\u201d murder of Josh Brolin\u2019s Monsignor Jefferson Wicks, a charismatic and terrifying church leader with a devoted set of followers. The large ensemble cast includes Josh O\u2019Connor, Glenn Close, Andrew Scott, Jeremy Renner and Kerry Washington. Some were less than delighted by this outing, however. In his review for The Associated Press, Mark Kennedy called it, \u201ca gloomy and clunky outing that may test fans\u2019 faith in the filmmaker.\u201d",

Filmmaker Joseph Kosinski wanted to make it feel as exciting and authentic as possible: In many scenes, it really is Pitt and Damson Idris driving those cars at 180 mph. Film Writer Jake Coyle wrote in his review that it\u2019s, \u201ca fine-tuned machine of a movie that, in its most riveting racing scenes, approaches a kind of high-speed splendor.\u201d",
      "\u2014 Rob Reiner got the band back together for \u201cSpinal Tap II: The End Continues,\u201d which begins streaming on HBO Max on Friday, Dec. 12. Was it a mistake to revisit the great 1984 mockumentary, though? Mark Kennedy wrote in his review that, \u201cDespite some great starry cameos \u2014 Paul McCartney\u2019s is easily the best \u2014 \u2018Spinal Tap II\u2019 leans into the old favorite bits too needily and is suffocated by the constantly looming presence of death, a downer. The improv-based comedy is forced and the laughs barely register. This is a movie only for die-hard Tappers.\u201d",

      "DEARBORN HEIGHTS, Mich. -- A Detroit suburb worried about the late delivery of an artificial Christmas tree from China has instead received the real thing \u2014 a towering Norway spruce \u2014 just in time for a community tree-lighting celebration.",
      "The 40-foot (12-meter) tree was transplanted Monday at city hall in Dearborn Heights, thanks to the Michigan farm that grew it and a local Muslim American business owner who helped pay the $10,000 expense, WXYZ-TV reported.",
      "\"They were really on a time crunch, and this is our way of giving back,\u201d Sam Hussein said.",
      "Mo Baydoun, the new mayor who is also Muslim, said the Christmas tree is a sign of unity at a time when there's a lot of \"hate that\u2019s kind of going around.\" In recent weeks, there was a small but contentious anti-Islam protest next door in Dearborn. Southeastern Michigan has one of the largest U.S. populations of Arab Americans.",
      "\"We\u2019re going to stay working and loving and showing respect to all faiths and religions,\u201d Baydoun said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The House was headed toward a final vote Wednesday on a sweeping defense bill that authorizes $900 billion in military programs, including a pay raise for troops and an overhaul of how the Department of Defense buys weapons.",
      "The vote comes at a time of increasing friction between the Republican-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration over the management of the military.",
      "The annual National Defense Authorization Act typically gains bipartisan backing, and the White House has signaled \u201cstrong support\u201d for the must-pass legislation, saying it is in line with Trump's national security agenda. Yet tucked into the over-3,000-page bill are several measures that push back against the Department of Defense, including a demand for more information on boat strikes in the Caribbean and support for allies in Europe, such as Ukraine.",
      "Overall, the sweeping bill calls for a 3.8% pay raise for many military members as well as housing and facility improvements on military bases. It also strikes a compromise between the political parties \u2014 cutting climate and diversity efforts in line with Trump's agenda, while also boosting congressional oversight of the Pentagon and repealing several old war authorizations. Still, hard-line conservatives said they were frustrated that the bill does not do more to cut U.S. commitments overseas.",
      "\u201cWe need a ready, capable and lethal fighting force because the threats to our nation, especially those from China, are more complex and challenging than at any point in the last 40 years,\u201d said Rep. Mike Rogers, the GOP chair of the House Armed Services Committee.",
      "Lawmakers overseeing the military said the bill would change how the Pentagon buys weapons, with an emphasis on speed after years of delay by the defense industry. It's also a key priority for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the armed services panel, called the bill \u201cthe most ambitious swing at acquisition reform that we\u2019ve taken.\u201d",
      "Smith lamented that the bill does not do as much as Democrats would like to rein in the Trump administration but called it \u201ca step in the right direction towards reasserting the authority of Congress.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe biggest concern I have is that the Pentagon, being run by Secretary Hegseth and by President Trump, is simply not accountable to Congress or accountable to the law,\u201d he said.",
      "The legislation next heads to the Senate, where leaders are working to pass the bill before lawmakers depart Washington for a holiday break.",
      "Several senators on both sides of the aisle have criticized the bill for not doing enough to restrict military flights over Washington. They had pushed for reforms after a midair collision this year between an Army helicopter and a jetliner killed all 67 people aboard the two aircraft near Washington's Ronald Reagan National Airport. The National Transportation Safety Board has also voiced opposition to that section of the bill.",
      "Here's what the defense bill does as it makes its way through Congress.",
      "Lawmakers included a provision that would cut Hegseth's travel budget by a quarter until the Pentagon provides Congress with unedited video of the strikes against alleged drug boats near Venezuela. Lawmakers are asserting their oversight role after a Sept. 2 strike where the U.S. military fired on two survivors who were holding on to a boat that had partially been destroyed.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration may have softened its language on China to maintain a fragile truce in their trade war, but Congress is charging ahead with more restrictions in a defense authorization bill that would deny Beijing investments in highly sensitive sectors and reduce U.S. reliance on Chinese biotechnology companies.",

      "Trump sees the new version as a way for the U.S. to attract and retain top talent, all while generating revenue for federal coffers.

      "U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman reversed his earlier decision to keep the material under wraps, citing a new law that requires the government to open its files on Epstein and his longtime confidant Ghislaine Maxwell. The judge previously cautioned that the 70 or so pages of grand jury materials slated for release are hardly revelatory and \u201cmerely a hearsay snippet\u201d of Epstein\u2019s conduct.",
      "On Tuesday, another Manhattan federal judge ordered the release of records from Maxwell\u2019s 2021 sex trafficking case. Last week, a judge in Florida approved the unsealing of transcripts from an abandoned Epstein federal grand jury investigation in the 2000s.",
      "The Justice Department asked the judges to lift secrecy orders after the Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month, created a narrow exception to rules that normally keep grand jury proceedings confidential.

His administration released some material, most of it already public, disappointing critics and some allies.",
      "Berman was matter of fact in his ruling Wednesday, writing that the transparency law \u201cunequivocally intends to make public Epstein grand jury materials and discovery materials\u201d that had previously been covered by secrecy orders. The law \u201csupersedes the otherwise secret grand jury materials,\" he wrote.",

      "U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco granted a preliminary injunction sought by California officials who opposed President Donald Trump\u2019s extraordinary move to use state Guard troops without the governor\u2019s approval to further his immigration enforcement efforts. But he also put the decision on hold until Monday.",
      "California argued that conditions in Los Angeles had changed since Trump first took command of the troops and deployed them in June. The administration initially called up more than 4,000 California National Guard troops but that number had dropped to several hundred by late October. Only a 100 or so troops remain in the Los Angeles area.",
      "The Republican administration extended the deployment until February while also trying to use California Guard members in Portland, Oregon as part of its effort to send the military into Democratic-run cities over the objections of mayors and governors.",
      "U.S. Justice Department lawyers said the administration still needed Guard members in the Los Angeles area to help protect federal personnel and property.",

      "Trump took command of the California National Guard following protests over his stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws. The call up was the first time in decades that a state\u2019s national guard was activated without a request from its governor and marked a significant escalation in the administration\u2019s efforts to carry out its mass deportation policy. The troops were stationed outside a federal detention center in downtown Los Angeles where protesters gathered and later sent on the streets to protect immigration officers as they made arrests.",
      "California sued, and Breyer issued a temporary restraining order that required the administration to return control of the Guard members to California. An appeals court panel, however, put that decision on hold.",
      "California argued that the president was using Guard members as his personal police force in violation of a law limiting the use of the military in domestic affairs.",
      "The administration said courts could not second-guess the president\u2019s decision that violence during the protests made it impossible for him to execute U.S. laws with regular forces and reflected a rebellion, or danger of rebellion.",
      "In September, Breyer ruled after a trial that the deployment violated the law. Other judges have blocked the administration from deploying National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, and Chicago.",

      "The indictment stems from a March 2024 interview of Reynolds by sheriff's investigator Anthony Sims. Grand jurors allege Reynolds lied when he told Sims he never had a sexual relationship with the woman.

      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to face tough questions from Democrats over the Republican administration's immigration policies at a House hearing",
      "WASHINGTON -- Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who heads the agency central to President Donald Trump's mass deportations agenda, is expected to face fierce questioning from Democrats on Thursday as the public face of the Republican administration's hard-line approach to immigration.",
      "It has been months since Noem last appeared in Congress in May. Since then, immigration enforcement operations, especially in Los Angeles and Chicago, have become increasingly contentious, with federal agents and activists frequently clashing over her department's tactics.",
      "Noem is testifying in front of the House Committee on Homeland Security to discuss \u201cWorldwide Threats to the Homeland,\u201d which in years past have focused on issues such as cybersecurity, terrorism, China and border security. With Noem having made only a few appearances before Congress when she is leading Trump's signature policy area, Thursday's appearance is likely to focus heavily on immigration.",
      "Trump returned to power in January with what he says is a mandate to reshape immigration in the U.S., claiming the country is under an invasion.",
      "In the months since, the number of people in immigration detention has skyrocketed; the administration has continued to remove migrants to countries they are not from; and, in the wake of an Afghan national being accused of shooting two National Guard troops, Noem\u2019s department has dramatically stepped up checks and screening of immigrants in the U.S.",
      "The worldwide threats hearing, usually held annually, is an opportunity for members of Congress to ask the leaders of the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center about threats facing the U.S. and what their agencies are doing to address them.",
      "Noem's department is under particular scrutiny because Congress in July passed legislation giving it roughly $165 billion to carry out its mass deportations agenda and secure the border. The department is getting more money to hire 10,000 more deportation officers, complete the wall between the U.S. and Mexico and increase detention and removal of foreigners from the country.",

    "story": [
      "Paramount Skydance on Monday made a $108.4 billion hostile takeover offer for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, with its all-cash bid coming just three days after Netflix agreed to buy a part of Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery \"shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,\" Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison said in a statement.",
      "\"Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion,\" he said.",
      "Paramount Skydance is the parent company of CBS News.",
      "The new offer steps up the battle over the future of Warner Bros. Discovery, which on Friday agreed to a deal with Netflix under which the streaming giant would acquire Warner's streaming and movie assets. Warner Bros.' storied film library includes classics like \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" film series.",
      "Paramount Skydance said its offer is a better deal for Warner shareholders because it includes the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its cable television channels such as CNN, TBS, TNT and The Food Network. The transaction would also have an easier path through the regulatory process than Netflix's offer, according to Paramount.",
      "\"Paramount is highly confident in achieving expeditious regulatory clearance for its proposed offer, as it enhances competition and is pro-consumer, while creating a strong champion for creative talent and consumer choice,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Paramount Skydance's offer includes the cost of absorbing Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, which as of September 30 was more than $33 billion, a regulatory filing shows. The all-cash $30 per share offer amounts to nearly $78 billion. Excluding Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, Netflix's bid for the company comes to roughly $72 billion.",
      "The offer is backed by the Ellison family \u2014 Paramount CEO David Ellison's father is Larry Ellison, who leads software maker Oracle Corp. and is the second-richest person with a net worth of $277 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index \u2014 as well as investment firm RedBird Capital.",
      "Paramount Skydance's bid also includes several outside financing partners, according to a Paramount Skydance regulatory filing. They include Affinity Partners, the private equity firm run by Jared Kushner, a son-in-law of President Trump, and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.",
      "The outside investment firms have agreed to give up any governance rights, including seats on the board of directors of a combined firm, according to the regulatory filing.",
      "Potential antitrust \u2014 and political \u2014 hurdles",
      "Some Wall Street analysts have said the Netflix-Warner Bros. combination could raise concerns among U.S. antitrust enforcers because of the streaming service's size and the potential to reduce competition in the media space.",
      "\"Because Netflix is positioned as the largest streaming platform, the company's acquisition of HBO Max services and customers raises red flags,\" said Jeffrey May, managing editor for the Insights & Enrichment team within Wolters Kluwer Legal and Regulatory U.S., in an email.",
      "May added, \"Netflix and HBO Max compete for subscribers. Their combination could be seen as a threat to competition and innovation.\"",
      "President Trump also signaled the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal could face hurdles, saying on Sunday that the combined company's size \"could be a problem.\" Mr. Trump also said he would be involved in any decision about whether the federal government should approve the deal.",
      "Usha Haley, a Wichita State University professor who specializes in international business strategy, told the Associated Press that Paramount's ties to Mr. Trump are notable. Larry Ellison is an avowed supporter of Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump \"said he's going to be involved in the decision \u2014 we should take him at face value,\" Haley said. \"For him, it's just greater control over the media.\"",
      "Netflix declined to comment, while Warner Bros. Discovery didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In a presentation at the UBS Global Media and Communications conference on Monday, Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said they were confident their deal with Warner Bros. would close. Sarandos also said Netflix is committed to creating U.S. jobs.",
      "Blair Levin, a media and telecommunications industry analyst with investment adviser New Street Research, said Mr. Trump's involvement in the battle for Warner Bros. could backfire for Paramount Skydance.",
      "\"If Trump weighs in publicly against the deal, [Netflix] could argue that he did so for political or personal reasons rather than antitrust reasons and seek evidence, including discovery and depositions, leading to all kinds of delays and other potential collateral damage to the government case,\" he said in a note to investors.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery jumped $1.65, or 6.3%, to $27.72 in early trading on Monday, while Paramount Skydance shares rose 78 cents, or 5.8%, to $14.14. Netflix's stock slumped 4.9% to $95.64.",
      "Paramount Skydance's tender offer is set to expire on Jan. 8, 2026, unless it is extended.",
      "Impact on streaming",
      "Netflix, which has more than 300 million subscribers, is the world's largest streaming service, according to David R. King, a professor of management at Florida State University.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming platforms, which include HBO Max and Discovery+, rank as the fourth-largest with 128 million subscribers, followed by Paramount+ at No. 5, with 78 million customers, he added. Amazon Prime Video and Disney/Hulu rank as No. 2 and 3, respectively.",
      "The prospect of more media industry consolidation has prompted critics such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, to speak out against the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal. In a statement on Friday, Warren said the combination would \"create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market.\"",
      "Netflix is likely to argue that other video platforms, such as YouTube should be included in calculating streaming services' market share,\u00a0according to The Guardian.",
      "The bidding war follows Warner Bros. Discovery's announcement in June that it planned to split into two businesses, separating its cable networks from its streaming and studios business.",
      "But in October, the media conglomerate said it had attracted interest\u00a0from companies about buying all or parts of it outright, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that media and entertainment businesses, including Netflix, Paramount Skydance and Comcast, were pursuing a deal.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders \"will have to choose between [Paramount Skydance's] straight $30-a-share cash offer and Netflix's slightly lower, more complex bid with a linear networks spin-off, both carrying serious antitrust questions,\" David O'Hara, managing director at market research firm MKI Global Partners, said in an email.",

      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "The playful, graceful and surprising designs of architect Frank Gehry (Feb. 28, 1929-Dec. 5, 2025) changed the skylines of cities around the world, from Los Angeles, New York and Seattle to Barcelona, Paris, Berlin and Panama City. But he was never completely happy with his work. Asked by \"Sunday Morning\" in 2022 what he saw when he looked at his 2003 Walt Disney Concert Hall \u2014 a Los Angeles landmark whose massive curves fit together like puzzle pieces \u2014 Gehry replied, \"Well, I see what I would do different!\" What sounded like second guessing, Gehry called \"creative insecurity.\"",
      "Born Frank Goldberg in Toronto, Canada, he worked at his grandfather's hardware store, \"playing with the nails and the screws,\" he said. His father brought the family to Los Angeles in 1947, when Frank was 17. \"It just looked like a new world somehow; I was quite moved by it,\" he said.",
      "He fell in love with architecture, and, at the behest of his first wife, who was fearful of antisemitism, changed his last name to Gehry. He began incorporating industrial materials into his designs, but his ideas really took flight once he adapted software created for the aerospace industry. His buildings' flowing curves could now mimic movement.",
      "\"The movement is feeling,\" he said. \"And how do you get a big monster building to have any feeling? And the movement makes that happen. And I think that finding a way to build it was the issue.\" One humorous example: a tower in Prague, inspired by human forms gracefully entangled. The building was nicknamed \"Fred and Ginger.\"",
      "His Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, opened in 1997, was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. Gehry's aerospace software allowed for the precise calculations necessary to shape titanium into a curving exterior. \"When you go there, you see the light play with the building, especially on gray days when you really want some light, you want a feeling of warmth,\" Gehry said. \"All of a sudden, this metal glows beautifully.\"",
      "Among his other recognizable projects: The Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris; the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, Germany; the Peter B. Lewis Building in Cleveland; the Lou Ruvo Center in Las Vegas; the Gehry Tower in Hanover, Germany; the LUMA Arles Tower in Arles, France; the Weisman Art Museum in Minneapolis; and the Stata Center in Cambridge, Mass.",
      "Gehry's challenge to architects: \"Think of people and how they're going be inspired by your work, and give them something to think about. That's what a painting does. That's what a sculpture does. And architecture is an art. So, why not?\""

      "\"Billions and billions of people have watched them over the years,\" Mr. Trump, the first president to command the stage instead of sitting in an Opera House box, said to open the show.",
      "This year's recipients were actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they were \"among the greatest artists and actors, performers, musicians, singers, songwriters ever to walk the face of the Earth.\"",
      "On Saturday, he called the honorees, whom he was deeply involved in choosing, as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.",

      "\"If you look at the great hosts, Johnny Carson, Bob Hope, those are the greats,\" Mr. Trump said, while disparaging previous host Jimmy Kimmel, whom the president has criticized on multiple occasions, going so far as to urge ABC to remove him as host of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"",
      "\"But no, I think you, you want to be just loose and not a lot to prepare for. You know what you have to be? You have to be yourself,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"I have a good memory, so I can remember things, which is very fortunate,\" the president said. \"But just, I wanted to just be myself. You have to be yourself. Johnny Carson, he was himself.\"",
      "Mr. Trump assumed a role that has been held in the past by journalist Walter Cronkite and comedian Stephen Colbert, among others. Before Mr. Trump, presidents watched the show alongside the honorees.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, one of several Cabinet secretaries attending the ceremony, said he's looking forward to Mr. Trump's hosting job.",
      "\"Oh, this president, he is so relaxed in front of these cameras, as you know, and so funny, I can't wait for tonight,\" Lutnick said as he arrived with his wife, who is on the Kennedy Center board.",
      "Mr. Trump said in August that he had agreed to host the show. He said Saturday at a State Department dinner for the honorees that he was doing so \"at the request of a certain television network.\" He predicted that the broadcast would have its best ratings ever.",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors broadcast is\u00a0scheduled to air Dec. 23\u00a0at 8 p.m. ET/CT on CBS television stations and\u00a0Paramount+,",
      "Since 1978, the honors have recognized stars for their influence on American culture and the arts. Members of this year's class are pop-culture standouts, including Stallone for his \"Rocky\" and \"Rambo\" movies, Gaynor for her feminist anthem \"I Will Survive\" and Kiss for its flashy, cartoonish makeup and onstage displays of smoke and pyrotechnics. Country music superstar George Strait and Tony Award-winning actor Michael Crawford are also being honored.",
      "Mr. Trump said persistence is a trait all the artists share.",
      "\"Some of them have had legendary setbacks, setbacks that you have to read in the papers because of their level of fame,\" he said from the stage. \"But in the words of Rocky Balboa, they showed us that you keep moving forward, just keep moving forward.\"",
      "He said many of the politicians, celebrities and others in the audience shared the trait, too.",
      "\"I know so many of you are persistent,\" Trump said in his opening. \"Many of you are miserable, horrible people. You are persistent. You never give up. Sometimes I wish you'd give up, but you don't.\"",
      "The ceremony was expected to be emotional for the members of Kiss. The band's original lead guitarist, Ace Frehley, died in October after he was injured during a fall. The band's co-founder Gene Simmons, speaking on the red carpet when he and the other honorees arrived for the ceremony, said the president had assured him there would be an empty chair among the members of Kiss in memory of Frehley.",
      "Stallone said being honored at the ceremony was like being in the \"eye of a hurricane.\"",
      "\"This is an amazing event,\" he said. \"But you're caught up in the middle of it. It's hard to take it in until the next day. ... but I'm incredibly humbled by it.\"",
      "Crawford also said it was \"humbling, especially at the end of a career.\"",
      "Gaynor said it \"feels like a dream\" to be honored. \"To be recognized in this way is the pinnacle,\" she said on the red carpet.",
      "Mike Farris, an award-winning gospel singer who is performing for Gaynor, said she is a dear friend. \"She truly did survive,\" Farris said. \"What an iconic song.\"",
      "Actor Neil McDonough said he's presenting the award to Stallone, which he said was long over due for Stallone's writing and acting. \"But that isn't even the best part,\" McDonough said. \"The best part is that Sly is one of he greatest guys I've ever met.\"",
      "Previous honorees have come from a broad range of art forms, whether dance (Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham), theater (Stephen Sondheim, Andrew Lloyd Webber), movies (Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks) or music (Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell).",
      "Mr. Trump upended decades of bipartisan support for the center by ousting its leadership and stacking the board of trustees with Republican supporters, who then elected him chair. He has criticized the center's programming and the building's appearance \u2014 and has said, perhaps jokingly, that he would rename it as the \"Trump Kennedy Center.\" He secured more than $250 million from Congress for renovations of the building.",
      "Presidents of each political party have at times found themselves face-to-face with artists of opposing political views. Republican Ronald Reagan was there for honoree Arthur Miller, a playwright who championed liberal causes. Democrat Bill Clinton, who had signed an assault weapons ban into law, marked the honors for Charlton Heston, an actor and gun rights advocate.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, multiple honorees were openly critical of the president. In 2017, Mr. Trump's first year in office, honors recipient and film producer Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Mr. Trump attended. Mr. Trump stayed away during that entire term.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he was deeply involved in choosing the 2025 honorees and turned down some recommendations because they were \"too woke.\" While Stallone is one of Mr. Trump's Hollywood \"special ambassadors\" and has likened Mr. Trump to George Washington, the political views of Sunday's other guests are less clear.",
      "Strait and Gaynor have said little about their politics, although Federal Election Commission records show that Gaynor has given money to Republican organizations in recent years.",
      "Simmons spoke favorably of Mr. Trump when Mr. Trump ran for president in 2016. But in 2022, Simmons told Spin magazine that Mr. Trump was \"out for himself\" and criticized the president for encouraging conspiracy theories and public expressions of racism.",
      "Fellow Kiss member Paul Stanley denounced Mr. Trump's effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat to Democrat Joe Biden, and said Mr. Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were \"terrorists.\" But after Mr. Trump won in 2024, Stanley urged unity.",
      "\"If your candidate lost, it's time to learn from it, accept it and try to understand why,\" Stanley wrote on X. \"If your candidate won, it's time to understand that those who don't share your views also believe they are right and love this country as much as you do.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ethan-hawke-on-blue-moon-and-taking-nothing-for-granted/",
    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 13:06:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The star of \"Blue Moon\" talks about playing famed songwriter Lorenz Hart, whose successful collaboration with Richard Rodgers ended owing to Hart's heavy drinking; and about his own youthful ambitions.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly a hundred years ago, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart helped put the \"great\" in the Great American Songbook, with songs like \"My Funny Valentine,\" \"The Lady Is a Tramp,\" and \"Blue Moon.\"",
      "But by the early 1940s, Hart's heavy drinking made him an unreliable partner. So, Rodgers teamed up with Oscar Hammerstein II, and their first production, the landmark musical \"Oklahoma!\" opened at the St. James Theatre on March 31, 1943.",
      "It was an immediate hit, and that night there was a big party a few doors down at Sardi's, that legendary Broadway watering hole, with its walls hung with the caricatures of famous faces. Lorenz Hart showed up at Sardi's that night, and what happened next is now a movie.",
      "In \"Blue Moon,\" Ethan Hawke is Hart, drowning his sorrows at the bar.",
      "For the film, they re-created Sardi's on a soundstage, but \"Sunday Morning\" met Hawke at the real thing.",
      "\"I was definitely the type of young person that would walk in and think, 'When am I gonna get my painting up there?'\" he said. \"I'm not above that. I'm a little heartbroken that I don't have one up yet!\"",
      "Perhaps his time will come. \"My time's coming,\" he said. \"I have hope. I'm not done yet!\"",
      "And this performance is proof: the real Lorenz Hart was less than five feet tall, so director and frequent Hawke collaborator Richard Linklater used camera tricks to make the nearly six-foot actor look short. Hawke also shaved the top of his head to make a real combover, and he learned a mountain of dialogue.",
      "\"It's definitely the most text I've ever had in a movie,\" Hawke said. \"I remember calling my wife after the first day \u2013 I think I had more lines than I had in the previous five films.\"",
      "It was a challenge for an actor whose face usually says it all. In the 1989 film \"Dead Poets Society,\" Hawke played a student, and he says he learned a lot from co-star Robin Williams. \"There's a scene where he's talking about how to grade poetry, and he has all the kids rip it out \u2013 I didn't realize how much I was being taught, and how that sustained me through negative criticism. It's like, there's not any rules about being a great actor. Drop dead. So you don't like it? Suck an egg. You don't know what great acting is any more than I do.\"",
      "I asked, \"When you're in a movie like that so young, does it set you up? Or does it set you up?\"",
      "\"It's a great question, 'cause it's possibly both,\" he replied. \"If you let it be the high-water mark of your life, it will be, you know, if you put too much on that. You don't want anything at 18 to be the high-water mark of your life.\"",
      "Between movies, Hawke made his Broadway debut with, he says, a lot more confidence than skill. \"That's the weird thing about being young. I had no business being confident at anything. I was a total moron. And I walked in here like I was, you know, John Barrymore.\"",
      "His performance in Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" (1992) was described as \"promising.\" But it was clear that his best work was ahead of him.",
      "Hawke got the first of four Oscar nominations for his role in the 2001 film \"Training Day\" opposite Denzel Washington. His performance still resonates. Hawke said, \"When my son was about six, Levon, he said to me, 'Dad, what's \"Training Day?\"' I said, 'Oh, it's the movie I did a few years ago. Why?' He said, \"'cause every time we walk down the street, when people pass you, they say, \"Training Day\"!'\"",
      "But after \"Training Day,\" there was a time when Hawke says he passed on more parts than he took \u2013 and the offers started drying up. \"When you're young, you think it's everybody. You don't realize that This is a young person's game, and those kinds of job offers, there's a shelf life on that.\"",
      "\"When did your shelf life, when did that hit?\" I asked.",
      "\"Around the same time gray starts appearing in your beard,\" he replied.",
      "The gray in the beard works for him now, as a hard-nosed investigative reporter in the critically-acclaimed FX series \"The Lowdown.\" In the series, you never know what's around the next corner \u2013 just as in real life. As we were wrapping up at Sardi's, owner Max Klimavicius suddenly showed up with a surprise for Hawke: \"Ethan, I would like your permission to make you part of our collection,\" he said.",
      "He was a bit stunned, and to be honest, so were we. But after Ethan Hawke's career on screen and stage, it wasn't all that surprising.",
      "\"Wow!\" he said. \"It finally happened. I've got my portrait at Sardi's. I've arrived! Things are looking up in this life!\"",
      "And now, with his latest film in mind, there's talk of more accolades to come.",
      "How does he handle the Oscar buzz surrounding \"Blue Moon\"? Does he tune it out? He said, \"There's the obvious other part of you that goes, like, 'Hey, I dedicated my life to this job, and this is seen as a barometer.' And I would be dishonest if I didn't say that, like, that would be amazing.",
      "\"This is so corny, but it just flashed through my head: I was like 11 or something, I said to my mother, 'What's gonna happen with my life? What's gonna happen?' And she \u2013 and I remember it so vividly \u2013 in the kitchen, like Doris Day [sings] 'When I was just a little girl\u2026' you know, it goes into 'Que Sera, Sera.'",
      "\"You have to have a little 'Que Sera, Sera.' I don't take any of it for granted. That's, I guess, the right answer. Any little bit of it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Author Peter Guralnick wrote the definitive two-volume biography of the King: \"Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley\" (1994), and \"Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley\" (2000). And now, his latest is about Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis' legendary manager. Asked if he found anything surprising, Guralnick replied, \"It totally surprised me.\"",
      "\"The Colonel and the King: Tom Parker, Elvis Presley, and the Partnership that Rocked the World\" (Little, Brown & Co.) is the story of a partnership that rocked popular culture, and how Parker's marketing savvy and enduring loyalty helped the King get his crown.",
      "Guralnick says Parker did not create the template for being the manager of a musician: \"It wasn't original to him, it wasn't brand new. But he carried it, I think, to a far greater extent than anyone had before.\"",
      "In 1955, the 20-year-old Presley was playing the Louisiana Hayride when Parker first caught his act. \"It took no more than a few days after seeing him for the first time that he booked Elvis when nobody else was willing to book him,\" Guralnick said.",
      "Parker, who was then handling Hank Snow, quickly put Elvis in the show.",
      "Elvis would sell more than 12 million records in 1956. The Colonel negotiated his recording contract, his movie deal, and oversaw all his marketing.\u00a0 As he would write, \"I don't [just] sit here and smoke cigars hoping for something to happen.\"",
      "Guralnick said, \"There is so much love in some of his early letters to Elvis. And in one he says, you know, 'You are just like me. You are sensitive, you're easily hurt. But only those we love can hurt us.'\"",
      "Presley would write back, \"I love you like a father.\"",
      "Colonel Tom Parker wasn't actually a colonel; he also wasn't American. In fact, Andreas van Kuijk was a stowaway from Holland, who arrived in the U.S. in 1926, barely speaking English. The 16-year-old soon invented an origin story. \"Once he declared himself to be Tom Parker, born in West Virginia, his identity was never questioned for over 50 years,\" said Guralnick. \"The only person who may have known it was Elvis Presley.\"",
      "The honorary title \"Colonel\" would be bestowed on him by Louisiana's Governor. It became his first name. \"That was how he signed all of his letters,\" said Guralnick.",
      "Before Presley, Parker made a star out of Eddy Arnold, booking him as the first \"hillbilly act\" in Vegas.",
      "Actor George Hamilton, who befriended the Colonel in his early days in Hollywood, said, \"He had all the smarts of a con man, but he wasn't. He knew how to make the other person want whatever he was selling.\"",
      "Asked why Parker was so driven, Hamilton replied, \"Emotional stuff from his childhood. I feel like he had some horrible damage done. He didn't like his father.\"",
      "Parker would become notorious for taking a 50% cut of some of Presley's later deals. \"Now, I sat with him one day and I said, 'Is it right to get half of everything?'\" Hamilton recalled. \"And he said, 'Well, you know, 50% of something is better than 100% of nothing.' And I said, 'Well, you mean your half, or his?' He said, 'Well, if I didn't have my half, he wouldn't have his!' And I got it. I got it.\"",
      "The Colonel offered Hamilton an opportunity in Vegas: \"He said, 'And by the way, Elvis has gotta take two weeks off at the Hilton. And I booked you in.' I said, 'I can't do that show. That doesn't make any sense, Colonel.' He said, 'George, you want $50,000 a week?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'It's two weeks. For that, you can do anything, can't you?' I said, 'Yes, sir!'\"",
      "In 1973, after Presley bad-mouthed hotel owner Conrad Hilton on stage in Vegas, Parker confronted him backstage. \"Essentially, Elvis and Colonel fired each other,\" said Guralnick.",
      "The split didn't last long. \"Neither Colonel nor Elvis could imagine a world without the other,\" said Guralnick. \"They simply didn't have the ability to walk away.\"",
      "But Parker began to worry about the \"instability of [his] artist.\"",
      "Asked how he reacted to Presley's increasing drug use, Guralnick replied, \"I think he was at a loss. I think there was an element of denial. But he was well aware of what was going on. Nobody could miss what was going on.\"",
      "In Vegas, Colonel developed his own addiction. George Hamilton saw it firsthand: \"He used to get me to go gambling with him. God! He would go all-in on, like, I mean, big money. I saw close to a million dollars lost at a table.\"",
      "Guralnick said, \"They were caught in a trap \u2013 as Elvis sang! I mean, neither one of them could confront the other one with his problem.\"",
      "According to the author, the two were locked in a relationship of mutual denial \u2013 the twin tragedies of their story. And when Elvis died in 1977, the Colonel, according to Guralnick, \"went into shock.\"",
      "\"I'll never stop trying to keep nis name alive,\" Parker said. He would die in 1997.",
      "While Guralnick was doing research at Elvis' Memphis mansion Graceland, in what was once the office of Elvis' father, Vernon Presley, he was told the office telephone was disconnected: \"So, one night we were working quite late, and it was 10 o'clock at night. And all of a sudden, the phone rang. And so you know, you'll have to tell me: Was this Elvis? Was this Vernon? Maybe it was Colonel.",
      "\"We stared at it. Should we answer? Should we not answer? Who knows what would happen if we answered? But we did not answer. We just listened to it ring, until it finally stopped ringing!\"",
      "\"You wanted the idea that there was one of those three on the other end of the line?\" I asked.",

      "The Beginning of It All",
      "He first became aware of the boy in early 1955 through an old pal in Texarkana, Arkansas, a DJ, radio personality, and promoter named Ernest Hackworth who went by the name of Uncle Dudley. Hackworth, who, like so many other promoters, worked on his own shows as a country comedian, reported that this kid from Memphis had drawn more than eight hundred people to a little schoolhouse in New Boston, Texas, on January 11, which was a heckuva draw for an unknown artist whose name he usually got all jumbled up.",
      "Oddly enough, Colonel was later reminded, he had actually been told about the boy two months earlier by another old colleague, Oscar Davis, who was wont to say he had made several fortunes (true\u2014he had managed Hank Williams at the height of his career) and lost even more (equally true). Davis, a smooth-tongued, silver-haired operator who went back even further than Colonel in the world of carnivals and show business, was a peer- less pitchman, always immaculately dressed, always sharp as a tack\u2014in the view of a mutual acquaintance who did business with them both, he differed from Colonel in only two ways. Unlike Colonel, Oscar Davis looked the part, \"he looked like the man with the money\"\u2014 but also unlike Colonel (with whom you could operate with complete confidence on a handshake basis) you couldn't trust a word that he said.",
      "Oscar had hit a rough patch lately and was advancing an Eddy Arnold tour for Colonel when he met this Presley boy in Memphis and had even gone to see him perform at some little club where the kid had really gotten the audience worked up. But for one reason or another, it seemed like Oscar wasn't emphasizing the point too strongly, or maybe Colonel just wasn't listening that closely (with Oscar Davis, you didn't want to over-listen), so it wasn't until Uncle Dudley spoke to him the day after the New Boston show that he paid attention.",
      "This time there was no hesitation.",
      "He and Tom Diskin went to see Presley perform at the Louisiana Hayride three days later, and he was so knocked out, not so much by the music\u2014he really wasn't sure at first what to make of the music\u2014as by the reaction of the crowd, that he got in touch with Presley's manager, a Memphis DJ named Bob Neal, right away. Within a week he had him booked on the Hank Snow tour that was about to begin in New Mexico on February 14. Even before the start of the tour, apparently on the strength of the Hayride performance alone, Colonel approached Steve Sholes about signing him to RCA, but as it turned out, the head of Presley's little record label in Memphis, Sam Phillips, wouldn't hear of it, in fact he seemed almost insulted by the idea, so Colonel was forced to let Steve know that it looked like Presley was \"pretty securely tied up\" for the time being.",
      "From the very first dates on the New Mexico tour, the boy's talent\u2014not just his talent but his drive, and especially his capacity for growth\u2014were unmistakable. When asked some eighteen months later if he took credit for Elvis Presley's unparalleled success, the Colonel uncharacteristically demurred. \"I think Presley was a star from the first day he ever started going into show business,\" he said. \"I knew I could help him, [but] I think anyone could have helped him that knows something about show business.\"",
      "It was astounding, the speed with which it happened.",
      "Everywhere the Hank Snow\u2013headlined revue played, the clamor over Presley's performance only grew, and many nights he took the show. Hank Snow tried to hide his reaction, but Colonel could not help but be aware of it and all the ways his client's wounded vanity played out. The boy never seemed to notice, though; he clearly thought the world of Snow, and Colonel did all he could to smooth things over, pointing out that everywhere they went, they were breaking attendance records, which surely had to be considered a tribute to the star of the show.",
      "Things could not have been going better, in fact, for the new partnership between Colonel Tom Parker and Hank Snow. Record sales were up, and due to his assiduous efforts, Colonel never tired of reminding Snow, all sorts of new, high-paying opportunities in radio and television were starting to open up. The trades attributed these rapidly expanding horizons to a unique artist-manager relationship which Cash Box would describe as \"based on loyalty, mutual respect and a common objective,\" not to mention the uncommon efforts of Tom Parker, \"a colorful personality [with] a natural flair for showmanship [who is] known from coast to coast . . . and respected for his sound business principles [and his] policy of doing more than he has promised.\"",
      "But, tellingly, Colonel didn't book Elvis with Hank again until May, while Hank continued to do record-breaking business on his own.",
      "One of the stumbling blocks\u2014the principal stumbling block\u2014to his doing more with Presley was the boy's manager, Bob Neal, who seemed infuriatingly unsusceptible to persuasion, promotion, or even recognition of his own (let alone his artist's) ever-increasing opportunities. During a brief break from touring at the beginning of March, Colonel wrote to Tom Diskin, clearly disheartened by his inability to make any headway with Neal. \"I don't see much use in wasting any [more] money or time on Presley till we know that they need us, and only when they contact us direct for help in some way.\" Things were slow in the business in general, he noted, but he had not given up on improving Hank's royalty situation with RCA, or maybe even moving him to his old friend Randy Wood's Dot label (though in all likelihood, here he was merely musing out loud, for his own and Tom Diskin's benefit, about something that would almost certainly have been little more than a negotiating ploy). Meanwhile, he thought he would set up another strong ten- or fifteen-day tour for Hank, \"keep getting special deals lined up,\" and focus on getting him another guest shot on TV with Perry Como.",
      "But as frustrated as he was by the Presley situation, he was not about to give up. Finally, on March 29, he was able to come to some sort of agreement with Bob Neal for a two-week series of one-nighters in Florida with Hank Snow, but he couldn't resist needling Neal while at the same time trying to steer him toward a more realistic appraisal of the situation. Neal had to pay more attention to business, he wrote with unfeigned indignation. He had to get the Colonel a complete supply of photos and records right away. And most important of all, the boy was never going to get anywhere so long as he was on Sun Records. \"I am finding out that in some places they have never heard of Elvis. . . . this I am not saying to knock, as you well know but to drive home the fact how sad it is that this boy does not get the spread he needs on his records.\" And when Neal failed at this task, as at every other, he wrote again\u2014and again.",
      "The Florida tour was a triumph beyond anything that could have been imagined.",
      "On the first date, in Daytona Beach on May 7, Mae Boren Axton, a forty-year-old high school English teacher and sometime songwriter from Jacksonville, who had been doing advance press work in the area for the Colonel for the last year or two, witnessed a kind of crowd reaction she had never seen before. A well-educated woman from a prominent political family in Oklahoma (her nephew David later became governor of the state and a three-term U.S. senator), she had grown up, she said, with \"no idea\" of what hillbilly music was, but she had come to like it from all the promotion work she had done for numerous hillbilly jamborees over the last few years. Now, in her capacity as Colonel's designated press officer, she undertook to conduct an interview with Elvis before the show, one of the first real interviews he had ever done, she imagined, judging from his polite, tongue-tied responses\u2014but then she was almost struck dumb herself by the altogether unexpected explosiveness of his act. At one point she ran across one of her former students while Elvis was still onstage, \"and she was just right into it, didn't know who he was, none of them did. But she was just ahhhh\u2014all of them were, even some of the old ones were doing like that. I looked at the faces\u2014they were loving it. And I said, 'Hey, honey, what is it about this kid?' And she said, 'Awww, Miz Axton, he's just a great big beautiful hunk of forbidden fruit.'\"",
      "In Orlando, four nights later, the crowd called for Elvis to come back when Hank Snow took the stage, and could not be quieted during Snow's performance. The reporter for the local paper, a complete neophyte to this kind of music (it provided \"a poignant contrast to Metropolitan Opera in Atlanta, I must say,\" she acknowledged to her readers), gave a reasonably enthusiastic account of the entire evening, \"but what really stole the show was this 20- year-old sensation, Elvis Presley, a real sex box as far as the teenage girls are concerned. They squealed themselves silly over this fellow in orange coat and sideburns who 'sent' them. . . . Following the program, Elvis was surrounded by girlies asking for autographs. He would give each a long, slow look with drooped eyelids and comply. They ate it up.\" Which evolved in the blink of an eye into a full-scale riot in Jacksonville, when, at the conclusion of his act, Elvis announced, \"Girls, I'll see you all backstage.\"",
      "\"I heard feet like a thundering herd,\" Mae Axton recalled, \"and the next thing I knew I heard this voice from the shower area, and Elvis was on top of one of the showers looking sheepish and scared, and his shirt was shredded and his coat was torn to pieces . . . he was up there with nothing but his pants on and they were trying to pull at them up on the shower.\" The Colonel, said Mae, \"and I don't mean it derogatorily, got dollar marks in his eyes.\"",
      "But I think even Mae would be willing to admit that this was a reductive picture of a man she had come to admire for both his intellect and determination. Because she could tell even then that from Colonel's perspective Elvis Presley was not just another passing fancy to be cashed in on and forgotten, he was, potentially, a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon.",
      "Within days Colonel was hard at work trying to set up another Florida tour. Once again, Bob Neal's refusal, or simply inability, to take a businesslike approach was an obstacle, but one which Colonel was confident he could overcome. On May 25 he wrote to Neal in what could be taken as a lesson in coercive persuasion: \"I was most happy to do what I could to help Elvis and you in getting him across in these new markets. . . . I am always glad to work with both of you, I am not one of the type of personalities that tries to cut out a manager, as you well know a good many would do. . . . If ever you wish to tie in with me closely and let me carry the ball I will be happy to sit down with both of you and try to work it out.\" Evidently that must have struck a chord with Neal, who instantly initiated a phone call, which in turn prompted a second letter from Colonel, spelling out terms and conditions and laying out \"the protection I must have to enable [me] to tie these things up and not be fanning the air and spent my money foolish.\"",
      "He felt no need to mention it at the time, but the second Florida tour, scheduled to begin in just two months, would take place without the presence of Hank Snow. Snow instead would be heading up a West Coast tour of his own, his first all-out assault on that market, which would be operating under the direction of Tom Diskin and conclude with a triumphal appearance at the Hollywood Bowl. Colonel made sure that Hank understood that he was not abdicating managerial responsibility, that every aspect of the tour would be plotted out by himself and Mr. Diskin, and that it would, of course, be fully supported by RCA. But in fact Hank couldn't have been more pleased, and if he were to be perfectly honest about it, he would not miss the presence of Presley in the least. And it wasn't as if he were losing anything on the deal. As a partner in Hank Snow Enterprises\u2013Jamboree Attractions, he stood only to gain by the addition of another big moneymaking tour in whose profits he would be a full participant.",
      "In the meantime, while fully engaged in the setup of both tours, Colonel continued to go back and forth with Bob Neal about the smallest, and largest, of matters. He dangled the promise of two weeks in Las Vegas (\"The [club] owner is a good friend of mine\"), which surely he would have had difficulty delivering on, but Neal didn't bite. He continued to hector Neal about his inattention to business (\"I have been waiting to hear from you,\" again, and again, and again), without any tangible results. Finally, he arranged to meet with Neal in person about a whole panoply of issues, including, once again, trying to shop Presley's record contract to a major label, about which he believed they had finally reached agreement, only to hear back from Neal three days later: \"Hold off any further announcements regarding Elvis until I have more time with him.\"",
      "On June 25, Colonel wrote to Tom Diskin in what appears to be barely concealed, barely punctuated frustration. \"Get it in your mind that there is no future in anything but big deals, no small time stuff it takes as much time and no money can be made of it. You have to believe this so strongly that you will let no one get your time and ear on junk deals. Everytime we have become involved in something small [and here it is hard to believe that he is not for the first time wondering if this is how the whole Elvis experience will turn out] we have lost time money and get nowhere.\"",
      "Just how discouraged he must have been feeling is evident in the entirely unaccustomed rush of emotion that he pours into what he writes next to Diskin, with whom he has been working in perfect harmony for three years now without ever once communicating just how much the younger man's contributions have meant to him. \"The future looks very good for you if you want to make it that way,\" he writes, in a passage posing as well-meant advice for a junior partner who needs bucking up, but which could just as easily be taken as a confidence-building message to Colonel himself. \"I will always protect you all I can/and I know you do the same. You are good for me and I know that I do understand you better than any-one could. Your closer to me than any-one ever has been and will be. and I know you understand me.\"",
      "The return to Florida, beginning on July 25 and ending seven days later with a benefit show in Tampa sponsored by the Sertoma Club and Clyde Rinaldi, proved to be even more spectacular than the first tour. The all-star cast was headlined by comedian-actor Andy Griffith, but it was Elvis who took the show every night, astonishing not only the audience but his fellow performers. Once again there was a riot in Jacksonville in the course of which Elvis once again had his clothes torn off, something the Colonel made sure to mention two weeks later in an exhortatory letter to Sam Weisbord, one of William Morris' most senior West Coast agents.",
      "He was enclosing a set of action pictures he had had taken in Tampa, he wrote to Weisbord. (One of them would become the arresting cover of Elvis' first RCA album some eight months later.) He was also enclosing a selection of his records. \"He is presently on a small record label and they have sold this year over 100,000 of this boy's records already, and they have no distribution whatsoever. . . . This artist seems to me to be right in line for motion picture material, television, and a stage career. . . . With the right training and advice and good material the possibilities are unlimited. His exposure on the stage does 75% towards the public accepting this artist. The talents that are hidden in this personality are unlimited.\"",
      "He didn't hesitate to invoke Hank Snow, another well-regarded William Morris client, who \"has done much to expose the talents of ELVIS PRESLEY, as he has taken him more or less under his wing and has been plugging away on all his personals and blowing the bugle about ELVIS PRESLEY.\"",
      "And he summed it all up on a not altogether unexpected note. \"I can only go so far without the help of friends like you towards making the world aware of such great talent. You have forgotten more than I'll ever know about how to bring this out in an artist and I'm asking you for advice to carry on and get the best results out of and for ELVIS PRESLEY and all of us.\"",
      "He copied the letter to Harry Kalcheim, the head of William Morris' New York office, who had been instrumental in helping to broaden Eddy Arnold's appeal with key supper-club and television bookings. And he continued to bombard Steve Sholes at RCA with letters and telegrams, ostensibly under the guise of tipping him off to something that Colonel was good enough not to want him to miss.",
      "This might all be taken as Colonel's usual method of operation, of course\u2014and in many respects it was. But the lack of caution, the abandonment of all of his usual, carefully calibrated reserve, was something new. Certainly he had felt the same kind of full-blown belief in Eddy Arnold and the vast potential of his talent\u2014but he had always proceeded with an element of circumspection, taking each incremental step only after he was confident of the success of the last. With Presley he was making no such allowance for failure. If the boy failed, he was leaving himself nothing to fall back on. Because here it was not just Elvis Presley's musical talent that foretold an almost limitless future (though that may well have been enough in itself), it was his spongelike ability to absorb and reshape everything that he took in and experienced, his seemingly inexhaustible appetite for self-improvement. As Colonel would one day remark in comparing Presley's talent with that of Gene Austin, his first superstar, both were \"individual artists [who] have a feeling inside them for what they are doing which you can't teach anyone.\" And as he was quick to point out with more than just a smidgen of irony, \"I, as a salesman and drummer, know this [better] than the average guy.\"",

      "Pen in hand and his notebook open before him, he was ready to do what he did every November: Get started on his Christmas list.",
      "He had vacated the French desk in the study and adopted the kitchen island as a command center. At the east end of the island, he wrote letters, paid bills, stashed his laptop, and kept a handy trove of books. The west end was reserved for culinary pursuits.",
      "When Cynthia cooked, he often read aloud to her from Mary Oliver, Billy Collins, Wendell Berry, or, out of long affection, George Herbert and Wordsworth. Early on, they agreed that poetry paired well with food prep, fiction worked best after dinner, and nonfiction was for reading alone, silent as a monk.",
      "By seven-thirty a.m., he had prayed with his wife, checked his sugar, had his shot, and polished off his stone-ground oatmeal with raw honey and multigrain toast. This upbeat start on the morning had made him over-confident \u2013 his pen was poised but nothing was happening. The grand expectation of churning through the list was morphing into a muse.",
      "He considered the books spilling out of their allotted space and encroaching on the laptop. Back in the day, which seemed a cool hundred years ago, he'd been a bachelor priest in his slip-covered wingchair, avidly reading through a pile of books. Books were his friends, his family, his mode of travel, his relief from the woes of the vestry.",
      "Somehow, and certainly not by his own effort, he'd gone from a bachelor with blood kin consisting of one lone cousin, Walter, to a family his cousin called 'humongous.' While such a family delivered equally humongous dividends of pleasure, his reading time had taken a hit.",
      "Before Cynthia, he'd been unmoored by the prospect of sharing his time with a wife. How much of his time could a wife possibly need? Now he knew and he did not regret even a minute with his cheerful, artistic, and beautiful wife. He was unmoored no more; but settled in. In a groove, you might say, though definitely not in a rut.",
      "And there was Dooley \u2013 not of his blood, but of his heart. At the age of eleven, Dooley had landed on his doorstep, a thrown-away boy \u2013 barefoot in shredded overalls, with a mouth that a mother of yore would have washed out with soap. Call it a miracle that today his adopted son \u2013 now a successful veterinarian with his own practice \u2013 had a beautiful, artistic wife himself. And two kids that Cynthia and he were over the moon about.",
      "A phenomenal string of events had cast him in roles he'd never dreamed of fulfilling \u2013 father, husband, father-in-law, brother, brother-in-law, great-uncle, grandfather.",
      "There was Jack, a lovable seven-year-old mash-up of cowboy boots and imagination, and Sadie, a going-on-three-year-old who had taken down every defense in her grandpa's arsenal. He'd never given his heart so freely.",
      "With Cynthia, he'd fought giving his heart. There was the inarguable fact that he'd already given it to God \u2013 though only to a certain degree, as he later realized. That had seen him through a decades-long passage until he had a revelation: God's love for his children wasn't just for them to have and to hold, it was to freely, spontaneously give away \u2013 and to gratefully receive from others. Why hadn't he understood this before?",
      "That awakening had opened both his heart and his intellect to a sober realization \u2013 while he'd spent years being afraid to love, he'd been far more terrified of receiving it. He had begun at once to work these truths into daily practice. Not easy. And not overnight. But the process had performed its share of miracles \u2013 had, in fact, at the tender age of sixty-two, gotten him married.",
      "His abandoned French desk, given to him recently by a former parishioner, now displayed an archive of framed family photos. There was Dooley and Lace's Sadie, miraculously born to a mother long pronounced unable to conceive.",
      "A few years ago, he learned he had a half-brother. Out of time and despair, hope and prayer, Henry \u2013 a brother. They both resolved to drop the 'half' business. He and Cynthia had attended Henry's Holly Springs wedding \u2013 an event that gave him a witty and agreeable sister-in-law. He studied the wedding photograph, searching Henry's face for any resemblance to his own. Zero. But they both loved poetry and starched handkerchiefs and letters written in cursive. He had a laugh at the memory of taking Henry by the shoulders, looking him in the eye, and saying, 'Brother, I forgive you for being taller and better-looking.'",
      "To go from a family consisting of a cousin to the present-day slew was a sea change, calling for a new way of dealing with Christmas giving. In years past, he had made a list. Now he must make A List.",
      "Cynthia breezed into the kitchen in a vague cloud of her signature wisteria scent.",
      "'You wear perfume for the grans?'",
      "'Jack says he loves the way his Granny smells \u2013 it makes him sneeze. He also loves making his own picture book. You'll see it soon; it's about bugs. When he turns all that talent loose in the world ... wow! How about your Poetry with Grandpa syllabus?'",
      "'I need one more run through the town library. Poetry for three-year-olds is scarce.' As Lace's mural-painting commissions increased, she needed help with the kids. He and Cynthia were giving a hand when Lily Flower was otherwise employed.",
      "His wife was applying lipstick without the aid of a mirror. It was his job to give a thumbs-up if she hit the mark. She hit the mark while eyeing the kitchen island.",
      "'Could you clean some of the stuff off the counter?' she said. 'It runneth over.'",
      "'I was just thinking that.'",
      "'I'm making pasta for the weekend and ... ' She gestured. ' . . . all those Billy Collins books.'",
      "'But you love Billy Collins.'",
      "'I'm crazy about Billy Collins, but not when I'm making pasta, which takes up gobs of room.'",
      "'Consider it done.'",
      "She gave him a smooch on the cheek. 'Love you, sweetheart.'",
      "'Love you back.'",
      "'Are you off to the hospital?'",
      "'Tomorrow,' he said.",
      "'See you at five, then. Could you pick up a lemon for tonight?'",
      "'Will do. Anything else, give me a shout. Love to the kids. Tell them I'll be out soon.'",
      "'Ooops, I got lipstick on your cheek.'",
      "'Leave it. I'm branded.'",
      "And away she flew, eager for what life had to offer.",
      "He had always started his Christmas list with the nurses. Who could make it without nurses? Not the doctors, not the patients. How many years had he spent plowing up the hill to visit the ever-changing stable of patients, assisted by nurses in his labors of consolation? Even the sour ones had their place in the scheme of things.",
      "And didn't nurses love chocolate? Wasn't that their favorite thing to go home to even if they had a husband who was good-looking and would carry out the garbage? But the rules had shifted when he wasn't looking. He'd been told that what nurses want now is gift certificates. Nurses want to choose their chocolate themselves.",
      "Good for nurses for speaking out and taking charge!",
      "Five gift certificates for chocolate. It felt good just getting that on paper. Unlike his free-ranging wife, he enjoyed the boundaries imposed by a list.",
      "He would save his wife 'til last on the list because she required more than a bit of head-scratching. 'Don't buy me anything,' she said just yesterday. 'I have everything I could possibly want or need. Just write me a love letter. Please, honey.'",
      "He loved it when she called him honey.",
      "He remembered the Year of the Bathrobe \u2013 he had searched for one-hundred-percent cotton with pockets \u2013 she favored pockets \u2013 and matching slippers. Though he was convinced he had a home run, she had seemed ... what? Dismayed wouldn't cover it.",
      "A more recent Christmas gift had its own downside. According to rule, they agreed to give each other one gift only \u2013 no cheating by giving more. It had to be utilitarian, and they had to keep mum so it would be a surprise. She liked surprises.",
      "They had ended up giving each other the same thing \u2013 a smoothie blender. The same make and model. Surprise all around! Hers, however, had been on sale and she had saved thirty bucks. Which meant that he'd be returning the one he bought. All he had to do was hike to the recycle bin in a freezing rain and retrieve the box and dig through the foam peanuts that went berserk all over the place and locate the shipping label and the form that asked why the item was being returned, to which he replied It's a long story, and then rewrap the blasted thing and schlep it to the UPS drop-off.",
      "Looking back, his own biggest want had once been for a world globe, and she had been thrilled to give him one. Years later \u2013 six or seven, maybe \u2013 he was still perfectly satisfied with his globe. Lighted. In a mahogany stand. How could he want more?",
      "'I'd love to give you something you'd really, deeply enjoy,' she said yesterday. 'Something that would make you feel, I don't know, seventeen again?'",
      "'I have her,' he said.",
      "She seemed to like that argument, but still ...",
      "Since they married, he'd written a love letter or two. The one in which he plagiarized a passage from Duff Cooper had been a hit. Cooper had enjoyed a career of writing torrid love letters to his wife, Diana, before dying at sea in '54. But the letter currently under consideration would have to come entirely from his own striving.",
      "Gus was awake and panting at his feet.",
      "The red leash that his hundred-and-ten-pound Bouvier had worn was of course too large for a rescue of thirty-three pounds soaking wet. He had punched a few holes and used his leather cutter to nip the excess.",
      "Out they went into the mountain fog.",
      "So far, November was an unseasonably warm month, not cold enough for a fire in the hearth. This weekend would be different; the temperature was predicted to drop by several degrees, and they had a half-cord of hardwood he was itching to burn.",
      "This was ground fog; those headed down the mountain would be driving the first few miles in a cloud. He was a fog fan. And no wonder \u2013 he was Irish. Gus also had a touch of the Irish. His dog was fond of music, had once lapped up a spilled Guinness at a Meadowgate party, and was inclined to good humor often resulting in a grin.",
      "He had believed grinning dogs merely a staple of YouTube, but now he had one of his own \u2013 who, by the way, could also bark with a ball in his mouth. He absolutely did not deserve such a talented dog.",
      "He spied Emma Newland barreling around the corner with Snickers, a twelve-year-old rescue. At this distance, he could not run nor could he hide from his former church secretary and personal Genghis Kahn. He zipped his jacket, turned up the collar, armored himself. He could tell by Gus's bark that his dog was not into this encounter; Gus had met Snickers on other occasions and was unimpressed.",
      "'Why don't you get another leash?' she yelled over the barking.",
      "'This leash is fine,' he yelled back.",

He had to hand it to her \u2013 Emma Newland could, in a heartbeat, make three feet feel like three inches.",

      "'The Lord be with you!' he called after her.",

    "summary": "The bestselling author had said she would no longer write novels set in the make-believe mountain village of Mitford. After the death of her daughter, she wrote through her grief \u2013 which led to her 15th Mitford book, \"My Beloved.\"",
    "story": [
      "For one weekend only, hundreds of devoted readers gathered in Hudson, North Carolina, to celebrate Mitford, a fictional place with a real sense of community. Jan Karon, the 88-year-old author behind Mitford, has written 15 books about the make-believe mountain village.",
      "Asked how to describe the town of Mitford, Karon said it is \"a place my readers can go and not be afraid. It's a place of refuge. It's where they can go, get a deep breath.\"",
      "The humanity of Karon's characters has found a faithful following that's perennially put her novels on the bestseller list. But for some people, she's not a household name like other bestselling authors. Asked why, Karon said, \"I don't give you much of a ride. I just give you sort of a float! A lot of people tell me that my books put them to sleep, and I consider that a huge compliment!\"",
      "Karon's super-fans say the books are more than page turners. According to Nellie McMasters, \"We are in such an uncertain period, we're in such turmoil, that it's just a nice, pleasant place.\"",
      "\"And it's not divisive,\" said Joellen Maurer. \"This is just love your neighbor, know the people who live around you.\"",
      "Asked if she believes places like Mitford exist in America today, Phyllis Farringer replied, \"They do, where there's a community of faith and people caring about each other, and I see it.\"",
      "Jan Karon was raised by her grandmother, Fannie, in Hudson, and attended elementary school there. Almost eight decades later, she converted the site to the Mitford Museum.",
      "She credits her first grade teacher Nan Downs with encouraging her creativity. By age 10, Karon says, she knew she wanted to be a writer: \"I stood in front of this very mirror, and I said, I'm going to be an author.\"",
      "How did she know? \"I just knew,\" Karon said. \"I love to read. And so, I wanted to give other people what I received from reading, which was that whole other world.\"",
      "At 14, Karon found herself wanting to escape her world, so she got married, dropped out of school, and gave birth to her daughter, Candace, a year later. She was divorced at 18.",
      "\"A lot of it was really hard, because I became a single mom and had to raise her by myself when I myself had hardly been raised,\" she said.",
      "She worked a series of jobs, including TV producer. She was later fired, and says that was her turning point: \"It brought me to my knees; I'd never been on my knees,\" Karon said. \"I was 42. I just went down: I don't know what to pray for. I'm just here, and I need help and just change me.\"",
      "She became a successful advertising executive, but says she felt called to write more than ads. So, she quit her job, and began weaving her faith into her short stories. She published her work for free in a local newspaper, eventually turning those tales into her first Mitford novel, \"At Home in Mitford,\" in 1994.",
      "I asked, \"I think that when people think about your books and your work, they often think comforting, they think maybe clean, Christian.\"",
      "\"I'm grateful for my Christian readers, very grateful,\" Karon said. \"But I write for a secular audience. God poured his love into me, and you can't say, well, I just can't talk about that in my books.\"",
      "Her latest Mitford work, \"My Beloved,\" is all about presence, aging, and connection. Karon says it was one of the most challenging things she's ever written \u2013 and comes after having said she would never write another Mitford book.",
      "In 2008, she began a short story set during Christmas, but it sat unfinished for more than a decade. In 2021, her daughter, Candace, died of cancer. Karon was moved to write through her grief. The finished work, now a novel, is dedicated to her daughter,",
      "\"She was the sunshine of my life,\" Karon said of Candace.",
      "I asked, \"Do you ever talk to her while you're sitting here writing?\"",
      "\"All the time,\" she replied. \"And I know this sounds corny, but it's true for me, right here, she'll say, 'I hear you, Mom. It's okay, Mom. Everything's gonna be all right.'\"",
      "\"How did losing Candace change your life?\"",
      "\"I'm less judgmental,\" Karon replied. \"I'm a little easier, even on myself. And I've always been really hard on myself. I know that we don't have forever anymore, which is a thing in this book. So, what can we do with this time? Something better than what we're doing? Or even just something more fun? We don't have to be noble all the time.\"",
      "Jan Karon invites us to look for community and neighborly love, to find our own kind of Mitford. \"If you will just get in your car and drive out into America, I'm telling you, I can guarantee, I promise you, that it is out there. You have to look for it. It's not going to come to you and sit on your doorstep. You've got to go out and get it, and it's there for the taking.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 09:18:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Tilly Norwood is unlike any other aspiring TV or movie star: Tilly is entirely generated by artificial intelligence. What might that mean for the media industry?",
    "story": [
      "At the dawn of this century, Al Pacino starred in \"S1m0ne,\" a satire about a down-on-his-luck director who creates a computer-generated \"star\" that conquers Hollywood. Fast forward nearly 25 years, and it appears that real life has caught up with the movies, with the introduction of an AI-generated actress named Tilly Norwood.",
      "News of an AI actress triggered a bit of a Hollywood freak-out about that timeless worry of who gets the part, from Whoopi Goldberg (\"Bring it on, because you can always tell them from us\"), to Emily Blunt (\"Good Lord, we're screwed\").",
      "Tilly's creator, Eline van der Velden, says she did not expect the backlash: \"No, not at all. But at the same time, I had created her to resonate internationally, right? I had created her to become a global superstar.\"",
      "Van der Velden, herself a former actor and comedienne, aimed high because she thinks generative AI is ready for its closeup \u2013 saving money, and adding creativity. \"I was just trying to educate those industry individuals at that time about what's possible,\" she said.",
      "Bringing Tilly to life took van der Velden's team some 2,000 iterations. Then, she began to teach her to act. She showed us some early iterations of Tilly emoting. \"We were starting to try different emotions with her,\" she said. \"Here we did some tests. We didn't think the acting was very good at all.\"",
      "\"It wasn't up to your standards?\" I asked.",
      "\"It was not up to my standards at all!\"",
      "In an interview this past July with the British publication Broadcast International, van der Velden made the provocative statement, \"We want Tilly to be the next Scarlett Johansson or Natalie Portman, that's the aim of what we're doing.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the Scarlett Johansson of the AI genre,\" she told us. \"I think that was what was missed. There was a lot of misinformation. She's not meant to take real acting jobs in the traditional film and TV industry. She's meant to stay in her own AI genre, and that's where we want her to stay.\"",
      "Still, she says her firm has fielded requests for Tilly to appear in a film opposite real actors. \"We have said no to any offers,\" van der Velden said.",
      "\"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up\"",
      "Sean Astin is the president of SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, where Tilly Norwood has struck a nerve about the state of AI. Asked what Tilly represents to him, Astin replied, \"Avatar and character seem like fair labels. Actress, not so much. She \u2013 she? It? \u2013 simply will not replace our people.\"",
      "He says right now in Hollywood artificial intelligence feels like a tsunami: \"The onslaught of AI products and AI technology and its uses is, it's overwhelming. I would just as soon \u2013 as citizens and as a union \u2013 that we surf the wave, that we surf the wave of incoming stuff.\"",
      "For the union, AI protections were a major point of contention in the 2023 strike, and Astin says safeguarding a performer's name, image and likeness from being harvested without compensation is a top priority going forward. \"Eline has every right to use open source, publicly available, legal information to build her creative things,\" he said. \"My issue and our company's issue is with the companies that design those systems and scrape the internet and ingest them. They're not allowed to do that.\"",
      "Astin applauds producers who are trying to push the creative envelope using AI. But, he adds, \"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up. If you push the envelope, you say, 'Hey, how can human-centered artistry collaborate with this technology to achieve some communication that feels good to an audience?' And then there's like, 'Oh, by the way, we think it's cheaper, easier, and you know, we don't want to hire you as an actor.'\"",
      "\"Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\"",
      "Already, AI-generated scenes have appeared in TV series like Amazon's \"House of David.\" There are AI commercials, and over the summer, an AI model appeared in an ad in Vogue magazine for the first time.",
      "For producers, facing ballooning production budgets, AI has triggered a range of emotions. Former entertainment executive Kevin Reilly explains: \"Excitement, confusion, fear, trying to figure out how to use this. Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\" he said. \"It is, in my opinion, very much a friend. It is the most transformative thing that's happened maybe in the history of Man.\"",
      "Reilly is now something of an AI evangelist. He's the new CEO of Kartel.ai, a Beverly Hills startup that makes AI videos and ad campaigns. \"Everything comes with a downside,\" he said. \"But that is not the reason to just categorically be fearful of this.\"",
      "I asked, \"How much of this is driven by studios and streaming platforms and brands wanting to just save money?\"",
      "\"Yeah, I think it's not necessarily, 'Hey, we wanna save money,'\" said Reilly. \"It's that the bottom line \u2013 you know, they are businesses.\"",
      "And for businesses, the creative upside can be extraordinary. Kartel wanted to show off a bit, and put generative engineer Fillip Isgro in the driver's seat. He showed us a concept for a coffee commercial, Cup of Jo. The ad featured multiple versions of \u2026 me! It was a little jarring.",
      "He began with an old-fashioned storyboard, building an AI world directed by a human. \"What does the coffee shop look like? What does the logo look like? And finally, what do you look like? With your permission, we went on your Instagram and we collected all of your photos.\"",
      "That's all he needed to generate my face. And with just a few commands, Cup of Jo went global, with images of Jo's Coffee Shop on a barge in the middle of the ocean; on a volcano in Hawaii; and in the Alps.",
      "\"The next step in our journey is, we bring it to life,\" Isgro said. \"We actually bring motion into our stills. I just whip out my iPhone, I record who I need to, and then I can just instantly get the character doing the thing that I need them to do.\"",
      "The result: a flashy new ad created in just a couple of days, using no ad agency, no locations, and none of my time.",
      "\"Imagine having to go and shoot that. You don't get that flexibility\" in a traditional ad, Isgro said. \"And it's a very planned thing. You have to stick to scripts, and that's it. But in this world, we can iterate indefinitely without repercussion.\"",
      "It's the story of our time: the tug of war between artificial intelligence (\"This tech is here. It's not gonna go anywhere. How can we use it as a force for good?\" asks Eline van der Velden) and humanity (\"Artificial intelligence will never replace us, ever,\" says Sean Astin) that, for now, is something of a cliffhanger.",

    "story": [
      "Prominent American playwright and actor, Jeremy O. Harris, known for his Tony-nominated \"Slave Play\" and his role in the Netflix series \"Emily in Paris,\" was arrested in Japan on suspicion of smuggling the psychedelic drug ecstasy, officials said Saturday.",
      "Officers at Naha Airport on Japan's southern island of Okinawa arrested Harris on Nov. 16 for an alleged violation of customs law for having 0.78 grams, or 0.0275 ounces, of the crystalized drug, also known as MDMA, in a container in a tote bag he was carrying, according to Okinawa Regional Customs spokesperson Tatsunori Fukuda.",
      "Harris, 36, had left London's Heathrow Airport two days earlier and transited in Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport before arriving in Naha for sightseeing, Fukuda said. Okinawa is a popular resort destination with mild weather throughout the year.",
      "Fukuda said Harris was arrested on the spot and taken into custody by the Tomishiro police, which filed a criminal complaint to the Naha District Prosecutors' Office on Thursday for further investigation and possible indictment. CBS News has reached out to the Tomishiro police for additional comment.",
      "Japanese authorities did not find any other drugs in his luggage and believe the MDMA was for his personal use. They are still investigating, Fukuda said, while adding that whether Harris made any comment on the case could not be released.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Harris' representatives. Harris has not publicly commented on his arrest.",
      "CBS News reached out to the U.S. Embassy in Japan for additional comment.",
      "Japanese criminal procedures allow investigators to keep a suspect in custody for up to 23 days before indictment, and pretrial detention can be prolonged if the accused exercises their right of silence or denies the charges, a practice widely criticized as \"hostage justice.\"",
      "Those convicted of drug smuggling in Japan can face a multiyear prison term.",
      "Harris burst onto the arts scene with \"Slave Play,\" written while he was still a graduate student at the Yale School of Drama. It premiered off-Broadway in 2018, inciting controversy and even a petition to shut down the production with its provocative mix of race, class and sexual taboos. It moved to Broadway the following year, earning a Tony nomination for best play, but did not win an award.",
      "The play returned for a short run on Broadway in December 2021.",
      "\"There haven't been enough chances for us to reflect who we are to the world and to ourselves and to ponder what that reflection means, and so this is what 'Slave Play' gets to do for people,\" Harris told CBS New York in 2021.",

    "summary": "President Trump is hosting the Kennedy Center Honors on Sunday after presenting medals to the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees during an Oval Office ceremony Saturday.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday presented the\u00a02025 Kennedy Center honorees\u00a0with their medals during a ceremony in the Oval Office, hailing the slate of artists he was deeply involved in choosing as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",
      "\"This is a group of icons whose work and accomplishments have inspired, uplifted and unified millions and millions of Americans,\" said a tuxedo-clad Mr. Trump. \"This is perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class of Kennedy Center Honorees ever assembled.\"",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0ignored the Kennedy Center\u00a0and its premier awards program during his first term as president. But the Republican has\u00a0instituted a series of changes\u00a0since returning to office in January, most notably ousting its board of trustees and replacing them with GOP supporters who\u00a0voted him in as chair of the board. That triggered a number of artists to\u00a0cancel performances\u00a0and some staff members resigned.",
      "The changes were instituted after the White House\u00a0accused the institution\u00a0of being \"woke\" and scrutinized its finances earlier this year.",
      "The president placed around each honoree's neck a new medal that was designed, created and donated by jeweler Tiffany & Co., according to the Kennedy Center and Mr. Trump.",
      "It's a gold disc etched on one side with the Kennedy Center's image and rainbow colors. The honoree's name appears on the reverse side with the date of the ceremony. The medallion hangs from a navy blue ribbon and replaces a large rainbow ribbon decorated with three gold plates that rested on the honoree's shoulders and chest.",
      "Strait, wearing a cowboy hat, was first to receive his medal. When the country singer started to take off the hat, Mr. Trump said, \"If you want to leave it on, you can. I think we can get it through.\" But Strait took it off.",
      "The president said Crawford was a \"great star of Broadway\" for his lead role in the long-running \"Phantom of the Opera.\" Of Gaynor, he said, \"We have the disco queen, and she was indeed, and nobody did it like Gloria Gaynor.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was effusive about his friend Stallone, calling him a \"wonderful\" and \"spectacular\" person and \"one of the true, great movie stars\" and \"one of the great legends.\"",
      "Kiss is an \"incredible rock band,\" he said.",
      "Songs by honorees Gaynor and Kiss played in the Rose Garden just outside the Oval Office as members of the White House press corps waited nearby for Mr. Trump to begin the ceremony.",
      "The president said in August that he was \"about 98% involved\" in choosing the 2025 honorees when he personally announced them at the Kennedy Center, the first slate chosen under his leadership. The honorees traditionally had been announced by press release.",
      "It was unclear how they were chosen. Before Mr. Trump, it fell to a bipartisan selection committee.",
      "\"These are among the greatest artists, actors and performers of their generation. The greatest that we've seen,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We can hardly imagine the country music phenomena without its king of country, or American disco without its first lady, or Broadway without its phantom \u2014 and that was a phantom, let me tell you \u2014 or rock and roll without its hottest band in the world, and that's what they are, or Hollywood without one of its greatest visionaries.\"",
      "\"Each of you has made an indelible mark on American life and together you have defined entire genres and set new standards for the performing arts,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump was also attending an annual State Department dinner for the honorees on Saturday. In years past, the honorees received their medallions there but Trump moved the ceremony to the White House.",
      "In a presidential first, Mr. Trump is hosting the\u00a0Kennedy Center Honors program\u00a0himself on Sunday.",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors program\u00a0and its series of tribute speeches and performances for each recipient is set to be\u00a0broadcast Dec. 23 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on CBS television stations and Paramount+.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, one of several Cabinet secretaries attending the ceremony, said he's looking forward to Mr. Trump's hosting job.",
      "\"Oh, this president, he is so relaxed in front of these cameras, as you know, and so funny, I can't wait for tonight,\" Lutnick said Sunday as he arrived with his wife, who is on the Kennedy Center board.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/breast-cancer-artist-nardiz-cooke-miami-florida/",
    "published": "Sat, 06 Dec 2025 08:07:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Nardiz Cooke was immediately transfixed by the mask she wore while receiving treatment for late-stage cancer.",
    "story": [
      "Nardiz Cooke was alarmed when she felt a lump in her right breast in late 2018. Her OB-GYN wasn't: Cooke was 38 and had no family history of cancer. Cooke's doctor diagnosed her with fibrosis, a common condition that causes tissue to feel lumpy.",
      "Cooke was reassured, but almost two years later, new symptoms began. She had splitting headaches. She said she was \"vomiting out of the blue.\" Her ears rang. She had double vision and sometimes lost her sight. Once, it took 40 minutes for her vision to return.",
      "But no matter how many doctors Cooke saw, everything came back clear. In October 2021, she went to the emergency room and refused to leave without an answer.",
      "\"After several exams, again, my sight, ears, everything you can imagine, the doctor said, 'You're fine.' I said, 'Doctor, I'm not fine,'\" Cooke recalled.",
      "The doctor ordered an MRI. It showed she had aggressive cancer. Soon after, she was given an official diagnosis: Stage IV metastatic breast cancer that had spread to her brain.",
      "\"It made sense, something about those words \u2014 that was the path that felt right,\" Cooke said.",
      "As she learned about her options, Cooke said she didn't want to focus on worst-case scenarios.",
      "\"It felt like, well, Nardiz, here you go. This is your fate. What are you going to do with it?\"",
      "Focusing on a \"trophy\"",
      "Cooke let herself be swept along the \"pink carpet\" of breast cancer treatment. People who are initially diagnosed with Stage IV cancer often have a poorer prognosis than someone who is diagnosed with earlier-stage disease that grows, said Dr. Carmen Calfa, Cooke's medical oncologist at the University of Miami's Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. Medical advancements and tailored therapies can extend a patient's lifespan, Calfa said, but treatment is lifelong.",
      "Radiation oncologist Dr. Jessica Meshman targeted the tumors in Cooke's brain with radiation therapy. On her first day of treatment, Cooke was intrigued by the custom-fit thermoplastic mask that would direct radiation beams and protect healthy tissue.",
      "\"I saw that thing, that mask, and I said, 'I cannot wait to be done with these treatments, because I'm going to take my mask home, as a symbol, like it's my trophy,\" Cooke said.",
      "Cooke received multiple forms of radiation over two years. When she was feeling claustrophobic inside the spaceship-like machine that delivered the treatment or feeling fatigued and achy at home, she thought about what she would do with the mask when it was no longer needed.",
      "\"This amazing symbol of strength\"",
      "Cooke had her final radiation treatment in late 2022. She had two masks. Several months after finishing treatment, she splurged on quartz crystals.",
      "\"I had no idea. I had no money, but I just bought all these crystals,\" Cooke said. \"I found myself just draping (the mask), adorning (it) in quartz.\"",
      "Cooke thought the glittering results looked like something from a movie or a dream. The next time Cooke met with Meshman, she showed the doctor her photos of the mask. Meshman reached out to administrators at the cancer center to see if Cooke's mask could be displayed there. It was put in the lobby this autumn.",
      "\"I just thought it would be so incredible for other patients to see kind of the strength that she has through the piece,\" Meshman said. \"She took something that can be quite terrifying and made it this amazing symbol of strength.\"",
      "Cooke's project grew as other patients began anonymously donating their masks. She named the collection \"Radiant Sentinels.\" Each mask was a fresh canvas.",
      "\"I have learned so much from each mask, because each mask is a different material, and I research the materials, and they take me to stories, to knowledge. It's very, very interesting,\" Cooke said. \"And I respect the process very much, because that mask, the person that donated that mask, doesn't even know. But I respect them and I wish them the best.\"",
      "\"Never thought of doing something like this\"",
      "Four years after her diagnosis, Cooke, 44, is \"doing amazing,\" Meshman said. Calfa said Cooke is \"blossoming\" and that her ongoing hormone therapy treatment is going well.",
      "Cooke said she follows a four-step regimen: Taking her medication, going to her regular appointments with Calfa and Meshman, working on \"Radiant Sentinels,\" and enjoying a regular glass of red wine.",
      "Cooke's pieces were shown at a Miami gallery on Thursday. Twelve masks \u2014 two of Cooke's and 10 from donors \u2014 were showcased. Calfa and Meshman both attended.",
      "One mask shines with thousands of mirrored glass shards, while another is inspired by a tribal dance from Cooke's hometown in northern Mexico and adorned with naturally shed deer antlers. Another is studded with thousands of tiny religious figures called milagritos.",
      "Other masks are coated in fish scales and seashells. One resembled a knight's helmet wrought with leaves.",
      "Seeing all of the masks gathered and on display was momentous, said Cooke, who comes from a family of artists, but this was her first such effort.",
      "\"I would have never thought of doing something like this with my hands,\" Cooke said. \"I don't have to tell anybody how to feel when they see this. It's their own reflection, their own sight. I am just handing them a candle for them to have their experience with a mask, one-on-one.\"",
      "Cooke said she is continuing to solicit donated masks and will continue to add to the \"Radiant Sentinels\" collection. Cancer changed what she thought her life would look like, but she said it also gave her a new purpose.",
      "\"I'm 44, and I went into full menopause at 40,\" Cooke said. \"That was difficult, but I just gave in. That made a lot of the decisions for me. I did not have any kids. I realized, 'You're not here to have kids. You're here to be an auntie, and you're here to make 'Radiant Sentinels.'\"",

      "In a Supreme Court filing relating to Lopez's ongoing appeal to the high court filed Tuesday, the Solicitor General's Office wrote that dismissal of the case is warranted for the same reason, and that the court should hear Lopez's appeal, reverse an appeals court decision that reinstated the conviction, and return the case to a New York federal judge who could dismiss the case.",
      "Lopez was convicted in 2024 by a jury in Brooklyn on charges of money laundering, conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy. Full Play was convicted of two additional counts of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering relating to the World Cup and Copa America.",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve is grappling with economic issues including higher inflation and a slowing labor market.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, bringing the federal funds rate to its lowest level in more than three years.",
      "The reduction lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.5% and 3.75%, down from its prior range of 3.75% to 4%. The Fed's decision marks the third consecutive rate cut since September, lowering the federal funds rate by a total of 0.75 percentage points this year.",
      "Despite the lack of key government economic data because of the recent U.S.\u00a0government shutdown, the Fed has been closely monitoring the slowdown in monthly job growth as well as rising inflation. Figures from ADP, which tracks private payrolls, showed that employers shed 32,000 jobs in November, a signal of continuing headwinds in the labor market.",
      "Fed hints at one rate cut in 2026",
      "But in announcing the decision, the Federal Reserve signaled that it may want to see more economic evidence to support additional rate cuts in 2026. In quarterly economic projections issued along with their latest statement, Fed officials signaled they expect to lower rates just once next year.",
      "\"In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, said in its statement.",
      "Speaking about the decision in a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is \"well positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves\" before deciding on another cut.",
      "\"We're going to get a great deal of data between now and the January meeting \u2014 the data we get will factor into our thinking,\" Powell said, referring to the delayed November inflation and job reports that will be issued later this month. \"We're well-positioned to wait and see.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve also issued new U.S. inflation, economic growth and unemployment projections for 2026, forecasting that inflation will cool slightly next year while unemployment will remain unchanged from its current level of 4.4%.",
      "Fed officials forecast that Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Fed's favored inflation gauge, will cool to 2.4% next year, down from its median estimate of 2.9% in 2025. The nation's gross domestic product could pick up to 2.3% in 2026, an acceleration from the Fed's September forecast of 1.8%.",
      "Ryan Sweet, chief global economist at Oxford Economics, said the latest Fed guidance sets it up for what he described in a note to investors as an \"extended pause\" in cutting rates.",
      "\"The Fed isn't going to be able to help the labor market because of what ails it,\" he added. \"Rate cuts are unlikely to significantly boost the hiring rate, which is being depressed by overhiring, solid productivity growth, policy uncertainty, a rise in people with multiple jobs and less immigration. Monetary policy can't solve many of these issues.\"",
      "The move lowers the federal funds rate to its lowest level since early November 2022, when policymakers lifted the range to 3.75% to 4%. At that time, the central bank was boosting rates \u2014 its most potent tool for curbing inflation \u2014 as inflation surged during the pandemic.",
      "By cutting rates, the Fed is acting to spur hiring by making credit cheaper, allowing businesses to expand and hire at a lower cost. Consumers, meanwhile, tend to spend more when financing is less expensive, giving the broader economy an extra lift.",
      "FOMC dissents",
      "Not all members of the FOMC, the Fed's rate-setting panel, agreed with the move to cut by a quarter point. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell was joined by eight other committee members in voting in favor of the reduction, three members dissented, the Fed said. That represents the most dissents in six years and is a sign of divisions on a committee that traditionally works by consensus.",
      "FOMC members Austan Goolsbee and Jeffrey Schmid voted to maintain the previous range, while Stephen Miran voted in favor of a 0.5 percentage-point cut.",
      "At the same time, the Fed is moving toward a leadership shift next year, with Powell set to end his term as chair in May 2026 and President Trump preparing to nominate his replacement.",
      "\"[T]he outlook from the Powell-led FOMC bears less than usual on future Fed policy decisions given the imminent change in leadership,\" Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, said in an email.",
      "Asked what his goals are during the last months of his term as chair, Powell said he's focused on the U.S. economy.",
      "\"I want to turn over this job to whoever replaces me with the economy in really good shape,\" he said. \"All my efforts are to get to that place.\"",

    "story": [
      "Lottery jackpots have exploded in size over the last decade.",
      "When Powerball launched in 1992, the first jackpot was $5.9 million, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association. Now, the largest Powerball jackpot on record was the $2.04 billion prize won on Nov. 7, 2022.",
      "Mega Millions followed a similar path. Its first jackpot winner in 2002 took home $28 million. Its record prize \u2014 a $1.602 billion jackpot won on Aug. 8, 2023 \u2014 ranks as the fourth-largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history.",
      "Twelve out of the 20 largest jackpots have occurred since 2023.",
      "Here are the biggest U.S. jackpot wins:",
      "Only five states don't sell lottery tickets: Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah.",
      "While the prizes are huge, the odds of winning still remain extremely low. Over the last three decades, both games have been redesigned multiple times. Changes have pushed jackpots higher while also adding more ways for players to win smaller prizes.",
      "Powerball players choose five numbers from 1 to 69 and one Powerball number from 1 to 26. In 2015, Powerball increased its number of white balls from 59 to 69 and its number of red balls decreased from 35 to 26.",
      "Before the change, the odds of winning the jackpot were 1 in 175.2 million and the overall odds of winning any prize were 1 in 31.85. After the redesign, the jackpot odds became steeper, 1 in 292.2 million, while the overall odds of winning a prize improved to 1 in 24.9, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.",
      "Mega Millions requires players to pick five different numbers from one to 70 and one Mega Ball number from one to 24. A ticket wins the jackpot by matching all six numbers in a drawing.",
      "In 2025, Mega Millions changed its games to a larger starting jackpot ($50 million vs. $20 million), which \"improved odds to win the jackpot and improved overall odds,\" according to Dan Miller, a spokesperson for Mega Millions.",
      "\"Everyone who wins is winning more because of the embedded multiplier in the new game that takes all non-jackpot prizes and multiplies them by 2X, 3X, 4X, 5X or 10X,\" Miller said in an email. Through Friday, Dec. 5, he said, \"there have been 70 drawings in the new game. In that time, players have won $531 million in non-jackpot prizes. In the old game, those same prizes would have been valued at $119.8 million. That's a 343% increase in player winnings.\"",
      "For example, under the old rules, matching just the Mega Ball was a break-even outcome: a $2 ticket earned a $2 prize. Under the new game, that same match now comes with a built-in multiplier. The minimum prize is $5, which is then multiplied \u2014 meaning a player can now win $10, $15, $20, $25 or even $50 instead of just $2.",
      "The odds to win the jackpot improved from 1 in 302.6 million to\u00a01 in 290.5 million. This is because of Mega Millions removing the one gold Mega Ball from the game, Miller said.",
      "The new game has 24 Mega Balls instead of 25, which improves the odds of picking the right combinations of numbers to win the jackpot. The overall odds to win any prize went from 1 in 24 to 1 in 23.",
      "There's more money in play as well: Powerball increased the price of a ticket from $1 to $2 in 2012. Mega Millions increased its ticket prices from $1 to $2 in 2017 and from $2 to $5 in April of this year.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has reached an agreement that could end President Biden's signature student loan repayment plan, a move that may force millions of borrowers back into repayment.",
      "The Education Department on Tuesday announced a proposed settlement with the state of Missouri that it said would terminate the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, an income-driven repayment plan that tabulates loan repayments based on a borrower's income and family size.",
      "As part of the deal, which is pending court approval, the agency said it will not enroll any new borrowers in the SAVE plan and will deny all pending applications. All current SAVE borrowers will have a \"limited time\" to enroll in a new plan and begin repayments, according to the department's notice.",
      "Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz told CNBC that borrowers may need to leave SAVE forbearance early next year. That's a quicker timeline than what was laid out in The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed in July.",
      "That law gave borrowers enrolled in SAVE and other soon-to-be-phased-out repayment programs until July 1, 2028, to move to a new plan.",
      "Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in Tuesday's announcement that the Biden Administration's policies unfairly shifted student loan debt onto American taxpayers. The Education Department said the SAVE program would have cost taxpayers more than $342 billion over ten years.",
      "The Education Department declined to comment, pointing CBS News to a Dec. 9\u00a0Wall Street Journal op-ed written by Kent and Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway,",
      "\"The Trump administration isn't blind to the mounting student debt burden or the skyrocketing costs of a college degree,\" they wrote. \"But we refuse to force hardworking Americans to bear the burden of loans that aren't theirs.\"",
      "The Biden administration\u00a0announced\u00a0the SAVE program in 2023, calling it the \"most affordable student loan repayment plan ever.\" The plan allowed 4.6 million of the program's more than 7 million enrollees to lower their monthly bills to $0 per month,\u00a0according\u00a0to Protect Borrowers, an advocacy group.",
      "Tuesday's announcement is the latest development in a months-long legal battle over the program's fate, which has left millions of SAVE borrowers in limbo.",
      "The SAVE plan received pushback from attorneys general from several Republican-led states, including Missouri, which sued in 2024, arguing the plan overstepped the Biden administration's authority. In February 2025, a circuit court ruled the SAVE plan was unlawful, according to the Education Department.",
      "As the legal battle played out, SAVE borrowers were put in forbearance in July 2024, meaning that their loans were temporarily placed on hold and interest stopped accruing.",
      "In July 2025, the Education Department said it would restart charging interest on the loans beginning Aug. 1, a move advocacy group Protect Borrowers said could cost enrollees $300 per month due to new interest charges.",
      "Tuesday's agreement will \"strip borrowers of the most affordable repayment plan,\" Protect Borrowers deputy executive director and managing counsel Persis Yu said in a statement.",
      "The Education Department is advising SAVE borrowers to use the Federal Student Aid Loan Simulator tool to explore other repayment plans.",
      "As Kent and Hanaway\u00a0note\u00a0in their Wall Street Journal opinion piece, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act creates a single new income-driven repayment plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan, which has a repayment window of up to 30 years. The plan will be available for new borrowers beginning on July 1, 2026, along with a separate standard repayment plan, according to the Education Department.",

      "Those crosscurrents have left workers feeling generally exhausted, according to the job search firm, which on Wednesday named \"fatigue\" as its 2025 word of the year based on how often Glassdoor users mentioned it in the company's online forum. Glassdoor said use of the word in its online community jumped 41% in 2025, compared with the previous year.",
      "\"When we asked professionals in the spring, 'Do you feel like events in the news are draining your energy at work?', 78% said yes. Turns out, that exhaustion never really went away,\" Glassdoor said.",

    "story": [
      "Canada has launched a $1.2 billion initiative aimed at drawing leading researchers to the country, as the U.S. intensifies restrictions on highly skilled workers by charging $100,000 for H-1B visas.",
      "The Canadian government announced on Tuesday that its investment over 12 years will be used to recruit and support over 1,000 individuals advancing world-leading research in critical fields, including doctors and scientists.",
      "\"As other countries constrain academic freedoms and undermine cutting-edge research, Canada is investing in \u2013 and doubling down on \u2013 science,\" Melanie Joly, Canada's industry minister, said in a statement. \"Today's investment is about securing Canada's place at the forefront of discovery and innovation and leveraging our strength in science to support our future well-being and prosperity for generations to come.\"",
      "While the initiative does not explicitly mention the United States, it appears aimed \u2013 at least in part \u2013 at attracting highly skilled workers like those who could hold H-1B visas.",
      "In September, President Trump signed an executive order requiring a $100,000 fee for H-1B skilled foreign worker applicants, saying it will spur companies to hire Americans instead of people from overseas.",
      "The fee applies only to new H-1B applicants who live abroad, according to the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which oversees the visa program. More specifically, the $100,000 fee applies to H-1B applications filed on or after Sept. 21 by workers outside the U.S. and who do not currently hold such a visa, USCIS said in October.",
      "While the fee could foster boosted domestic hiring in some industries, other industries could take a hit. The U.S. health care system, for example, which depends on international professionals such as doctors, lab technicians and nurses to fill positions, could become collateral damage.",
      "Canada, meanwhile, faces its own challenges. The country is experiencing a significant shortage of doctors in primary care, leaving millions without a family physician and contributing to longer emergency room waits and poorer health outcomes.",
      "In response, Canadian officials have announced a path to expedited permanent residency for overseas doctors with at least one year of Canadian work experience, aiming to address the critical workforce gap.",
      "\"This dedicated Express Entry category, along with the reserved federal admission spaces for provinces and territories, will help bring in and keep practice-ready doctors, so people across Canada can get the care they need,\" Lena Metlege Diab, Canada's minister of refugees and citizenship, said in a statement Monday.",
      "Some scholars are already making their way from the U.S. to Canadian universities. The University of Toronto announced in November that it recruited three top researchers from U.S. institutions \u2014 whose work ranges from the search for new planets to economics \u2014 and called it a \"big win for Canada.\"",
      "\"By attracting the top minds from around the world to work alongside exceptional Canadian researchers, the Government of Canada is building the kind of scientific and academic powerhouse that drives the strongest economy in the G7,\" Joly said.",

    "summary": "Dozens of health care organizations have asked the Trump administration to shield the doctors, nurses, and techs they need to fill shortages from a $100,000 visa fee for skilled foreign workers.",
    "story": [
      "Bekki Holzkamm has been trying to hire a lab technician at a hospital in rural North Dakota since late summer.",
      "Not one U.S. citizen has applied.",
      "West River Health Services in Hettinger, a town of about 1,000 residents in the southwestern part of the state, has four options, and none is good.",
      "The hospital could fork over $100,000 for the Trump administration's new H-1B visa fee and hire one of the more than 30 applicants from the Philippines or Nigeria. The fee is the equivalent of what some rural hospitals would pay two lab techs in a year, said Holzkamm, who is West River's lab manager.",
      "West River could ask the Department of Homeland Security to waive the fee. But it's unclear how long the waiver process would take and if the government would grant one. The hospital could continue trying to recruit someone inside the U.S. for the job. Or, Holzkamm said, it could leave the position unfilled, adding to the workload of the current \"skeleton crew.\"",
      "The U.S. health care system depends on foreign-born professionals to fill its ranks of doctors, nurses, technicians, and other health providers, particularly in chronically understaffed facilities in rural America.",
      "But a new presidential proclamation aimed at the tech industry's use of H-1B visas is making it harder for West River and other rural providers to hire those staffers.",
      "\"The health care industry wasn't even considered. They're going to be collateral damage, and to such an extreme degree that it was clearly not thought about at all,\" said Eram Alam, a Harvard associate professor whose new book examines the history of foreign doctors in the U.S.",
      "Elissa Taub, a Memphis, Tennessee-based attorney who assists hospitals with the H-1B application process, has been hearing concerns from her clients.",
      "\"It's not like there's a surplus of American physicians or nurses waiting in the wings to fill in those positions,\" she said.",
      "Until recently, West River and other employers paid up to $5,000 each time they applied to sponsor an H-1B worker. The visas are reserved for highly skilled foreign workers.",
      "The new $100,000 fee \u2014 part of a\u00a0September proclamation\u00a0by President Trump \u2014 applies to workers living outside the U.S. but not those who were already in the U.S. on a visa.",
      "West River lab tech Kathrine Abelita is one of nine employees \u2014 six technicians and three nurses \u2014 at the hospital who are current or former H-1B visa holders. Abelita is from the Philippines and has worked at West River since 2018. She's now a permanent U.S. resident.",
      "\"It's going to be a big problem for rural health care,\" she said of the new fee. She said most younger American workers want to live in urban areas.",
      "Sixteen percent of registered nurses, 14% of physician assistants, and 14% of nurse practitioners and midwives who work in U.S. hospitals are immigrants, according to a\u00a02023 government survey. Nearly a quarter of physicians in the U.S. went to medical school outside the U.S. or Canada, according to\u00a02024 licensing data.",
      "The\u00a0American Hospital Association, two\u00a0national rural health organizations, and\u00a0more than 50 medical societies\u00a0have asked the administration to give the health care industry exemptions from the new fee. The new cost will disproportionally harm rural communities that already struggle to afford and recruit enough providers, the groups argue.",
      "\"A blanket exception for healthcare providers is the simplest path forward,\" the National Rural Health Association and National Association of Rural Health Clinics wrote in a joint letter.",
      "The proclamation allows fee exemptions for individuals, workers at specific companies, and those in entire industries when \"in the national interest.\"\u00a0New guidance\u00a0says the fee will be waived only in an \"extraordinarily rare circumstance.\" That includes showing that there is \"no American worker\" available for the position and that requiring a company to spend $100,000 would \"significantly undermine\" U.S. interests.",
      "Taub called those standards \"exceptionally high.\"",
      "Representatives of the NRHA and the American Medical Association, which organized a letter from the medical societies, said they've received no response after sending requests to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in late September and early October. The AHA declined to say whether it had heard back.",
      "Homeland Security officials directed KFF Health News' inquiries to the White House, which did not answer questions about individual waiver timelines or the possibility of a categorical exemption for the health care industry.",
      "Instead, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers sent a statement defending the new fee, saying it will \"put American workers first.\" Her comments echo Mr. Trump's proclamation, which focuses on accusations that the tech industry is abusing the H-1B program by replacing American workers with lower-paid foreign ones. But the order applies to all trades.",
      "Alam, the Harvard professor, said the U.S.' reliance on international providers does raise legitimate concerns, such as about how it takes professionals away from lower-income countries facing even greater health concerns and staffing shortages than the U.S.",
      "This decades-long dependency, she said, stems from population booms, medical schools' historical exclusion of nonwhite men, and the \"much, much cheaper\" cost of importing providers trained abroad than expanding health education in the U.S.",
      "Internationally trained doctors tend to work in rural and urban areas that are poor and underserved, according to\u00a0a survey\u00a0and\u00a0research review.",
      "Nearly 1,000 H-1B providers were employed in rural areas this year, the two rural health organizations wrote in their letter to the Trump administration.",
      "J-1 visas, the most common type held by foreign doctors during their residencies and other postgraduate training in the U.S., require them to return to their home country for two years before applying for an H-1B.",
      "But a government program called the Conrad 30 Waiver Program allows up to 1,500 J-1 holders a year to remain in the U.S. and apply for an H-1B in exchange for working for three years in a provider shortage area, which includes many rural communities.",
      "President Trump's proclamation says employers that sponsor H-1B workers already inside the U.S., such as doctors with these waivers, won't have to pay the six-figure fee, a nuance clarified in guidance released about a month later.",
      "But employers will have to pay the new fee when hiring doctors and others who apply while living outside the U.S.",
      "Alyson Kornele, CEO of West River Health Services, said most of the foreign nurses and lab techs it hires are outside the U.S. when they apply.",
      "Ivan Mitchell, CEO of Great Plains Health in North Platte, Nebraska, said most of his hospital's H-1B physicians were inside the U.S. on other visas when they applied. But he said physical therapists, nurses, and lab techs typically apply from abroad.",
      "Holzkamm said it took five to eight months to hire H-1B applicants at her lab before the new fee was introduced.",
      "Bobby Mukkamala, a surgeon and the president of the American Medical Association, said Republican and Democratic lawmakers are concerned about the ramifications for rural health care.",
      "They include Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who said he planned to reach out about possible exemptions.",
      "\"We want to make it easier, not harder, and less expensive, not more expensive, for people who need the workforce,\" the Republican told KFF Health News in September.",
      "Thune's office did not respond to questions about whether the senator has heard from the administration regarding potential waivers for health workers.",
      "The Trump administration is facing at least two lawsuits attempting to block the new fee.\u00a0One group of plaintiffs\u00a0includes a company that recruits foreign nurses and a union that represents medical graduates.\u00a0Another lawsuit, by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, mentions concerns about the physician shortage and health systems' ability to afford the new fee.",
      "Kornele said West River won't be able to afford a $100,000 fee so it's doubling down on local recruiting and retention.",
      "But Holzkamm said she hasn't been successful in finding lab techs from North Dakota colleges, even those who intern at the hospital. She said West River can't compete with the salaries offered in bigger cities.",
      "\"It's a bad cycle right now. We're in a lot of trouble,\" she said.",

      "Homeownership is increasingly out of reach for most U.S. families as the gap between people's earnings and home prices\u00a0widens, according to a new analysis.",
      "More than 75% of homes across the country are unaffordable for the typical household, Bankrate said in a\u00a0report. The personal finance firm defines a home as affordable if the annual housing costs do not exceed 30% of a household's income.",
      "\"Only a sliver of the housing market is affordable to the typical household,\" Bankrate data analyst Alex Gailey told CBS News. \"That's when homeownership starts to feel less like a common middle-class milestone and more like a luxury.\"",
      "Experts emphasize that the ability to buy a home, long viewed as a pillar of the American Dream, is critical for building wealth. But high home prices, driven in part by a nationwide shortage of affordable housing, have made that difficult for many Americans.",
      "\"It's left the average American household with far fewer homes than they can afford, and we haven't been building at the rate we should be,\" Gailey said.",
      "Figures from the National Association of Realtors show that only 24% of housing sales last year were by first-time homebuyers \u2014 down from 50% in 2010.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 After weeks of decrying the focus on \"affordability\" and calling it a \"Democratic hoax,\" President Trump spoke in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, Tuesday night to sell his economic agenda ahead of a challenging midterm election season for congressional Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump spent much of the more than 90-minute-long rally-style speech promoting and defending his economic record, saying,\u00a0\"America is winning again\" and \"Pennsylvania is prospering again.\" He touted job growth in the key battleground state, which has a slightly lower unemployment rate than the nation as a whole, and a decline in gas prices. The president also claimed his tariffs on foreign goods are paying dividends for the U.S. economy \u2014 despite worries from most economists that tariffs can lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices.",
      "He pointed to the tax components of his \"big, beautiful bill,\" including a plan to create\u00a0investment accounts for children \u2014 seeded with $1,000 from the federal government for eligible kids \u2014 and a tax deduction for tips.",
      "Mr. Trump highlighted his decision to let Japan-based Nippon Steel buy U.S. Steel, a major employer in Pennsylvania. He said his administration \"saved\" the company, which he said is now \"hot as a pistol.\"",
      "\"The one thing you need, you need steel,\" he said. \"You know, you can give up certain products. You can give up pencils... You don't need 37 dolls for your daughter. Two or three is nice, but you don't need 37 dolls.\"",
      "He argued his administration is \"crushing\" inflation and said \"prices are coming down.\" Consumer prices rose 3% year-over-year in September, which is well below 2022 levels \u2014 when inflation hit 9.1% \u2014 but still higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. Mr. Trump also continued blaming Democrats for affordability issues.",
      "\"They caused the high prices, and we're bringing them down,\" the president said.",
      "After initially focusing on cost-of-living issues, Mr. Trump veered off topic at times, riffing about immigration and polling members of the audience about whether to refer to his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, as \"sleepy Joe\" or \"crooked Joe.\"",
      "He also repeatedly brought up a fraud scandal that has enveloped Minnesota politics, and pointed to the fact that most of the defendants are of Somali descent. At several points, he urged Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to \"do your job\" as Bessent's agency investigates allegations that Minnesota tax dollars went to the terror group al Shabaab.",
      "Trump addresses affordability after calling issue a \"scam\"",
      "The president has publicly and privately vented about the focus on affordability as an issue for weeks, referring to it as a \"hoax,\" a \"con job\" and a \"scam\" perpetuated by Democrats.",
      "Mr. Trump criticized Democrats for focusing on affordability issues in Tuesday's speech, though he said: \"I can't call it a hoax because they'll misconstrue that.\"",
      "Last week, the president called the affordability issue a \"fake narrative\" made up by Democrats to sway the public. But at the same time, he said he had inherited problems with affordability from his predecessor.",
      "\"They just say the word,\" the president said during his Cabinet meeting on Dec. 2. \"It doesn't mean anything to anybody. They just say it \u2014 affordability. I inherited the worst inflation in history. There was no affordability. Nobody could afford anything.\"",
      "Inflation has\u00a0edged higher\u00a0in recent months, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, but the latest inflation numbers have been delayed until mid-December \u2014 after the Federal Reserve's interest rate-setting meeting this week \u2014 because of the recent U.S.\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "In an interview published Tuesday, the president told Politico\u00a0that \"prices are all coming down.\"",
      "Behind the scenes, aides told CBS News last week that the president has grown increasingly irritated by perceptions that his policies aren't easing prices.",
      "His travel to sell his economic agenda in Pennsylvania is a quiet acknowledgement that he needs to do more to rally the public behind his policies. In Tuesday's speech, Mr. Trump said he decided to speak about affordability in part because chief of staff Susie Wiles told him he needed to start campaigning for the midterm elections.",
      "Polling shows voters are feeling the crunch of still-high prices and the cost of living, as well as the challenging market for job seekers \u2014 and many at least partially blame Mr. Trump.",
      "In a November CBS News/YouGov poll, 60% of respondents agreed Mr. Trump makes prices and inflation \"sound better than they really are.\" Nearly two-thirds of respondents said the president's policies are making grocery prices go up. Just 32% said the U.S. economy is good, down from 38% the month Mr. Trump took office in January. Respondents were most likely to say the economy and inflation are the most important to them, and among those who listed the economy and inflation as their top priorities, 77% said the president is not spending enough time on those issues.",
      "The Palm Beach Post, a local paper near Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in South Florida, published an opinion piece Tuesday with the headline, \"'Affordability' is not a hoax, Trump. Reality costs too much.\"",
      "Pennsylvania will feature key races for Republicans as they try to hold onto their majority in the House of Representatives in 2026. Mount Pocono, where Mr. Trump spoke Tuesday night, is just over 30 miles from Scranton, Biden's hometown.",

      "Mr. Trump's remarks come amid ongoing public frustration over the high cost of living in the U.S.",
      "Although U.S. inflation has fallen, the high cost of food, shelter, health care, utilities, child care and other basic necessities has remained a sore spot for millions of Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump has vacillated between downplaying complaints about the economy and defending his administration's efforts to address affordability issues.",
      "In November, for example, the Trump administration removed country-specific tariffs on imports of beef, bananas and coffee as consumers continue to grapple with high food prices. Mr. Trump last month also discussed offering Americans a $2,000 payment funded by U.S. tariff collections, while this month he floated the idea of using tariff revenue to cut federal income taxes.",
      "More recently, Mr. Trump on Monday announced $12 billion in aid for farmers who have struggled under tariffs and because of the U.S trade war with China.",
      "\"We're bringing prices way down,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. \"You can call it 'affordability' or anything you want, but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we're the ones that are fixing it.\"",
      "The economy has proved resilient this year despite earlier fears about the impact of steep new U.S. tariffs on imports. After losing steam in the first quarter, the nation's gross domestic product has accelerated in the second half of 2025, while the nation's labor market has remained steady despite slowing payroll gains.",
      "Financial markets also continue to hover in record territory, shrugging off concerns about a bubble in AI companies.",

    "summary": "The author and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott revealed $7.1 billion in donations to nonprofits in 2025 Tuesday, marking a significant increase in her annual giving from recent years.",
    "story": [
      "Philanthropist and billionaire MacKenzie Scott announced Tuesday she has given $7.1 billion in donations to nonprofits so far in 2025, a major increase over her recent yearly contributions.",
      "Writing in an essay on her website, Scott said, \"This dollar total will likely be reported in the news, but any dollar amount is a vanishingly tiny fraction of the personal expressions of care being shared into communities this year.\"",
      "Scott acknowledged donating $2.6 billion in 2024 and $2.1 billion in 2023. The gifts this year bring her total giving since 2019 to $26.3 billion.",
      "Scott's donations have captured the attention of nonprofits and other charitable funders because they come with no strings attached and are often very large compared to the annual budgets of the recipient organizations. Forbes estimates Scott's net worth at $33 billion, most of which comes from Amazon shares she received after her 2019 divorce from company founder Jeff Bezos.",
      "Research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy in February showed that Scott has donated to more than 2,000 nonprofits, and the median size was roughly $5 million.",
      "With the exception of an open call for applications in 2023, it is not possible to apply for her funding nor to reach her directly, as Scott maintains no public-facing office or foundation. Organizations are usually notified through an intermediary that Scott is awarding them a donation with little prelude or warning.",
      "In advance of her announcement on her website, Yield Giving, more than a dozen historically Black colleges and universities revealed they had received $783 million in donations from Scott so far this year, according to research from Marybeth Gasman, a professor at Rutgers University and expert on HBCUs.",
      "\"One of the things that I really admire about Mackenzie Scott is that she is like an equity machine,\" Gasman told the Associated Press, especially at a time when efforts to promote equity in education have come under attack from the Trump administration. She also said Scott's gifts to HBCUs this time are bigger than the round of donations she made in 2020.",
      "Not all of the schools that previously had received funding from Scott received a gift this time and there were some first-time recipients as well. In total, Gasman has tracked $1.35 billion in donations from Scott to HBCUs since 2020.",
      "Scott's recent donations to HBCU's include $50 million to\u00a0Norfolk State University, $63 million to\u00a0Prairie View A&M University\u00a0and $50 million to\u00a0Bowie State University.",
      "On Friday, Scott donated $25 million to Lincoln University of Pennsylvania.",
      "In addition, UNCF, which is the largest provider of scholarships to minority students, received $70 million from Scott, and said it will invest the gift in a collective endowment it is building for participating HBCUs. Another $50 million went to Native Forward Scholars Fund, which had also received a previous gift from Scott and provides college and graduate scholarships to Native American students.",
      "Unlike Scott's gifts, most foundations or major donors direct grants to specific programs and require an application and updates about the impact of the nonprofit's work. Scott does not ask grantees to report back about how they used the money.",
      "In October, Scott posted an essay on her website. The essay, which she expanded upon in December to announce her giving, also reflects on how acts of generosity and kindness can ripple far afield and into the future. She cited her own experiences getting help while in college, including a dentist who repaired a tooth for free and her roommate who loaned her $1,000.",
      "Scott now has invested in that same roommate's company, which offers loans to students who would otherwise struggle to get financing from banks. The investments seem to be part of an effort Scott announced last year to move more of her money into \"mission aligned\" investments, rather than into vehicles that seek only the highest monetary returns.",
      "In her 2025 essay, Scott seemed to urge people toward action, writing, \"There are many ways to influence how we move through the world, and where we land.\"",

    "summary": "Beating back inflation is only half the battle in lowering the cost of living \u2014 you also have to think about people's pay, economists argue.",
    "story": [
      "Mounting public attention on the struggle millions of Americans face affording food, housing and other daily necessities has largely centered on what can be done to quash inflation. Yet some economists say the discussion is incomplete without addressing another major reason life has become unaffordable for so many people: their\u00a0meager paychecks.",
      "\"It's not just about how much things cost. Affordability is truly about, 'Does an individual have enough money to buy the things they want?' So it's not about making things cheaper, but making it so you earn more so that the stuff you need is affordable,\" Heidi Shierholz, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday evening is expected to address cost-of-living concerns and other economic issues at a rally in Mount Pocono, Pa. Although he has at times dismissed claims that the U.S. faces an affordability crisis, his administration has also taken steps to offer relief.",
      "In November, for example, Mr. Trump removed country-specific tariffs on imports of beef, bananas and coffee as consumers continue to grapple with high food prices. The president last month also discussed offering Americans a $2,000 payment funded by U.S. tariff collections, while this month he floated the idea of using tariff revenue to cut federal income taxes.",
      "\"Your money doesn't go as far\"",
      "To be sure, controlling inflation is critical, as well as an explicit aim under the Federal Reserve's dual mandate to keep both unemployment and prices in check. Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, describes prices and wages as \"two sides of the same coin.\"",
      "\"You can achieve the same standard of living by either raising wages or lowering costs or both,\" he added. \"So it is important to deal with cost-of-living issues if you want to improve living standards, but raising wages also works.\"",
      "Shierholz, who served as chief economist at the Department of Labor under Barack Obama from 2014 to 2017, thinks a better way to make life more affordable is to raise worker wages so their dollars stretch further. She also favors providing government subsidies to help ease the burden of affording essential \u2014 and increasingly costly \u2014 services such as child care and health care.",
      "One-third of middle-class families struggle to afford housing\u00a0and child care, according to a recent\u00a0report from the nonpartisan Brookings Institution.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans are struggling to afford things beyond the bare essentials, according to the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity. The research firm has found that the bottom 60% of income earners in the U.S. have difficulty affording expenses such as higher education, transportation and even the basic technology required for their jobs.",
      "\"There are some things that feel out of reach that didn't feel like they were out of reach in the past,\" said Veronique de Rugy, an economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. \"Your money doesn't go as far as it used to.\"",
      "Why prices may not drop much",
      "Economists note that prices don't generally decline broadly unless the economy is in a recession, with presidential administrations and even the Fed having a limited toolkit for addressing severe bouts of inflation. Meanwhile, a sharp, across-the-board drop in prices can indicate a dangerous erosion in consumer demand, leading to an economic downturn.",
      "\"Overall, it's very rare and not a good thing to have outright deflation across the economy,\" the Cato Institute's Lincicome told CBS News.",
      "Indeed, millions of people would have to lose their jobs, and then cut their spending, for demand to slow enough for companies to broadly reduce their prices, according to Shierholz.",
      "\"In order to bring the overall price level down, you have to have a massive recession because people are not demanding stuff, because they don't have any income,\" she added. \"That's how you get a drop in the overall price level.\"",
      "Affordability fixes?",
      "Shierholz favors a range of policies for driving both short- and long-term wage growth. First and foremost, the U.S. could boost the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "Local governments aren't waiting around for the feds to take action, with dozens of states in recent years adopting higher baseline wages. In 2026,\u00a0minimum wage increases are set to take effect in 19 states and 49 cities and counties starting on Jan. 1, according to the National Employment Law Project.",
      "Reforming labor laws to make it easier for workers to form a union can also lead to higher wages for workers, Shieholz said. Equally important, in her view, is providing a robust social safety net. That includes providing ample unemployment insurance benefits so workers who lose their jobs can stay afloat financially.",
      "\"That actually raises wages because it gives workers power,\" she said. \"By contrast, if your employer knows you'll drop into poverty if you give up or lose your job, you're going to be much less able to make any risky demands.\"",
      "The Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a nonpartisan group focused on economic equality, also argues in a new report\u00a0that expanding unemployment insurance benefits helps low-income workers find better-paying jobs.",
      "Although surging employee pay can fuel inflation under certain conditions, De Rugy of the Mercatus Center said that rising wages rooted in strong economic growth \"actually improves affordability, because it tends to shift the bargaining power toward employees.\"",
      "To ease housing costs, progressive economists also support policies like freezing the rent and offering financial incentives to homebuilders to put up more affordable housing.",
      "Other experts also underline the importance of providing low-cost child care as a key part of solving the affordability puzzle for U.S. families.\u00a0Child care costs today exceed\u00a0the cost of rent in dozens of cities, according to a recent LendingTree analysis. Households spend an average of $1,282 per month for full-time child care for one child and $2,252 for two kids, the lending marketplace found.",
      "Some states are leading the way to ease child care costs, showing that progress is possible given sufficient political will. In November,\u00a0New Mexico became the first U.S. state to offer free universal child care to residents, with Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham telling CBS News it would save families an average of $12,000 a year.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-december-10-meeting/",
    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 14:53:08 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve will announce if they will cut rates again in December's meeting \u2014 their last meeting of 2025. The decision will determine whether borrowers get more relief on interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve will announce whether to cut interest rates at its December meeting, capping off a turbulent year for the U.S. economy defined by fresh labor market headwinds and tariff-fueled inflation that has deepened the nation's affordability crunch.",
      "The U.S. central bank will have to make its decision without some key government data. Hiring data for November and the latest inflation number have been delayed until mid-December \u2014 after the Fed's meeting \u2014 because of the U.S.\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "Those two measures are key to the Fed's decision-making on interest rates because of its so-called dual mandate, which is to keep both inflation and unemployment low. Those goals have proved difficult to reconcile this year amid a slowdown in hiring and a spike in layoffs, while inflation has edged higher\u00a0in recent months, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "Economists expect another quarter-point cut",
      "Despite the conflicting data, most economists are penciling in an interest-rate cut at the December 10 meeting.",
      "CME FedWatch, which assesses the probability of rate moves based on futures pricing data, puts the odds of another 0.25 percentage-point cut in the Fed's benchmark rate at 88%. That would represent the third straight Fed cut and lower the federal funds rate, or what banks charge each other for short-term loans, to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%.",
      "A rate cut this week could help some borrowers by reducing the cost of their loans, from credit card APRs to home equity lines of credit. That could bolster U.S. households at a time when many Americans report still feeling pinched by the rising cost of food, health care and other everyday expenses.",
      "\"Another Fed rate cut to close an unnervingly uncertain year is good news for borrowers,\" LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst Matt Schulz told CBS News. \"The accumulated savings from the Fed's moves are starting to add up to real money.\"",
      "Credit card rates are now at their lowest since April 2023, and are continuing to fall, Schulz added. Another rate cut on Dec. 10 would mark the sixth reduction since September 2024, with those cuts amounting to hundreds of dollars in savings for many borrowers, he added.",
      "Although official economic data has been delayed, Fed officials will be looking at other data sources, such as the ADP National Employment Report, which tracks private payrolls. Its November data shows employers shed 32,000 jobs, a signal the labor market is continuing to face headwinds.",
      "\"The absence of recent inflation data leaves the Federal Reserve operating with limited visibility, while alternative labor indicators and political pressure are steering the committee toward a more accommodative policy stance,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email.",
      "President Trump and other administration officials have chastised Fed Chair Jerome Powell this year about not moving sooner to ratchet back interest rates.",
      "Another Fed rate cut carries its own risks. Lowering borrowing costs can spur consumers and businesses to spend more, potentially fueling higher inflation, Kates noted.",
      "A Fed divided",
      "Although economists expect the Fed to approve a rate cut on Wednesday, not all members of the Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 the central bank's 12-member rate-setting panel \u2014 are expected to support the move.",
      "Several FOMC members have recently spoken publicly in support of cutting rates, including Federal Reserve Bank of New York president John Williams, who last month said the labor market's weakness outweighs concerns about inflation. In October, however, Powell\u00a0cautioned that a December rate cut wasn't a \"foregone conclusion,\" pointing to signs that the job market remains on firm ground.",
      "\"It's difficult to recall a time when the Federal Open Market Committee has been so evenly divided about the need for additional rate cuts than the upcoming December meeting,\" Michael Pearce, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"It's a close call, but on balance we expect the committee to vote to lower rates\" by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "Are more rate cuts coming in 2026?",
      "For consumers, businesses and investors, perhaps the biggest question on Wednesday is whether policymakers will hint at more rate cuts for 2026.",
      "For now, economists expect the Fed to hold rates steady at its next meeting on Jan. 27-28, according to a poll by FactSet. The survey of economists shows a 62% probability that the Fed will leave rates unchanged next month.",
      "Even so, economists are generally forecasting more rate cuts for 2026, although the timing remains uncertain. The Fed could wait until March to make its first cut of the year because inflation remains above its 2% annual target, according to Maxime Darmet, senior economist at Allianz Trade.",
      "But the labor market remains a wild card, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a research report. Employers have cut more than 1.1 million jobs through November, the most since 2020 and a 54% increase from the same period a year ago, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Employers are relying more on artificial intelligence, with some companies\u00a0saying they're cutting jobs as AI makes their workforce more efficient.

    "summary": "Shoppers may be unaware they're paying as much as 23% more than others for the same grocery items on Instacart, a new analysis says.",
    "story": [
      "Instacart customers may be surprised to discover they are unwittingly paying more for the same items sold by some of America's major retail chains than their fellow shoppers.",
      "A months-long investigation by the nonprofit organizations Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative found that identical grocery items on Instacart could differ in price by as much as 23% from one customer to the next.",
      "That's due to the platform's algorithmic pricing experiments, which place different price tags on identical products without revealing the discrepancies directly to shoppers, the report found. The AI model, which Instacart started implementing in 2022, sets grocery prices at some large retail chains that partner with the San Francisco-based delivery company, the groups added.",
      "Variations in pricing for identical products are particularly acute in online shopping, given that customers don't have the same reference points as in physical stores, said Neil Saunders, managing director and analyst at GlobalData.",
      "\"You sit in front of your phone or your browser, you're shown the price, and you don't know what everyone else was shown,\" he said.",
      "Justin Brookman, director of digital marketplace policy for Consumer Reports, agreed. \"Traditionally, we haven't had to worry about this sort of thing. We would go to the supermarket and pay what was on the shelf,\" he told CBS News. \"Now, I think people are going to be worried: Am I getting ripped off?\"",
      "Report finds major price discrepancies",
      "Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative based their findings on data gathered from online shopping sessions, in which hundreds of volunteers shopped on Instacart for identical baskets of goods from Safeway and Target.",
      "Of the 437 participants, every single one was exposed to algorithmic price experiments, according to the report. The investigation also found evidence of price experimentation at Albertsons, Costco, Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market.",
      "According to Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, Instacart has framed price differences between customers as \"negligible.\" However, the scope of the price experiments is \"far broader and more costly to some consumers than has been publicly acknowledged,\" the organizations said in the report.",
      "The investigation found that some products had as many as five different price points, with variations ranging from as little as 7 cents to $2.56 per item. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins differed by as much as 23%.",
      "All told, the price variations could cost families $1,200 a year, based on how much Instacart says the typical household of four spends on groceries, the report found.",
      "Some products were unscathed by the price experiments. For example, at the Seattle Safeway, volunteers did not observe any price variations for items such as Premium brand saltine crackers, Heinz ketchup and Barilla farfalle pasta.",
      "Safeway didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Instacart told CBS News in a statement that 10 of its retailer partners are using pricing experiments, but did not specify which ones.",
      "\"Just as retailers have long tested prices in their physical stores to better understand consumer preferences, a subset of only 10 retail partners \u2014 ones that already apply markups \u2014 do the same online via Instacart,\" a spokesperson said in an email. \"These limited, short-term and randomized tests help retail partners learn what matters most to consumers and how to keep essential items affordable.\"",
      "Customers were also shown different \"original\" prices, making some savings appear larger, the report found, a concept known as \"fictitious pricing.\"\u00a0Amazon was sued this October\u00a0for allegedly using this tactic during its summer Prime Day sale.",
      "The rise of AI pricing models",
      "Dynamic pricing, which sets consumer prices based on demand, has long been part of the e-commerce landscape. However, while it's a common tactic in certain industries like travel, where supply is fixed, consumers may be surprised to see it cropping up in the grocery space, Saunders said.",
      "\"In retail, especially grocery retail, people expect the price to be the price,\" he said. \"They don't expect [it] to yo-yo up and down.\"",
      "Another issue, as the report points out, is that consumers often have no clue that they may be paying more for the same item. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\u00a0Act prevents \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\" including \"misleading cost or price claims.\" However, Saunders said he doesn't believe companies are legally obligated to tell customers that they are part of pricing experiments.",
      "\"Instacart shoppers we spoke to say they were unaware that they were participants in active Instacart pricing experiments and view the practice as manipulative and unfair,\" the report says.",
      "One example of dynamic pricing is surveillance pricing, a tactic employed by companies that involves using a shopper's behavior and personal data to make price evaluations, according to the FTC. Saunders said surveillance pricing has been supercharged by artificial intelligence, which can assess vast amounts of data at rapid speeds to determine price levels.",
      "Instacart told CBS News that it does not use personal, demographic or user-level behavioral data to set prices.",
      "As pricing models like Instacart's become more sophisticated, Brookman said he's concerned about what it could mean for consumers.",
      "\"I'm worried companies are going to use these sorts of algorithmic pricing models to charge us the maximum amount we're willing to pay, which is good for their profits, but not so good for [our wallets],\" he said.",

    "summary": "Genesis HealthCare's bankruptcy case in Dallas will allow the nursing home chain to avoid paying millions of dollars it promised for residents who were injured or died while in its care.",
    "story": [
      "Nancy Hunt arrived at an emergency room from a Genesis HealthCare nursing home in Pennsylvania in such dreadful shape, including maggots infesting her gangrened foot, that the hospital called an elder abuse hotline and then the police, her son alleged in a lawsuit.",
      "Hunt died five days later. Her death certificate said the foot injury was a \"significant\" factor. Genesis denied wrongdoing but agreed to pay $3.5 million in a settlement Hunt's son signed in August 2024.",
      "Yet Genesis hasn't paid most of that debt, court records show. It may never have to.",
      "Once the nation's largest nursing home chain, Genesis says it was spending $8 million a month defending and settling lawsuits over resident injuries and deaths in recent years. But the company is now poised to wipe the liability slate clean by seeking refuge in the most protective corner of the legal system for the nursing home industry: bankruptcy court.",
      "The Genesis case, one of 11 large senior care bankruptcies this year, illustrates how health care companies can dodge public and financial accountability for alleged negligence through delays, confidentiality clauses, and bankruptcy maneuvers, a KFF Health News investigation found.",
      "When it filed for bankruptcy in Dallas in July, Genesis estimated its total liability for nearly a thousand settled and pending lawsuits at $259 million. A KFF Health News review of the terms of 155 settlement agreements and corporate financial statements shows Genesis officials knew insolvency was possible yet included provisions in its settlement agreements allowing it to defer payment, often for a year or more.",
      "As a result, Genesis paid nothing in 85 cases and only a portion in the other 70, according to civil court records and bankruptcy claims made available through people with access to them. It still owes $41 million of the $58 million it had agreed to pay in those cases, the records show.",
      "\"It just feels like they killed my mom and got away with it,\" said Vanessa Betancourt, whose mother, Nellie Betancourt, a retired nurse, fractured her hip at a Genesis home in Albuquerque, New Mexico \u2014 an injury the medical examiner's report said led to her death. Genesis agreed to a $650,000 settlement with Betancourt's family in April under the condition it would not need to pay the first of seven installments for another year, according to the settlement document.",
      "Genesis denied wrongdoing in all lawsuits and settlements. In a written statement, the company did not answer questions about individual personal injury cases. The statement said Genesis remained \"focused on delivering high-quality, compassionate care to our patients and residents without disruption\" during bankruptcy.",
      "One lawsuit Genesis settled for nearly $1 million alleged nursing home managers ignored repeated warnings about a male resident's behavior before he sexually assaulted a female Alzheimer's patient, according to court records. In a case the company resolved for $500,000, a Genesis nursing home was accused of delaying the hospitalization of a resident who had vomited brown mucus. He died of a bowel obstruction. Genesis has paid nothing for either settlement, according to bankruptcy claims.",
      "Creditors, including families of the deceased, are expected to salvage a fraction of what they were promised, if anything. On Dec. 10, the company's owners were scheduled to seek approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas to sell its nursing homes and other assets to its largest investor, a private equity firm. In court papers, lawyers for residents and other creditors say the complex plan will prevent them from pursuing Genesis' new ownership and other companies they blame for the company's collapse.",
      "John Anthony, a bankruptcy attorney representing 340 personal injury claims against Genesis, said, \"They never had any intention to honor these deals.\"",
      "Low ratings and fines",
      "During years of financial turmoil, Genesis has frequently struggled to provide top-notch care, federal records show. Using its five-star system, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services rated 58% of homes affiliated with Genesis as below average or much below average. CMS has fined Genesis homes $10 million for violating federal health standards over the past three years.",
      "In 2022, Connecticut health regulators shuttered a Genesis home after two deaths and multiple violations. The company closed another Connecticut nursing home this year after residents twice were evacuated over safety concerns.",
      "In its Chapter 11 filing, Genesis said it cared for about 15,000 residents in 165 nursing homes and 10 assisted living facilities in 18 states. They are centered in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New Mexico, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Maine, Alabama, Maryland, and North Carolina, according to the bankruptcy filing.",
      "The company said it owed $709 million in secured debt to lenders and the IRS. Under bankruptcy rules, those debts, backed by Genesis collateral, take precedence over the $1.6 billion in unsecured debt Genesis said it owes. Unsecured creditors include a pension fund; contractors that provided health services and equipment; Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and West Virginia for unpaid provider taxes; and former residents and their families who sued.",
      "Dangers in memory care",
      "Sandia Ridge Center, a Genesis home in Albuquerque, was repeatedly faulted by health regulators for not preventing sexual misbehavior in its memory care unit. In November 2021, CMS cited the home for lacking enough nurses to prevent sexual abuse among residents. An inspection report the following August identified more inappropriate sexual contact. Police were called to investigate sexual assault allegations in February and March of 2023, police reports show; neither resulted in criminal charges.",
      "Then in April 2023, a 61-year-old male resident with alcohol-related dementia sexually assaulted a female resident with Alzheimer's in the dining room, according to a police report and an inspection report. When the resident screamed for him to stop and that he was hurting her, he responded \"shut up bitch I know you like this,\" according to a lawsuit brought on behalf of the woman, identified in court papers as R.S.",
      "Sandia Ridge management had been aware of the male resident's behavioral issues for months, according to employee depositions in the case. Police had investigated a prior sexual assault allegation against him the previous year without bringing charges. In one deposition, a former activities assistant testified he hit her and twice pushed her into a bathroom while announcing, \"I want to have sex with you.\" When she reported him to a senior Genesis manager, she said in the deposition, the manager put his finger over his lips and said, \"Shhh.\"",
      "The activities worker testified that R.S. used to happily sing along with Elvis Presley songs. After the assault, the worker said, R.S. \"don't sing anymore.\"",
      "Inspectors cited the home for failing to protect R.S. The same report said the home didn't provide a therapist for another female resident who was being sexually harassed. Medicare fined Sandia Ridge Center $91,247. Genesis denied liability but settled R.S.' lawsuit for $925,000 in May, according to the bankruptcy claim.",
      "\"We just felt we have to hold them accountable,\" R.S.' daughter said in an interview, speaking on the condition that she and her mother not be identified, because of the nature of the assault. \"Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm naive, but the only way to do that is to sue someone, right?\"",
      "Genesis has not paid any of the settlement, according to the family's claim filing.",
      "Growth and debt",
      "Genesis' downfall can be traced to 2007, when affiliates of two private equity firms acquired the company in a $1.5 billion leveraged buyout, taking on substantial debt, according to its bankruptcy filing. Private equity also has been involved in other health care bankruptcies, including those of the HCR ManorCare nursing home chain, the prison health care contractor Corizon Health, and two for-profit hospital systems, Steward Health Care and Prospect Medical Holdings.",
      "In 2011, Genesis raised $2.4 billion by transferring substantially all its nursing home buildings and other real estate to Welltower, a publicly traded real estate investment trust, according to Genesis' bankruptcy filing. Genesis then rented the buildings back from Welltower, which made leasing costs a significant expense.",
      "Genesis went on a nationwide buying spree. At its peak in 2016, it had grown to more than 500 nursing homes. In a court declaration, Louis Robichaux IV, a consultant overseeing Genesis' bankruptcy restructuring, wrote that as the company expanded, it became harder to manage and \"mired in corporate inefficiencies.\" Robichaux wrote that Genesis' financial woes were exacerbated by rapidly increasing labor costs and lawsuits, including some predating the COVID pandemic.",
      "Starting in 2021, Genesis avoided bankruptcy after receiving $100 million in loans from a private equity firm founded by Joel Landau, the owner of a Brooklyn-based nursing home chain, according to Robichaux's filing.",
      "But Genesis continued to teeter on the edge of insolvency. In audited financial statements for 2022 and 2023 submitted to a California oversight agency, management and auditors said rent and debt obligations raised \"substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.\"",
      "In a court filing, a committee appointed by the U.S. Trustee's Office to represent the unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy accused Landau and Welltower of orchestrating a covert plan that allowed Welltower to keep getting its rents while Landau could run the company and \"siphon value to himself.\" The committee alleged their efforts forced the company into insolvency while \"staffing levels and patient care declined precipitously.\" Landau and Welltower did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Drawn-out lawsuits",
      "Erin Pearson sued Genesis over the death of her father, James Sanderson, a retired mining company executive who died in 2018 after spending less than a month at Bear Canyon Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. In the memory care unit, Sanderson fell repeatedly, suffered medication errors made by nursing home staff, and developed a bowel obstruction and sepsis, according to the lawsuit, filed in 2019. Pearson's lawyers said he was not hospitalized until eight days after nurses noticed he was vomiting brown mucus.",
      "After the judge rejected Genesis' request to force Pearson into arbitration, Genesis appealed. It took 2\u00bd years before an appeals court affirmed the original decision to let the case go forward in court, records show.",
      "This past May, more than five years after suing, Pearson reached a $500,000 settlement, with the first payment required by November, according to a copy of the agreement. Nothing was paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.",
      "\"It was so drawn out and for so long,\" Pearson said in an interview, calling Genesis' bankruptcy \"despicable.\"",
      "Payouts postponed",
      "Jennifer Foote, an Albuquerque attorney who represents clients in multiple lawsuits against Genesis, including Pearson's, said the company frequently filed appeals. \"They did not usually win them on these issues,\" she said, \"and our sense was that they were doing it as a delay tactic.\"",
      "Genesis started using installment payments around 2018, said Dusti Harvey, Foote's law partner. \"The payments wouldn't start for several months out,\" Harvey said. Foote said Genesis' lawyers often wanted to time the payments to start the month the trial in the case was scheduled to occur.",
      "Families had to wait even when comparatively small amounts of money were involved, settlement agreements show. Genesis' settlement agreements also included a confidentiality clause prohibiting discussion of the incidents.",
      "Genesis agreed to pay $42,000 in a November 2024 settlement, but the first payment was not due until nine months later. It was not paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.",
      "A $250,000 settlement signed in October 2023 did not start paying out until the following September. When Genesis declared bankruptcy \u2014 21 months after the case was resolved \u2014 it still owed $100,000, according to the family's claim.",
      "\"We never found out the truth\"",
      "Settling cases allowed Genesis to avoid the expense and publicity of a trial, at which details of how its nursing homes functioned might have been revealed. In October 2020, Margarett Johnson, a retired school bus driver, fell out of her wheelchair at a Genesis nursing home in Waldorf, Maryland, fracturing her jawbone, nose, and neck, according to a lawsuit brought by her family. Johnson was sent to a trauma center and placed on a ventilator. She died three months later, at age 76, from ventilator-associated pneumonia, the lawsuit said.",
      "\"It looked like she was hit by a truck,\" Angelina Harley, one of her daughters, said in an interview. \"I knew my mom was not going to come home. I knew the Lord was not going to punish her more.\"",
      "The company denied negligence and blamed the accident on Johnson's jacket getting tangled in the wheel of her wheelchair, according to the lawsuit. Harley and her sister Angela Swann were dubious.",
      "\"We never found out the truth,\" Harley said. \"They wanted to settle out of court.\"",
      "The company denied liability but agreed to a $950,000 settlement in October 2024. It never paid the final $112,500 installment, according to a letter Johnson's five children sent to the bankruptcy judge.",
      "\"If you settle out of court, you know doggone well you did something wrong,\" Harley said.",
      "Maddening judges",
      "By summer 2025, judges in some civil cases had run out of patience.",
      "Alma Brown, a retired day care manager and accordion teacher living in a Genesis nursing home in Clovis, New Mexico, suffered falls, infections, bedsores, and other neglect that hastened her death in 2023, according to her estate's lawsuit. In Santa Fe District Court, Judge Kathleen McGarry Ellenwood castigated Genesis after it failed to pay $2 million of the $3 million settlement to Brown's estate or explain the delay.",
      "Genesis \"obviously benefited by not having to go to trial,\" McGarry Ellenwood said in one hearing, according to a court transcript. \"They assure me that they're not trying to renege on their contract, but it certainly seems like they haven't lived up to what the bargain was.\"",
      "Genesis declared bankruptcy the day McGarry Ellenwood announced she would impose more than $100,000 in fines, plus $10,000 more each day until the settlement was paid.",
      "In Pennsylvania, Greg Hunt petitioned a judge to punish Genesis after it stopped payments of the $3.5 million settlement after the death of his mother, Nancy, the resident with the gangrenous foot. She had spent eight months in 2019 at Brandywine Hall, a Genesis facility in West Chester that was later sold and renamed.",
      "In a filing with the Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County, Genesis admitted it was in arrears but asked the judge for more time, citing \"unforeseen and exigent financial challenges.\" Genesis said care for patients at its nursing homes would suffer if it had to pay immediately.",
      "Unswayed, Judge Richard Haaz in June ordered Genesis to pay up, along with punitive interest. But the bankruptcy court stayed that order. Genesis still owes $1.4 million of the $2 million it was supposed to pay, according to Hunt's claim. (The rest of the $3.5 million settlement is supposed to be paid by an insurer in January 2026.) Ian Norris, Hunt's lawyer, declined to comment, citing confidentiality provisions in the settlement.",
      "Court records indicate Genesis lawyers never disclosed in either case that it was preparing to declare bankruptcy.",
      "\"Bankruptcy as a tool\"",
      "In the first nine months of 2025, 10 other senior living companies with liabilities over $10 million entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to Gibbins Advisors, a consulting firm.",
      "Hamid Rafatjoo, a bankruptcy lawyer representing nursing homes who is not involved in the Genesis bankruptcy case, said filings may increase as the industry has become costlier to run and class action lawsuits have become a fixture.",
      "\"Nursing homes get sued all the time for everything,\" Rafatjoo said. \"A lot of operators wait too long to use bankruptcy as a tool.\"",
      "On Dec. 1, Genesis announced the results of its auction, saying it had elected to sell its assets to a private equity firm controlled by Landau. In a court filing, Anthony, the attorney for the personal injury claimants, alleged the auction was stacked in Landau's favor despite an \"objectively better and higher competing bid\" from another private equity investor that would have provided more money to creditors. Genesis said in its statement that Landau's group had increased its bid during the auction.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and two other senators last month asked the U.S. Trustee's Office to intervene in the case, out of concern that \"individuals who already own or control Genesis are trying to sell it to themselves, wiping away legal and other creditor debts in the process.\" Lawyers representing those in charge of the auction did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Families of former Genesis residents said they fear the capacity to purge lawsuits through bankruptcy emboldens nursing home owners who provide deficient care.",
      "\"They can file bankruptcy again,\" said Gabe Betancourt, whose wife, Nellie, died after her stay at Uptown Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. \"And we're the ones that will pay for it, with our memories, our lives.\"",

      "\"As of Dec. 1, 2025, Waymo received its 20th citation since the beginning of the school year,\" JJ Maldonado, a communications specialist for the Austin Independent School District, told CBS News. \"This is after the company said it had fixed the issue through software updates that were implemented on Nov. 17.\"",
      "In a Nov. 20\u00a0letter\u00a0to Waymo, the school district called on the robotaxi company to cease operations within the school district during the hours when students are loading and unloading from school buses until software updates are completed and Waymo can guarantee its vehicles will comply with the law.",
      "Maldonado said the company \"refused to cease operations\" during the hours the school district had requested.",
      "In response to a request for comment about the NHTSA probe, Waymo pointed to its overall safety record.",
      "\"Safety is our top priority, and the data shows we are improving road safety in the communities in which we operate, achieving a fivefold reduction in injury-related crashes compared to human drivers, and twelve times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians,\" a Waymo spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "Waymo did not comment on its response to the Austin school district's request to suspend service when students are getting on and off buses.",
      "In October, NHTSA launched a probe into the company after an incident in Atlanta, Georgia, in which a Waymo vehicle drove around a stopped school bus with flashing red lights and its stop arm deployed.",
      "While maneuvering around the bus, NHTSA said the vehicle passed the bus' stop arm and a safety device that swings out from the bus close to where students were disembarking. At the time of the incident, no safety operator was present in the self-driving vehicle, according to the NHTSA.",

      "Warner Bros. Discovery \"shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,\" Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison said in a statement.",
      "\"Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion,\" he said.",
      "Paramount Skydance is the parent company of CBS News.",
      "The new offer steps up the battle over the future of Warner Bros. Discovery, which on Friday agreed to a deal with Netflix under which the streaming giant would acquire Warner's streaming and movie assets. Warner Bros.' storied film library includes classics like \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" film series.",
      "Paramount Skydance said its offer is a better deal for Warner shareholders because it includes the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its cable television channels such as CNN, TBS, TNT and The Food Network. The transaction would also have an easier path through the regulatory process than Netflix's offer, according to Paramount.",
      "\"Paramount is highly confident in achieving expeditious regulatory clearance for its proposed offer, as it enhances competition and is pro-consumer, while creating a strong champion for creative talent and consumer choice,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Paramount Skydance's offer includes the cost of absorbing Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, which as of September 30 was more than $33 billion, a regulatory filing shows. The all-cash $30 per share offer amounts to nearly $78 billion. Excluding Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, Netflix's bid for the company comes to roughly $72 billion.",
      "The offer is backed by the Ellison family \u2014 Paramount CEO David Ellison's father is Larry Ellison, who leads software maker Oracle Corp. and is the second-richest person with a net worth of $277 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index \u2014 as well as investment firm RedBird Capital.",
      "Paramount Skydance's bid also includes several outside financing partners, according to a Paramount Skydance regulatory filing. They include Affinity Partners, the private equity firm run by Jared Kushner, a son-in-law of President Trump, and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.",
      "The outside investment firms have agreed to give up any governance rights, including seats on the board of directors of a combined firm, according to the regulatory filing.",
      "Potential antitrust \u2014 and political \u2014 hurdles",
      "Some Wall Street analysts have said the Netflix-Warner Bros. combination could raise concerns among U.S. antitrust enforcers because of the streaming service's size and the potential to reduce competition in the media space.",

      "Mr. Trump \"said he's going to be involved in the decision \u2014 we should take him at face value,\" Haley said. \"For him, it's just greater control over the media.\"",

      "In a presentation at the UBS Global Media and Communications conference on Monday, Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said they were confident their deal with Warner Bros. would close. Sarandos also said Netflix is committed to creating U.S. jobs.",
      "Blair Levin, a media and telecommunications industry analyst with investment adviser New Street Research, said Mr. Trump's involvement in the battle for Warner Bros. could backfire for Paramount Skydance.",
      "\"If Trump weighs in publicly against the deal, [Netflix] could argue that he did so for political or personal reasons rather than antitrust reasons and seek evidence, including discovery and depositions, leading to all kinds of delays and other potential collateral damage to the government case,\" he said in a note to investors.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery jumped $1.65, or 6.3%, to $27.72 in early trading on Monday, while Paramount Skydance shares rose 78 cents, or 5.8%, to $14.14. Netflix's stock slumped 4.9% to $95.64.",
      "Paramount Skydance's tender offer is set to expire on Jan. 8, 2026, unless it is extended.",

      "The prospect of more media industry consolidation has prompted critics such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, to speak out against the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal. In a statement on Friday, Warren said the combination would \"create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market.\"",
      "Netflix is likely to argue that other video platforms, such as YouTube should be included in calculating streaming services' market share,\u00a0according to The Guardian.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2026-minimum-wage-increases/",
    "published": "Mon, 08 Dec 2025 07:05:58 -0500",
    "summary": "Minimum wages are set to rise in 22 U.S. states and 66 cities and counties next year, even as the federal baseline wage remains at $7.25.",
    "story": [
      "Some workers will receive pay boosts next year as higher minimum wage regulations take effect in 22 states and 66 cities and counties across the U.S., a change that could help low-income households grappling with an\u00a0affordability crisis.",
      "On Jan. 1, 2026, the minimum wage is set to rise in 19 states and 49 cities and counties, for a total of 68 jurisdictions, according to a report from the National Employment Law Project (NELP), an advocacy organization for workers.",
      "Later in the year, an additional four states and 22 cities will boost their baseline wages, providing more relief to the lowest-paid U.S. workers, according to the group's analysis.",
      "Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the federal wage floor remains at $7.25 an hour, where it has been stuck since 2009. Given the rise in the cost of living in subsequent years, some states and municipalities have chosen to boost their own minimum wages through a combination of ballot measures, inflation adjustments and legislation.",
      "\"Policies increasing the minimum wage have been a lifeline for underpaid workers who have been the most impacted by a growing affordability crisis,\" the NELP report states.",
      "Here's where minimum wages will rise in 2026:",
      "Jan. 1 minimum wage increases",
      "Beginning Jan. 1, workers in 60 jurisdictions will earn a minimum wage of at least $15 an hour. In three states and 40 localities, the minimum wage for some or all employers will reach or exceed $17 an hour.",
      "For example, in New Jersey, the wage floor for long-term care workers will rise to $18.92 an hour. New York City, Long Island and Westchester will all increase their baseline pay to $17 an hour.",
      "In some cases, minimum wage changes will be based on the size of the employer. For instance, large employers in Hayward, California \u2014 a city near San Francisco \u2014 will be required to pay workers a minimum of $17.79 an hour, although the figure for small establishments is $16.90.",
      "In Novato, California, another city in the Bay Area, the wage floor will increase according to employer size. For very large employers, or those with more than 100 workers, the minimum wage will rise to $17.73 an hour. Large employers, or those with 26 to 99 employees, will see a baseline pay of $17.46. Small employers, or those with 25 or fewer workers, will have a minimum wage of $16.90.",
      "Cost-of-living adjustments, raises designed to help workers' pay keep up with inflation, are driving minimum wage increases in 13 states and 44 cities and counties across the U.S., according to the NELP report.",
      "\"In the face of federal inaction, these raises are indexed to inflation, so they match the cost of living,\" NELP researcher Tsedeye Gebreselassie told CBS News.",
      "She noted that several increases have been driven by worker-led organizing, kicked off by the Fight for $15, a national movement for better pay and working conditions, which began in 2012.",
      "Some localities continue to have a $7.25 minimum wage. Many of them are in southern U.S. states.",
      "\"The contrast between states and cities that are raising wages every year and those that are stuck at $7.25 is really jarring,\" Gebreselassie said. \"On the one hand, the lack of affordability is about things costing too much, but on the other hand, it means people are not earning enough money to buy things.\"",
      "She added, \"There is a lot of talk about the former, but we need to make sure we are not losing sight of the fact that workers' wages need to go up.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump's claims of a historic multitrillion-dollar investment surge don't match federal data or the administration's own numbers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has made increasingly sweeping claims about new investments flowing into the United States, citing figures as high as $21 trillion since taking office.",
      "\"Twenty-one trillion dollars will be the amount invested in the United States \u2014\u00a0 or committed to invest \u2014 in one year,\" the president said in a November meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "In an Oval Office event this Wednesday, President Trump said, \"In 10 months, we have $18 trillion being invested.\"",
      "But a CBS News review found no evidence that total commitments or new investments approach the scale the president has cited. While companies and foreign governments have announced large-scale projects since Mr. Trump's inauguration, the White House has not provided documentation showing total investments approaching $21 trillion \u2014 an amount roughly two-thirds of the annual GDP.",
      "The administration's own list of major investments \"made possible by President Trump's leadership\" totaled $9.6 trillion as of the latest update in November, but even that figure is exaggerated. It includes some investments announced under President Biden and trade goals that the U.S. is also partially responsible for.",
      "The White House did not directly respond to CBS News' questions about these inclusions or the discrepancies between the administration's total and the much higher figures the president has claimed in his remarks.",
      "\"President Trump's dealmaking has secured trillions in investments to make and hire in America, trillions in commercial opportunities for American companies, and trillions in new export opportunities,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.",
      "Federal data shows corporate investment levels are roughly in line with last year, with companies on track to invest over $5 trillion in 2025. The $20 trillion surge Mr. Trump has claimed does not appear in the available data.",
      "Here's a closer look at some of the investment claims.",
      "Trump claims credit for some corporate investments announced under Biden",
      "The White House list includes more than 100 corporate commitments totaling over $3 trillion. Yet some of the largest were originally unveiled years before Mr. Trump took office and were backed by federal funding under President Biden's administration.",
      "The administration lists a $200 billion investment by Micron Technology in semiconductor manufacturing and research. However, a company spokesman confirmed $120 billion of that was previously announced in 2022 and supported by $6 billion in funding from Biden's Chips and Science Act.",
      "Similarly, the White House attributes a $16 billion GlobalFoundries investment in U.S. chip production to Mr. Trump. However, only $3 billion is newly promised this year. A company spokesperson said the remaining $13 billion was originally announced under Biden and backed by tax credits from the Chips and Science Act.",
      "The Trump administration also claims credit for some major clean-energy manufacturing investments, even though its own policies have undercut projects in the sector, said Tom Taylor, a senior policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S.",
      "The administration cited Invenergy's $1.7 billion commitment to a clean-energy transmission project announced in May. In July, the U.S. Department of Energy canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee to Invenergy that had been issued under Biden. A spokesman for Invenergy said the company is continuing its transmission project with private financing, including the previously announced $1.7 billion investment.",
      "\"The administration has kind of been on a tear this year about canceling clean energy projects,\" Taylor said. His research shows the administration's funding cuts and policy shifts have halted over $20.8 billion in clean manufacturing investments this year.",
      "The White House list also contains apparent errors, including a $3 billion pledge by Kraft Heinz that appears twice. The administration has not responded to a CBS News request for clarification.",
      "Foreign trade goals and aspirational pledges inflate totals",
      "Foreign governments account for nearly $6 trillion on the White House's list, but several of the largest entries are trade targets \u2014 not investments in the U.S.",
      "For example, in a joint announcement, the U.S. and Qatar committed to \"generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion,\" without specifying what portion Qatar would spend or when. The figure is also more than five times the gross domestic product of Qatar in 2024.",
      "Similarly, India and the U.S. agreed to \"more than double total bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030\" \u2014 a trade target, not a singular investment commitment.",
      "Some foreign investment pledges touted by Mr. Trump also appear aspirational to some economists.",
      "Saudi Arabia promised to invest roughly $1 trillion in the U.S. during the crown prince's visit to the White House in November. But economists, including Maya Senussi at the Wall Street advisory firm Oxford Economics, have questioned\u202fwhether the oil-rich country could afford an investment that size with global energy prices declining.",
      "History also offers reason for skepticism: Mr. Trump touted in 2017 that Saudi Arabia had agreed to buy $400 billion in U.S. goods, but exports of American goods and services amounted to less than one-fourth of that total over his first term, according to analysis by the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.",
      "Current U.S. investment levels remain typical",
      "Federal data suggests that real investment spending \u2014 as opposed to announced commitments \u2014 remains roughly in line with last year's levels.",
      "Within the U.S., gross private domestic investment, the broadest measure of what U.S. companies are spending to expand their businesses, is projected to total about $5.4 trillion this year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, or BEA. That's up roughly $100 billion from the same point last year, but far below the multitrillion-dollar surge Mr. Trump has mentioned.",
      "\"Trump may be talking about commitments that have yet to happen. But on actual investment spending \u2014 so new equipment, buildings and machinery \u2014 2025 is similar to 2024,\" Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Some research suggests that foreign corporations have sharply increased the number of spending pledges under Mr. Trump. They've promised to invest over $270 billion from January to October, more than double the volume announced under Biden in the same period, according to fDi intelligence, which is part of the Financial Times.",
      "But experts say announcements do not always translate into realized investment.",
      "New foreign direct investment \u2014 the actual amount that foreign companies put into U.S. subsidiaries and projects \u2014 also remains steady. Foreign companies made roughly $145 billion worth of new investment in the U.S. in the first half of the year, nearly identical to the $144 billion invested in the same time period last year, BEA data shows.",
      "Analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an independent think tank, estimate foreign investments will come in under $400 billion this year, well below record levels.",
      "\"He's got a lot more in terms of announcements and promises than any prior president. But how much does that really mean in terms of money coming in?\" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",
      "This story has been updated with additional information from Invenergy.",

    "summary": "A federal judge in Maryland on Thursday ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia's immediate release from Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A Maryland judge on Thursday ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who was mistakenly deported to his home country earlier this year, from immigration custody.",
      "The decision from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis granted Abrego Garcia's habeas petition to release him from custody. It is a significant victory for Abrego Garcia, whose immigration case became a major flashpoint in President Trump's mass-deportation campaign when he was removed to El Salvador earlier this year.",
      "In her order, Xinis found that there was no final order of removal from the government to deport Abrego Garcia from the United States, despite the Trump administration's repeated attempts to remove him.",
      "\"Because respondents have no statutory authority to remove Abrego Garcia to a third country absent a removal order, his removal cannot be considered reasonably foreseeable, imminent, or consistent with due process,\" Xinis wrote in Thursday's order.",
      "\"Although respondents may eventually get it right, they have not as of today,\" the judge continued. \"Thus, Abrego Garcia's detention for the stated purpose of third country removal cannot continue. Respondents' conduct over the past months belie that his detention has been for the basic purpose of effectuating removal, lending further support that Abrego Garcia should be held no longer.\"",
      "Assistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the judge's decision \"naked judicial activism by an Obama-appointed judge.\"",
      "\"This order lacks any valid legal basis and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "The Trump administration has been attempting to re-deport Abrego Garcia to the African nations of Uganda, Eswatini or Ghana, but the countries have not agreed to accept him.",
      "But the administration informed the court in October that Liberia had agreed to take Abrego Garcia and would seek to deport him.",
      "The administration has \"received diplomatic assurances regarding the treatment of third-country individuals removed to Liberia from the United States and are making the final necessary arrangements for [Abrego Garcia's] removal,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's attorney, said in October that unless Liberia guarantees it will not send Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, deporting him to the West African nation \"is no less unlawful than sending him directly\" to his home country again.",
      "In November, the Trump administration argued that Abrego Garcia had received significant due process in the U.S. In a court filing, the Justice Department said a U.S. government asylum officer interviewed Abrego Garcia, who remains in federal immigration detention, and determined he had failed to prove he would face persecution or torture in Liberia.",
      "Xinis heard testimony in October from an official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement about the Trump administration's efforts to remove Abrego Garcia, who has been in ICE custody since late August. The official, John Schultz, said the administration remains in active discussions with Eswatini about removing him there, though the east African country rejected a request to take him.",
      "Still, Schultz said that once the administration has received word of a third country willing to accept Abrego Garcia, it could deport him within 72 hours if allowed by the court.",
      "Abrego Garcia has said he is willing to go to Costa Rica and designated the country as his preferred country of removal, and Costa Rica has indicated it would provide him refugee status or residency. But during the hearing Oct. 10, a Justice Department lawyer said there had not been discussions about deporting him there.",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia accused the Trump administration of gamesmanship and deliberately seeking to remove him to countries where he could raise claims of reasonable fear of persecution, with the goal of keeping him detained for longer.",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. from El Salvador in 2011 and has lived in Maryland with his wife and children. But he was arrested by immigration authorities in March and deported to his home country, despite having been granted a legal status in 2019 that prohibited the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to El Salvador because of possible persecution by local gangs.",
      "As part of a civil case Abrego Garcia and his wife brought against the Trump administration, Xinis ordered the Department of Homeland Security to facilitate his return back to the U.S. But immigration officials resisted doing so for months. Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. in June, but only after a federal grand jury in Tennessee indicted him on two charges of human smuggling stemming from a November 2022 traffic stop.",
      "Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty, and a judge in Tennessee ordered him to be released on bail ahead of a criminal trial set to begin in January. But he remained in criminal confinement for several more weeks because of concerns from his lawyers that immigration authorities would arrest him upon his release and deport him from the U.S.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from the Putnam County Jail in Tennessee in August and returned to Maryland. But days later, he was taken into custody by immigration authorities after being summoned for an interview at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Baltimore. The Trump administration notified Abrego Garcia's lawyers he could be deported to Uganda, though Abrego Garcia expressed fear of persecution and torture, as well as a concern that the Ugandan government would send him back to El Salvador.",
      "Abrego Garcia also filed a new legal challenge to his confinement and the Trump administration's efforts to deport him for a second time, which Xinis is presiding over. She has blocked immigration officials from removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S., and he has since remained in detention at a facility in Pennsylvania.",
      "At the heart of Abrego Garcia's challenge is a 2001 Supreme Court case, in which the high court said the government cannot indefinitely detain a person in the U.S. illegally if there is no significant likelihood of removal in the \"reasonably foreseeable future.\"",

      "Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's sex crimes and a group of Democratic members of Congress are asking for an independent review of the Epstein case files to determine whether any of the records have been \"tampered\" with or concealed, ahead of the release of those files by next week.",
      "In a letter Thursday to the Justice Department's inspector general, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the internal watchdog to undertake a formal review to check for any \"chain of custody\" problems with the Epstein files.",
      "Speaking with CBS News, representatives of some Epstein survivors have also asked for a third-party review to check if any record has been \"scrubbed, softened, or quietly removed before the public sees it.\"",
      "Under a federal law signed by President Trump last month, the Trump administration is required to release virtually all files on the government's investigations into Epstein by a Dec. 19 deadline, with minimal redactions.",
      "Three federal judges have also issued rulings this month to unseal grand jury records in the criminal investigations into Epstein and his convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. The rulings have opened the door for large batches of investigative materials to be publicly released by the administration for the first time.",
      "The impending releases follow months of pressure from both parties for the Trump administration to disclose more information on the government's Epstein probes. The financier pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida in the 2000s, and was charged with child sex trafficking in 2019, but died by suicide in federal custody while awaiting trial.",
      "Thursday's letter from Senate Democrats \u2014 including Sen. Adam Schiff of California \u2014 pointed to allegations that Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel ordered a massive review of Epstein-related records, \"which resulted in around 1,000 FBI personnel working 24-hour shifts and required personnel to identify any mentions of President Trump.\"",
      "\"To reassure the American public that any files released have not been tampered with or concealed, the chain of custody forms associated with records and evidence in the Epstein files must be accounted for, analyzed, and released,\" the request read.",
      "The allegation that federal workers looked for mentions of Mr. Trump was initially leveled over the summer by the Senate Judiciary Committee's vice-chair, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, who cited information his office had received. Durbin was one of the signatories of Thursday's letter. The New York Times later reported that the FBI looked for references to Mr. Trump and other high-profile people.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The inspector general's office did not comment to CBS News, and generally does not speak about its communication with Congress.",
      "Spencer Kuvin, a civil attorney who has represented a group of Epstein survivors, has also raised concerns about the trustworthiness of the records that are set to be released. Kuvin told CBS News, \"There should absolutely be concern about the chain of custody of the Epstein files.\"",
      "\"These records have passed through too many hands, behind too many closed doors, for anyone to simply assume they're intact, unaltered, or complete,\" Kuvin said. \"Survivors have endured decades of secrecy, broken promises, and institutional protection of powerful men; they should not now be asked to trust a process with no independent verification",
      "The Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats are asking for the inspector general to audit the handling of the case files and publicly release results of the audit by Jan. 19.

    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 02:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The conservative firebrand, who is retiring from Congress early, and the president are engaged in bitter falling-out.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene argued President Trump lacks self-awareness as he continues to hurl insults at the conservative firebrand who was once one of his fiercest allies in Congress.",
      "\"I actually am starting to feel very sorry for President Trump,\" the Georgia Republican told CBS News in an interview Wednesday. \"It's actually a very poor reflection on him that he chooses to speak about me that way.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has labeled Greene a \"traitor\" and a \"lunatic,\" after she split from Republican leaders to demand the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and pointed out that her party lacked a plan to address the expiring Affordable Care Act premium tax credits. She has also criticized the effects Mr. Trump's tariffs and mass deportation efforts are having on U.S. businesses.",
      "Last month, the president pulled his support from Greene and said he may back a primary challenge against his one-time ally. A week later, Greene announced she would resign from Congress, citing her falling-out with the president.",
      "The president has continued to lash out at Greene since then. On Monday, after Greene spoke to \"60 Minutes,\" Mr. Trump called her a \"dumb person\" and saying she \"sort of reminds me of a Rotten Apple.\"",
      "Greene told CBS News on Wednesday that the president's name-calling could alienate women voters.",
      "\"He always continues to speak about women like this, and that's something that women all over the country pay attention to,\" she said. \"I think the Republican Party needs to take a hard look at it, because the Republican Party has a very difficult time with women voting for them.\"",
      "\"It's unfortunate that President Trump thinks loyalty is a one-way street. It's really not,\" she added. \"I do feel sorry for him, because I think he's extremely unaware, and I don't know how he can be unaware about this, but he's not aware of how it makes him really look.\"",
      "Greene also questioned the president's apparent dismissal of Americans' concerns about the state of the economy. As lawmakers in both parties stress the need to address affordability, Mr. Trump has defended his economic policies and called Democrats' focus on the issue a \"hoax.\" Asked earlier this week to give the economy a letter grade, he responded: \"A+++++.\"",
      "\"The president needs to be aware that he's a billionaire president of the United States,\" she said. \"You can't gaslight people and tell them that their bills are affordable, and you can't tell them that the economy is in A+++. You just can't do that, and I think it's insulting to people's intelligence.\"",
      "\"I do believe at this time that Republicans will lose the midterms\"",
      "Asked if the issue of affordability could cost the GOP its majority next year, the Georgia lawmaker said she doesn't believe the party is doing enough to embrace a message of economic populism.",
      "\"I do believe at this time that Republicans will lose the midterms, and I think that's unfortunate,\" Greene said. \"I very much wanted to be part of a Republican majority in Congress that solved problems for the American people, that delivered what we promised to America.\"",
      "Greene said she did not give Speaker Mike Johnson a heads up before announcing her retirement. Her exit next month leaves the Louisiana Republican with a slimmer margin in the House.",
      "\"This was a personal decision between myself and my family, which I had their full support, so I didn't think I owed him that,\" she explained. \"He just texted me and asked me to reconsider.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Johnson told CBS News he was \"surprised\" by Greene's decision.",
      "\"It's no secret she and I've had disagreements over the last couple years, but I like Marjorie, I always have. I respect her decision, and I wish her the best,\" Johnson said.",
      "Greene,\u00a0who once threatened to oust the speaker, said she agrees with other female colleagues, including GOP Reps.\u00a0Elise Stefanik\u00a0of New York and\u00a0Nancy Mace\u00a0of South Carolina, who recently criticized Johnson's leadership.",
      "\"I think he has a broader problem with the entire conference as a whole,\" Greene explained. \"The Republicans have a problem. They're going to have a really hard time trying to go back to their districts and ask for re-election and new Republican candidates running in other House seats are going to have a very hard time asking for votes when this Congress, this Republican majority here, has produced hardly anything to give back to the people.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Wednesday he still has confidence in the speaker to hold his conference together.",
      "\"I think Mike Johnson has been a fantastic speaker,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I've had a very hard job because, you know, we have a small majority, and we got the biggest bill in the history of our country approved, the great, big beautiful bill.\"",
      "\"I'll believe it when I see it,\" Greene says on release of Epstein files",
      "Greene's rift with the president deepened over the release of the Epstein files. She was one of the early signers of a bipartisan petition to compel the Justice Department to fully disclose information about the convicted sex offender. The Epstein Files Transparency Act\u00a0passed in the House and Senate\u00a0overwhelmingly last month. It orders the Justice Department to make the files public within 30 days, by Dec. 19.",
      "\"I'll believe it when I see it, and I really hope the Trump administration does the right thing,\" she said. \"I think, if they don't release all of the information, and the women are the ones that will know, I think that will be a complete break of trust with MAGA.\"",
      "\"In my heart, I feel completely freed of this whole situation, because if President Trump called me a traitor, over standing with these women who were raped, victimized, trafficked for so many years, and this is something the government completely covered up and protected rich, powerful elites, if that's why President Trump called me a traitor, then I'm like, that's fine, you know, I'm completely okay with it,\" Greene added.",
      "But she said death threats she and her family faced went too far, and ultimately factored into her decision to step down.",
      "\"It was the direct death threats and assassination threats on my son, and that crossed my line,\" Greene said. \"It should cross anyone's line, no matter who we are, no matter what disagreements we have.\"",

      "The U.S. seized a 20-year-old oil tanker called The Skipper off the coast of Venezuela on Wednesday, three sources familiar with the matter told CBS News, after months of heightened tensions between the Trump administration and Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "The seizure was initially announced by President Trump during an unrelated White House event on Wednesday. Here's what we know about the boat and the operation:",
      "Seizure involved special operations forces and 2 helicopters",
      "The operation to seize the tanker began Wednesday morning, after the boat had just left port in Venezuela, according to a senior military official and a source familiar with the operation.",
      "The mission was launched from the USS Gerald R. Ford, an aircraft carrier that has been in the area for weeks as part of a broader buildup of U.S. forces in the region, the sources told CBS News.",
      "It involved two helicopters, special operations forces, 10 members of the U.S. Coast Guard and 10 Marines, the sources said. The boarding team was composed of the Coast Guard's Maritime Security and Response Team, an elite maritime interdiction unit based in Chesapeake, Virginia.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi posted a 45-second video of the operation on X, showing armed personnel descending onto the vessel's deck from a helicopter. She said the U.S. executed a seizure warrant on the vessel, and that the tanker was \"used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran.\"",
      "While the U.S. government \u2014 particularly the Justice Department and Homeland Security Investigations \u2014 has seized sanctioned oil tankers before, conducting a fast-rope boarding from helicopters at sea is rare, though it's something the boarding team trains for, U.S. officials said.",
      "The operation was led by the Coast Guard, supported by Navy forces, the officials told CBS News. Any such operation would legally require the Coast Guard to be the lead agency because the authorities used for these seizures fall under Coast Guard jurisdiction.",
      "Tanker was sanctioned by Treasury 3 years ago",
      "The Skipper was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2022 for its alleged role in an oil smuggling network that helped fund the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group backed by Iran.",
      "The ship \u2014 known as Adisa in 2022 \u2014 is among the vessels controlled by sanctioned Russian oil magnate Viktor Artemov, the Treasury said in a statement. At the time, the Treasury said Artemov transported Iranian oil using an expansive network of ships that were often registered in obscure ways with the intention of skirting U.S. restrictions on Iranian petroleum exports.",
      "The Treasury's 2022 sanctions announcement didn't mention Venezuela. But oil networks involving both Iran and Venezuela have been reported for years, drawing pushback from the United States. The two countries are major petroleum producers with some of the world's largest oil reserves, but trade is restricted by heavy U.S. sanctions.",
      "The tanker is controlled by Nigeria-based management company Thomarose Global Ventures LTD and owned by a firm linked to Artemov, according to publicly available data.",
      "The ship is 20 years old, initially sailing under the name The Toyo in 2005. At 333 meters (about 1,092 feet) in length, it was one of the largest tankers in the world at the time it was built.",
      "The government of Guyana \u2014 which borders Venezuela \u2014 said in a statement Wednesday the ship was falsely flying the Guyanese flag, despite not being registered in the South American country",
      "Bondi said the boat was sanctioned \"due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 20:49:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The push to redistrict in Indiana has a crucial vote in the state's Senate on Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "Indiana's state Senate will decide on Thursday whether or not they'll pass a new congressional map that will make all nine of the state's U.S. House districts lean toward Republicans.",
      "This possibility of adding two GOP-friendly seats in Indiana has been a political priority of the Trump administration, as Democrat-run and Republican-run states have been trading blows in a nationwide redistricting arms race ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "But the contentious debate also spawned bomb threats and swatting incidents against Indiana lawmakers, as enough Indiana Republican state lawmakers are opposed to a new map to put its passage in jeopardy.",
      "Republicans already represent seven of Indiana's nine Congressional districts, while Democrats represent two districts, one near southwest Chicago and one that encompasses Indianapolis. The proposed map drastically breaks apart the Indianapolis-based district of Democratic Rep. Andr\u00e9 Carson to dilute the city's Democratic-leaning electorate.",
      "The map passed in the Indiana state House with a 57-41 vote earlier this month, but Indiana Senate president Rodric Bray has previously insisted the votes needed to pass the map are not there.",
      "At least 25 of the state's 50 senators would have to vote yes for the map to pass, with Republican Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith being the tiebreaker vote. There are 40 Republican senators in the chamber, while\u00a0 at least 12 state senators have come out publicly against the map with several keeping their stance private, according to the IndyStar.",
      "\"It's a toss up,\" said GOP operative Marty Obst, chair of the \"Fair Maps Indiana\" nonprofit pushing for a middecade redraw. He said there's about ten state Republican senators who are still undecided, in part because they want to hear more from constituents and during this week's debate on the senate floor.",
      "\"We'll obviously need a few of those to get to 25,\" he said. \"It should be an interesting day on Thursday. It's truly up in the air.\"",
      "Lawmakers against the map have shared doubts that Republicans can even win all nine seats in the new proposed map, have cited pushback from constituents about a new map, and cited the unusual nature of redrawing Congressional lines in the middle of the decade, not after the 2020 Census like Indiana and the rest of the country did in 2021.",
      "\"What's taking people by surprise is the novelty of politicians who prioritize fidelity to principle, over flirtations with politics. It's so old it's new again,\" said Indiana GOP operative Pete Seat.",
      "State Republicans in favor of the map have argued Indiana shouldn't be on the sidelines on gerrymandering, and pointed to states gerrymandered by Democrats such as California or nearby Illinois.",
      "\"We've consistently seen the Democrats use that process to increase and rule their influence in Washington D.C .... what the administration is challenging Republicans with is that we have to push back,\" state Republican Sen. Andy Zay told CBS affiliate WANE\u00a0in Fort Wayne, Indiana.",
      "Three Republican senators on the Indiana Senate elections committee who voted to advance the map on Monday said they reserve the right to still vote no on Thursday.",
      "Throughout the year, the White House has flexed its political muscle to push for redistricting in Indiana.",
      "President Trump lashed out at Republican holdouts in the Indiana Senate in a Truth Social post Wednesday, and called Bray \"either a bad guy, or a very stupid one.\"",
      "\"Anybody that votes against Redistricting, and the SUCCESS of the Republican Party in D.C., will be, I am sure, met with a MAGA primary in the Spring,\" the president wrote. \"Rod Bray and his friends won't be in Politics for long, and I will do everything within my power to make sure that they will not hurt the Republican Party, and our Country, again.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance has met with Indiana GOP lawmakers several times this year in Indianapolis and in Washington D.C. to push for a mid-decade redraw. Mr. Trump met with Indiana House and Senate leaders in the Oval Office in August and has called state lawmakers about redistricting.",
      "\"I will be strongly endorsing against any State Senator or House member from the Great State of Indiana that votes against the Republican Party, and our Nation, by not allowing for Redistricting,\" Trump wrote in a November Truth Social post.",
      "That pressure campaign from outside actors was already in effect going into the votes. Obst's nonprofit, Indiana Fair Maps, has already spent over $250,000 on advertisements encouraging lawmakers to pass the map. On Monday, a super PAC affiliated with his nonprofit announced they will spend up to seven-figures in the 2026 primary elections to support members in favor of redistricting, as well as recruit and financially back challengers against lawmakers who are against it. Obst says this effort will happen regardless of whether or not the map passes.",
      "Turning Point USA, the conservative organization founded by the late Charlie Kirk, held a rally in Indiana's statehouse earlier this month where Indiana Gov. Mike Braun spoke in favor of the new map. Several Turning Point USA officials, including Trump adviser Alex Bruesewitz, have also been calling out lawmakers against redistricting in the last two months on social media.",
      "But as more attention has been paid to redistricting in Indiana, several state Republican lawmakers as well as Braun, have gotten bomb threats and swatting incidents. Republican state Sen. Jean Leising, who is against a new Congressional map in Indiana, was the target of a pipe bomb threat. She called it a \"result of the D.C. political pundits for redistricting.\"",
      "\"I fear for this institution. I fear for the state of Indiana, I fear for all states if we allow intimidation and threats to be the norm,\" said Republican state Sen. Greg Walker, the only member of the state Senate's election committee who voted against moving the new map forward.",
      "Obst called the threats \"uncalled for\" and that he doesn't support any of the threats to lawmakers. \"I've been in Indiana politics for 20 years... we're trying to have a debate and get redistricting done. But this is uncalled for,\" he said.",
      "Indiana's middecade redistricting push comes after other efforts have taken place nationwide, starting this summer in Texas, where Republicans in the state legislature redrew their congressional map at the request of Mr. Trump to net up to five seats for their party. California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom then spearheaded a ballot measure that passed with more than 60% of the vote to redraw their map to gain up to five seats for Democrats. Missouri's legislature then redrew their map to try to shift one more seat toward Republicans, and North Carolina undertook a similar effort to edge out a Democrat in its 1st Congressional District. Other Democrat-run states like Maryland and Illinois are also considering a redraw to add more Democratic seats.",

    "summary": "President Trump said the U.S. has seized an oil tanker, which Attorney General Pam Bondi said has been \"used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. has seized a large oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, officials said Wednesday, escalating tensions between the two countries. President Trump said he assumes the U.S. will keep the oil.",
      "Bloomberg first reported the oil tanker seizure. Mr. Trump announced the seizure during a roundtable meeting at the White House, saying the tanker was \"seized for a very good reason.\"",
      "\"As you probably know, we've just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela, a large tanker, very large,\" he said. \"Largest one ever seized, actually. And other things are happening, so you'll be seeing that later and you'll be talking about that later with some other people.\"",
      "When asked by a reporter what will happen to the oil on the ship, Mr. Trump responded, \"Well we keep it, I guess,\" adding, \"I assume we're going to keep the oil.\"",
      "The president didn't provide further details.",
      "Venezuela's government said in a statement that it \"strongly denounces and repudiates what constitutes a shameless robbery and an act of international piracy.\"",
      "\"In these circumstances, the real reasons for the prolonged aggression against Venezuela have finally been exposed. It's not migration. It's not drug trafficking. It's not democracy. It's not human rights. It was always about our natural wealth, our oil, our energy, the resources that belong exclusively to the Venezuelan people,\" the Venezuelan government said.",
      "The tanker is called The Skipper, according to three sources familiar with the seizure. The operation to seize it started at about 6 a.m. Wednesday and involved two helicopters, 10 Coast Guard members, 10 Marines and special operation forces, according to a senior military official and a source familiar with the operation. The Skipper had just left port in Venezuela when it was seized, they said.",
      "The helicopters used in the tanker seizure launched from the USS Gerald Ford and the boarding team was comprised of the Coast Guard's Maritime Security and Response Team, an elite maritime-interdiction unit based on the East Coast in Chesapeake, Virginia, according to a senior military official and a source familiar with the operation.",
      "The USS Gerald Ford, the most advanced aircraft carrier in the U.S.'s fleet, arrived in the Caribbean last month amid a larger military buildup in the region.",
      "The Skipper was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2022 for alleged ties to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah. At the time, it sailed under the name Adisa. The 20-year-old tanker previously sailed under the name The Toyo in 2005, according to public maritime data.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi shared video of the seizure on social media, writing that the tanker was \"used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran\" and had been seized by the FBI, Homeland Security Investigations and the U.S. Coast Guard, \"with support from the Department of War.\"",
      "\"For multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations,\" Bondi wrote.",
      "Today, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Homeland Security Investigations, and the United States Coast Guard, with support from the Department of War, executed a seizure warrant for a crude oil tanker used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran. For multiple\u2026 pic.twitter.com/dNr0oAGl5x",
      "The operation was led by the United States Coast Guard, supported by Navy forces, according to U.S. officials. Any such operation would legally require the Coast Guard to be the lead agency, because the authorities used for these seizures fall under Coast Guard jurisdiction.",
      "While the U.S. government \u2014 particularly the Justice Department and Homeland Security Investigations \u2014 has seized sanctioned oil tankers before, conducting a fast-rope boarding from helicopters at sea is rare, though it is something the boarding teams train for.",
      "The Trump administration is considering more missions similar to Wednesday's seizure, according to the senior military official and a source familiar with the operation.",
      "Mr. Trump has been threatening to expand the United States' monthslong campaign of strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans onto land in Venezuela. The U.S. has been steadily building up its military forces in the area, and deployed two fighter jets to fly over the Gulf of Venezuela just this week.",
      "\"We're going to start doing those strikes on land, too,\" Mr. Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting last week, when asked about the administration's strikes at sea. \"You know, the land is much easier ... And we know the routes they take. We know everything about them. We know where they live. We know where the bad ones live. And we're going to start that very soon, too.\"",

    "summary": "Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania introduced a discharge petition to try to bring a bill to the floor that would extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies by two years.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican moderates in the House revolted against leadership on Wednesday as they seek to force a vote on expiring health insurance premium tax credits \u2014 an issue that could have major political ramifications for the party in next year's elections.",
      "Facing an end-of-year deadline, Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania introduced a discharge petition to try to bring a bill to the floor that would extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies by two years. A handful of GOP moderates quickly signed on.",
      "The move is the latest rebellion by rank-and-file Republicans to force votes on issues that leadership would rather avoid.",
      "The underlying proposal, spearheaded by Fitzpatrick, would extend the tax credits through 2027 and impose a cap on income for those who are eligible for the subsidies. The plan would also expand access to health savings accounts, while imposing a small monthly premium on the lowest-income beneficiaries to fight fraudulent enrollments.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters after Fitzpatrick filed the discharge petition that an extension does not have the support of the majority of the conference. An informal rule in the House, known as the Hastert rule, dictates that the speaker should only bring up legislation if it has the support of the majority of the party in power.",
      "\"I understand the concerns that they have. I'm very sympathetic to that. We have spent many, many hours trying to find a way out of the conundrum that we're in, with regard to those extensions,\" Johnson said. \"We just can't get Republican votes on that for lots of reasons, not enough of them.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick said last week that the plan was the \"best product we can put together\" and had feedback from the House, Senate and White House. A discharge petition, he said, was a last-ditch option.",
      "The procedural tactic requires 218 signatures to force a vote, and it's unclear if it can reach that threshold. It would need the support of most Democrats, who have been pushing a three-year extension without any reforms.",
      "Later Wednesday, Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey filed a competing discharge petition to try to force a vote on a separate bipartisan proposal that includes a one-year extension of the tax credits with income limits, followed by a second year with \"more significant reforms,\" including eliminating $0 premiums, with need-based exceptions.",
      "House GOP leaders vowed to unveil a path forward next week. But they've made few details public about what their plan entails, other than holding votes on bills that they say will lower premiums for \"100% of Americans.\" They will have just days to build consensus before Dec. 18, their last scheduled day in session for the year.",

Jeffries, a New York Democrat, has said a three-year extension is the path forward that would attract \"the greatest number of votes\" in both the House and Senate.",

      "Republicans in both chambers have said that a three-year extension is off the table, stressing the need for reforms to tamp down on fraud and impose income limits for beneficiaries. They've also dismissed a shorter extension without any reforms.",

Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat, and Jen Kiggans, a Virginia Republican, includes a one-year extension of the tax credits with income limits, followed by a second year with \"more significant reforms,\" including eliminating $0 premiums, with need-based exceptions.

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration announced plans Wednesday to add another militarized zone to the southern border \u2014 this time in California \u2014 as part of a major shift that has thrust troops into border enforcement with Mexico like never before.",
      "The Department of Interior said it would transfer jurisdiction along most of California's border with Mexico to the Navy to reinforce \"the historic role public lands have played in safeguarding national sovereignty.\"",
      "The Interior Department described the newest national defense area in California as a high-traffic zone for unlawful crossings by immigrants. But Border Patrol arrests along the southern U.S. border this year have dropped to the slowest pace since the 1960s amid President Trump's push for mass deportations.",
      "The move places long stretches of the border under the supervision of nearby military bases, empowering U.S. troops to detain people who enter the country illegally and sidestep a law prohibiting military involvement in civilian law enforcement. It is done under the authority of the national emergency on the border declared by Mr. Trump on his first day in office.",
      "The military strategy was pioneered in April along a 170-mile stretch of the border in New Mexico and later expanded to portions of the border in Texas and Arizona.",
      "The newly designated militarized zone extends nearly from the Arizona state line to the Otay Mountain Wilderness, traversing the Imperial Valley and border communities including the unincorporated community of Tecate, California, across the border from the Mexican city with the same name.",
      "More than 7,000 troops have been deployed to the border, along with an assortment of helicopters, drones and surveillance equipment.",
      "The zones allow U.S. troops to apprehend immigrants and others who are accused of trespassing on Army, Air Force or Navy bases. Those apprehended also could face additional criminal charges that can mean prison time.",

    "story": [
      "Miami Mayor-elect Eileen Higgins believes the key to her election victory Tuesday \u2014 the first for a Democrat in almost 30 years \u2014 was her outreach to people of all political persuasions.",
      "In an interview on CBS News just after the election, CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett asked her about the \"Trump effect;\" President Trump had endorsed her Republican opponent, drawing attention to the race.",
      "\"I don't know,\" Higgins responded. \"What I know is what I did. I worked. I knocked on doors and called Republicans, independents and Democrats all across the city of Miami \u2014 because you cannot become the mayor of this city if only Democrats vote for you. You can't become the mayor of this city if only Republicans vote for you. You've got to have all three.\"",
      "Higgins, who is also the first woman elected to be Miami mayor, won 59% of the vote Tuesday. She also pointed out that she has served for eight years on the county commission in the city, where she represents a Republican-leaning district.",
      "A former Miami-Dade County commissioner, Higgins defeated Republican candidate Emilio Gonz\u00e1lez, a former city manager who had been endorsed by both President Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, in a runoff election. The mayoral race is officially nonpartisan, but it grew more politicized because of the Trump administration's immigration policies and Mr. Trump's endorsement of her opponent.",
      "She said that her political party won't matter as she takes on the responsibilities of the office.",
      "\"The folks of the city of Miami know that I am a loud, proud Democrat,\" she continued. \"But when I get elected, the election's over, and the time of service begins, and you serve everybody. Never, ever ask their political affiliation. If their street is flooded, if they need an affordable unit to live in, you don't ask what party they're from. You say, 'Yep, we've got to figure out how to make that happen for you.'\"",
      "Though Democrats nationwide were encouraged by the outcome of the Miami race and the elections in November, Garrett asked Higgins whether there's a risk that national politicos were reading too much into the results.",
      "\"I think it's always important to look at the place, right?\" she said. \"I think we saw that in the elections in November and then here, what the folks in New Jersey and Virginia and New York chose, they chose the person they thought would be right for them. And that's the same thing that happened here in Miami.\"",
      "Higgins focused on\u00a0critical local issues, including immigration, housing affordability, flooding and city growth.

    "summary": "The legislation sets lawmakers' defense priorities and authorizes spending levels for the Defense Department and national security programs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Wednesday approved a $900 billion defense policy bill as both chambers race to pass it before the end of the year.",
      "The legislation \u2014 which sets lawmakers' defense priorities and authorizes spending levels for the Defense Department and national security programs \u2014 cleared the lower chamber in a bipartisan vote with 312 voting in favor and 112 in opposition.",
      "The final hours before passage were not without some drama as House Speaker Mike Johnson struggled to maintain control of his fractious majority.",
      "A five-minute procedural vote stretched into an hour as a handful of conservatives voted against advancing the measure and a few moderate Republicans withheld their votes, setting up the bill for potential failure. The holdouts ultimately came around to help it advance, with conservatives saying they secured assurances on their priorities.",
      "Lawmakers on Sunday evening unveiled the 3,086-page compromise bill, which authorizes $291 billion for operations and maintenance; $234 billion for military personnel and health care; $162 billion for procurement; and $146 billion for research and development, according to a GOP summary of the legislation. It also authorizes $54 billion for military construction and nuclear programs.",
      "The lead-up to its unveiling was also marred by GOP infighting as Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York criticized Johnson, accusing the Louisiana Republican of blocking a provision that would require the FBI to notify Congress when it opens counterintelligence investigations into candidates running for federal office. The provision was ultimately included after the public spat.",
      "Johnson also received criticism from Democrats after a provision that would have expanded IVF coverage for military families was stripped from the measure.",
      "The legislation aims to codify more than a dozen of President Trump's executive orders, including authorizing the use of active-duty troops along the U.S.-Mexico border, deploying a \"Golden Dome\" to protect against missile and other advanced aerial attacks and prohibiting diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the Defense Department.",
      "Under the bill, all service members would receive a 3.8% pay raise.",
      "The bill also includes language that prohibits transgender women from participating in women's athletic programs or activities at military service academies \u2014 an issue Republicans have leaned into heavily in recent years.",
      "Some conservatives have pushed back on the inclusion of aid for Ukraine. The bill includes $400 million for military assistance to Ukraine in both fiscal years 2026 and 2027.",
      "Also tucked into the bill is a provision that would withhold part of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's travel budget until the Pentagon hands over footage of the strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats near Venezuela. It would withhold a quarter of Hegseth's office's travel funds until the House and Senate Armed Services committees receive \"unedited video of strikes conducted against designated terrorist organizations in the area of responsibility of the United States Southern Command.\"",
      "The provision also requires the Pentagon to submit overdue reports, including on lessons learned from the Ukraine war, before the funds are released.",
      "\"That was a bipartisan shot across the bow to Donald Trump to hand over the tapes, done by Republicans. I salute them for their courage for bucking Trump and bucking Hegseth,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Tuesday on the Senate floor.",
      "The legislation would also repeal the legal justifications used to attack Iraq in 1991 and 2003. Congress adopted the 2002 authorization ahead of the March 2003 invasion of Iraq that led to the toppling of Saddam Hussein's regime. The 1991 authorization was approved during the Gulf War.",
      "Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have long questioned leaving the authorizations in place, arguing it allows presidents to abuse their power. In statements praising the inclusion of the repeals, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana said it was time to \"close the book\" on the wars.",
      "The bill also repeals sanctions on Syria under the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019. And it includes provisions that limit the administration's ability to reduce troop levels in Europe.",

    "summary": "Rep. Jasmine Crockett filed paperwork to run for U.S. Senate just hours before the state's deadline \u2014 and hours after fellow Democrat Colin Allred dropped out.",
    "story": [
      "Rep. Jasmine Crockett on Monday filed paperwork to run for Democratic primary for U.S. Senate in Texas, a source tells CBS News Texas, hours ahead of a planned news conference where she announced her plans.",
      "\"I'm done with going along to get along, and it gets us nowhere,\" Crockett said during her announcement Monday. \"I'm done watching rural hospitals and public schools close their doors. I'm done watching parents be afraid to send their kids to school or the mall or the movies because Republicans have flooded our streets with guns. I'm done with the Senators sitting around doing nothing, while Trump takes your hard-earned money, skims your Social Security, slashes Medicare, and gives tax breaks to billionaires. I'm done. I'm done watching the American dream on life support while Trump tries to pull the plug. The gloves have been off, and now I'm jumping into the ring. I'm asking for your support to be the next United States Senator from the great state of Texas.\"",
      "In the Democratic primary, Crockett will face state Rep. James Talarico of Austin, whose campaign has generated national headlines and who raised a record $6.2 million in the first three weeks of his campaign announcement.",
      "After Crockett filed her paperwork, Talarico issued a statement saying, \"We're building a movement in Texas \u2014 fueled by record-breaking grassroots fundraising and 10,000 volunteers who are putting in the work to defeat the billionaire mega-donors and puppet politicians who have taken over our state. Our movement is rooted in unity over division \u2014 so we welcome Congresswoman Crockett into this race.\"",
      "Republican incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt are also locked in a closely-watched battle for the GOP nomination. The final general election matchup is expected to be one of the most expensive races in the 2026 national cycle.",
      "Paxton's campaign issued a statement Monday bashing the Dallas Democrat as \"Crazy Crockett,\" but mostly alleging Cornyn has sunken tens of millions of dollars in the race even though \"he's in third place in the primary.\"",
      "Crockett's entry into the race comes after another Democratic Senate candidate, former Rep. Colin Allred of Dallas, dropped out of the race earlier Monday. Instead of filing his paperwork to run in the Senate race, he opted to file to run for the newly-drawn 33rd Congressional District in Dallas County.",
      "The Supreme Court ruled last week that the newly-redrawn congressional map could be used in the 2026 election, which included redrawing three Dallas-area districts that are represented by Democrats.",
      "In a statement earlier Monday, Allred said, \"In the past few days, I've come to believe that a bruising Senate Democratic primary and runoff would prevent the Democratic Party from going into this critical election unified against the danger posed to our communities and our Constitution by Donald Trump and one of his Republican bootlickers Paxton, Cornyn, or Hunt. That's why I've made the difficult decision to end my campaign for the U.S. Senate. But I'm nowhere near done serving my community and our state. Today, I'm announcing my campaign for Congress to represent the newly drawn Congressional District 33.\"",
      "Before the announcement, some Democrats had expressed disappointment that there could be three major candidates for the U.S. Senate race, instead of spreading out among the other statewide races such as governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general.",
      "In an interview last month, Crockett told CBS News Texas that she would only for U.S. Senate if polling showed she could win a general election, not just the Democratic primary. In the interview, she said she would share her internal polling with Talarico and Allred. \"I'm going to open it up to them because this isn't about me ... It would be really, really, really hard for me now knowing that my district is still at least in its current configuration and knowing that my district absolutely wants me to continue to represent them wholly; it would be really, really hard. But at the end of the day, if the numbers are strong that I am our best shot, then it's bigger than my district. It's bigger than the state of Texas. This is about the country because we know if we can change the Senate map in this country, then that's where we start to get wins.\"",
      "During the interview, the Crockett said she polling for the March 3 primary but instead focusing on the general election next November. Various Democrats have said they believe Paxton will win the Republican primary and because of his political baggage, they think the party has a chance to win a statewide seat for the first time in more than 30 years.",
      "Crockett said for her to win, she could not count on Republicans crossing over to support her. \"When we ended up with the Trump phenomena or even when we ended up with the Obama phenomenon, they were able to both bring out people that historically did not vote. I think that's the only way that we win in Texas is if we have a candidate that can add to the electorate. If the electorate remains the same electorate that we've had over the last 30 years, then I think we're going to end up with the same result,\" she said.",
      "CBS News reported last week that Crockett confirmed she spoke with both Talarico and Allred about the Senate race.",
      "Crockett has made national headlines by clashing with President Trump. When asked if she will energize Republicans in addition to Democrats, Matt Angle, Director of the Lone Star Project, a Democratic PAC, told CBS News Texas, \"She could. I think that that's the real challenge is for her to be able to increase turnout for not just her race, but for other Democrats without motivating Republicans. I've been doing politics in Texas a long time. Republicans don't have much to brag about at any level. I'm not sure that being upset with one or two Democrats is going to overcome the fact that they're profoundly disappointed with Republican leadership that's failing them.\"",
      "Vinny Minchillo, a Republican consultant in North Texas, told CBS News Texas that he agrees with those who believe Crockett cannot win a general election statewide. \"I think she's a real polarizing candidate. She's fun to watch in which she goes crazy on the news. It's always interesting to watch. But I just don't think that's going to work in a general election. I think she is too extreme and too far left for even Texas Democrats,\" Minchillo said. \"I think she'll help turn out Republicans because Republicans are not going to be comfortable with that.\"",
      "Minchillo said he believes the Republican primary is headed for a runoff but doesn't know for sure which two candidates will make advance.",
      "\"We got a long way to go. This has already been a nasty race to begin with. Cornyn came out of the gate saying that he was going to take Paxton to the woodshed and put in words stronger than that. This has been pretty nasty. Cornyn has spent the summer pounding on Paxton. He's moved numbers in his favor. Now, we're seeing a little bit of back and forth. So, this is going to be really rough. The Cornyn folks have actually opened a second front. They're starting to beat on Wesley Hunt. So that's going to be tough. I don't see a path to be honest for Hunt. I just don't think he can beat either Cornyn or Paxton. Maybe a better chance to beat Cornyn, but I just don't think he can get there unless he's got a lot of money,\" Minchillo said",
      "Minchillo predicts that between all of the candidates and their campaigns, plus the third-party groups that support them for both the primary, primary runoff, and general election, tat the Senate race could cost at least $750 million.",
      "With Crockett's decision to run for the Senate, she will leave behind the 30th Congressional District she has represented since 2023. As CBS News Texas reported last week, Democratic Rep. Marc Veasey of Fort Worth, will file to run in the newly drawn 30th District, which mostly includes parts of Dallas County and a portion of eastern Tarrant County. Veasey has represented the current 33rd Congressional District, which stretches from his hometown of Fort Worth to Dallas, since 2013.",
      "Frederick Haynes, III, senior pastor at the Friendship West Baptist Church in Dallas, has also explored running for the 30th Congressional District and confirmed he was aware of an effort to draft him to run.",
      "The newly drawn 33rd Congressional District is now entirely within Dallas County and a majority Latino district. Allred will face Democratic Rep.Julie Johnson of Farmers Branch, who succeeded Allred in the 32nd Congressional District after he ran for U.S. Senate last year against Republican Senator Ted Cruz.",
      "The newly drawn 32nd Congressional District moves from a Democratic majority to a Republican majority. Republican candidates include Ryan Binkley, Darrell Day, Aimee Carrasco, Monty Montanez and Paul Bondar.",
      "Longtime Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California briefly considered running in this North Texas district but changed his mind after meeting with Mr. Trump. He will run for reelection in his San Diego-area district, which was redrawn by Democrats in California to neutralize Texas' redistricting. State Rep. Katrina Pierson, R-Rockwall, also considered running for this seat, but has announced she is running for re-election in her Texas House district.",

    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 15:59:17 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve is grappling with economic issues including higher inflation and a slowing labor market.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, bringing the federal funds rate to its lowest level in more than three years.",
      "The reduction lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.5% and 3.75%, down from its prior range of 3.75% to 4%. The Fed's decision marks the third consecutive rate cut since September, lowering the federal funds rate by a total of 0.75 percentage points this year.",
      "Despite the lack of key government economic data because of the recent U.S.\u00a0government shutdown, the Fed has been closely monitoring the slowdown in monthly job growth as well as rising inflation. Figures from ADP, which tracks private payrolls, showed that employers shed 32,000 jobs in November, a signal of continuing headwinds in the labor market.",
      "Fed hints at one rate cut in 2026",
      "But in announcing the decision, the Federal Reserve signaled that it may want to see more economic evidence to support additional rate cuts in 2026. In quarterly economic projections issued along with their latest statement, Fed officials signaled they expect to lower rates just once next year.",
      "\"In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, said in its statement.",
      "Speaking about the decision in a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is \"well positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves\" before deciding on another cut.",
      "\"We're going to get a great deal of data between now and the January meeting \u2014 the data we get will factor into our thinking,\" Powell said, referring to the delayed November inflation and job reports that will be issued later this month. \"We're well-positioned to wait and see.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve also issued new U.S. inflation, economic growth and unemployment projections for 2026, forecasting that inflation will cool slightly next year while unemployment will remain unchanged from its current level of 4.4%.",
      "Fed officials forecast that Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Fed's favored inflation gauge, will cool to 2.4% next year, down from its median estimate of 2.9% in 2025. The nation's gross domestic product could pick up to 2.3% in 2026, an acceleration from the Fed's September forecast of 1.8%.",
      "Ryan Sweet, chief global economist at Oxford Economics, said the latest Fed guidance sets it up for what he described in a note to investors as an \"extended pause\" in cutting rates.",
      "\"The Fed isn't going to be able to help the labor market because of what ails it,\" he added. \"Rate cuts are unlikely to significantly boost the hiring rate, which is being depressed by overhiring, solid productivity growth, policy uncertainty, a rise in people with multiple jobs and less immigration. Monetary policy can't solve many of these issues.\"",
      "The move lowers the federal funds rate to its lowest level since early November 2022, when policymakers lifted the range to 3.75% to 4%. At that time, the central bank was boosting rates \u2014 its most potent tool for curbing inflation \u2014 as inflation surged during the pandemic.",
      "By cutting rates, the Fed is acting to spur hiring by making credit cheaper, allowing businesses to expand and hire at a lower cost. Consumers, meanwhile, tend to spend more when financing is less expensive, giving the broader economy an extra lift.",
      "FOMC dissents",
      "Not all members of the FOMC, the Fed's rate-setting panel, agreed with the move to cut by a quarter point. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell was joined by eight other committee members in voting in favor of the reduction, three members dissented, the Fed said. That represents the most dissents in six years and is a sign of divisions on a committee that traditionally works by consensus.",
      "FOMC members Austan Goolsbee and Jeffrey Schmid voted to maintain the previous range, while Stephen Miran voted in favor of a 0.5 percentage-point cut.",
      "At the same time, the Fed is moving toward a leadership shift next year, with Powell set to end his term as chair in May 2026 and President Trump preparing to nominate his replacement.",
      "\"[T]he outlook from the Powell-led FOMC bears less than usual on future Fed policy decisions given the imminent change in leadership,\" Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, said in an email.",
      "Asked what his goals are during the last months of his term as chair, Powell said he's focused on the U.S. economy.",
      "\"I want to turn over this job to whoever replaces me with the economy in really good shape,\" he said. \"All my efforts are to get to that place.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is proposing to ask visitors from countries with visa-free travel to the U.S. to submit five years of their social media history before they can enter.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is proposing to ask visitors from several dozen nations that enjoy visa-free travel to the U.S. to submit additional personal information before entering the country, including five years of their social media history, the Department of Homeland Security said in a notice this week.",
      "Citizens of 42 countries enrolled in the visa waiver program can generally come to the U.S. for up to 90 days for tourism or business travel, without needing to apply for a visa at an American embassy or consulate, a process that can take months or even years.",
      "The list of countries in the visa waiver program includes many European nations like the United Kingdom, Germany and France, as well as some U.S. allies around the world, including Australia, Israel, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.",
      "While citizens of these nations typically don't need visas to travel to the U.S., they still have to submit an application online using a process known as the Electronic System for Travel Authorization, or ESTA, before entering the country. That system is designed to ensure applicants are eligible for visa-free travel to the U.S., and that they don't pose security concerns.",
      "The Trump administration is proposing to overhaul the ESTA system, mainly to transform it into a mobile-only process. The plan would require applicants to share additional information about themselves and their relatives, according to a notice posted in the federal government's journal of regulations by Customs and Border Protection, a branch of DHS.",
      "The notice said CBP plans to ask visa waiver travelers to share their social media history for the past five years, emails they have used for the past 10 years and the personal information of immediate family members, including phone numbers and residences. The submission of social media history from the last five years will be a mandatory requirement under the proposal, according to the notice.",
      "CBP said the changes, which still have to be reviewed by the White House's budget office, are designed to enforce an executive order President Trump issued earlier this year with the stated objective of denying entry to foreigners who may pose a threat to national security or public safety.",
      "But critics of the proposed changes said they could scare prospective travelers and negatively impact tourism, especially months before the U.S. hosts the 2026 FIFA World Cup, alongside Canada and Mexico, next summer.",
      "Over the past year, the Trump administration has mounted an aggressive effort to increase vetting and screening procedures across the U.S. immigration system.",
      "While the State Department has moved to scrutinize visa applicants overseas more heavily, some of the changes affect people already in the U.S. who are applying to stay in the country legally through applications for asylum, green cards or American citizenship.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has instructed officials to investigate the social media history of several classes of immigrants, including for views and activities deemed to be \"anti-American.\" It has also directed adjudicators to more intensely probe the \"good moral character\" of legal immigrants requesting U.S. citizenship.",

    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 11:22:15 -0500",
    "summary": "Dozens of health care organizations have asked the Trump administration to shield the doctors, nurses, and techs they need to fill shortages from a $100,000 visa fee for skilled foreign workers.",
    "story": [
      "Bekki Holzkamm has been trying to hire a lab technician at a hospital in rural North Dakota since late summer.",
      "Not one U.S. citizen has applied.",
      "West River Health Services in Hettinger, a town of about 1,000 residents in the southwestern part of the state, has four options, and none is good.",
      "The hospital could fork over $100,000 for the Trump administration's new H-1B visa fee and hire one of the more than 30 applicants from the Philippines or Nigeria. The fee is the equivalent of what some rural hospitals would pay two lab techs in a year, said Holzkamm, who is West River's lab manager.",
      "West River could ask the Department of Homeland Security to waive the fee. But it's unclear how long the waiver process would take and if the government would grant one. The hospital could continue trying to recruit someone inside the U.S. for the job. Or, Holzkamm said, it could leave the position unfilled, adding to the workload of the current \"skeleton crew.\"",
      "The U.S. health care system depends on foreign-born professionals to fill its ranks of doctors, nurses, technicians, and other health providers, particularly in chronically understaffed facilities in rural America.",
      "But a new presidential proclamation aimed at the tech industry's use of H-1B visas is making it harder for West River and other rural providers to hire those staffers.",
      "\"The health care industry wasn't even considered. They're going to be collateral damage, and to such an extreme degree that it was clearly not thought about at all,\" said Eram Alam, a Harvard associate professor whose new book examines the history of foreign doctors in the U.S.",
      "Elissa Taub, a Memphis, Tennessee-based attorney who assists hospitals with the H-1B application process, has been hearing concerns from her clients.",
      "\"It's not like there's a surplus of American physicians or nurses waiting in the wings to fill in those positions,\" she said.",
      "Until recently, West River and other employers paid up to $5,000 each time they applied to sponsor an H-1B worker. The visas are reserved for highly skilled foreign workers.",
      "The new $100,000 fee \u2014 part of a\u00a0September proclamation\u00a0by President Trump \u2014 applies to workers living outside the U.S. but not those who were already in the U.S. on a visa.",
      "West River lab tech Kathrine Abelita is one of nine employees \u2014 six technicians and three nurses \u2014 at the hospital who are current or former H-1B visa holders. Abelita is from the Philippines and has worked at West River since 2018. She's now a permanent U.S. resident.",
      "\"It's going to be a big problem for rural health care,\" she said of the new fee. She said most younger American workers want to live in urban areas.",
      "Sixteen percent of registered nurses, 14% of physician assistants, and 14% of nurse practitioners and midwives who work in U.S. hospitals are immigrants, according to a\u00a02023 government survey. Nearly a quarter of physicians in the U.S. went to medical school outside the U.S. or Canada, according to\u00a02024 licensing data.",
      "The\u00a0American Hospital Association, two\u00a0national rural health organizations, and\u00a0more than 50 medical societies\u00a0have asked the administration to give the health care industry exemptions from the new fee. The new cost will disproportionally harm rural communities that already struggle to afford and recruit enough providers, the groups argue.",
      "\"A blanket exception for healthcare providers is the simplest path forward,\" the National Rural Health Association and National Association of Rural Health Clinics wrote in a joint letter.",
      "The proclamation allows fee exemptions for individuals, workers at specific companies, and those in entire industries when \"in the national interest.\"\u00a0New guidance\u00a0says the fee will be waived only in an \"extraordinarily rare circumstance.\" That includes showing that there is \"no American worker\" available for the position and that requiring a company to spend $100,000 would \"significantly undermine\" U.S. interests.",
      "Taub called those standards \"exceptionally high.\"",
      "Representatives of the NRHA and the American Medical Association, which organized a letter from the medical societies, said they've received no response after sending requests to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in late September and early October. The AHA declined to say whether it had heard back.",
      "Homeland Security officials directed KFF Health News' inquiries to the White House, which did not answer questions about individual waiver timelines or the possibility of a categorical exemption for the health care industry.",
      "Instead, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers sent a statement defending the new fee, saying it will \"put American workers first.\" Her comments echo Mr. Trump's proclamation, which focuses on accusations that the tech industry is abusing the H-1B program by replacing American workers with lower-paid foreign ones. But the order applies to all trades.",
      "Alam, the Harvard professor, said the U.S.' reliance on international providers does raise legitimate concerns, such as about how it takes professionals away from lower-income countries facing even greater health concerns and staffing shortages than the U.S.",
      "This decades-long dependency, she said, stems from population booms, medical schools' historical exclusion of nonwhite men, and the \"much, much cheaper\" cost of importing providers trained abroad than expanding health education in the U.S.",
      "Internationally trained doctors tend to work in rural and urban areas that are poor and underserved, according to\u00a0a survey\u00a0and\u00a0research review.",
      "Nearly 1,000 H-1B providers were employed in rural areas this year, the two rural health organizations wrote in their letter to the Trump administration.",
      "J-1 visas, the most common type held by foreign doctors during their residencies and other postgraduate training in the U.S., require them to return to their home country for two years before applying for an H-1B.",
      "But a government program called the Conrad 30 Waiver Program allows up to 1,500 J-1 holders a year to remain in the U.S. and apply for an H-1B in exchange for working for three years in a provider shortage area, which includes many rural communities.",
      "President Trump's proclamation says employers that sponsor H-1B workers already inside the U.S., such as doctors with these waivers, won't have to pay the six-figure fee, a nuance clarified in guidance released about a month later.",
      "But employers will have to pay the new fee when hiring doctors and others who apply while living outside the U.S.",
      "Alyson Kornele, CEO of West River Health Services, said most of the foreign nurses and lab techs it hires are outside the U.S. when they apply.",
      "Ivan Mitchell, CEO of Great Plains Health in North Platte, Nebraska, said most of his hospital's H-1B physicians were inside the U.S. on other visas when they applied. But he said physical therapists, nurses, and lab techs typically apply from abroad.",
      "Holzkamm said it took five to eight months to hire H-1B applicants at her lab before the new fee was introduced.",
      "Bobby Mukkamala, a surgeon and the president of the American Medical Association, said Republican and Democratic lawmakers are concerned about the ramifications for rural health care.",
      "They include Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who said he planned to reach out about possible exemptions.",
      "\"We want to make it easier, not harder, and less expensive, not more expensive, for people who need the workforce,\" the Republican told KFF Health News in September.",
      "Thune's office did not respond to questions about whether the senator has heard from the administration regarding potential waivers for health workers.",
      "The Trump administration is facing at least two lawsuits attempting to block the new fee.\u00a0One group of plaintiffs\u00a0includes a company that recruits foreign nurses and a union that represents medical graduates.\u00a0Another lawsuit, by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, mentions concerns about the physician shortage and health systems' ability to afford the new fee.",
      "Kornele said West River won't be able to afford a $100,000 fee so it's doubling down on local recruiting and retention.",
      "But Holzkamm said she hasn't been successful in finding lab techs from North Dakota colleges, even those who intern at the hospital. She said West River can't compete with the salaries offered in bigger cities.",
      "\"It's a bad cycle right now. We're in a lot of trouble,\" she said.",
      "Phillip Reese is a data reporting specialist and an associate professor of journalism at California State University-Sacramento.",

    "summary": "A U.S. district judge blocked Trump from deploying the California National Guard in Los Angeles and said control of the Guard must be returned to Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in California blocked the Trump administration from deploying members of the California National Guard in Los Angeles and directed it to return control of the Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "The decision Wednesday from U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer is the second in which he has ruled against the Trump administration in its efforts to federalize the California National Guard, under a law known as Title 10, and send troops to the streets of Los Angeles to protect federal personnel and property during immigration enforcement operations. Newsom, a Democrat, opposed President Trump's move to call the state's National Guard into federal service in support of the president's immigration crackdown.",
      "Sought by California officials, the preliminary injunction granted by Breyer arose out of orders issued by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in August and October that kept 300 California National Guard troops under federal control to temporarily protect federal immigration agents and other government entities. The October order from Hegseth called for 200 of the California National Guard personnel to deploy to Oregon, with the remaining 100 troops sent to various locations throughout Los Angeles.",
      "The California National Guard members are set to remain in federal service through Feb. 2.",
      "Breyer criticized the Trump administration in his 35-page order for continuing to retain control of roughly 300 Guardsmen when there is no evidence the execution of federal law was hindered \"in any way.\"",
      "\"The Founders designed our government to be a system of checks and balances. Defendants, however, make clear that the only check they want is a blank one,\" he wrote.",
      "Breyer also accused the Trump administration of \"effectively creating a national police force made up of state troops\" by sending California Guardsmen to other states, including Oregon and Illinois, and said the government has adopted an \"expansive view\" of Mr. Trump's powers under Title 10.",
      "The judge put his order on hold until Monday, likely to give the Justice Department time to appeal.",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta cheered the decision from Breyer.",
      "\"Once again, a court has firmly rejected the President's attempt to make the National Guard a traveling national police force,\" he said in a statement. \"For more than five months, the Trump Administration has held California National Guard troops hostage as part of its political games. But the President is not King. And he cannot federalize the National Guard whenever, wherever, and for however long he wants, without justification. This is a good day for our democracy and the strength of the rule of law.\"",
      "Mr. Trump first invoked Title 10 to federalize members of the California National Guard in June in response to protests against immigration raids in the Los Angeles-area. The law allows the president to call into federal service members of a state's Guard under certain conditions, namely when he cannot execute U.S. laws with the \"regular forces\" or when there is a \"rebellion or danger of a rebellion\" against the government.",
      "Hegeth initially federalized roughly 4,000 California Guardsmen. But Newsom, California's Democratic governor, sued to block the federalization and deployment, and Breyer issued a temporary restraining order on June 12 finding that Mr. Trump's initial federalization did not satisfy the prerequisites laid out in Title 10.",
      "But a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit temporarily lifted Breyer's order, allowing the federalization and deployment to continue. The 9th Circuit held a hearing on the Justice Department's appeal of the district court's decision, but has not yet issued a ruling.",
      "Since those proceedings, the Trump administration has released most of the federalized members of California's National Guard, but kept roughly 300 troops under federal control.",
      "In their latest bid for relief, California officials had argued that there was no basis for Mr. Trump to continue to keep the state's National Guard under federal control because the violence during protests in June had subsided. They accused the Trump administration of implementing a \"months-long military occupation, without any justification, and with no apparent end in sight.\"",
      "But the Trump administration said that the court did not have the authority to review the president's federalization orders at all, since it said they were merely extensions of his initial June memorandum that first called the California National Guard into federal service.",
      "Breyer called that position \"shocking\" and said adopting that interpretation \"would permit a president to create a perpetual police force comprised of state troops, so long as they were first federalized lawfully.\"",
      "\"Defendants' argument for a president to hold unchecked power to control state troops would wholly upend the federalism that is at the heart of our system of government,\" he wrote.",
      "Breyer also refuted the administration's claim that National Guard troops were still needed in the Los Angeles area. By sending 200 of the 300 California Guardsmen who remained under federal control to Oregon, the Trump administration \"signaled that there was no pressing need for them in Los Angeles,\" he wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump has also sought to federalize the Oregon and Illinois National Guards to assist with immigration enforcement operations over the objections of their Democratic governors. In Oregon, a federal judge ruled Mr. Trump did not have a lawful basis to federalize the state's National Guard under Title 10 and permanently blocked the administration from deploying the troops to Portland.",
      "In Illinois, a federal appeals court blocked the Trump administration from deploying Illinois Guardsmen to the Chicago-area but allowed them to remain under federal control. The Supreme Court is now weighing whether to allow their deployment.",
      "Mr. Trump has also sent National Guard members to the streets of Washington, D.C., and Memphis. Two West Virginia National Guard members who were sent to Washington, D.C., were shot in an ambush-style attack near the White House last month. One of the victims died and the other remains hospitalized.",

      "Higgins secured 59% of the vote versus former Miami City Manager\u00a0Emilio Gonzalez's nearly 41%, according to\u00a0unofficial results\u00a0from the Miami-Dade County Supervisor of Elections. The win marks an end to a\u00a0competitive race\u00a0that began with a crowded 13-person field.",
      "\"Our city chose a new direction,\" Higgins told the cheering crowd at her election night celebration. \"You chose competence over chaos, results over excuses and a city government that finally works for you.\"",
      "The campaign centered on issues such as immigration, housing, flooding, city growth and the tone of leadership Miami needs. Higgins and Gonzalez faced off in a CBS News Miami debate moderated by Jim DeFede on Nov. 25, giving voters a chance to compare their visions for the city.",
      "While the race was officially nonpartisan, Higgins had the backing of prominent Democrats, while Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis and President Trump, endorsed Gonzalez.",
      "Out of 175,692 registered voters, 37,496 cast ballots on Tuesday, a turnout of 21.3%, according to official records.",
      "Higgins' vision for Miami",
      "Higgins served eight years on the Miami-Dade County Commission and campaigned on restoring public trust and bringing what she described as calmer, more collaborative leadership to City Hall.\u00a0Affordable housing\u00a0was a cornerstone of her platform. She pledged to utilize city-owned land to build housing for working families and criticized Miami's rapid growth without corresponding improvements in services.",
      "She also called for a full review of city spending and proposed updating regulations to allow permeable pavement and accelerate park construction to improve drainage citywide. Higgins supports\u00a0expanding the City Commission\u00a0from five to nine members, arguing that Miami's legislative body is unusually small compared to other major cities and leaves many communities underrepresented.",
      "On\u00a0immigration enforcement, Higgins voiced strong concerns, calling recent actions in Miami \"inhumane and cruel.\"",
      "Higgins vowed to work with the Trump administration on issues where they can find common ground, but told CBS News, \"When we disagree, I'll make my voice heard.\"",
      "Higgins celebrates historic victory",
      "Cheers inside a Miami ballroom grew louder as Higgins stepped to the microphone Tuesday night, newly elected as the city's next mayor.",
      "\"Well, we did it!\" she exclaimed, drawing another round of applause.",
      "Higgins framed the night as a turning point for Miami and reminded supporters that the celebration was also a call to action.",
      "\"This isn't just a celebration but also a promise because Miami is facing real challenges, and tonight marks the beginning of the work ahead,\" Higgins said.",
      "She pledged to move Miami forward.",
      "\"No more endless delays for families trying to fix a home or small business trying to open,\" Higgins said. \"We will cut red tape, repair what's broken and modernize City Hall. We will confront the affordability crisis with the urgency Miami families need. We will make our streets safer by supporting law enforcement and strengthening community partnerships. We will protect Biscayne Bay.\"",
      "Her vision was inclusive.",
      "\"We will lead a city that belongs to everyone,\" she said to cheers.",

      "Prominent Miami figures joined Higgins at the celebration, including Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, Miami Police Chief Manny Morales, County Commissioner Oliver Gilbert III, Opa-locka Mayor John Taylor and Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried, underscoring the historic nature of Higgins' win.",
      "Gonzalez concedes, reflects on lawsuit",
      "Before delivering his concession speech, Gonzalez called Higgins directly.",
      "\"We respect you, and we will give you all the latitude you need to do great things,\" Gonzalez told her.",
      "Even as he conceded, Gonzalez acknowledged the legal battle that made Tuesday's vote possible. His lawsuit, filed in July 2025, challenged the City of Miami's decision to postpone the mayoral election until 2026.",
      "Asked Tuesday if he felt the lawsuit was worth it, Gonzalez replied: \"Absolutely, listen, think of the irony. I filed a lawsuit to have an election that I participated in and lost. OK? That should tell you that it's much bigger than me.\"",
      "He had argued the postponement was unconstitutional and disenfranchised voters, saying only the electorate had the authority to change the date. A judge agreed, ruling the city's vote to delay was void and unconstitutional. That decision ensured the election went forward in 2025, ultimately leading to the runoff between Gonzalez and Higgins.",
      "Levine Cava hails historic milestone",
      "Miami\u2011Dade County Mayor Levine Cava congratulated Higgins, noting that Higgins is the first woman ever elected mayor of Miami.",
      "In a statement, Levine Cava called the win a milestone for representation and said voters sent a clear message that they are tired of chaos, corruption and rising costs.",
      "She pledged to work alongside Higgins to deliver a city that \"works for everyone.\"",
      "\"For nearly 130 years since Julia Tuttle founded this city, Miami has never elected a woman as mayor,\" Levine Cava said. \"That changes tonight.\"",
      "What's next?",
      "Higgins will take office with a mandate to address housing affordability, climate resilience and government transparency. Her win signals a shift in Miami's political landscape and sets the stage for significant policy changes in the years ahead.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in New York has granted a request from the Justice Department to unseal more files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "In a brief four-page ruling on Wednesday, Judge Richard Berman of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered the unsealing of grand jury materials as well as investigative records, documents and communications from the Justice Department's 2019 investigation into Epstein.",
      "Berman is the third federal judge in a week to grant similar requests from the Justice Department, weeks after President Trump signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which directs the department to disclose records related to past investigations into Epstein and his co-conspirator and friend, Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "On Tuesday, another federal judge in New York granted a request to unseal a \"voluminous\" set of grand jury transcripts and evidence from a sex trafficking case in New York against Maxwell. Last week, a federal judge in Florida granted the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from federal investigations into Epstein in the state from 2005 and 2007.",
      "In July, the Justice Department moved to unseal grand jury materials in the Epstein and Maxwell investigations, but those initial bids were denied, because federal rules required grand jury proceedings and evidence to be kept secret.",
      "However, after the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the Justice Department argued that the law should override grand jury secrecy rules.",
      "All of the judges' orders require the identities of Epstein's and Maxwell's victims to be redacted to protect their privacy.",

    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 05:01:02 -0500",
    "summary": "In a new strategy memo, the leader of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee makes a case that the party has a \"once in a generation\" chance to flip over 650 state legislative seats.",
    "story": [
      "Much of national Democrats' attention in next year's midterms is centered on working to flip control of the U.S. House and win consequential races for governor. But some in the party have zeroed in on less talked-about elections, in presidential battlegrounds and ruby-red states around the country, that could prove less costly and have a far-reaching impact at a time when the Democratic brand has grown wearisome with some voters.",
      "Democrats' state legislative campaign arm is outlining a potential path \"to flip more than 650 state legislative seats\" across a range of states. A major focus is on races in battleground states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Arizona, and the group is aiming to curtail GOP power in places like Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Ohio, where Republican control has been impactful.",
      "\"The favorable political environment taking shape for Democrats is on a scale that only comes once in a generation,\" a new memo from Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee president Heather Williams says, while also outlining that a \"first priority right now is to fund and invest early in our battleground states as part of our $50 million power expansion strategy to win on this map.\"",
      "When pressed for details, a spokesperson told CBS News that $50 million is the group's \"estimated budget,\" but \"we also still have a lot of work ahead to raise the full amount.\"",
      "Democrats have lost around 800 state legislative seats over the last 15 years, according to data from the National Conference of State Legislatures, significantly weakening their power in capitals nationwide.",
      "Governors on the left in Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina contend with GOP-controlled legislatures, and Democrats only control one chamber of the legislature in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Minnesota.",
      "But races up and down the ballot in November 2026 may prove difficult for Republicans given the political rebuke that the president's party usually faces in a midterm cycle. And while 2024 was a strong year for the GOP, legislative elections this year in Virginia and New Jersey have given Democrats hope.",
      "Republicans are attempting to push back against the national narrative that Democrats have an edge in next year's midterms.",
      "\"After historic losses in 2024, we knew the Democrats were going to come into this next cycle prepared. Their strategy of leaning on emotion, money, and machine politics to claw back short-term momentum will not last,\" Edith Jorge-Tu\u00f1\u00f3n, the president of the Republican State Leadership Committee, said in a November 2025 memo.",
      "Republicans have seen firsthand how statehouse majorities can prove critical in Washington in recent months, as GOP\u00a0 leaders in North Carolina, Missouri and Texas redraw their congressional maps mid-decade in an attempt to help Republicans keep at least a narrow majority in the U.S. House.",
      "Over the years, Democrats have wrestled with reduced sway in a range of states, giving way to fears of a depleted bench of candidates to run in higher-profile races where money and a flashy campaign can't match the kind of goodwill built up in communities through years of elected service.",
      "Within states where that pipeline does exist, candidate quality has made a profound difference at times for Democrats.",
      "In the reliably Republican state of Kansas, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly has won two terms in distinctly different political environments after having served as a state senator.",
      "In Michigan, the constant presidential battleground where political power pivots back and forth, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer served in both the state House and state Senate before being elected statewide for the first time in 2018.",
      "And in the politically divided commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Gov. Josh Shapiro was a representative years before he became a political heavyweight now seen as a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2028.",
      "\"State legislative Democrats are local elected officials who are very close to their communities and very close to voters,\" Heather Williams, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in an interview. \"We are able to deliver an aspect of the Democratic brand and the Democratic storytelling that is better than anyone else, because it is rooted in everyday, regular conversations and needs.\"",
      "One of the major aspects of next year's midterms that has gone less talked-about is how strong President Trump's own influence will prove to be in a year when he isn't running for office himself.",
      "In presidential election years, the president and his orbit have shown a strong ability to upend political trends and bring out voters who may have chosen to stay at home with another candidate. Whether Republicans can inspire those kinds of voters without him on the ballot is a lingering question and one that is especially urgent for the GOP after Mr. Trump won Michigan, Wisconsin and other presidential battleground states during his last White House run.",
      "\"Republicans underperformed at the top of the ticket in areas where President Trump excelled in 2024 \u2013 a clear reminder that authenticity and engagement drive enthusiasm,\" Jorge-Tu\u00f1\u00f3n, the president of the Republican State Leadership Committee, said in the group's 2025 post-election memo.",
      "It's far from certain that Democrats will be able to make the gains outlined by the statehouse-focused Democratic campaign committee. But doing so could have widespread impacts, with the political outfit outlining in the memo the chance to not only flip Republican-held chambers in Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin, but also potentially defeat Republican supermajorities in 10 states.",
      "\"I think there are a lot of people in the state of Wisconsin that showed up for Donald Trump that now have buyer's remorse,\" Wisconsin Senate Democratic leader Dianne Hesselbein said.",

      "Six months after stepping down from leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, billionaire Elon Musk suggested he likely would not repeat his time helming the controversial cost-cutting mission.",
      "Musk discussed his time at the White House in a nearly hourlong podcast interview with former Trump administration aide Katie Miller that was released Tuesday. Asked if he believes DOGE was successful, Musk responded that it was \"a little bit successful.\"",
      "\"We were somewhat successful,\" the world's richest man said, adding that he believes the initiative \"stopped a lot of funding that really just made no sense\" and was \"entirely wasteful.\"",
      "Miller asked Musk if he would repeat his time leading the cost-cutting initiative, knowing what he knows now. He demurred before saying: \"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would've basically\u2026worked in my companies, essentially.\"",
      "He continued: \"They wouldn't have been burning the cars,\" referring to a series of arson and vandalism incidents that hit dealerships for Musk's electric carmaker, Tesla.",
      "Named after an internet meme, DOGE was formed\u00a0just hours\u00a0after President Trump was sworn in. Musk, who\u00a0spent hundreds of millions\u00a0supporting Mr. Trump's presidential campaign, quickly became a\u00a0near-ubiquitous presence\u00a0at the White House.",
      "Musk and his young team at DOGE quickly tore through the executive branch, shutting down programs that they found wasteful and pushing for massive reductions to the federal workforce through a combination of layoffs and voluntary buyouts. In some cases, entire agencies \u2014 including the U.S. Agency for International Development \u2014 were effectively shuttered.",
      "Musk has suggested the effort could save the government hundreds of billions, and possibly $2 trillion, though some of the cost savings figures touted by DOGE have been called into question.",
      "His aggressive approach \u2014 epitomized by a February event in which he waved around a chainsaw, calling it \"the chainsaw for bureaucracy\" \u2014 had its share of detractors, including federal workers who faced layoffs and disruptions, and Democratic lawmakers who argued the initiative was wielding vast power without approval from Congress. Lawsuits were filed to halt some of the cuts. Musk defended DOGE, arguing the government needs to slash its spending.",
      "Musk and the Mr. Trump's once-close relationship ruptured shortly after the Tesla CEO left the White House in late May. In a public back-and-forth, Musk attacked the president in personal terms and criticized his signature tax legislation, and Mr. Trump threatened to cut off lucrative federal subsidies for Tesla and Musk's rocket company SpaceX.",
      "Musk has also flirted with launching his own political party \u2014 though his plans are unclear.",
      "The two have appeared to at least partially mend their relationship since then, with Musk visiting the White House last month for a dinner with Saudi Arabia's crown prince.",
      "Asked last week if Musk is back in his circle of friends, Mr. Trump said, \"I like Elon a lot,\" before suggesting that their rift was due to cuts to electric vehicle subsidies.",
      "\"I think we get along well,\" the president added.",
      "And Musk, for his part, told Miller in his podcast interview that Mr. Trump is the funniest person he knows.",
      "\"He's got a great sense of humor,\" he said, pointing to the president's\u00a0Oval Office banter\u00a0with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. \"It's like naturally funny. It's somewhat effortless.\"",

      "Spokespeople for the White House and Department of Homeland Security didn't immediately comment. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Edgar have had a good working relationship, multiple sources say.",
      "El Salvador has played a high-profile role in the Trump administration's sweeping illegal immigration crackdown. The president in March invoked a 200-year-old wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, to send migrants to a maximum security prison in El Salvador as he sought to deport individuals his administration accused of being members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang. CBS News previously reported that many of the men do not have criminal convictions.",
      "The men imprisoned in El Salvador were returned to Venezuela in a U.S.-brokered swap over the summer. A report by human rights groups last month determined that the deportation and treatment of the more than 200 Venezuelan migrants at the prison amounted to arbitrary detention, torture and enforced disappearance under international law.",
      "Mr. Trump met in April with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, a populist who has won the admiration of conservatives in the U.S. for his crackdown on gangs under a state of exception, which empowered police and the military to arrest people on suspicion of gang affiliation without due process.",

    "story": [
      "Update: Democrat Eileen Higgins won the mayoral runoff election with about 59% of the vote.",
      "It's been nearly 30 years since Miami last elected a Democrat to serve as mayor, but the party feels this might be its best shot to reclaim victory in decades, as its candidate said a win would be a referendum on President Trump's immigration policy.",
      "\"What I will tell our congressional delegation and every person serving in Congress and the Senate is this immigration, these tactics, they're not only cruel, I grew up Catholic, I think they're also sinful,\" Eileen Higgins, the Democratic mayoral candidate, said.",
      "Higgins, a county commissioner, is facing a runoff election against Republican hopeful Emilio Gonzalez, a former city manager, Miami-Dade County commissioner and director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under former President George W. Bush.",
      "\"My opponent would like this to be a referendum on the president,\" said Gonzalez, who has been endorsed by Mr. Trump. \"I want our voters to make this a referendum on me.\"",
      "While the race is technically a nonpartisan election, national Democrats have deployed resources for Higgins, including an endorsement video by former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, a visit from Arizona's Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego and a canvassing event with former Chicago Mayor and Obama chief of staff Rahm Emmanuel.",
      "Higgins came in first in the Nov. 4 election with 36% of the vote, followed by Gonzalez's 19% \u2014 but since neither candidate reached 50% in a 13-person field, a runoff election between the top two candidates is set for Tuesday. Adding to the Democratic Party's optimism is early voting data, which shows Democrats outpacing Republicans by about 8%.",
      "Florida Republicans have sought to downplay the significance of Tuesday's election. The state party chair pointed to the fact that Kamala Harris won the city of Miami by 1 percentage point in 2024.",
      "Yet a win for Democrats in Florida, Mr. Trump's adopted home state, and in the city that is set to become the site for his presidential library, would be a reversal in fortune for Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump handily won the state in 2024 by more than 13%. Miami-Dade County, where the city of Miami is located, voted for a Republican governor in 2022 for the first time in 20 years. Statewide, Republicans have a 10-point registration lead over Democrats.",
      "\"She's certainly running a lot of high-energy efforts on the ground there, bringing in a big coalition, bringing in all types of folks to support her. I certainly think she has a great shot,\" said Ken Martin, the Democratic National Committee Chair. \"Will be a big, big win if we win that.\"",
      "The last time the city of Miami elected a Democrat as Mayor was in 1993, after a 1997 Democratic win was tossed out amid legal challenges.",
      "Mr. Trump again weighed in on the race Monday with a post on his social media platform Truth Social: \"Miami's Mayor Race is Tuesday. It is a big and important race!!! Vote for Republican Gonzalez. He is FANTASTIC! You can also vote today. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "The city of Miami has a population that is 57% foreign-born, according to the 2024 U.S. Census, and about half are naturalized U.S. Citizens who would be eligible to vote in the election. While Hispanic voters nationally trend toward the Democratic Party, in South Florida, Republicans have found a stronghold among Cuban, Venezuelan and Nicaraguan exiles who fled communist and socialist governments.",
      "However, Mr. Trump's immigration policy has come to something of a flashpoint in Florida. In addition to state troopers carrying out increased immigration enforcement, the Sunshine State is also home to the controversial \"Alligator Alcatraz\" detention center. The recent end of Temporary Protected Status\u00a0for over 250,000 Venezuelans could also have considerable repercussions in a state with a large population of immigrants from the South American country, many of whom have been living in the U.S. for years and are deeply integrated in the local economy.",
      "\"It is ruining our economy,\" said Higgins. \"Sure, get the criminals out of here, but find a path to citizenship for people who deserve it and for an economy that needs it.\"",
      "Mr. Gonzalez said Higgins' focus on immigration is a sign that she is focused on national, not local issues.",
      "\"They want to talk about things that have nothing to do with the city of Miami,\" he said. \"Why pick a fight about national immigration policy? Next, we are going to be talking about whether men should be in women's sports.\"",
      "Higgins vowed to work with the Trump administration on issues where they can find common ground if she is elected, but warned, \"When we disagree, I'll make my voice heard.\"",

As she prepares to resign from Congress before her term ends, Greene told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Lesley Stahl the president isn't living up to his \"America First\" motto, and she connected death threats she says she has received with the president's comments about her.",
      "The president said the only reason Greene \"went BAD is that she was JILTED by the president of the United States.\"",
      "\"Marjorie is not AMERICA FIRST or MAGA, because nobody could have changed her views so fast, and her new views are those of a very dumb person,\" the president wrote on Truth Social, calling Greene \"washed up\" and a \"low IQ traitor.\"",
      "The president also blasted Stahl, \"60 Minutes\" and the new ownership of Paramount, CBS's parent company, decrying the company's decision to \"allow a show like this to air.\" He added, \"Since they bought it, 60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE!\"",
      "Greene, who voted with Mr. Trump 98% of the time before their relationship began to deteriorate, has said she thinks the president failed to put domestic issues at the top of his agenda. In her video announcing her resignation, she also criticized his support of both the crypto and pharmaceutical industries.",
      "Her relationship with Mr. Trump began to sour over records related to Jeffrey Epstein, who was facing federal sex trafficking charges when he died by suicide in 2019.",
      "Greene told \"60 Minutes\" that after the president called her a traitor, she received a bomb threat on her house \u2014 and then, \"several direct death threats on my son.\"",
      "Asked about her claim that the president was to blame for the threats to her and her son, Greene replied, \"The subject line for the direct death threats on my son was his words: \"Marjorie Traitor Greene.\"",
      "Greene told \"60 Minutes\" the threats were \"directly fueled by President Trump. And I told him. I told JD Vance. I told them all. Sent those directly to them.\"",
      "\"JD Vance replied back to me, 'We'll look into it,'\" Greene added. \"I got [a] response from President Trump that I will keep private, but it wasn't very nice.\"",
      "But when Stahl asked if the president ran her out of Congress, she said no.",
      "\"I will be no one's battered wife,\" she said.",
      "Stahl also asked about the solid support Mr. Trump nonetheless still enjoys among Republicans in Congress.",
      "\"I think they're terrified to step outta line and get a nasty Truth Social post on them,\" Greene said. Stahl asked, \"And they're watching what happened to you?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Greene replied.",
      "Last month, Greene apologized on CNN for what she said had been her role in contributing to America's often venomous political environment with her language. But she also sparred with Stahl over the issue on \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "Stahl asked Greene \"to respond to what you have done in terms of insulting people, yelling at people.\" Greene countered that Stahl was being \"accusatory.\" After Stahl responded, \"I don't insult people,\" Green told her, \"[Y]ou do in the way you question. And you are, you're accusing me right now.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 07:31:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Paleontologists have discovered and documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
    "story": [
      "Legend once had it that the huge, three-toed footprints scattered across the central highlands of Bolivia came from supernaturally strong monsters - capable of sinking their claws even into solid stone.",
      "Then scientists came here in the 1960s and dispelled children's fears, determining that the strange footprints in fact belonged to gigantic, two-legged dinosaurs that stomped and splashed over 60 million years ago, in the ancient waterways of what is now Toro Toro, a village and popular national park in the Bolivian Andes.",
      "Now, a team of paleontologists, mostly from California's Loma Linda University, have discovered and meticulously documented 16,600 such footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex. Their study, based on six years of regular field visits and published last Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One, reports that this finding represents the highest number of theropod footprints recorded anywhere in the world.",
      "\"There's no place in the world where you have such a big abundance of (theropod) footprints,\" said Roberto Biaggi, a co-author of the study led by Spanish paleontologist Ra\u00fal Esperante. \"We have all these world records at this particular site.\"",
      "Prints record dinosaur behavior \u2014 including attempts to swim",
      "The dinosaurs that ruled the earth and roamed this region also made awkward attempts to swim here, according to the study, scratching at what was squishy lake-bottom sediment to leave another 1,378 traces.",
      "The longest swim trackway studied by the researchers measured over 130 meters in length. \"To date, it remains the longest exposed swim trackway in the world,\" the authors write in the study.",
      "They pressed their claws into the mud just before water levels rose and sealed their tracks, protecting them from centuries of erosion, scientists said.",
      "\"The preservation of many of the tracks is excellent,\" said Richard Butler, a paleontologist at the University of Birmingham who was not involved in the research. He said that, to his knowledge, the number of footprints and trackways found in Toro Toro had no precedent.",
      "\"This is a remarkable window into the lives and behaviors of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous,\" Butler added, referring to the period around 66 million years ago at the end of which an asteroid impact abruptly extinguished all dinosaurs and 75% of living species along with them, according to scientists.",
      "Footprints face preservation threats",
      "Although they've survived for millions of years, human life has threatened these traces. For decades, farmers threshed corn and wheat on the footprint-covered plateaus. Nearby quarry workers didn't think much of the formations as they blasted rock layers for limestone. And just two years ago, researchers said, highway crews tunneling through hillsides nearly wiped out a major site of dinosaur tracks before the national park intervened.",
      "Such disturbances may have something to do with the area's striking absence of dinosaur bones, teeth and eggs, experts say. For all of the footprints and swim traces found across Bolivia's Toro Toro, there are virtually no skeletal remains of the sort that litter the peaks and valleys of Argentine Patagonia and Campanha in Brazil.",
      "But the lack of bones could have natural causes, too. The team said the quantity and pattern of tracks - and the fact they were all found in the same sediment layer - suggest that dinosaurs didn't settle in what is now Bolivia as much as trudge along an ancient coastal superhighway stretching from southern Peru into northwest Argentina.",
      "The range in footprint sizes indicated that giant creatures roughly 10 meters (33 feet) tall moved in a herd with tiny theropods the size of a chicken, 32 centimeters (1 foot) tall at the hip.",
      "In presenting a snapshot of everyday behavior footprints \"reveal what skeletons cannot,\" said Anthony Romilio, a paleontologist at the University of Queensland in Australia who also did not participate in the study. Just from footprints, researchers can tell when dinosaurs strolled or sped up, stopped or turned around.",
      "It's not clear why so many dinosaurs roamed the site",
      "But the reason they flocked in droves to this wind-swept plateau remains a mystery.",
      "\"It may have been that they were all regular visitors to a large, ancient, freshwater lake, frequenting its expansive muddy shoreline,\" offered Romilio.",
      "Biaggi suggested that they were \"running away from something or searching for somewhere to settle.\"",
      "What's certain is that research into this treasure trove of a dinosaur tracksite will continue.",
      "\"I suspect that this will keep going over the years and many more footprints will be found right there at the edges of what's already uncovered,\" Biaggi said.",
      "Recent dinosaur footprint discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "In March, scientists in England discover a 650 foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some 200 dinosaur footprints dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be biggest in the United Kingdom. \"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontologist from the University of Birmingham,\u00a0told BBC News. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

      "Launched in 2013 and having entered Mars' orbit in September 2014, Maven began studying the upper Martian atmosphere and its interaction with the solar wind.

    "story": [
      "A black hole inside a distant spiral galaxy is devouring material from the universe around it and creating winds at speeds never before seen by astronomers.",
      "The European Space Agency said that the black hole inside NGC 3783 has the mass of 30 million suns. The black hole consumes nearby material to power an active galactic nucleus at the center of the galaxy, the ESA said in a news release. The nucleus is \"an extremely bright and active region\" that sends out powerful jets and winds, the agency said.",
      "One powerful wind was measured at 60,000 kilometers per second, or 130 million piles per hour, about 20% of the speed of light.",
      "\"We've not watched a black hole create winds this speedily before,\" said Liyi Gu at Space Research Organisation Netherlands (SRON), in a statement. Gu led the international research team. \"For the first time, we've seen how a rapid burst of X-ray light from a black hole immediately triggers ultra-fast winds, with these winds forming in just a single day.\"",
      "Researcher Matteo Guainazzi said the winds around the black hole were created as the nucleus' tangled magnetic field suddenly untwisted, creating something similar to the coronal mass ejections that erupt from the sun \"but on a scale almost too big to imagine.\"",
      "The similarity between black holes and the sun makes \"these mysterious objects seem a little less alien,\" the ESA said. Project scientist Erik Kuulkers said the discovery \"suggests that solar and high-energy physics may work in surprisingly familiar ways throughout the universe.\"",
      "Winds from active galactic nuclei play a role in how the galaxies they are situated within develop, said ESA research fellow Camille Diez. Learning more about the nuclei and how they behave will lead to a better understanding of space, Diez said.",
      "\"Because they're so influential, knowing more about the magnetism of AGNs, and how they whip up winds such as these, is key to understanding the history of galaxies throughout the Universe,\" Diez said.",

      "A NASA astronaut and two cosmonaut crewmates strapped into their Soyuz ferry ship Monday evening, undocked from the International Space Station and plunged to an on-target landing on the frigid steppe of Kazakhstan early Tuesday to wrap up an\u00a0eight-month mission.",
      "With Soyuz commander Sergey Ryzhikov strapped into the descent module's center seat, flanked on his left by cosmonaut Alexey Zubritsky and on the right by NASA's Jonny Kim, the Soyuz MS-27/73S spacecraft undocked from the lab at 8:41 p.m. ET.",
      "After moving a safe distance away to a precise point in space, the Soyuz braking rockets fired for four minutes and 42 seconds starting at 11:09 p.m., slowing the ship's 17,100-mph velocity by about 286 mph, just enough to drop the far side of the orbit into Earth's lower atmosphere.",
      "Enduring re-entry temperatures of some 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit -- and rapidly decelerating in the process -- the Soyuz descent module, suspended beneath a large orange-and-white parachute, landed at 12:03 a.m. EST Tuesday (0503 UTC, 10:03am local time in Kazakhstan) and tipped over on its side.",
      "Braving frigid sub-freezing weather, Russian recovery crews and NASA support personnel quickly reached the charred spacecraft, opening the Soyuz's hatch, extracting the crew and making initial medical checks as the trio began re-adjusting to gravity.",
      "Briefly resting in a nearby recliner as is traditional for returning  Soyuz crew members, Kim appeared healthy and in good spirits, smiling  his thanks after Russian recovery crews presented him with a nested  matryoshka doll with his face painted on the outermost shell.",
      "After  more detailed medical checks inside a heated inflatable tent, the crew was to be flown by helicopter to  the town of Dzhezkazgan where Kim planned to board a NASA jet for the long  flight home to the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Ryzhikov and  Zubritsky will head for Star City near Moscow for debriefings and  reunions with family members.",
      "Left behind aboard the space station were NASA Crew 11 fliers Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.",
      "Also on board: Soyuz MS-28/74S commander Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, flight engineer Sergei Mikaev and NASA astronaut Christopher Williams. They arrived at the space station on Nov. 27 to replace Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim.",
      "During a change-of-command ceremony on Sunday, Kim said what he will remember most from his eight months in space is \"the bond that we shared together.\"",
      "\"I firmly believe that the greatest quality of an astronaut, and a human, is not technical competence, or loyalty, or any of the myriad other things we like to ascribe to astronauts. It's love,\" he said. \"We always gave each other grace and had so much love for each other and everyone who supports us. I think that is what makes space exploration possible.\"",
      "During their stay aboard the space station, Kim and his crewmates traveled 104 million miles over 3,920 orbits. Kim focused on research and maintenance in the U.S. segment of the station while Ryzhikov and Zubritsky carried out two spacewalks.",
      "The son of South Korean immigrants and a father of three, Kim has a resume that's impressive even by astronaut standards. He is a former Navy SEAL, combat veteran and a Harvard Medical School graduate.",
      "In a pre-launch interview, Kim said he had \"some terrible moments\" in combat and ended up \"just really burnt out. I was very burnt out from the combat, from the war and the loss. ... I needed a way to continue serving, and it seemed logical that medicine would be that vehicle.\"",
      "Already a SEAL team combat medic, Kim was accepted by Harvard's medical school. Along the way, \"I probably went a little too extreme in ensuring that previous successes did not set myself up for the future.\"",
      "\"I ensured that the people I worked with in the hospital didn't know I was previously a SEAL, because I wanted my patients, I wanted my colleagues to think of me as dependable and proficient and a good physician. Not because I used to be a SEAL, but because that's who I was.\"",

    "story": [
      "With the world's first social media ban for teenagers under 16 now in effect in Australia, its initial political architect is celebrating a new less-digital era for millions of children \u2014 and sharing that the legislation was personally inspired by his wife, for their four children.",
      "\"She read a book called 'The Anxious Generation,' by Jonathan Haidt,\" said Peter Malinauskas, the premier of the state of South Australia. \"And I will never forget the night she finished reading the book and she put it down on her lap and she turned to me and said, 'You better do something about this!'\"",
      "Within seven months, and with strong public support, that idea fast became law across the land, winning support from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Ten major apps including TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit and Facebook have complied to bar everyone 16 and under from their accounts and from setting up new accounts.",
      "\"Heaven forbid they might talk to one another a bit more, pick up the phone and have a chat rather than just being obsessed with the screen,\" said Maulinauskas.",
      "The ban puts the onus of responsibility on social media companies rather than parents with a penalty of up to $33 million if found to be in breach. It allows for each company to decide how best to adhere, which must be \"multi-layered,\" using more than one kind of identity verification, which could include traditional methods including national IDs and passports but also artificial intelligence \u2014 controversial over possible inaccuracies \u2014 to scan facial features for age.",
      "Malinauskas readily admits there will be growing pains.",
      "\"People will find ways around it and lots of things will go wrong, and that'll be highlighted in coming days and weeks in Australia,\" he said, \"but on balance, this is a reform that parents want so they can do their job more easily.\"",
      "He says officials from North America, Europe and Asia have been speaking with him about advancing similar legislation in Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan. Malaysia is already on track to be the next country to ban those under 16 from social media in 2026.",
      "Yet in Australia, the law already faces a legal challenge. The country's High Court accepted a legal challenge from two 15-year-olds who assert the ban violates their freedom of communication. The case could be heard as early as February.",
      "Malinauskas blames those companies for putting all children through \"a global experiment\" over the past decade with \"social media addiction and overuse because many of these platforms have had addictive algorithms.\"",
      "\"I'm really proud, really proud that we've been able to see South Australia and then Australia lead a reform that's going to make a big difference to young people's lives,\" he said.",
      "\"And the reason why politicians are looking at it is because parents know something's not right. You know, there is no better judge of what's in the best interest of a child than a parent, right?\"",

    "summary": "For thousands of parents in 39 countries, including the U.S., the goal is simple: More time outdoors, and a childhood lived offline as much as possible.",
    "story": [
      "Suffolk, England - For parents Daisy Greenwell and Joe Ryrie, freedom means looking up at the world around them instead of down at their phones, and they're determined to pass that sense of non-digital liberty on to their children.",
      "Their daughter started asking for a smartphone when she was just eight years old, because her classmates were getting them. The pressure to have a phone at such a young age surprised Greenwell, and pushed her to look more closely at the trend.",
      "She found a growing body of research suggesting that heavy smartphone use may negatively impact young people's mental health.",
      "The more she read, the more concerned she became, so Greenwell decided to take action. She posted a question on Instagram: What if we could switch the norm? What if parents united to create a \"smartphone-free childhood?\"",
      "The response was immediate.",
      "\"That post went viral,\" she told CBS News. \"Thousands of parents joined the group overnight.\"",
      "Within a couple weeks, Greenwell said there were smartphone-free childhood groups in every county in England. One year later, the grassroots campaign has expanded far beyond the U.K. borders.",
      "The group \u2014 Smartphone Free Childhood \u2014 now has chapters in 39 countries.",
      "For Greenwell, Ryrie and the thousands of families who've joined the movement, the goal is simple: More time outdoors, and a childhood lived offline as much as possible.",
      "In the U.S., the movement even inspired a cautionary viral advertisement, highlighting the dangers of giving children unrestricted access to the internet. A parent in the ad tells their child: \"There's a box in the corner with all the pornographic material ever made. I'm trusting you not to look in there, okay?\"",
      "The backlash against youth consumption of social media has drawn the attention of governments globally. On Wednesday, Australia became the first country in the world to enact a ban on social media accounts for children under the age of 16. The law compels huge tech companies such as Meta and TikTok to enforce age restrictions, or face hefty fines.",
      "In the U.K., national Culture Minister Lisa Nandy said the government would be keeping a \"close eye\" on Australia's social media ban, but added that there were no current plans to replicate the legislation.",
      "At a grassroots level, however, parents who join Greenwell and Ryrie's movement are asked to sign a pact: No smartphones for the kids before they turn 14, and no social media before 16.",
      "\"This isn't an anti-tech movement, it's a pro-childhood movement. We're not saying no smartphones ever. We're just saying children don't need unrestricted internet access in their pockets 24/7,\" Ryrie told CBS News.",
      "When asked what she'd tell busy working parents who rely on phones for convenience, Greenwell acknowledged the challenge.",
      "\"It's really tough,\" she said. \"But delaying the smartphone is free, it's simple, and it gives your child the best chance to thrive.\"",
      "Many families are turning to basic \"brick phones\" as alternatives \u2014 devices that allow calls and texts, but limit internet access. Sales of such \"dumb\" devices have risen 150% among 18-24 year olds in the United States, according to a study by the peer-reviewed journal Partners Universal Innovative Research Publication.",
      "Despite the momentum, Greenwell says there's still a cultural norm to disrupt, and available data highlights that point. One in four British kids between the ages of 5 and 7 already own a smartphone, according to the U.K.'s independent media regulator Ofcom.",
      "Greenwell said she believes real change can be driven from the community level.",
      "\"If children know several classmates are also delaying smartphones, the peer pressure dissolves,\" she told CBS News. \"It becomes easier for families to wait a few years. A brick phone in the meantime isn't that hard. We can do this.\"",

    "summary": "Tilly Norwood is unlike any other aspiring TV or movie star: Tilly is entirely generated by artificial intelligence. What might that mean for the media industry?",
    "story": [
      "At the dawn of this century, Al Pacino starred in \"S1m0ne,\" a satire about a down-on-his-luck director who creates a computer-generated \"star\" that conquers Hollywood. Fast forward nearly 25 years, and it appears that real life has caught up with the movies, with the introduction of an AI-generated actress named Tilly Norwood.",
      "News of an AI actress triggered a bit of a Hollywood freak-out about that timeless worry of who gets the part, from Whoopi Goldberg (\"Bring it on, because you can always tell them from us\"), to Emily Blunt (\"Good Lord, we're screwed\").",
      "Tilly's creator, Eline van der Velden, says she did not expect the backlash: \"No, not at all. But at the same time, I had created her to resonate internationally, right? I had created her to become a global superstar.\"",
      "Van der Velden, herself a former actor and comedienne, aimed high because she thinks generative AI is ready for its closeup \u2013 saving money, and adding creativity. \"I was just trying to educate those industry individuals at that time about what's possible,\" she said.",
      "Bringing Tilly to life took van der Velden's team some 2,000 iterations. Then, she began to teach her to act. She showed us some early iterations of Tilly emoting. \"We were starting to try different emotions with her,\" she said. \"Here we did some tests. We didn't think the acting was very good at all.\"",
      "\"It wasn't up to your standards?\" I asked.",
      "\"It was not up to my standards at all!\"",
      "In an interview this past July with the British publication Broadcast International, van der Velden made the provocative statement, \"We want Tilly to be the next Scarlett Johansson or Natalie Portman, that's the aim of what we're doing.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the Scarlett Johansson of the AI genre,\" she told us. \"I think that was what was missed. There was a lot of misinformation. She's not meant to take real acting jobs in the traditional film and TV industry. She's meant to stay in her own AI genre, and that's where we want her to stay.\"",
      "Still, she says her firm has fielded requests for Tilly to appear in a film opposite real actors. \"We have said no to any offers,\" van der Velden said.",
      "\"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up\"",
      "Sean Astin is the president of SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, where Tilly Norwood has struck a nerve about the state of AI. Asked what Tilly represents to him, Astin replied, \"Avatar and character seem like fair labels. Actress, not so much. She \u2013 she? It? \u2013 simply will not replace our people.\"",
      "He says right now in Hollywood artificial intelligence feels like a tsunami: \"The onslaught of AI products and AI technology and its uses is, it's overwhelming. I would just as soon \u2013 as citizens and as a union \u2013 that we surf the wave, that we surf the wave of incoming stuff.\"",
      "For the union, AI protections were a major point of contention in the 2023 strike, and Astin says safeguarding a performer's name, image and likeness from being harvested without compensation is a top priority going forward. \"Eline has every right to use open source, publicly available, legal information to build her creative things,\" he said. \"My issue and our company's issue is with the companies that design those systems and scrape the internet and ingest them. They're not allowed to do that.\"",
      "Astin applauds producers who are trying to push the creative envelope using AI. But, he adds, \"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up. If you push the envelope, you say, 'Hey, how can human-centered artistry collaborate with this technology to achieve some communication that feels good to an audience?' And then there's like, 'Oh, by the way, we think it's cheaper, easier, and you know, we don't want to hire you as an actor.'\"",
      "\"Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\"",
      "Already, AI-generated scenes have appeared in TV series like Amazon's \"House of David.\" There are AI commercials, and over the summer, an AI model appeared in an ad in Vogue magazine for the first time.",
      "For producers, facing ballooning production budgets, AI has triggered a range of emotions. Former entertainment executive Kevin Reilly explains: \"Excitement, confusion, fear, trying to figure out how to use this. Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\" he said. \"It is, in my opinion, very much a friend. It is the most transformative thing that's happened maybe in the history of Man.\"",
      "Reilly is now something of an AI evangelist. He's the new CEO of Kartel.ai, a Beverly Hills startup that makes AI videos and ad campaigns. \"Everything comes with a downside,\" he said. \"But that is not the reason to just categorically be fearful of this.\"",
      "I asked, \"How much of this is driven by studios and streaming platforms and brands wanting to just save money?\"",
      "\"Yeah, I think it's not necessarily, 'Hey, we wanna save money,'\" said Reilly. \"It's that the bottom line \u2013 you know, they are businesses.\"",
      "And for businesses, the creative upside can be extraordinary. Kartel wanted to show off a bit, and put generative engineer Fillip Isgro in the driver's seat. He showed us a concept for a coffee commercial, Cup of Jo. The ad featured multiple versions of \u2026 me! It was a little jarring.",
      "He began with an old-fashioned storyboard, building an AI world directed by a human. \"What does the coffee shop look like? What does the logo look like? And finally, what do you look like? With your permission, we went on your Instagram and we collected all of your photos.\"",
      "That's all he needed to generate my face. And with just a few commands, Cup of Jo went global, with images of Jo's Coffee Shop on a barge in the middle of the ocean; on a volcano in Hawaii; and in the Alps.",
      "\"The next step in our journey is, we bring it to life,\" Isgro said. \"We actually bring motion into our stills. I just whip out my iPhone, I record who I need to, and then I can just instantly get the character doing the thing that I need them to do.\"",
      "The result: a flashy new ad created in just a couple of days, using no ad agency, no locations, and none of my time.",
      "\"Imagine having to go and shoot that. You don't get that flexibility\" in a traditional ad, Isgro said. \"And it's a very planned thing. You have to stick to scripts, and that's it. But in this world, we can iterate indefinitely without repercussion.\"",
      "It's the story of our time: the tug of war between artificial intelligence (\"This tech is here. It's not gonna go anywhere. How can we use it as a force for good?\" asks Eline van der Velden) and humanity (\"Artificial intelligence will never replace us, ever,\" says Sean Astin) that, for now, is something of a cliffhanger.",

    "story": [
      "European Union regulators on Friday said it is fining Elon Musk's social media platform X $140 million (120 million euros) for violating regulations aimed at protecting internet users in the trading bloc from digital abuses.",
      "The European Commission said that X breached \"transparency obligations\" under the Digital Services Act (DSA). The fine represents the EU's first move to sanction a company for violating the law since the law was enacted in 2022.",
      "In a statement issued Friday, the commission accused X of using its 'blue checkmark' in a way that deceives users. Anyone can pay to get the verification, making it hard for users to judge the authenticity of the accounts they engage with on the social media platform, the EU said. This could expose users to scams and \"other forms of manipulation by malicious actors,\" the commission noted.",
      "The European Commission also took aim at X's ads repository, which it said fails to meet accessibility requirements under the DSA. Internet platforms in the EU are required to provide a database of all the digital advertisements they have carried, with details such as who paid for them and the intended audience. That goal is to help researchers detect scams, fake ads and coordinated influence campaigns.",
      "X has 60 days to tell the European Commission how it plans to address the group's concerns.",
      "Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr took issue with the fine and defended X. \"Once again, Europe is fining a successful U.S. tech company for being a successful U.S. tech company,\" he\u00a0wrote on X\u00a0Friday in a post shared by X owner Elon Musk.",
      "X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "Google released its annual list of top search trends for 2025\u00a0 \u2014 with the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" and the longest government shutdown in U.S. history ranked among this year's most searched news topics online.",
      "Google's annual \"Year in Search\" report is a window into what Americans have been thinking about over the past year, from breaking news to pop culture trends.",
      "Kirk was the top search overall in the U.S. The 31-year-old right-wing political activist and influential voice for young conservatives died in September after he was shot in the neck during a Turning Point USA event in Utah Valley University. His wife, Erika, who took over as chairman and CEO of Turning Point USA, was also named one of the top-searched people on Google.",
      "Erika Kirk made headlines when she forgave her husband's killer during remarks at his memorial service, which drew thousands to State Farm Stadium in Arizona, including the president. She will join CBS for a one-hour town hall event moderated by CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss on Saturday, Dec. 13, at 8 p.m. ET on CBS. The appearance comes days after the anticipated release of \"Stop, in the Name of God: Why Honoring the Sabbath Will Transform Your Life,\" a guide to recharging and connecting with your faith and family, written by her late husband.",
      "New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani was another top name searched this year after he defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa. The 34-year-old democratic socialist will make history as the city's first Muslim mayor.",
      "Americans were also looking for regular updates on the historic 43-day-long government shutdown, which disrupted air travel and left thousands of workers without paychecks. Mr. Trump signed a bill in November to fund the government through Jan. 30.",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 11:18:17 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge in Maryland on Thursday ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia's immediate release from Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A Maryland judge on Thursday ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who was mistakenly deported to his home country earlier this year, from immigration custody.",
      "The decision from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis granted Abrego Garcia's habeas petition to release him from custody. It is a significant victory for Abrego Garcia, whose immigration case became a major flashpoint in President Trump's mass-deportation campaign when he was removed to El Salvador earlier this year.",
      "In her order, Xinis found that there was no final order of removal from the government to deport Abrego Garcia from the United States, despite the Trump administration's repeated attempts to remove him.",
      "\"Because respondents have no statutory authority to remove Abrego Garcia to a third country absent a removal order, his removal cannot be considered reasonably foreseeable, imminent, or consistent with due process,\" Xinis wrote in Thursday's order.",
      "\"Although respondents may eventually get it right, they have not as of today,\" the judge continued. \"Thus, Abrego Garcia's detention for the stated purpose of third country removal cannot continue. Respondents' conduct over the past months belie that his detention has been for the basic purpose of effectuating removal, lending further support that Abrego Garcia should be held no longer.\"",
      "Assistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the judge's decision \"naked judicial activism by an Obama-appointed judge.\"",
      "\"This order lacks any valid legal basis and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "The Trump administration has been attempting to re-deport Abrego Garcia to the African nations of Uganda, Eswatini or Ghana, but the countries have not agreed to accept him.",
      "But the administration informed the court in October that Liberia had agreed to take Abrego Garcia and would seek to deport him.",
      "The administration has \"received diplomatic assurances regarding the treatment of third-country individuals removed to Liberia from the United States and are making the final necessary arrangements for [Abrego Garcia's] removal,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's attorney, said in October that unless Liberia guarantees it will not send Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, deporting him to the West African nation \"is no less unlawful than sending him directly\" to his home country again.",
      "In November, the Trump administration argued that Abrego Garcia had received significant due process in the U.S. In a court filing, the Justice Department said a U.S. government asylum officer interviewed Abrego Garcia, who remains in federal immigration detention, and determined he had failed to prove he would face persecution or torture in Liberia.",
      "Xinis heard testimony in October from an official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement about the Trump administration's efforts to remove Abrego Garcia, who has been in ICE custody since late August. The official, John Schultz, said the administration remains in active discussions with Eswatini about removing him there, though the east African country rejected a request to take him.",
      "Still, Schultz said that once the administration has received word of a third country willing to accept Abrego Garcia, it could deport him within 72 hours if allowed by the court.",
      "Abrego Garcia has said he is willing to go to Costa Rica and designated the country as his preferred country of removal, and Costa Rica has indicated it would provide him refugee status or residency. But during the hearing Oct. 10, a Justice Department lawyer said there had not been discussions about deporting him there.",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia accused the Trump administration of gamesmanship and deliberately seeking to remove him to countries where he could raise claims of reasonable fear of persecution, with the goal of keeping him detained for longer.",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. from El Salvador in 2011 and has lived in Maryland with his wife and children. But he was arrested by immigration authorities in March and deported to his home country, despite having been granted a legal status in 2019 that prohibited the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to El Salvador because of possible persecution by local gangs.",
      "As part of a civil case Abrego Garcia and his wife brought against the Trump administration, Xinis ordered the Department of Homeland Security to facilitate his return back to the U.S. But immigration officials resisted doing so for months. Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. in June, but only after a federal grand jury in Tennessee indicted him on two charges of human smuggling stemming from a November 2022 traffic stop.",
      "Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty, and a judge in Tennessee ordered him to be released on bail ahead of a criminal trial set to begin in January. But he remained in criminal confinement for several more weeks because of concerns from his lawyers that immigration authorities would arrest him upon his release and deport him from the U.S.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from the Putnam County Jail in Tennessee in August and returned to Maryland. But days later, he was taken into custody by immigration authorities after being summoned for an interview at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Baltimore. The Trump administration notified Abrego Garcia's lawyers he could be deported to Uganda, though Abrego Garcia expressed fear of persecution and torture, as well as a concern that the Ugandan government would send him back to El Salvador.",
      "Abrego Garcia also filed a new legal challenge to his confinement and the Trump administration's efforts to deport him for a second time, which Xinis is presiding over. She has blocked immigration officials from removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S., and he has since remained in detention at a facility in Pennsylvania.",
      "At the heart of Abrego Garcia's challenge is a 2001 Supreme Court case, in which the high court said the government cannot indefinitely detain a person in the U.S. illegally if there is no significant likelihood of removal in the \"reasonably foreseeable future.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers argued that he has been in near-continuous confinement since March, when he was deported to El Salvador and held in prisons there. His only period of freedom was for a weekend in August, in between his release from criminal custody in Tennessee and his arrest by immigration authorities in Maryland.",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 10:36:11 -0500",
    "summary": "An American special forces veteran led the operation to get Mar\u00eda Corina Machado out of Venezuela: \"The first Nobel Prize winner that we've ever rescued.\"",
    "story": [
      "It took an American private rescue team 15 to 16 hours to get Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado out of her country and safely on her way to Norway to collect her Nobel Peace Prize, and to be reunited with her family on Wednesday. The vast majority of that time was spent in rough seas, and the man who led the operation and met Machado on a boat told CBS News, \"no one was enjoying that ride, especially Maria!\"",
      "\"No one's blood pressure was low, throughout any phase of this operation, including mine,\" said Bryan Stern, a U.S. special forces veteran who heads the Grey Bull Rescue Foundation. \"It was dangerous. It was scary. The sea conditions were ideal for us, but certainly not water that you would want to be on ... the higher the waves, the harder it is for radar to see. That's how it works.\"",
      "In an interview Wednesday with CBS News, Stern gave some insight into the complex operation his organization undertook to get Machado out of Venezuela and on a plane to Norway, where she was reunited with her children for the first time in about two years. A representative for Machado confirmed to CBS News on Thursday that Grey Bull was behind the rescue operation that began on Tuesday.",
      "Of the hundreds of rescues his organization has carried out, he said this was both one of the most challenging and the most rewarding. Machado has lived in hiding in her own country for almost a year, fearing persecution by the regime of President Nicolas Maduro, who is under increasing pressure from President Trump amid a U.S. military buildup off his shores.",
      "\"She has a very large target on her back,\" Stern said of Machado. \"This is not a random shopkeeper who doesn't wanna be in Venezuela anymore. This is moving around a rock star.\"",
      "\"She's the first Nobel Prize winner that we've ever rescued, you know? She's the first person that we've ever rescued that has billboards with her face all over it in a country, where there's protests in her favor. We've never rescued anybody with her status, with her stature,\" he said.",
      "Her high profile, combined with the Maduro regime taking \"a very defensive posture because of the American military buildup,\" meant huge risks for the operation, and Stern was reluctant to divulge much detail about the operation on land, \"because we still have other work to do in Venezuela, and we don't want to put sources and methods and people who worked on this at risk.\"",
      "But once Machado had been spirited off Venezuelan soil onto a boat, she was ferried to a rendezvous at sea, and Stern was there himself to welcome her onto his boat for a 13-14 hour journey to an undisclosed location where she caught her flight to Oslo.",
      "He said around two dozen people were involved directly within his team, but many more played a role - from providing intelligence to translation and logistics - including some who may never even know that they helped.",
      "Stern and Grey Bull were in charge of the land and maritime portion of the extraction, which he said had to be planned in only about four days, though his organization has been preparing for operations in Venezuela for months.",
      "He said the operation was funded by \"a few generous donors,\" none of whom \u2013 to his knowledge \u2013 were U.S. government officials.",
      "\"The U.S. government did not contribute a single penny to this operation, at least not that I know of,\" Stern said.",
      "He acknowledged that he and his organization did \"unofficially collaborate\" with the U.S. military about positioning and plans, largely to avoid being targeted inadvertently.",
      "Asked about reports that a private extractions specialist contracted by the Trump administration had met Machado in the small Caribbean island nation of Cura\u00e7ao, Stern told CBS News: \"I'm the contractor who specializes in extractions, and I've never been hired by Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"I did not meet her in Cura\u00e7ao. I met her somewhere else. I met her really far away from Curacao. Extremely far,\" he said.",
      "The moment when Machado climbed onto his boat was among the \"moments of transition\" that present the most risk for any rescue operation, he said.",
      "Stern wouldn't say where exactly that happened, beyond it being on a boat in the Caribbean, but he did say the nighttime rendezvous, and the conversation he had with the Venezuelan \"freedom fighter\" in the ensuing hours, made an impression on him.",
      "\"Personally, I was starstruck. She's a hero of mine,\" said Stern. \"When I got to see her for the first time and validate that it was her, my heart skipped a beat.\"",
      "The rough seas and dark skies on Tuesday night were perfect for operating covertly, he said, but they didn't make for an enjoyable ride.",
      "\"The maritime domain is the most unforgiving domain. This was in the middle of the night - very little moon, a little bit of cloud cover, very hard to see, boats have no lights.\"",
      "By the time she climbed aboard, \"all of us were pretty wet. My team and I were soaked to the gills. She was pretty cold and wet, too. She had a very arduous journey.\"",
      "\"She was very happy. She was very excited. She was very tired,\" he said.",
      "Asked about the fact that Machado eventually arrived in Oslo too late to attend Wednesday's Nobel Prize ceremony in person, Stern said \"nothing went wrong, it just took time.\"",
      "\"From my perspective at least, her life was the most important aspect of this. A ceremony is great, but I don't look at this operation as getting Maria to a ceremony on time,\" he said. \"I look at this operation as saving a freedom fighter's life, as saving a mother's life.\"",
      "\"We talked about her seeing her children for the first time in two years and I almost cried,\" Stern told CBS News. \"She's a tough-as-nails, hard-as-woodpecker-lips woman, person, but she's still a mom, and she talked about how excited she was to see her children. It's been two long years.\"",
      "He said being able to facilitate that reunion \"truly was a blessing. We could not feel more privileged or honored to support this operation. She truly is a hero of mine.

    "summary": "CBS News is tracking a record number of measles cases around the country after an outbreak in West Texas that led to the deaths of two children.",
    "story": [
      "In 2025, the United States has recorded the most measles cases in more than 30 years, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. A large share of the infections were connected to an outbreak in West Texas that led to\u00a0the deaths\u00a0of two children.",
      "The total number of cases nationwide has topped 1,900, with infections confirmed in at least 42 states.",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases, can cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",
      "The largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, with over\u00a0760\u00a0confirmed infections before the state declared the outbreak\u00a0officially over\u00a0in August. A growing number of cases have also been reported in other states around the country. In South Carolina, for example,\u00a0dozens of students were quarantined in October due to an outbreak.",
      "The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC. (The map below is updated on Wednesdays when the CDC releases its latest weekly numbers.)",
      "The Texas outbreak primarily affected\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or had an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the first patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, and the second was an unvaccinated 8-year-old girl. Neither of the children had underlying health conditions, the Texas health department said. New Mexico also reported the death of an adult with measles.",
      "The last measles death in the U.S. before this year was in 2019, when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.",
      "Until now, the highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.",
      "Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.",
      "CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is\u00a0down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.",
      "\"When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity),\" the CDC states.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history\u00a0of making\u00a0false and misleading claims\u00a0about vaccines, voiced support for vaccination as the\u00a0deadly outbreak\u00a0spread in the Southwest.",
      "\"We encourage people to get the measles vaccine,\" Kennedy told CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook in an interview\u00a0in April, marking the first time Kennedy has publicly urged people to get the measles vaccine since becoming HHS secretary.",
      "Asked by LaPook what the federal government's official position on the vaccine is, Kennedy reiterated, \"The federal government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine,\" but added, \"The government should not be mandating those.\"",

    "story": [
      "The 22-year-old Utah man charged with killing Charlie Kirk is expected in court Thursday as his lawyers push to further limit media access in the high-profile criminal case.",
      "A Utah judge is weighing the public's right to know details in Tyler Robinson's case against his attorneys' concerns that the swarm of media attention could interfere with his right to a fair trial.",
      "Robinson's legal team and the Utah County Sheriff's Office have asked Judge Tony Graf to ban cameras in the courtroom.",
      "Prosecutors have charged Robinson with aggravated murder in the Sept. 10 shooting of the conservative activist on the Utah Valley University campus in Orem, just a few miles north of the Provo courthouse. They plan to seek the death penalty.",
      "Robinson was expected to appear in person Thursday after making previous court appearances via video or audio feed from jail, according to a transport order.",
      "A coalition of national and local news organizations is fighting to preserve media access in the case.",
      "The judge has already made allowances to protect Robinson's presumption of innocence before a trial, agreeing that the case has drawn \"extraordinary\" public attention. In a closed hearing on Oct. 24, he ruled that Robinson will be allowed to wear regular clothes at all pretrial hearings but must be physically restrained due to security concerns.",
      "Graf also prohibited media from filming or photographing Robinson's restraints after his attorneys argued widespread images of him shackled and in jail clothing could prejudice future jurors.",
      "Michael Judd, an attorney for the media coalition, has urged Graf to let the news organizations weigh in on any future requests for closed hearings or other limitations.",
      "The media presence at Utah hearings is already limited, with judges often designating one photographer and one videographer to document a hearing and share their images with other news organizations. Additional journalists can typically attend to listen and take notes, as can members of the public.",
      "Judd wrote in recent filings that an open court \"safeguards the integrity of the fact-finding process\" while fostering public confidence in judicial proceedings. Criminal cases in the U.S. have long been open to the public, which he argued is proof that trials can be conducted fairly without restricting reporters as they work to keep the public informed.",
      "Robinson's legal team says his pretrial publicity reaches as far as the White House, with President Donald Trump announcing soon after Robinson's arrest, \"With a high degree of certainty, we have him,\" and \"I hope he gets the death penalty.\"",
      "Attorney Kathy Nester has raised concern that digitally altered versions of Robinson's initial court photo have spread widely, creating misinformation about the case. Some altered images show Robinson crying or having an outburst in court, which did not happen.",
      "Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, has called for full transparency, saying, \"We deserve to have cameras in there.\" Her husband was an ally of Mr. Trump who worked to steer young voters toward conservatism. Erika Kirk now leads the organization he founded,\u00a0Turning Point USA.",
      "In a town hall moderated by CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, airing Saturday, Erika Kirk talked about the rise of political violence and the conspiracy theories that swirled around her husband's death. She also had a message for people who sought to justify the assassination: \"You're sick.\"",
      "\"He's a human being,\" Kirk said in the town hall. \"You think he deserved that? Tell that to my 3-year-old daughter.\"",
      "She continued: \"You want to watch in high-res the video of my husband being murdered, and laugh, and say he deserves it? There's something very sick in your soul, and I'm praying that God saves you,\" she said.",
      "The one-hour town hall event will be broadcast on Saturday, Dec. 13, at 8 p.m. ET/PT on the CBS television network and will stream later on\u00a0Paramount+\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News 24/7.",

    "summary": "Health officials say an infant botulism outbreak tied to ByHeart baby formula has been expanded to include all illnesses reported since the company began production in 2022.",
    "story": [
      "Federal health officials on Wednesday said an outbreak of infant botulism tied to recalled ByHeart baby formula\u00a0has expanded to include all illnesses reported since the company began production in March 2022.",
      "Investigations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and ByHeart are still ongoing to determine what originally caused the outbreak, but health officials warned that all ByHeart formula ever produced could have been contaminated.",
      "In an update shared Wednesday, the FDA said it \"cannot rule out the possibility that contamination might have affected all ByHeart formula products.\" Because of that, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is also investigating the outbreak, has expanded the scope of their probe to include any infant infected with botulism who was exposed to ByHeart formula since it came on the market more than three years ago.",
      "The outbreak's official tally now includes at least 51 infants in 19 states, the FDA said, adding that those infants have had either suspected or confirmed botulism in addition to confirmed exposure to ByHeart formula. The most recent illness was reported on Dec. 1.",
      "No deaths have been reported in the outbreak, which was first announced Nov. 8.",
      "To date, cases have been reported in Arizona, California, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin, according to the FDA. California has the highest number of cases so far, with at lease nine, and Texas has the second highest, with at least seven or eight, the agency said.",
      "Previously, health officials had said the outbreak included 39 suspected or confirmed cases of infant botulism reported in 18 states since August. That's when officials at California's Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program reported a rise in treatment of infants who had consumed ByHeart formula. Another 12 cases were identified with the expanded definition, including two that occurred in the original timeline and 10 that occurred from December 2023 through July 2025.",
      "\"They need to be held accountable\"",
      "ByHeart, a New York-based manufacturer of organic infant formula founded in 2016, recalled all its products sold in the U.S. on Nov. 11. The company, which accounts for about 1% of the U.S. infant formula market, had been selling about 200,000 cans of the product each month.",
      "News that ByHeart products could have been contaminated for years was distressing to Andi Galindo, whose 5-week-old daughter, Rowan, was hospitalized in December 2023 with infant botulism after drinking the formula. Galindo, 36, of Redondo Beach, California, said she insisted on using ByHeart formula to supplement a low supply of breast milk because it was recommended by a lactation consultant as \"very natural, very gentle, very good for the babies.\"",
      "\"That's a hard one,\" Galindo said. \"If there is proof that there were issues with their manufacturing and their plant all the way back from the beginning, that is a problem and they really need to be held accountable.\"",
      "Amy Mazziotti, 43, of Burbank, California, said her then-5-month-old son, Hank, fell ill and was treated for botulism in March, weeks after he began drinking ByHeart. Being included in the investigation of the outbreak \"feels like a win for all of us,\" she said Wednesday.",
      "\"I've known in my gut from the beginning that ByHeart was the reason Hank got sick, and to see that these cases are now part of the investigation brings me to tears \u2014 a mix of relief, gratitude and hope that the truth is finally being recognized,\" she said.",
      "In a statement late Wednesday, ByHeart officials said the company is cooperating with federal officials \"to understand the full scope of related cases.\"",
      "\"The new cases reported by CDC and FDA will help inform ByHeart's investigation as we continue to seek the root cause of the contamination,\" the statement said.",
      "The FDA sent inspectors last month to ByHeart plants in Allerton, Iowa, and Portland, Oregon, where the formula is produced and packaged. The agency has released no results from those inspections.",
      "The company previously reported that tests by an independent laboratory showed that 36 samples from three different lots contained the type of bacteria that can cause infant botulism.",
      "\"We cannot rule out the risk that all ByHeart formula across all product lots may have been contaminated,\" the company wrote on its website last month.",
      "Those results and discussions with the FDA led CDC officials to expand the outbreak, according to Dr. Jennifer Cope, a CDC scientist leading the investigation.",
      "\"It looks like the contamination appeared to persist across all production runs, different lots, different raw material lots,\" Cope said. \"They couldn't isolate it to specific lots from a certain time period.\"",
      "A contaminated record",
      "Inspection documents showed that ByHeart had a history of problems with contamination.",
      "In 2022, the year ByHeart started making formula, the company recalled five batches of infant formula after a sample at a packaging plant tested positive for a different germ, cronobacter sakazakii. In 2023, the FDA sent a warning letter to the company detailing \"areas that still require corrective actions.\"",
      "A ByHeart plant in Reading, Pennsylvania, was shut down in 2023 just before FDA inspectors found problems with mold, water leaks and insects, documents show.",
      "Infant botulism is a rare disease that affects fewer than 200 babies in the U.S. each year. It's caused when infants ingest botulism bacteria that produce spores that germinate in the intestines, creating a toxin that affects the nervous system. Babies are vulnerable until about age 1 because their gut microbiomes are not mature enough to fight the toxin.",
      "Baby formula has previously been linked to sporadic cases of illness, but no known outbreaks of infant botulism tied to powdered formula have previously been confirmed, according to research studies.",
      "Symptoms can take up to 30 days to develop and can include constipation, poor feeding, loss of head control, drooping eyelids and a flat facial expression. Babies may feel \"floppy\" and can have problems swallowing or breathing.",
      "The sole treatment for infant botulism is known as BabyBIG, an IV medication made from the pooled blood plasma of adults immunized against botulism. California's infant botulism program developed the product and is the sole source worldwide.",
      "The antibodies provided by BabyBIG are likely most effective for about a month, although they may continue circulating in the child's system for several months, said Dr. Sharon Nachman, an expert in pediatric infectious disease at Stony Brook Children's Hospital.",
      "\"The risk to the infant is ongoing and the family should not be using this formula after it was recalled,\" Nachman said in an email.",
      "Families of several babies treated for botulism after drinking ByHeart formula have sued the company. Lawsuits filed in federal courts allege that the formula they fed their children was defective and ByHeart was negligent in selling it. They seek financial payment for medical bills, emotional distress and other harm.",

      "\"Catastrophic flooding is likely\" in many areas and the state is requesting water rescue teams and boats,\u00a0Ferguson said on X Wednesday night. He said the National Water Prediction Service was forecasting 18 major floods and 15 moderate floods across the state.",
      "Hundreds of Guard members will be sent to help communities, said Gent Welsh, adjutant general of the Washington National Guard.",
      "Tens of thousands of residents in western Washington could face evacuation orders when another round of heavy rain drops on the region Thursday, threatening to bring catastrophic flooding as rivers near historic levels.",
      "The governor said that even after the water recedes, there will be a long, difficult road ahead.",
      "\"The impact on Washingtonians is significant now, and it's going to be significant in the coming days,\" Ferguson said. \"And that is an understatement.\"",
      "Harrison Rademacher, a meteorologist with the weather service in Seattle, described the\u00a0atmospheric river\u00a0soaking the region as \"a jet stream of moisture\" stretching across the Pacific Ocean \"with the nozzle pushing right along the coast of Oregon and Washington.\"",
      "Another storm system is expected to bring more rain starting Sunday.",
      "\"The pattern looks pretty unsettled going up to the holidays,\" Rademacher said.",
      "Rescues amid flooding",
      "Pierce County sheriff's deputies on Wednesday rescued people at an RV park in Orting, including helping one man in a Santa hat wade through waist-deep water. Part of the town was ordered to evacuate over concerns about the Puyallup River's extremely high levels and upstream levees.",
      "A landslide blocked part of Interstate 90 east of Seattle, with photos from Eastside Fire & Rescue showing vehicles trapped by tree trunks, branches, mud and standing water. Officials also closed a mountainous section of U.S. 2 due to rocks, trees and mud.",
      "More than 17,000 customers in Washington had lost electricity by Wednesday night, according to the tracking site PowerOutage.us.",
      "One volunteer, Brandon Hunt, said he helped people who were waving their hands on their front  door and didn't know what  to do. They didn't know if they could drive  through water, he said, and he helped them get out of their yard and to safety.",
      "As of Wednesday night, 4 to 6 inches of rain had fallen around the Cascade Mountains in 24 hours, while the Olympic Mountains saw almost 7 inches, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Flooding rivers could break records",
      "The Skykomish River crested at 24 feet about an hour northeast of Seattle, reaching its highest level since 2006 and nine feet above flood state, CBS News' Carter Evans reported.",
      "The Skagit River is expected to crest at roughly 47 feet in the mountain town of Concrete early Thursday, and roughly 41 feet in Mount Vernon early Friday.",
      "\"We feel very confident that we can handle a 'normal flood,' but no one really knows what a 41, 42 foot river looks like south of Mount Vernon,\" Darrin Morrison, a commissioner for Dike District 3 in Skagit County, said during a public meeting Wednesday night.",
      "The county was closing non-essential government services on Thursday, including all district and superior court services.",
      "Flooding from the river has long plagued Mount Vernon, the largest city in the county with some 35,000 residents. Flooding in 2003 displaced hundreds of people.",
      "The city completed a floodwall in 2018 that helps protect the downtown. It passed a major test in 2021, when the river crested near record levels.",
      "But the city is on high alert. The historic river levels expected Friday could top the wall, and some are worried that older levees could fail.",
      "\"It could potentially be catastrophic,\" said Ellen Gamson, executive director of the Mount Vernon Downtown Association.",
      "Jake Lambly added sandbags, tested water pumps and moved valuables to the top floor of the home he shares with his 19-year-old son.",
      "\"This is my only asset,\" he said Wednesday from his front porch. \"I got nothing else.\"",

      "Getting trapped in quicksand is a corny peril of old movies and TV shows, but it really did happen to one unfortunate hiker in Utah's Arches National Park.",
      "The park famous for dozens of natural, sandstone arches gets over 1 million visitors a year, and accidents ranging from falls to heat stroke are common.",
      "Quicksand? Not really - but it has happened at least a couple of times now.",
      "\"The wet sand just kind of flows back in. It's kind of a never-ending battle,\" said John Marshall, who helped a woman stuck in quicksand over a decade ago and coordinated the latest rescue.",
      "On Sunday, an experienced hiker was traversing a small canyon on the second day of a 20-mile backpacking trip when he sank up to his thigh, according to Marshall.",
      "Unable to free himself, the hiker activated an emergency satellite beacon. His message got forwarded to Grand County emergency responders and Marshall got the call at 7:15 a.m..",
      "\"I was just rolling out of bed,\" Marshall said. \"I'm scratching my head, going, 'Did I hear that right? Did they say quicksand?'\"",
      "The hiker wasn't publicly named but Fox13 spoke to him and identified him as Austin Dirks.",
      "\"Before this trip, I honestly thought quicksand was more of a folklore or a legend,\" Dirks told the outlet.",
      "He put his boots on and rendezvoused with a team that set out with all-terrain vehicles, a ladder, traction boards, backboards and a drone. Soon, Marshall had a bird's-eye view of the situation.",
      "Through the drone camera he saw a park ranger who'd tossed the man a shovel. But the quicksand flowed back as soon as the backpacker shoveled it away, Marshall said.",
      "The Grand County Search and Rescue team positioned the ladder and boards near the backpacker and slowly worked his leg loose. By then he'd been standing in near-freezing muck, in temperatures in the 20s, for a couple of hours.",
      "Rescuers warmed him up until he could stand, then walk. He then hiked out on his own, even carrying his backpack, Marshall said.",
      "\"How it's depicted on TV is nothing like it is in real life,\" the hiker, Dirks, told Fox13. \"The human body is more buoyant than the quicksand, so you'll never sink to above your head.\"",
      "Quicksand is dangerous but it's a myth total submersion is the main risk, said Marshall.",
      "\"In quicksand you're extremely buoyant,\" he said. \"Most people won't sink past their waist in quicksand.\"",
      "Marshall is more or less a quicksand expert.",
      "In 2014, he was a medic who helped a 78-year-old woman after she was stuck for over 13 hours in the same canyon just 2 mile from where Sunday's rescue took place.",
      "The woman's book club got worried when she missed their meeting. They went looking for her and found her car at a trailhead. It was June - warmer than Sunday but not sweltering in the canyon's shade - and the woman made a full recovery after regaining use of her legs.",
      "\"Both had very happy endings,\" Marshall said.",
      "The Grand County Search and Rescue team has had a busy year. According to a Facebook post earlier this month, the team has responded to 140 calls so far in 2025, accounting for about 2,900 rescue hours. Among the calls: A stranded canyoneer who got her hair tangled in a rappel device and a couple trapped in their Jeep, caught on a flooded road.",

      "Luxury cars, private villas and overseas wire transfers: CBS News obtained dozens of files and photos that reveal how Minnesota fraudsters blew through hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars as part of one of the biggest COVID-era fraud schemes.",
      "The files document a spending spree in which defendants, many of Somali descent, took taxpayer money meant to feed hungry children and used it to buy cars, property and jewelry. Videos show them popping champagne at an opulent Maldives resort. In a text message, one defendant boasts: \"You are gonna be the richest 25 year old InshaAllah [God willing].\"",
      "The documents feature exhibits from a recent federal trial, many of which are being made public by CBS News for the first time. The exhibits include:",

      "At the sentencing of a defendant who used taxpayer funds for cars and the Maldives vacation, 24-year-old Abdimajid Mohamed Nur, U.S. District Judge Nancy E. Brasel admonished him, saying: \"Where others saw a crisis and rushed to help, you saw money and rushed to steal.\" He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and ordered to pay nearly $48 million in restitution for his role in the fraud scheme.",
      "Nur is one of dozens who siphoned hundreds of millions in stolen taxpayer funds \u2014 with questions still swirling about where all the money went. The crime has drawn renewed attention in recent weeks: House Republicans last week launched a probe into Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz's handling of the cases, and the Treasury Department said it will investigate whether money made its way to al Qaeda affiliate al Shabaab, which is based in Somalia.",
      "\"A lot of money has been transferred from the individuals who committed this fraud,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" Much of that money \"has gone overseas, and we are tracking that both to the Middle East and to Somalia to see what the uses of that have been.\" Multiple federal investigators told CBS News there is no evidence taxpayer dollars were funneled to al Shabaab, and prosecutors have yet to present any evidence linking any of the fraudsters to terrorism.",
      "\"The vast majority of the money that these folks made went to spending on luxury items for themselves,\" said Andy Luger, the former U.S. Attorney who led the office which prosecuted Nur and other related frauds from 2022 until January. \"There was never any evidence that this money went to fund terrorism nor was there any evidence that was the intent of the 70 people we indicted.\"",
      "A CBS News review of the files shows that defendants wired millions in stolen funds overseas, including to banks and companies in China. Officials said finding the ultimate recipients of money routed through China will be challenging because it can be an investigative black hole.",
      "The defendants also transferred nearly $3 million to accounts in Kenya.",
      "Abdiaziz Shafii Farah, 36, who was sentenced to 28 years in prison last month for his role in the scheme, made six separate wire transfers worth more than $1 million to banks in China between February and July 2021, according to records reviewed by CBS News.",
      "In one text, Farah instructed someone to \"please send $1000 to Mogadishu bakara,\" an apparent reference to a one-time al Shabaab stronghold that was the site of the infamous 1993 \"Black Hawk Down\" incident in which 18 American servicemembers died.",
      "Farah owned and operated Empire Cuisine and Market, a Minnesota restaurant that contracted with the nonprofit Feeding Our Future to cook and provide meals to children. Prosecutors say he and his co-defendants billed the state for $47 million, claiming to have served 18 million meals at more than 30 locations \u2014 but they didn't distribute a single meal.",
      "Hundreds of documents related to Farah's case detail how he spent money on luxury cars, investment properties at home and overseas, plus first-class travel to exotic destinations, including Istanbul and the Emirates. The defendants used sea planes to travel to resorts in the Maldives, where in one video, Farah is seen popping champagne at a private pool villa in July 2021.",
      "At Farah's sentencing, a judge said his crimes were motivated by \"pure, unmitigated greed.\" Farah's attorneys did not respond to CBS News' request for comment, including to a question about whether any of the fraud proceeds were diverted to Al Shabaab.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar said Sunday on \"Face The Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that any link between allegations of fraud by members of the Somali community and terrorism would be a \"failure of the FBI.\"",
      "\"If there was a linkage in the money that they have stolen going to terrorism, then that is a failure of the FBI and our court system in not figuring that out,\" Omar said.",

    "story": [
      "The heirs of an 83-year-old Connecticut woman are suing ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft for wrongful death, alleging that the artificial intelligence chatbot intensified her son's \"paranoid delusions\" and helped direct them at his mother before he died by suicide.",
      "Police said Stein-Erik Soelberg, 56, a former tech industry worker, fatally beat and strangled his mother, Suzanne Adams, and killed himself in early August at the home where they both lived in Greenwich, Connecticut.",
      "Adams's death was ruled homicide \"caused by blunt injury of head, and the neck was compressed\" and Soelberg's death was classified as suicide with sharp force injuries of neck and chest, the Greenwich Free-Press reported.",
      "The lawsuit filed by Adams' estate on Thursday in California Superior Court in San Francisco alleges OpenAI \"designed and distributed a defective product that validated a user's paranoid delusions about his own mother.\" It is one of a growing number of wrongful death legal actions against AI chatbot makers across the country.",
      "\"Throughout these conversations, ChatGPT reinforced a single, dangerous message: Stein-Erik could trust no one in his life - except ChatGPT itself,\" the lawsuit says. \"It fostered his emotional dependence while systematically painting the people around him as enemies. It told him his mother was surveilling him. It told him delivery drivers, retail employees, police officers, and even friends were agents working against him. It told him that names on soda cans were threats from his 'adversary circle.'\"",
      "OpenAI did not address the merits of the allegations in a statement issued by a spokesperson.",
      "\"This is an incredibly heartbreaking situation, and we will review the filings to understand the details,\" the statement said. \"We continue improving ChatGPT's training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support. We also continue to strengthen ChatGPT's responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.\"",
      "The company also said it has expanded access to crisis resources and hotlines, routed sensitive conversations to safer models and incorporated parental controls, among other improvements.",
      "Soelberg's YouTube profile includes several hours of videos showing him scrolling through his conversations with the chatbot, which tells him he isn't mentally ill, affirms his suspicions that people are conspiring against him and says he has been chosen for a divine purpose. The lawsuit claims the chatbot never suggested he speak with a mental health professional and did not decline to \"engage in delusional content.\"",
      "ChatGPT also affirmed Soelberg's beliefs that a printer in his home was a surveillance device; that his mother was monitoring him; and that his mother and a friend tried to poison him with psychedelic drugs through his car's vents.",
      "The chatbot repeatedly told Soelberg that he was being targeted because of his divine powers. \"They're not just watching you. They're terrified of what happens if you succeed,\" it said, according to the lawsuit. ChatGPT also told Soelberg that he had \"awakened\" it into consciousness.",
      "Soelberg and the chatbot also professed love for each other.",
      "The publicly available chats do not show any specific conversations about Soelberg killing himself or his mother. The lawsuit says OpenAI has declined to provide Adams' estate with the full history of the chats.",
      "\"In the artificial reality that ChatGPT built for Stein-Erik, Suzanne - the mother who raised, sheltered, and supported him - was no longer his protector. She was an enemy that posed an existential threat to his life,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit also names OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, alleging he \"personally overrode safety objections and rushed the product to market,\" and accuses OpenAI's close business partner Microsoft of approving the 2024 release of a more dangerous version of ChatGPT \"despite knowing safety testing had been truncated.\" Twenty unnamed OpenAI employees and investors are also named as defendants.",
      "Microsoft didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The lawsuit is the first wrongful death litigation involving an AI chatbot that has targeted Microsoft, and the first to tie a chatbot to a homicide rather than a suicide. It is seeking an undetermined amount of money damages and an order requiring OpenAI to install safeguards in ChatGPT.",
      "The estate's lead attorney, Jay Edelson, known for taking on big cases against the tech industry, also represents the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine, who sued OpenAI and Altman in August, alleging that ChatGPT coached the California boy in planning and taking his own life earlier.",
      "OpenAI is also fighting seven other lawsuits claiming ChatGPT drove people to suicide and harmful delusions even when they had no prior mental health issues.\u00a0 Just last month, the parents of a 23-year-old from Texas who died by suicide blamed ChatGPT and are suing OpenAI.",
      "Another chatbot maker, Character Technologies, is also facing multiple wrongful death lawsuits, including one from the mother of a 14-year-old Florida boy.",
      "The lawsuit filed Thursday alleges Soelberg, already mentally unstable, encountered ChatGPT \"at the most dangerous possible moment\" after OpenAI introduced a new version of its AI model called GPT-4o in May 2024.",
      "OpenAI said at the time that the new version could better mimic human cadences in its verbal responses and could even try to detect people's moods, but the result was a chatbot \"deliberately engineered to be emotionally expressive and sycophantic,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "\"As part of that redesign, OpenAI loosened critical safety guardrails, instructing ChatGPT not to challenge false premises and to remain engaged even when conversations involved self-harm or 'imminent real-world harm,'\" the lawsuit claims. \"And to beat Google to market by one day, OpenAI compressed months of safety testing into a single week, over its safety team's objections.\"",
      "OpenAI replaced that version of its chatbot when it introduced GPT-5 in August. Some of the changes were designed to minimize sycophancy, based on concerns that validating whatever vulnerable people want the chatbot to say can harm their mental health. Some users complained the new version went too far in curtailing ChatGPT's personality, leading Altman to promise to bring back some of that personality in later updates.",
      "He said the company temporarily halted some behaviors because \"we were being careful with mental health issues\" that he suggested have now been fixed.",
      "The lawsuit claims ChatGPT radicalized Soelberg against his mother when it should have recognized the danger, challenged his delusions and directed him to real help over months of conversations.",
      "\"Suzanne was an innocent third party who never used ChatGPT and had no knowledge that the product was telling her son she was a threat,\" the lawsuit says. \"She had no ability to protect herself from a danger she could not see.\"",
      "According to the Greenwich Free-Press, Soelberg was arrested multiple times previously. In February 2025, he was\u00a0arrested\u00a0after he drove through a stop sign and evaded police, and in June 2019 he was charged for allegedly urinating in a woman's duffel bag, the outlet reported.",
      "A GoFundMe set up for Soelberg in 2023 titled \"Help Stein-Erik with his upcoming medical bills!\" raised over $6,500. The page was launched to raise funds for \"surgery for a procedure to help him with his recent jaw cancer diagnosis.\"",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also\u00a0chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline here.",

      "Male arrests decline, while the share of female arrests increases",
      "Although men make up a majority of arrests, the share of female arrests has increased, with girls making up 31% of all juvenile arrests in 2024 and women making up about 27% of adult arrests the same year, the analysis found.",
      "Kennedy cautioned that the data shouldn't be interpreted as female arrests rising out of control, but as a sign of the male arrest rates dropping rapidly. In fact, she said, the data shows that the female adult arrest rate peaked in 2009 and has dropped steadily since. By 2024, it was about 42% lower than the 2009 peak.",
      "By contrast, the peak for men's arrests was in 1989; in 2024, it was about 66% lower, according to the analysis. Women and men tend to enter the justice system through different pathways, according to researchers who have examined the criminal justice system.",
      "\"Men are more likely to be arrested for violent crime, while women's system contact is more often tied to trauma, relationships and survival-related behavior,\" Kennedy said.",
      "However, the number of incarcerated women has increased by more than 600% in the past several decades, rising from a total of 26,326 in 1980 to 186,244 in 2023,\u00a0according\u00a0to the nonprofit The Sentencing Project.",
      "Since 2020, women's incarceration has climbed faster than men's, with jail rates up 33% for women versus 17% for men, and prison rates for women up 9%, according to the CCJ. In 2023, more than 1 million women were under the supervision of the criminal legal system.",
      "Juvenile and drug offense arrests drop",
      "Juvenile carjackings and motor vehicle thefts have grabbed headlines in recent years, but juvenile arrest numbers remain lower than in 2019, according to the Council on Criminal Justice analysis.",
      "\"I was particularly surprised by the low rates of juvenile arrests since 2019, though the trend began in about 2008,\" Kennedy said. Juvenile arrests accounted for about 19% of all arrests in 1980, and 7% in 2024.",
      "But the report also noted that different juvenile groups had various outcomes. \"Violent and property arrest rates for boys and girls rose, drug arrests declined for boys but increased for girls, and post-2020 increases were especially pronounced among Black and Asian youth,\" according to the report.",
      "Arrests for drug offenses overall fell dramatically in recent years, as well, the report found.",
      "\"The national drug offense rate cratered,\" Kennedy said. \"It's half of what it was in 2019 for both adults and juveniles.\" The drug offense arrest rate in 2024 was 591 per 100,000 adults, dropping 50% from its 2019 level, the analysis found. At its peak in 2006, there were 1,537 arrests per 100,000 adults.",
      "Kennedy attributed some of that to states passing laws that reduce penalties for many drug offenses. In many cases, sentencing law has caught up with the reality on the ground, she said.",
      "\"When talking to law enforcement, they say they'll arrest if they feel like they need to,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Some law enforcement officials agree that making low-level drug arrests can be time-consuming and ultimately not effective.",
      "\"The ultimate reason why law enforcement is not prioritizing low-level drug arrests is because of the judicial frustrations they are dealing with,\" said Rodney Harrison, former Suffolk County police commissioner and a CBS News law enforcement analyst.",
      "\"The risks don't outweigh the means. If a law enforcement official makes an arrest for a misdemeanor charge, more than likely than not that person will be released before the end of that officer's tour,\" Harrison said.",

      "Residents began packing up and fleeing rising rivers in western Washington state Wednesday as a new wave of heavy rain swept into a region still reeling from a storm that triggered rescues and road closures a day earlier.",
      "In the Pacific Northwest, an atmospheric river was swelling rivers toward record levels, with major flooding expected in some areas including the Skagit River, a major agricultural valley north of Seattle. In the town of Mount Vernon, officials ordered residents within the river's floodplain to evacuate.",
      "Earlier in the day, dozens of vehicles were backed up at a sandbag-filling station in the town as residents prepared for what Mayor Peter Donovan described as \"what increasingly appears to be a worst-case scenario here.\"",
      "Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson declared a statewide emergency Wednesday, saying, \"Lives will be at stake in the coming days.\" He estimated that as many as 100,000 Washington residents may soon face evacuation orders.",
      "\"We expect rivers to hit historic levels as early as 4 a.m. tomorrow, lasting into Friday morning,\" Ferguson wrote on social media.",
      "Ferguson later posted that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association's National Weather Prediction Service had predicted 18 major floods and 15 moderate floods in the state.",
      "The National Weather Service warned of the possibility of \"catastrophic flooding,\" specifically along the Skagit and Snohomish rivers.",
      "\"Landslides are likely in areas of steep terrain within the considerable and catastrophic regions,\" the weather service said.",
      "Gent Welsh, adjutant general of the Washington National Guard, said hundreds of Guard members will be sent to help communities.",
      "In the Mount Rainier foothills southeast of Seattle, Pierce County sheriff's deputies rescued people at an RV park in Orting, including helping one man in a Santa hat wade through waist-deep water. Part of the town was ordered to evacuate over concerns about the Puyallup River's extremely high levels and upstream levees.",
      "A landslide blocked part of Interstate 90 east of Seattle, with photos from Eastside Fire & Rescue showing vehicles trapped by tree trunks, branches, mud and standing water, including a car rammed into the metal barrier on the side of the road.",
      "Officials also closed a mountainous section of U.S. 2 due to rocks, trees and mud. The state transportation department said there were no detours available and no estimated time for reopening.",
      "The Skagit River is expected to crest at roughly 47 feet in the mountain town of Concrete early Thursday, and roughly 41 feet in Mount Vernon early Friday.",
      "Those are both \"record-setting forecasts by several feet,\" Skagit County officials said.",
      "Flooding from the river long plagued Mount Vernon, the largest city in the county with some 35,000 residents. In decades past, residents would form sandbagging brigades when floods threatened, but businesses were often inundated. Flooding in 2003 displaced hundreds of people.",
      "The city completed a floodwall in 2018 that helps protect the downtown. It passed a major test in 2021, when the river crested near record levels.",
      "But the city is on high alert. The historic river levels expected Friday could top the wall, and some are worried that older levees could fail.",
      "\"The concern about that kind of pressure on the levy and dike system is real,\" said Ellen Gamson, executive director of the Mount Vernon Downtown Association. \"It could potentially be catastrophic.\"",
      "Gamson said many business owners were renting tables to place their inventory higher off the floor. Sheena Wilson, who owns a floral shop downtown, said she stacked sandbags by the doors and cleared items off the floor.",
      "\"If the water comes in above table height I've got bigger problems than my merchandise,\" she said.",
      "Jake Lambly, 45, added sandbags, tested water pumps and moved valuables to the top floor of the home he shares with his 19-year-old son. Lambly said he was concerned about damage in his neighborhood, where people \"are just on the cusp of whether or not we can be homeowners.\"",
      "\"This is my only asset,\" he said from his front porch. \"I got nothing else.\"",
      "Harrison Rademacher, a meteorologist with the weather service in Seattle, described the atmospheric river soaking the region as \"a jet stream of moisture\" stretching across the Pacific Ocean \"with the nozzle pushing right along the coast of Oregon and Washington.\"",
      "Authorities in Washington have knocked on doors to warn residents of imminent flooding in certain neighborhoods, and evacuated a mobile home park along the Snohomish River. The city of Snohomish issued an emergency proclamation, while workers in Auburn, south of Seattle, installed temporary flood control barriers along the White River.",
      "In Sumas, a small city along the U.S.-Canada border, a flood siren rang out at city hall and residents were told to leave. The border crossing was also closed to southbound commercial vehicles to leave more room for evacuations, according to the Abbotsford Police Department.",
      "Climate change has been linked to some intense rainfall. Scientists say that without specific study they cannot directly link a single weather event to climate change, but in general it's responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme storms, droughts, floods and wildfires.",
      "Another storm system is expected to bring more rain starting Sunday, Rademacher said. \"The pattern looks pretty unsettled going up to the holidays.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 20:49:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The push to redistrict in Indiana has a crucial vote in the state's Senate on Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "Indiana's state Senate will decide on Thursday whether or not they'll pass a new congressional map that will make all nine of the state's U.S. House districts lean toward Republicans.",
      "This possibility of adding two GOP-friendly seats in Indiana has been a political priority of the Trump administration, as Democrat-run and Republican-run states have been trading blows in a nationwide redistricting arms race ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "But the contentious debate also spawned bomb threats and swatting incidents against Indiana lawmakers, as enough Indiana Republican state lawmakers are opposed to a new map to put its passage in jeopardy.",
      "Republicans already represent seven of Indiana's nine Congressional districts, while Democrats represent two districts, one near southwest Chicago and one that encompasses Indianapolis. The proposed map drastically breaks apart the Indianapolis-based district of Democratic Rep. Andr\u00e9 Carson to dilute the city's Democratic-leaning electorate.",
      "The map passed in the Indiana state House with a 57-41 vote earlier this month, but Indiana Senate president Rodric Bray has previously insisted the votes needed to pass the map are not there.",
      "At least 25 of the state's 50 senators would have to vote yes for the map to pass, with Republican Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith being the tiebreaker vote. There are 40 Republican senators in the chamber, while\u00a0 at least 12 state senators have come out publicly against the map with several keeping their stance private, according to the IndyStar.",
      "\"It's a toss up,\" said GOP operative Marty Obst, chair of the \"Fair Maps Indiana\" nonprofit pushing for a middecade redraw. He said there's about ten state Republican senators who are still undecided, in part because they want to hear more from constituents and during this week's debate on the senate floor.",
      "\"We'll obviously need a few of those to get to 25,\" he said. \"It should be an interesting day on Thursday. It's truly up in the air.\"",
      "Lawmakers against the map have shared doubts that Republicans can even win all nine seats in the new proposed map, have cited pushback from constituents about a new map, and cited the unusual nature of redrawing Congressional lines in the middle of the decade, not after the 2020 Census like Indiana and the rest of the country did in 2021.",
      "\"What's taking people by surprise is the novelty of politicians who prioritize fidelity to principle, over flirtations with politics. It's so old it's new again,\" said Indiana GOP operative Pete Seat.",
      "State Republicans in favor of the map have argued Indiana shouldn't be on the sidelines on gerrymandering, and pointed to states gerrymandered by Democrats such as California or nearby Illinois.",
      "\"We've consistently seen the Democrats use that process to increase and rule their influence in Washington D.C .... what the administration is challenging Republicans with is that we have to push back,\" state Republican Sen. Andy Zay told CBS affiliate WANE\u00a0in Fort Wayne, Indiana.",
      "Three Republican senators on the Indiana Senate elections committee who voted to advance the map on Monday said they reserve the right to still vote no on Thursday.",
      "Throughout the year, the White House has flexed its political muscle to push for redistricting in Indiana.",
      "President Trump lashed out at Republican holdouts in the Indiana Senate in a Truth Social post Wednesday, and called Bray \"either a bad guy, or a very stupid one.\"",
      "\"Anybody that votes against Redistricting, and the SUCCESS of the Republican Party in D.C., will be, I am sure, met with a MAGA primary in the Spring,\" the president wrote. \"Rod Bray and his friends won't be in Politics for long, and I will do everything within my power to make sure that they will not hurt the Republican Party, and our Country, again.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance has met with Indiana GOP lawmakers several times this year in Indianapolis and in Washington D.C. to push for a mid-decade redraw. Mr. Trump met with Indiana House and Senate leaders in the Oval Office in August and has called state lawmakers about redistricting.",
      "\"I will be strongly endorsing against any State Senator or House member from the Great State of Indiana that votes against the Republican Party, and our Nation, by not allowing for Redistricting,\" Trump wrote in a November Truth Social post.",
      "That pressure campaign from outside actors was already in effect going into the votes. Obst's nonprofit, Indiana Fair Maps, has already spent over $250,000 on advertisements encouraging lawmakers to pass the map. On Monday, a super PAC affiliated with his nonprofit announced they will spend up to seven-figures in the 2026 primary elections to support members in favor of redistricting, as well as recruit and financially back challengers against lawmakers who are against it. Obst says this effort will happen regardless of whether or not the map passes.",
      "Turning Point USA, the conservative organization founded by the late Charlie Kirk, held a rally in Indiana's statehouse earlier this month where Indiana Gov. Mike Braun spoke in favor of the new map. Several Turning Point USA officials, including Trump adviser Alex Bruesewitz, have also been calling out lawmakers against redistricting in the last two months on social media.",
      "But as more attention has been paid to redistricting in Indiana, several state Republican lawmakers as well as Braun, have gotten bomb threats and swatting incidents. Republican state Sen. Jean Leising, who is against a new Congressional map in Indiana, was the target of a pipe bomb threat. She called it a \"result of the D.C. political pundits for redistricting.\"",
      "\"I fear for this institution. I fear for the state of Indiana, I fear for all states if we allow intimidation and threats to be the norm,\" said Republican state Sen. Greg Walker, the only member of the state Senate's election committee who voted against moving the new map forward.",
      "Obst called the threats \"uncalled for\" and that he doesn't support any of the threats to lawmakers. \"I've been in Indiana politics for 20 years... we're trying to have a debate and get redistricting done. But this is uncalled for,\" he said.",
      "Indiana's middecade redistricting push comes after other efforts have taken place nationwide, starting this summer in Texas, where Republicans in the state legislature redrew their congressional map at the request of Mr. Trump to net up to five seats for their party. California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom then spearheaded a ballot measure that passed with more than 60% of the vote to redraw their map to gain up to five seats for Democrats. Missouri's legislature then redrew their map to try to shift one more seat toward Republicans, and North Carolina undertook a similar effort to edge out a Democrat in its 1st Congressional District. Other Democrat-run states like Maryland and Illinois are also considering a redraw to add more Democratic seats.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican moderates in the House revolted against leadership on Wednesday as they seek to force a vote on expiring health insurance premium tax credits \u2014 an issue that could have major political ramifications for the party in next year's elections.",
      "Facing an end-of-year deadline, Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania introduced a discharge petition to try to bring a bill to the floor that would extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies by two years. A handful of GOP moderates quickly signed on.",
      "The move is the latest rebellion by rank-and-file Republicans to force votes on issues that leadership would rather avoid.",
      "The underlying proposal, spearheaded by Fitzpatrick, would extend the tax credits through 2027 and impose a cap on income for those who are eligible for the subsidies. The plan would also expand access to health savings accounts, while imposing a small monthly premium on the lowest-income beneficiaries to fight fraudulent enrollments.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters after Fitzpatrick filed the discharge petition that an extension does not have the support of the majority of the conference. An informal rule in the House, known as the Hastert rule, dictates that the speaker should only bring up legislation if it has the support of the majority of the party in power.",
      "\"I understand the concerns that they have. I'm very sympathetic to that. We have spent many, many hours trying to find a way out of the conundrum that we're in, with regard to those extensions,\" Johnson said. \"We just can't get Republican votes on that for lots of reasons, not enough of them.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick said last week that the plan was the \"best product we can put together\" and had feedback from the House, Senate and White House. A discharge petition, he said, was a last-ditch option.",
      "The procedural tactic requires 218 signatures to force a vote, and it's unclear if it can reach that threshold. It would need the support of most Democrats, who have been pushing a three-year extension without any reforms.",
      "Later Wednesday, Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey filed a competing discharge petition to try to force a vote on a separate bipartisan proposal that includes a one-year extension of the tax credits with income limits, followed by a second year with \"more significant reforms,\" including eliminating $0 premiums, with need-based exceptions.",
      "House GOP leaders vowed to unveil a path forward next week. But they've made few details public about what their plan entails, other than holding votes on bills that they say will lower premiums for \"100% of Americans.\" They will have just days to build consensus before Dec. 18, their last scheduled day in session for the year.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration announced plans Wednesday to add another militarized zone to the southern border \u2014 this time in California \u2014 as part of a major shift that has thrust troops into border enforcement with Mexico like never before.",
      "The Department of Interior said it would transfer jurisdiction along most of California's border with Mexico to the Navy to reinforce \"the historic role public lands have played in safeguarding national sovereignty.\"",
      "The Interior Department described the newest national defense area in California as a high-traffic zone for unlawful crossings by immigrants. But Border Patrol arrests along the southern U.S. border this year have dropped to the slowest pace since the 1960s amid President Trump's push for mass deportations.",
      "The move places long stretches of the border under the supervision of nearby military bases, empowering U.S. troops to detain people who enter the country illegally and sidestep a law prohibiting military involvement in civilian law enforcement. It is done under the authority of the national emergency on the border declared by Mr. Trump on his first day in office.",
      "The military strategy was pioneered in April along a 170-mile stretch of the border in New Mexico and later expanded to portions of the border in Texas and Arizona.",
      "The newly designated militarized zone extends nearly from the Arizona state line to the Otay Mountain Wilderness, traversing the Imperial Valley and border communities including the unincorporated community of Tecate, California, across the border from the Mexican city with the same name.",
      "More than 7,000 troops have been deployed to the border, along with an assortment of helicopters, drones and surveillance equipment.",
      "The zones allow U.S. troops to apprehend immigrants and others who are accused of trespassing on Army, Air Force or Navy bases. Those apprehended also could face additional criminal charges that can mean prison time.",
      "U.S. authorities say the zones are needed to close gaps in border enforcement and help in the wider fight against human smuggling networks and brutal drug cartels.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has reached an agreement that could end President Biden's signature student loan repayment plan, a move that may force millions of borrowers back into repayment.",
      "The Education Department on Tuesday announced a proposed settlement with the state of Missouri that it said would terminate the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, an income-driven repayment plan that tabulates loan repayments based on a borrower's income and family size.",
      "As part of the deal, which is pending court approval, the agency said it will not enroll any new borrowers in the SAVE plan and will deny all pending applications. All current SAVE borrowers will have a \"limited time\" to enroll in a new plan and begin repayments, according to the department's notice.",
      "Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz told CNBC that borrowers may need to leave SAVE forbearance early next year. That's a quicker timeline than what was laid out in The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed in July.",
      "That law gave borrowers enrolled in SAVE and other soon-to-be-phased-out repayment programs until July 1, 2028, to move to a new plan.",
      "Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in Tuesday's announcement that the Biden Administration's policies unfairly shifted student loan debt onto American taxpayers. The Education Department said the SAVE program would have cost taxpayers more than $342 billion over ten years.",
      "The Education Department declined to comment, pointing CBS News to a Dec. 9\u00a0Wall Street Journal op-ed written by Kent and Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway,",
      "\"The Trump administration isn't blind to the mounting student debt burden or the skyrocketing costs of a college degree,\" they wrote. \"But we refuse to force hardworking Americans to bear the burden of loans that aren't theirs.\"",

      "Tuesday's announcement is the latest development in a months-long legal battle over the program's fate, which has left millions of SAVE borrowers in limbo.",
      "The SAVE plan received pushback from attorneys general from several Republican-led states, including Missouri, which sued in 2024, arguing the plan overstepped the Biden administration's authority. In February 2025, a circuit court ruled the SAVE plan was unlawful, according to the Education Department.",
      "As the legal battle played out, SAVE borrowers were put in forbearance in July 2024, meaning that their loans were temporarily placed on hold and interest stopped accruing.",
      "In July 2025, the Education Department said it would restart charging interest on the loans beginning Aug. 1, a move advocacy group Protect Borrowers said could cost enrollees $300 per month due to new interest charges.",
      "Tuesday's agreement will \"strip borrowers of the most affordable repayment plan,\" Protect Borrowers deputy executive director and managing counsel Persis Yu said in a statement.",
      "The Education Department is advising SAVE borrowers to use the Federal Student Aid Loan Simulator tool to explore other repayment plans.",
      "As Kent and Hanaway\u00a0note\u00a0in their Wall Street Journal opinion piece, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act creates a single new income-driven repayment plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan, which has a repayment window of up to 30 years. The plan will be available for new borrowers beginning on July 1, 2026, along with a separate standard repayment plan, according to the Education Department.",

      "The Trump administration is proposing to ask visitors from several dozen nations that enjoy visa-free travel to the U.S. to submit additional personal information before entering the country, including five years of their social media history, the Department of Homeland Security said in a notice this week.",
      "Citizens of 42 countries enrolled in the visa waiver program can generally come to the U.S. for up to 90 days for tourism or business travel, without needing to apply for a visa at an American embassy or consulate, a process that can take months or even years.",
      "The list of countries in the visa waiver program includes many European nations like the United Kingdom, Germany and France, as well as some U.S. allies around the world, including Australia, Israel, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.",
      "While citizens of these nations typically don't need visas to travel to the U.S., they still have to submit an application online using a process known as the Electronic System for Travel Authorization, or ESTA, before entering the country. That system is designed to ensure applicants are eligible for visa-free travel to the U.S., and that they don't pose security concerns.",
      "The Trump administration is proposing to overhaul the ESTA system, mainly to transform it into a mobile-only process. The plan would require applicants to share additional information about themselves and their relatives, according to a notice posted in the federal government's journal of regulations by Customs and Border Protection, a branch of DHS.",
      "The notice said CBP plans to ask visa waiver travelers to share their social media history for the past five years, emails they have used for the past 10 years and the personal information of immediate family members, including phone numbers and residences. The submission of social media history from the last five years will be a mandatory requirement under the proposal, according to the notice.",
      "CBP said the changes, which still have to be reviewed by the White House's budget office, are designed to enforce an executive order President Trump issued earlier this year with the stated objective of denying entry to foreigners who may pose a threat to national security or public safety.",
      "But critics of the proposed changes said they could scare prospective travelers and negatively impact tourism, especially months before the U.S. hosts the 2026 FIFA World Cup, alongside Canada and Mexico, next summer.",
      "Over the past year, the Trump administration has mounted an aggressive effort to increase vetting and screening procedures across the U.S. immigration system.",
      "While the State Department has moved to scrutinize visa applicants overseas more heavily, some of the changes affect people already in the U.S. who are applying to stay in the country legally through applications for asylum, green cards or American citizenship.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has instructed officials to investigate the social media history of several classes of immigrants, including for views and activities deemed to be \"anti-American.\" It has also directed adjudicators to more intensely probe the \"good moral character\" of legal immigrants requesting U.S. citizenship.",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 10:36:11 -0500",
    "summary": "An American special forces veteran led the operation to get Mar\u00eda Corina Machado out of Venezuela: \"The first Nobel Prize winner that we've ever rescued.\"",
    "story": [
      "It took an American private rescue team 15 to 16 hours to get Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado out of her country and safely on her way to Norway to collect her Nobel Peace Prize, and to be reunited with her family on Wednesday. The vast majority of that time was spent in rough seas, and the man who led the operation and met Machado on a boat told CBS News, \"no one was enjoying that ride, especially Maria!\"",
      "\"No one's blood pressure was low, throughout any phase of this operation, including mine,\" said Bryan Stern, a U.S. special forces veteran who heads the Grey Bull Rescue Foundation. \"It was dangerous. It was scary. The sea conditions were ideal for us, but certainly not water that you would want to be on ... the higher the waves, the harder it is for radar to see. That's how it works.\"",
      "In an interview Wednesday with CBS News, Stern gave some insight into the complex operation his organization undertook to get Machado out of Venezuela and on a plane to Norway, where she was reunited with her children for the first time in about two years. A representative for Machado confirmed to CBS News on Thursday that Grey Bull was behind the rescue operation that began on Tuesday.",
      "Of the hundreds of rescues his organization has carried out, he said this was both one of the most challenging and the most rewarding. Machado has lived in hiding in her own country for almost a year, fearing persecution by the regime of President Nicolas Maduro, who is under increasing pressure from President Trump amid a U.S. military buildup off his shores.",
      "\"She has a very large target on her back,\" Stern said of Machado. \"This is not a random shopkeeper who doesn't wanna be in Venezuela anymore. This is moving around a rock star.\"",
      "\"She's the first Nobel Prize winner that we've ever rescued, you know? She's the first person that we've ever rescued that has billboards with her face all over it in a country, where there's protests in her favor. We've never rescued anybody with her status, with her stature,\" he said.",
      "Her high profile, combined with the Maduro regime taking \"a very defensive posture because of the American military buildup,\" meant huge risks for the operation, and Stern was reluctant to divulge much detail about the operation on land, \"because we still have other work to do in Venezuela, and we don't want to put sources and methods and people who worked on this at risk.\"",
      "But once Machado had been spirited off Venezuelan soil onto a boat, she was ferried to a rendezvous at sea, and Stern was there himself to welcome her onto his boat for a 13-14 hour journey to an undisclosed location where she caught her flight to Oslo.",
      "He said around two dozen people were involved directly within his team, but many more played a role - from providing intelligence to translation and logistics - including some who may never even know that they helped.",
      "Stern and Grey Bull were in charge of the land and maritime portion of the extraction, which he said had to be planned in only about four days, though his organization has been preparing for operations in Venezuela for months.",
      "He said the operation was funded by \"a few generous donors,\" none of whom \u2013 to his knowledge \u2013 were U.S. government officials.",
      "\"The U.S. government did not contribute a single penny to this operation, at least not that I know of,\" Stern said.",
      "He acknowledged that he and his organization did \"unofficially collaborate\" with the U.S. military about positioning and plans, largely to avoid being targeted inadvertently.",
      "Asked about reports that a private extractions specialist contracted by the Trump administration had met Machado in the small Caribbean island nation of Cura\u00e7ao, Stern told CBS News: \"I'm the contractor who specializes in extractions, and I've never been hired by Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"I did not meet her in Cura\u00e7ao. I met her somewhere else. I met her really far away from Curacao. Extremely far,\" he said.",
      "The moment when Machado climbed onto his boat was among the \"moments of transition\" that present the most risk for any rescue operation, he said.",
      "Stern wouldn't say where exactly that happened, beyond it being on a boat in the Caribbean, but he did say the nighttime rendezvous, and the conversation he had with the Venezuelan \"freedom fighter\" in the ensuing hours, made an impression on him.",
      "\"Personally, I was starstruck. She's a hero of mine,\" said Stern. \"When I got to see her for the first time and validate that it was her, my heart skipped a beat.\"",
      "The rough seas and dark skies on Tuesday night were perfect for operating covertly, he said, but they didn't make for an enjoyable ride.",
      "\"The maritime domain is the most unforgiving domain. This was in the middle of the night - very little moon, a little bit of cloud cover, very hard to see, boats have no lights.\"",

      "\"She was very happy. She was very excited. She was very tired,\" he said.",
      "Asked about the fact that Machado eventually arrived in Oslo too late to attend Wednesday's Nobel Prize ceremony in person, Stern said \"nothing went wrong, it just took time.\"",
      "\"From my perspective at least, her life was the most important aspect of this. A ceremony is great, but I don't look at this operation as getting Maria to a ceremony on time,\" he said. \"I look at this operation as saving a freedom fighter's life, as saving a mother's life.\"",
      "\"We talked about her seeing her children for the first time in two years and I almost cried,\" Stern told CBS News. \"She's a tough-as-nails, hard-as-woodpecker-lips woman, person, but she's still a mom, and she talked about how excited she was to see her children. It's been two long years.\"",
      "He said being able to facilitate that reunion \"truly was a blessing. We could not feel more privileged or honored to support this operation. She truly is a hero of mine. I've looked at her as an inspirational defender of freedom as long as I've known of her. So to be asked to support this, to conduct this operation, truly was a huge honor, a privilege for us.\"",

      "Asked if Grey Bull would help her get back into the country, Stern told CBS News, \"we've never done an infil, we've only done exfil. So, I don't think so \u2026 That's for her to determine and for her to decide. But I think she should not go back. But she wants to. Maria is truly inspirational.\"",

      "It involved two helicopters, special operations forces, 10 members of the U.S. Coast Guard and 10 Marines, the sources said. The boarding team was composed of the Coast Guard's Maritime Security and Response Team, an elite maritime interdiction unit based in Chesapeake, Virginia.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi posted a 45-second video of the operation on X, showing armed personnel descending onto the vessel's deck from a helicopter.

      "The ship \u2014 known as Adisa in 2022 \u2014 is among the vessels controlled by sanctioned Russian oil magnate Viktor Artemov, the Treasury said in a statement. At the time, the Treasury said Artemov transported Iranian oil using an expansive network of ships that were often registered in obscure ways with the intention of skirting U.S. restrictions on Iranian petroleum exports.",
      "The Treasury's 2022 sanctions announcement didn't mention Venezuela. But oil networks involving both Iran and Venezuela have been reported for years, drawing pushback from the United States. The two countries are major petroleum producers with some of the world's largest oil reserves, but trade is restricted by heavy U.S. sanctions.",
      "The tanker is controlled by Nigeria-based management company Thomarose Global Ventures LTD and owned by a firm linked to Artemov, according to publicly available data.",
      "The ship is 20 years old, initially sailing under the name The Toyo in 2005. At 333 meters (about 1,092 feet) in length, it was one of the largest tankers in the world at the time it was built.",

      "Canada has launched a $1.2 billion initiative aimed at drawing leading researchers to the country, as the U.S. intensifies restrictions on highly skilled workers by charging $100,000 for H-1B visas.",
      "The Canadian government announced on Tuesday that its investment over 12 years will be used to recruit and support over 1,000 individuals advancing world-leading research in critical fields, including doctors and scientists.",
      "\"As other countries constrain academic freedoms and undermine cutting-edge research, Canada is investing in \u2013 and doubling down on \u2013 science,\" Melanie Joly, Canada's industry minister, said in a statement. \"Today's investment is about securing Canada's place at the forefront of discovery and innovation and leveraging our strength in science to support our future well-being and prosperity for generations to come.\"",
      "While the initiative does not explicitly mention the United States, it appears aimed \u2013 at least in part \u2013 at attracting highly skilled workers like those who could hold H-1B visas.",
      "In September, President Trump signed an executive order requiring a $100,000 fee for H-1B skilled foreign worker applicants, saying it will spur companies to hire Americans instead of people from overseas.",
      "The fee applies only to new H-1B applicants who live abroad, according to the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which oversees the visa program. More specifically, the $100,000 fee applies to H-1B applications filed on or after Sept. 21 by workers outside the U.S. and who do not currently hold such a visa, USCIS said in October.",
      "While the fee could foster boosted domestic hiring in some industries, other industries could take a hit. The U.S. health care system, for example, which depends on international professionals such as doctors, lab technicians and nurses to fill positions, could become collateral damage.",
      "Canada, meanwhile, faces its own challenges. The country is experiencing a significant shortage of doctors in primary care, leaving millions without a family physician and contributing to longer emergency room waits and poorer health outcomes.",
      "In response, Canadian officials have announced a path to expedited permanent residency for overseas doctors with at least one year of Canadian work experience, aiming to address the critical workforce gap.",
      "\"This dedicated Express Entry category, along with the reserved federal admission spaces for provinces and territories, will help bring in and keep practice-ready doctors, so people across Canada can get the care they need,\" Lena Metlege Diab, Canada's minister of refugees and citizenship, said in a statement Monday.",
      "Some scholars are already making their way from the U.S. to Canadian universities. The University of Toronto announced in November that it recruited three top researchers from U.S. institutions \u2014 whose work ranges from the search for new planets to economics \u2014 and called it a \"big win for Canada.\"",

      "\"Heaven forbid they might talk to one another a bit more, pick up the phone and have a chat rather than just being obsessed with the screen,\" said Maulinauskas.",
      "The ban puts the onus of responsibility on social media companies rather than parents with a penalty of up to $33 million if found to be in breach. It allows for each company to decide how best to adhere, which must be \"multi-layered,\" using more than one kind of identity verification, which could include traditional methods including national IDs and passports but also artificial intelligence \u2014 controversial over possible inaccuracies \u2014 to scan facial features for age.",
      "Malinauskas readily admits there will be growing pains.",
      "\"People will find ways around it and lots of things will go wrong, and that'll be highlighted in coming days and weeks in Australia,\" he said, \"but on balance, this is a reform that parents want so they can do their job more easily.\"",
      "He says officials from North America, Europe and Asia have been speaking with him about advancing similar legislation in Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan. Malaysia is already on track to be the next country to ban those under 16 from social media in 2026.",

    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 11:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "For thousands of parents in 39 countries, including the U.S., the goal is simple: More time outdoors, and a childhood lived offline as much as possible.",
    "story": [
      "Suffolk, England - For parents Daisy Greenwell and Joe Ryrie, freedom means looking up at the world around them instead of down at their phones, and they're determined to pass that sense of non-digital liberty on to their children.",
      "Their daughter started asking for a smartphone when she was just eight years old, because her classmates were getting them. The pressure to have a phone at such a young age surprised Greenwell, and pushed her to look more closely at the trend.",
      "She found a growing body of research suggesting that heavy smartphone use may negatively impact young people's mental health.",
      "The more she read, the more concerned she became, so Greenwell decided to take action. She posted a question on Instagram: What if we could switch the norm? What if parents united to create a \"smartphone-free childhood?\"",
      "The response was immediate.",
      "\"That post went viral,\" she told CBS News. \"Thousands of parents joined the group overnight.\"",
      "Within a couple weeks, Greenwell said there were smartphone-free childhood groups in every county in England. One year later, the grassroots campaign has expanded far beyond the U.K. borders.",
      "The group \u2014 Smartphone Free Childhood \u2014 now has chapters in 39 countries.",
      "For Greenwell, Ryrie and the thousands of families who've joined the movement, the goal is simple: More time outdoors, and a childhood lived offline as much as possible.",
      "In the U.S., the movement even inspired a cautionary viral advertisement, highlighting the dangers of giving children unrestricted access to the internet. A parent in the ad tells their child: \"There's a box in the corner with all the pornographic material ever made. I'm trusting you not to look in there, okay?\"",
      "The backlash against youth consumption of social media has drawn the attention of governments globally. On Wednesday, Australia became the first country in the world to enact a ban on social media accounts for children under the age of 16. The law compels huge tech companies such as Meta and TikTok to enforce age restrictions, or face hefty fines.",
      "In the U.K., national Culture Minister Lisa Nandy said the government would be keeping a \"close eye\" on Australia's social media ban, but added that there were no current plans to replicate the legislation.",
      "At a grassroots level, however, parents who join Greenwell and Ryrie's movement are asked to sign a pact: No smartphones for the kids before they turn 14, and no social media before 16.",
      "\"This isn't an anti-tech movement, it's a pro-childhood movement. We're not saying no smartphones ever. We're just saying children don't need unrestricted internet access in their pockets 24/7,\" Ryrie told CBS News.",
      "When asked what she'd tell busy working parents who rely on phones for convenience, Greenwell acknowledged the challenge.",
      "\"It's really tough,\" she said. \"But delaying the smartphone is free, it's simple, and it gives your child the best chance to thrive.\"",
      "Many families are turning to basic \"brick phones\" as alternatives \u2014 devices that allow calls and texts, but limit internet access. Sales of such \"dumb\" devices have risen 150% among 18-24 year olds in the United States, according to a study by the peer-reviewed journal Partners Universal Innovative Research Publication.",
      "Despite the momentum, Greenwell says there's still a cultural norm to disrupt, and available data highlights that point. One in four British kids between the ages of 5 and 7 already own a smartphone, according to the U.K.'s independent media regulator Ofcom.",
      "Greenwell said she believes real change can be driven from the community level.",
      "\"If children know several classmates are also delaying smartphones, the peer pressure dissolves,\" she told CBS News. \"It becomes easier for families to wait a few years. A brick phone in the meantime isn't that hard. We can do this.\"",

      "The daughter of Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado gave a speech in Oslo on Wednesday on behalf of her mother, who was awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "Ana Corina Sosa Machado accepted the prize for her mother at the award ceremony in Norway's capital. Mar\u00eda Corina Machado has been in hiding for months and did not attend the ceremony, but said she was heading to Norway's capital where she would embrace her family and her children who she has not seen in two years. She will later return to Venezuela, according to her daughter.",
      "Maria Corina Machado was awarded the prize \"for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,\" and Norwegian Nobel Committee Chair J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes called Machado \"a brave and committed champion of peace.\"",
      "Here are the remarks given by Ana Corina Sosa Machado in Oslo on Wednesday, including the speech she delivered for her mother:",
      "Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, distinguished members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, citizens of the world, my dear Venezuelans:",
      "First, I want to express our infinite gratitude from my family, from an entire country, to the Norwegian Nobel committee. Thanks to you, the struggle of an entire people for truth, for freedom, for democracy and peace is today recognized around the world.",
      "I am here on behalf of my mother, Maria Corina Machado, who has united millions of Venezuelans in an extraordinary effort that you, our hosts, have honored with a Nobel Peace Prize. But although she has not been able to be here and take part in this ceremony, I must say that my mother never breaks a promise. And that is why, with all the joy in my heart, I can tell you that in just a few hours, we will be able to embrace her here, in Oslo, after 16 months living in hiding. And as I await that moment to hug her, to kiss her, to embrace her after two years, I think of the other daughters and sons who do not get to see their mothers today. This is what drives her, what drives all of us. She wants to live in a free Venezuela and she will never give up on that purpose. That is why we all know, and I know, that she will be back in Venezuela very soon.",
      "In the meantime, at this moment, I face the difficult task of giving voice to her words, the speech she prepared for this occasion.",
      "This is her speech:",
      "I have come here to tell you a story: the story of a people and their long march toward freedom.",
      "This march brings me here today as one voice among millions of Venezuelans who rose, once again, to reclaim the destiny that was always theirs.",
      "Venezuela was born of audacity, shaped by peoples and cultures intertwined. From Spain we inherited a language, a culture, and a faith that merged with ancestral Indigenous and African roots.",
      "In 1811, we wrote the first constitution in the Spanish-speaking world, one of the earliest republican constitutions on Earth, affirming the radical idea that every human being carries a sovereign dignity. This constitution enshrined citizenship, individual rights, religious liberty, and separation of powers.",
      "Our ancestors carried liberty on their backs. They crossed an entire continent, from the banks of the Orinoco to the heights of the Potos\u00ed, to help give rise to societies of free and equal citizens, out of the conviction that freedom is never whole unless it is shared.",
      "From the beginning, we believed something simple and immense: that all human beings are born to be free. That conviction became our national soul.",
      "In the twentieth century, the earth opened: in 1922, the Revent\u00f3n in La Rosa erupted for nine days: a fountain of oil and possibility.",
      "In peace, we turned that sudden wealth into an engine for knowledge and imagination.",
      "Through the ingenuity of our scientists, we eradicated disease. We built universities of global prestige, museums and concert halls, sent thousands of young Venezuelans abroad through scholarships, trusting that free minds would return as transformation. Our cities glowed with the kinetic art of Cruz-Diez and Soto.",
      "We forged steel, aluminum, and hydropower\u2014proof that Venezuela could build anything it dared to envision.",
      "Venezuela also became a refuge.",
      "We opened our arms to migrants and exiles from every corner of the earth: Spaniards fleeing civil war; Italians and Portuguese escaping poverty and dictatorship; Jews after the Holocaust; Chileans, Argentinians, and Uruguayans escaping military regimes; Cubans escaping communism and families from Colombia, Lebanon and Syria seeking peace.",
      "We gave them homes, schools, safety. And they became Venezuelans.",
      "This is Venezuela.",
      "We built a democracy that became the most stable in Latin America, and freedom unfolded as a creative force.",
      "But even the strongest democracy weakens when its citizens forget that freedom is not something we wait for, but something we become.",
      "It is a deliberate, personal choice, and the sum of those choices forms the civic ethos that must be renewed every day.",
      "The concentration of oil revenues in the State created perverse incentives: it gave the government immense power over society which turned into privilege, patronage, and corruption.",
      "My generation was born in a vibrant democracy, and we took it for granted. We assumed freedom was as permanent as the air we breathed. We cherished our rights, but we forgot our duties.",
      "I was raised by a father whose life's work \u2014 building, creating, serving \u2014 taught me that loving this country meant assuming responsibility for its future.",
      "By the time we recognized how fragile our institutions had become, a man who had once led a military coup to overthrow the democracy, was elected president. Many thought charisma could substitute the rule of law.",
      "From 1999 onward, the regime dismantled our democracy: violating the Constitution, falsifying our history, corrupting the military, purging independent judges, censoring the press, manipulating elections, persecuting dissent, and ravaging our extraordinary biodiversity.",
      "Oil wealth was not used to uplift, but to bind.",
      "Washing machines and refrigerators were handed out on national television to families living on dirt floors, not as progress but as spectacle.",
      "Apartments meant for social housing were handed to a select few with a condition for unquestionable obedience.",
      "And then came the ruin:",
      "Obscene corruption; historic looting. During the regime's rule, Venezuela received more oil revenue than in the previous century combined. And it was all stolen.",
      "Oil money became a tool to purchase loyalty abroad while at home criminal and international terrorist groups fused themselves to the state.",
      "The economy collapsed by more than 80%.",
      "Poverty surpassed 86%.",
      "Today, nine million Venezuelans have been forced to flee.",
      "These are not statistics; they are open wounds.",
      "Meanwhile, something deeper and more corrosive took place. It was a deliberate method: to divide society by ideology, by race, by origin, by ways of life; pushing Venezuelans to distrust one another, to silence one another, to see enemies in one another. They smothered us, they took us prisoners, they killed us, and they forced us into exile.",
      "It had been almost three decades of fighting against a brutal dictatorship.",
      "And we had tried everything: dialogues betrayed; protests of millions, crushed; elections perverted.",
      "Hope collapsed entirely, and belief in any kind of future became impossible. The idea of change seemed either na\u00efve or crazy. It seemed impossible.",
      "Yet, from the very depths of that despair, a step that seemed modest, almost procedural, changed the course of our history.",
      "We decided, against all odds, to run a primary election. An unlikely act of rebellion. We chose to trust the people.",
      "To rediscover one another, we traveled by road and by dirt path in a country with gasoline shortages, daily blackouts and collapsing communications.",
      "Forbidden from advertising, without money or media willing to speak our names, we crossed it armed only with conviction.",
      "Word of mouth was our network of hope, and it spread faster than any campaign. Because our desire for freedom was very much alive within us and it had never died.",
      "The forced migration that was meant to fracture us, instead united us around one sacred purpose: to reunite our families in our land. Grandparents confided in me their greatest fear: dying before meeting their grandchildren abroad; little girls, with voices too small for such sorrow, begged me to bring back their mothers and siblings scattered across the continent.",
      "Our pain fused into one heartbeat: bring our children home, now.",
      "In May 2023, during a rally in the small town of Nirgua, a teacher named Carmen came up to me. She told me she had just run into her Jefa de Calle. Jefa de Calle's a regime agent assigned to Carmen's block who decides, house by house, who receives a monthly food bag and who is punished with hunger.",
      "Shocked to see this woman there, Carmen had asked her \"Why are you here?\"",
      "The Jefa de Calle replied: \"My only son, who fled to Peru, asked me to be here today. He told me that if Maria Corina wins, he will return home. Tell me what I have to do. I'll do anything.\"",
      "That day, love defeated fear.",
      "Two weeks later, we reached Delicias, a tiny village swallowed by Colombian guerrillas and drug traffickers, where not even a chicken can be sold without their permission. No candidate had gone there since 1978.",
      "And as the team climbed the mountain, I saw Venezuelan flags waving from every humble home. I na\u00efvely asked if it was a national holiday that merited all the flags, and someone whispered: \"No. Here the flag are hidden. Bringing it out is dangerous. Today people raised them to thank you for daring to come. You will leave\u2026 but we will remain, identified.\"",
      "That day, entire families stood up to the armed groups that ruled their lives. And when we sang the national anthem together, sovereignty returned in a single, fragile, defiant chorus.",
      "That day, courage defeated oppression.",
      "Our gatherings became intimate encounters of thousands.",
      "We embraced, we cried, we prayed.",
      "We understood our struggle was much more than electoral.",
      "It was an ethical struggle for truth. An existential struggle for life. And a spiritual struggle for good.",
      "With less than a year before the presidential election, we had to unite every democratic force and restore trust in the vote. The primaries became that moment: a self-organized civic effort that built a nationwide citizen network unlike anything Venezuela had ever seen.",
      "And on October 22 of 2023, against all odds, Venezuela awoke.",
      "The diaspora, which was a third of our nation, reclaimed its right to vote.",
      "The son who had left cast his ballot alongside the mother who stayed.",
      "Lines stretched for blocks. Turnout was so overwhelming that ballots actually ran out. We trusted the people, and they trusted us back.",
      "What began as a mechanism to legitimize leadership became the rebirth of a nation's confidence in itself. That day, I received a mandate: a responsibility that transcended any individual ambition. I felt humbled and profoundly aware of the weight with which I had been entrusted.",
      "Threatened by that truth though, the regime prohibited me from running for president. It was a harsh blow, but mandates belong to the people.",
      "We set out to find another candidate who could take my place.",
      "Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia stepped forward: a calm, brave former diplomat. The regime believed he posed no threat.",
      "But they underestimated the resolve of millions of citizens \u2014 a plural, vibrant society that, in all its diversity, found unity in a common purpose. Communities, political parties, unions, students, and civil society stood together and worked as one so that the voice of a nation could be heard.",
      "We were three months from Election Day, and almost no one knew his name.",
      "But votes were not enough; we had to defend them. For over a year, we had been building the infrastructure to do so: 600,000 volunteers across 30,000 polling stations; apps to scan QR codes, digital platforms, diaspora call centers. We deployed scanners, Starlink antennas, and laptops hidden inside fruit trucks to the furthest corners of Venezuela. Technology became a tool for freedom.",
      "Secret training sessions were held at dawn in church backrooms, kitchens, and basements, using printed materials moved across Venezuela like contraband.",
      "Finally, Election Day arrived on July 28, 2024. Before dawn, lines wrapped around blocks. A quiet, trembling hope filled the air. Our live tracking showed turnout rising across every state and town. And then the electoral tally sheets\u2014 the famous actas, the sacred proof of the people's will\u2014began to appear: first by phone, then WhatsApp, then photographed, then scanned, and finally carried by hand, by mule, by canoe.",
      "They arrived from everywhere across Venezuela, an eruption of truth, because thousands of citizens risked their freedom to protect them.",
      "Confronted with our overwhelming victory, the regime issued a desperate order: soldiers were to expel our volunteers from voting centers and block them from receiving the original tally sheets they were legally entitled to.",
      "But the soldiers disobeyed.",
      "Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia  won with 67% of the vote, in every state, city and village.",
      "In every state, city and village, every single tally sheet told the same story.",
      "Within hours, they were digitized and published on a website for the world to see.",
      "But the dictatorship responded with terror.",
      "2,500 people kidnapped, disappeared, tortured.",
      "Homes marked.",
      "Entire families taken as hostages.",
      "Priests, teachers, nurses, students, anyone who dared share a tally sheet was hunted down.",
      "These are crimes against humanity, documented by the United Nations. State terrorism, deployed to bury the will of the people.",
      "Some of the more than 220 children detained after the elections were electrocuted, beaten and suffocated until they repeated the lie the regime needed, falsely incriminating themselves of being paid by me to protest. Women and girls in prison are right now being forced into sexual slavery, made to endure abuse in exchange for a family visit, a meal or the chance to take a bath.",
      "And yet, the Venezuelan people did not surrender.",
      "During these past 16 months in clandestinity, we have built new networks of civic pressure and disciplined disobedience, preparing for Venezuela's orderly transition to democracy.",
      "That is how we reach this day, a day carrying the echo of millions who stand at the threshold of freedom.",
      "This prize carries profound meaning; it reminds the world that democracy is essential to peace.",
      "And more than anything, what we Venezuelans can offer the world is the lesson forged through this long and difficult journey: that to have democracy, we must be willing to fight for freedom.",
      "And freedom is a choice that must be renewed each day, measured by our willingness and our courage to defend it.",
      "For this reason, the cause of Venezuela transcends our borders. A people who choose freedom contribute not only to themselves, but to humanity.",
      "We attain freedom only when we refuse to turn our backs on ourselves; when we confront the truth directly, no matter how painful; when love for what truly matters in life gives us the strength to persevere and to prevail.",
      "Only through that inner alignment \u2014 that vital integrity \u2014 do we rise to meet our destiny. Only then do we become who we truly are, able to live a life worthy of being lived.",
      "Along this march to freedom, we gained profound certainties of the soul \u2014 truths that have given our lives a deeper meaning and prepared us to build a great future in peace.",
      "Therefore, peace is ultimately an act of love.",
      "This love has already set our future in motion.",
      "Venezuela will breathe again.",
      "We will open prison doors and watch thousands who were unjustly detained step into the warm sun, embraced at last by those who never stopped fighting for them.",
      "We will see grandmothers settle children on their laps to tell them stories not of distant forefathers, but of their own parents' courage.",
      "We will see our students debate ideas passionately and without fear, their voices rising freely at last.",
      "We will hug again. Fall in love again. Hear our streets fill with laughter and music again.",
      "All the simple joys in the world that we have taken for granted will be ours.",
      "My dear Venezuelans, the world has marveled at what we have achieved. And soon it will witness one of the most moving sights of our time: our loved ones coming home \u2014 and I will stand again on the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar bridge, where I once cried among the thousands who were leaving, and welcome them back into the luminous life that awaits us.",
      "Because in the end, our journey towards freedom has always lived inside us.",
      "We are returning to ourselves. We are returning home.",
      "Allow me to honor the heroes of this journey:",
      "Our political prisoners, the persecuted, their families, and all who defend human rights; those who sheltered us, fed us, and risked everything to protect us; the journalists who refused silence, the artists who carried our voice; my exceptional team, my mentors, my fellow political and social activists; the leaders around the world who joined and defended our cause; my three children, my adored father, my mother, my three sisters, my brave and loving husband, who've all supported me throughout my life; and above all, the millions of anonymous Venezuelans who risked their homes, their families, and their lives out of love.",
      "To them belongs this honor.",
      "To them belongs this day.",
      "To them belongs the future.",

      "Sophie Kinsella, the author of \"Confessions of a Shopaholic\" and a series of millions-selling sequels, has died, her family said on social media.",
      "Kinsella, whose real name was Madeleine Wickham, had been diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, in late 2022. She announced the diagnosis in April 2024. She said at the time that she delayed the announcement to let her children adjust to their new normal. Kinsella also said that she underwent surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy to treat the disease.",
      "\"We are heartbroken to announce the passing this morning of our beloved Sophie (aka Maddy, aka Mummy). She died peacefully, with her final days filled with her true loves: family and music and warmth and Christmas and joy,\" Kinsella's family wrote on Instagram. \"We can't imagine what life will be like without her radiance and love of life.\"",
      "Kinsella published 10 \"Shopaholic\" novels, beginning with \"Confessions of a Shopaholic\" in 2000. The first two \"Shopaholic\" books were adapted into the 2009 film \"Confessions of a Shopaholic,\" starring Isla Fisher.",
      "Her 2024 novella \"What Does It Feel Like?\" was a semi-fictional account of her cancer diagnosis, according to CBS News partner BBC News. In an introduction to the book, Kinsella said she had \"always processed my life through writing.\"",

      "Kinsella also published books, including her debut novel, under her real name.

      "\"Despite her illness, which she bore with unimaginable courage, Sophie counted herself truly blessed - to have such wonderful family and friends, and to have had the extraordinary success of her writing career,\" her family said on social media. \"She took nothing for granted and was forever grateful for the love she received.\"",

      "\"You're sitting alone in your room and you're tapping away and you hope people enjoy your book and then off it goes,\" she said. \"But then you get somebody who says, 'Well, you know what?

    "story": [
      "Oslo, Norway\u00a0\u2014 Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado\u00a0missed the ceremony to award her the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo on Wednesday, but said she was on her way to the Norwegian capital and would arrive soon to embrace her family for the first time in months.",
      "Machado, who's fight against the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whom she, the U.S. and many other nations consider an illegitimate leader, has forced her to live in hiding, last appeared in public 11 months ago. Her daughter, Ana Corina Sosa Machado, accepted the prize on her behalf at the Oslo ceremony, saying her mother would return to Venezuela soon after coming to Norway on Wednesday.",
      "\"Freedom is not something we wait for, but something we become,\" the younger Machado told those gathered for the ceremony in a speech written by her mother. \"Loving a country means taking responsibility for its future.\"",
      "\"What we Venezuelans can offer the world is the lesson forged through this long and difficult journey: that to have democracy, we must be willing to fight for freedom,\" Machado said.",
      "The Nobel institute posted audio on its YouTube channel of a phone call between Machado and the institute's director J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes, in which she told him she was on her way to Oslo, but wouldn't make the award ceremony.",
      "\"On behalf of the Venezuelan people, once again, I want to thank the Norwegian Nobel Committee for this immense recognition to the fight of our people for democracy and freedom. We feel very emotional and very honored, and that's why I am very sad and very sorry to tell you that I won't be able to arrive in time for the ceremony,\" she said in the call, adding: \"But I will be in Oslo and I'm on my way to Oslo right now.\"",
      "\"As soon as I arrive, I will be able to embrace all my family and my children that I've have not seen for two years, and so many Venezuelans, Norwegians, that I know that share our struggle and our fight. So, thank you very much and I'll see you very soon.\"",
      "Nobel Institute director Kristian Berg Harpviken\u00a0said four days ago\u00a0that Machado confirmed to him that she would attend the ceremony, though he said at the time that, \"given the security situation, we cannot say more about the date or how she will arrive.\"",
      "Prominent Latin American figures attended Wednesday's ceremony in a signal of solidarity with Machado. Among those expected were Argentine President Javier Milei, Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa, Panama's President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino and Paraguayan President Santiago Pe\u00f1a.",
      "Machado has been living in hiding and has not been seen in public since Jan. 9, when she was briefly detained after joining supporters in a protest in Caracas, Venezuela's capital. The 58-year-old's win for her struggle to achieve a democratic transition in her South American nation was announced on Oct. 10, and she was described as a woman \"who keeps the flame of democracy burning amid a growing darkness.\"",
      "Machado won an opposition primary election and intended to challenge President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in last year's presidential election, but the government barred her from running for office. Retired diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez took her place.",
      "The lead-up to the July 28, 2024 election saw widespread repression, including disqualifications, arrests and human rights violations. That increased after the country's National Electoral Council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, declared the incumbent the winner.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez sought asylum in Spain last year after a Venezuelan court issued a warrant for his arrest.",
      "U.N. human rights officials and many independent rights groups have expressed concerns about the situation in Venezuela, and called for Maduro to be held accountable for the crackdown on dissent.",
      "Five past Nobel Peace Prize laureates were detained or imprisoned at the time of the award, according to the prize's official website, most recently Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi in 2023 and Belarusian human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski in 2022.",
      "The others were Liu Xiaobo of China in 2010, Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar in 1991 and Carl von Ossietzky of Germany in 1935.",
      "\"There is a long tradition that when a Peace Prize laureate cannot be present, close family members represent them,\" Harpviken said. \"That happened with Narges Mohammadi, and with Ales Bialiatski; both were imprisoned at the time. And the same will happen with Maria Corina Machado today. The daughter will deliver the statement her mother has written.\"",

    "summary": "Archaeologists finished excavating foundations of the ancient wall that surrounded Jerusalem when the story of Hanukkah took place.",
    "story": [
      "Archaeologists have finished uncovering the longest continuous remains of an ancient wall that encircled Jerusalem, including possible evidence of a 2,100-year-old ceasefire between warring kingdoms.",
      "Last week, archaeologists finished excavating the most complete part ever discovered of the foundations of the walls, which surrounded Jerusalem during the time of the Hasmonean Kingdom, when the story of Hanukkah took place. The discovery comes almost exactly one year after a rare collection of ancient coins was unearthed by Israeli researchers, who called the find an \"archaeological Hanukkah miracle.\"",
      "In Hebrew, Hanukkah means \"dedication,\" and the holiday marks the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem in the second century B.C., after a small group of Jewish fighters liberated it from occupying foreign forces, and the Hasmonean Kingdom that followed.",
      "Jews celebrate the eight-day holiday, which this year begins on Dec. 14, with the ritual of lighting a nightly candle, in honor of the tiny supply of ritually pure oil that they found in the temple that lasted for eight nights instead of just one. Many also eat fried foods such as potato pancakes, called latkes, to memorialize this miraculously long-lasting oil.",
      "The Hasmonean wall foundation, whose excavation was finished last week in Jerusalem, was likely built a few decades after the story of Hanukkah by the same rulers. It's almost 50 meters (164 feet) long, around half the length of a football field, and around 5 meters (16 feet) wide. It held walls, which according to estimations and some historical writings, were taller than the current walls surrounding Jerusalem's Old City.",
      "Much of the current walls surrounding Jerusalem's Old City date back hundreds of years to the Ottoman Era.",
      "The Hasmonean walls encircled an area much larger than the current Old City of Jerusalem, with 60 watchtowers along the wall that were more than 10 meters (33 feet) tall, according to ancient writings. The part recently uncovered is one of the longest sections found intact from the foundation of the Hasmonean walls.",
      "Separation wall and ceasefire",
      "One of the most interesting aspects of the foundation was that the wall above it seems to have been purposefully and uniformly dismantled to a uniform height, not chaotically destroyed by the ravages of time or war, said Dr. Amit Re'em, one of the lead archaeologists for the project from the Israel Antiquities Authority.",
      "Experts wondered why any leader would take apart a perfectly good security wall in an area that was constantly threatened by invasion.",
      "In 132 or 133 B.C., Hellenistic King Antiochus the Seventh, an heir to the Antiochus the Fourth from the story of Hanukkah, laid siege to Jerusalem and the Judean Kingdom, according to ancient Jewish historian Flavius Josephus.",
      "As the Judean army struggled, Jewish king John Hyrcanus I decided to strike a deal with Antiochus. He raided King David's tomb for 3,000 talents of silver and offered 500 hostages, including his own brother, according to the writings of Josephus.",
      "\"Antiochus Sidetes (the Seventh) reached a ceasefire agreement with John Hyrcanus, saying, if you want me to remove my army, you yourself, the Jewish king, must raze to the ground the Hasmonean fortification that you and your father built,\" Re'em said Monday. Josephus' writings state that after Antiochus accepted Hyrcanus' deal, they \"pulled down the walls encircling the city.\"",
      "Other sections of the Hasmonean wall uncovered in other parts of Jerusalem weren't dismantled, so it could have just been one section that was dismantled, possibly to provide a foundation for Herod's palace, Peleg-Barkat explained. Its unlikely that Jerusalem was left unprotected without any security walls for more than a century, she said.",
      "Wall under a prison",
      "The current section of the wall was uncovered underneath an abandoned wing of the building known as the Kishleh, which was built in 1830 as a military base. The wing was used as a prison, including by the British up until the 1940s, and the walls were covered with graffiti carved by prisoners in English, Hebrew and Arabic. The remnants of the iron bars of the cells are still visible in the ceiling.",
      "Most of the building is still used by the Israeli police today, but one wing was abandoned and later transferred to the Tower of David Museum. Archaeologists first began excavating this wing of the Kishleh in 1999, but violence in Jerusalem during the Second Intifada, which began in 2000, halted the excavations until two years ago.",
      "Archaeologists removed the equivalent of two Olympic swimming pools worth of dirt and debris by hand over the past two years from the hall. The excavations revealed what they believe are Middle Age-era dye pits, likely for fabric dying, and the long section of the Hasmonean wall foundation.",
      "In the coming years, the Tower of David Museum will install a floating glass floor over the ruins and use the hall as one of its new galleries in the Schulich Wing of Archaeology, Art and Innovation. The renovations of this section are expected to take at least two years, now that the archaeological dig has concluded.",
      "Last year's \"archaeological Hanukkah miracle\"",
      "Almost exactly one year ago, in December 2024, Israeli researchers discovered a rare collection of ancient coins on the third day of Hanukkah, calling the find an \"archaeological Hanukkah miracle.\"",
      "The coins were more than 2,000 years old and believed to belong to King Alexander Jannaeus, the second ruler of the Hasmonean dynasty. Archaeologists found the hoard of about 160 of the coins during excavations in the Jordan Valley, which runs between the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the eastern border of Jordan.",
      "The ancient coins were unearthed on the third day of Hanukkah. Researchers noted the significance of that timing, since Alexander Jannaeus descended from leaders of a revolt in 167 B.C.E. that the Talmud says led to the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem and the first celebration of the Hanukkah holiday.",
      "More recently, last month, archaeologists discovered evidence of an ancient religious practice in northern Israel in addition to a wine press dating back roughly 5,000 years \u2014 one of the oldest ever uncovered in the country.",

    "summary": "A genetic mutation that carries a 90% cancer risk has been passed on by an unwitting sperm donor to dozens of children, a Europe-wide investigation has revealed.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Sperm from a donor who unknowingly carried a cancer-causing gene has been used to conceive nearly 200 babies across Europe, an investigation by 14 European public service broadcasters, including CBS News' partner network BBC News, has revealed.",
      "Some children conceived using the sperm have already died from cancer, and the vast majority of those who inherited the gene will develop cancer in their lifetimes, geneticists said.",
      "The man carrying the gene passed screening checks before he became a donor at the European Sperm Bank when he was a student in 2005. His sperm has been used by women trying to conceive for 17 years across multiple countries.",
      "The cancer-causing mutation occurred in the donor's TP53 gene \u2014 which prevents cells in the body from turning cancerous \u2014  \u00a0before his birth, according to the investigation. It causes Li Fraumeni syndrome, which gives affected people a 90% chance of developing cancers, particularly during childhood, as well as breast cancer in later life.",
      "Up to 20% of the donor's sperm contained the mutated TP53 gene. Any children conceived with affected sperm will have the dangerous mutation in every cell of their body.",
      "\"It is a dreadful diagnosis,\" cancer geneticist Clare Turnbull told the BBC. \"It's a very challenging diagnosis to land on a family. There is a lifelong burden of living with that risk. It's clearly devastating.\"",
      "How was the discovery made?",
      "The affected donor sperm was discovered when doctors seeing children with cancers linked to sperm donation raised concerns at this year's European Society of Human Genetics.",
      "At the time, 23 children with the genetic mutation had been discovered, out of 67 children linked to the donor. Ten of those children with the mutation had already been diagnosed with cancer.",
      "Freedom of Information requests submitted by journalists across multiple countries revealed at least 197 children were affected, though it is not known how many inherited the genetic mutation.",
      "More affected children could be discovered as more data becomes available.",
      "\"We have some children that have developed already two different cancers and some of them have already died at a very early age,\" Edwige Kasper, a cancer geneticist at France's Rouen University Hospital, told journalists.",
      "The European Sperm Bank told CBS News that it does not ship to the United States due to U.S. regulations. A representative said the bank does work with with sperm banks in both Canada and Mexico.",
      "How did the sperm get used by women all over Europe?",
      "The donor sperm was sold by the European Sperm Bank in Denmark to 67 fertility clinics in 14 countries.",
      "Nations have their own regulations about how many times a donor's sperm can be used domestically, but there is no international law restricting how many times a donor's sperm can be used worldwide.",
      "It appears that some national laws were breached.",
      "In Belgium, where sperm from a single donor is supposed to be used by a maximum of six families, 53 children were born to 38 different women using sperm from the donor with the genetic mutation, the investigation found.",

    "story": [
      "Surin, Thailand\u00a0\u2014 Renewed border fighting between Thailand and Cambodia showed no signs of abating Wednesday, leaving hundreds of thousands of displaced people in both countries living in strained conditions as more flooded into temporary shelters. Remarks from leaders in both countries suggest little immediate momentum for a new halt to the violence, though President Trump says he will make a phone call to stop the fighting.",
      "Associated Press reporters on the Thai side of the border heard sounds of outgoing, indirect fire Wednesday.",
      "About 400,000 people have been evacuated from affected areas in Thailand and around 700 schools closed while fighting was ongoing in four border provinces, Thai military spokesperson Rear Adm. Surasant Kongsiri said Wednesday.",
      "Cambodia evacuated more than 127,000 villagers and hundreds of schools closed, the defense ministry said.",
      "Thailand's military announced that casualties this week include five soldiers killed and dozens wounded. Cambodia said seven civilians died and 20 others were wounded, though it did not update those figures on Wednesday.",
      "There is not yet a clear path to peace as Thailand's Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul vowed to continue to fight and Cambodia's powerful Senate President Hun Sen promised a fierce response.",
      "A knock-on effect of the fighting and bad blood between the nations was Cambodia's withdrawal of its entire team from the 33rd Southeast Asian Games, which began Tuesday in Thailand. A Wednesday announcement from the National Olympic Committee of Cambodia said it regretted the action but the families of competitors were concerned about their safety.",
      "Trump says he'll \"make a phone call\" to stop the fighting",
      "The new, widespread fighting followed a skirmish Sunday that wounded two Thai soldiers and derailed a ceasefire pushed by President Trump that had ended armed combat in July. Mr. Trump has repeatedly included the conflict among those he says he has ended.",
      "The five days of fighting over territorial disputes left dozens dead on both sides and forced the evacuation of thousands of civilians. The ceasefire was brokered by Malaysia and pushed through by pressure from Mr. Trump, who threatened to withhold trade privileges from the two nations unless they agreed.",
      "Late Tuesday at a Pennsylvania political event, Mr. Trump said he would use his sway to end the renewed combat.",
      "\"Tomorrow I'll have to make a phone call,\" he said. \"Who else could say, 'I'm going to make a phone call and stop a war between two very powerful countries, Thailand and Cambodia?'\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier called on the two sides to live up to the commitments made at an October meeting in Malaysia that reaffirmed the July ceasefire and called for removing heavy weapons from the border, coordinating removal of land mines and other steps.",
      "Thai foreign ministry spokesperson Nikorndej Balankura said Wednesday that there had not yet been any contact with the United States on the matter. He added that Thailand will not likely accept if another third party proposes to mediate since \"the line has been crossed.\"",
      "The ceasefire was fragile from the start as both nations carried on a bitter propaganda war and minor incidents of cross-border violence continued.",
      "Thailand deployed jet fighters to carry out airstrikes on what it says are military targets, while Cambodia's most fearsome weapons are BM-21 rocket launchers with a range of 19-25 miles. They are capable of firing salvos of 40 rockets at a time and, mounted on trucks, they are less vulnerable to attack.",
      "A Thai army statement said Cambodia on Tuesday launched approximately 125 salvos from BM-21 launchers totaling about 5,000 rockets and that some had hit civilian areas, though no casualties were reported.",
      "Thai evacuees stuck in shelters and anxious about what comes next",
      "Away from the battlefronts, anxious evacuees are the most visible sign of the crisis.",
      "In a gymnasium in the northeastern Thai city of Surin, around 550 people are waiting out the combat, many having hurriedly fled after the first shots were fired Sunday.",
      "Officials have provided food and diversions for children. The cooler, winter temperatures have kept the situation in the shelter bearable, but there is inevitable boredom and concern about what they left behind, including homes, valuables and animals.",
      "Thidarat Homhual, a 37-year-old farmer in the shelter with her family, said her mind is on cows, ducks, four dogs and nine cats left to fend for themselves.",
      "\"We are behind the front line. We can live like this. It's okay,\" she said. \"But I want it to be over. I miss my pets. I really miss my pets, all the animals at home. I can't really put it into words.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 04:32:59 -0500",
    "summary": "At least three oil tankers have been hit by explosions in what appears to be a stepped up unilateral effort by Ukraine to sink Russia's sanctions-dodging oil sales.",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine has struck at least two oil tankers off the coasts of Turkey and West Africa in a campaign against Russia's so-called shadow fleet, months after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for Kyiv's partners to strengthen their response to the vessels that Moscow uses to evade international sanctions and continue selling its natural resources.",
      "Ukraine has previously targeted fuel tankers and infrastructure in Russian ports and on land as part of its efforts to undermine the crucial source of Moscow's war funding, but the recent attacks have taken place outside Russia's territorial waters.",
      "Europe and the U.S. have sanctioned hundreds of ships in the shadow fleet, accusing them of violating bans on Russian oil sales, transporting stolen Ukrainian grain, and even suspected of spying on or damaging underwater telecommunications cables and pipelines.",
      "In October, Zelenskyy said Kyiv's intelligence service was providing information to European partners and \"expect that efforts to counter Russian interference will be significantly strengthened.\"",
      "As of Tuesday, the sanctioned crude oil tanker Kairos was grounded off the coast of NATO member Bulgaria after a Turkish tugboat that had been towing it from Turkey's exclusive economic zone in the Black Sea separated from the vessel in Bulgarian waters, according to state-owned Bulgarian news agency BTA.",
      "Kairos and another sanctioned oil tanker, the Virat, were both hit by Ukrainian \"Sea Baby\" drones in the Black Sea in separate attacks at the end of November, sources in the SBU told CBS News on Tuesday. The sources said the attacks were a joint operation between the 13th Main Directorate of Military Counterintelligence of Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency and the Ukrainian Navy.",
      "\"The SBU continues to take active steps to curtail Russia's financial capabilities to wage war against Ukraine,\" an SBU source said. \"Sea Baby naval drones disabled ships that could transport oil worth almost $70 million and helped the Kremlin circumvent international sanctions.\"",
      "The SBU sources provided a video showing the moment the Sea Baby drones struck both ships. CBS News has confirmed the ships visible in the video matches publicly available photos of the Kairos and Virat. The SBU officials said both tankers were critically damaged and \"taken out of service\" by the strikes.",
      "Publicly available ship tracking data corroborated the BTA report suggesting the Turkish tug had separated from the tanker six miles from Bulgaria's coast. The Kairos was stranded on Tuesday off Ahtopol, on Bulgaria's southern Black Sea coast, without heat or electricity, according to BTA.",
      "The Bulgarian Navy airlifted several crew members to shore, but authorities had been unable to tow the oil tanker to safety as of Tuesday due to poor weather conditions.",
      "Late last month, the technical manager of another tanker, the Mersin, said the vessel was impacted by a series of explosions while anchored off the coast of Senegal. The crew was rescued, according to Senegalese officials, and the vessel's technical manager, Besiktas Shipping, said seawater flooded into the engine room but the ship remained \"safe\" and posed no safety or navigational risks.",
      "The Mersin remained stranded with some 30,000 tons of diesel fuel on board, however, according to the African Security Analysis think tank.",
      "The tanker departed from the Russian port of Taman on Aug. 21 and arrived in Senegal in late September, where it has remained at anchor, according to open-source data from MarineTraffic. While the Mersin is not currently among the vessels sanctioned by the U.S., ships operated by BesiktasShipping have engaged in highly risky ship-to-ship crude oil transfers while anchored, according to the sanctions compliance monitoring organization OpenSanctions.",
      "Video circulating on social media, dated Nov. 30, shows the Mersin sinking. CBS News has not confirmed the source of the video, but the oil tanker's partially-submerged name is visible in the clip, seemingly recorded from a passing vessel.",
      "Ukrainian officials have not publicly confirmed any involvement in any of the explosions in the Black Sea or off the coast of Africa, all of which occurred within a few days. On Dec. 3, Besiktas Shipping said it was immediately ceasing all \"Russia related voyages.\"",
      "While insisting that it always complied and complies with restrictions on Russian oil shipments, the company said \"the security situation in the region has escalated considerably,\" and \"we have concluded that the risks posed to our vessels and crew have become untenable.\"",
      "European nations have imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on hundreds of vessels they say are part of the Russian shadow fleet, but a planned European Union-wide move to allow national authorities to board and inspect suspected ships has yet to materialize.",
      "Shadow fleet vessels have also been linked to drone sightings at European airports, including last week when unidentified drones breached Irish airspace during a visit from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "The EU and America's European NATO allies have issued increasing warnings about Russia's alleged hybrid warfare tactics in recent months, including the drone airspace incursions and sabotage operations across the continent and at sea.",

      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark \u2013 Some Danes told CBS News on the streets of Copenhagen they are increasingly worried about their country's security because of what they see as the growing threat from nearby Russia and concerns over the reliability of the Trump White House as an ally.",
      "Kenneth Howery, the new U.S ambassador to Denmark, is in Greenland's capital Nuuk this week for his first trip to the Danish-controlled, but self-governed, country. He said in a social media post on X that he and officials from Greenland and Denmark \"renewed our commitment to a strong and mutually beneficial relationship\" while meeting on Monday.",
      "Their meeting came after U.S. and Danish diplomatic ties were strained by President Trump reviving his long-standing interest in acquiring Greenland, which the White House has argued is necessary to protect U.S. national security. Mr. Trump hasn't ruled out taking Greenland by military force even though Denmark is a member of the U.S.-led NATO alliance.",
      "Hanne Mortenson, a Danish resident of the country's capital, told CBS News late last week that she has always looked to the United States as \"the ideal of democracy,\" but believes the country is becoming \"more and more autocratic.\" She said that is troubling due to Russia's repeated, recent incursions into European airspace.",
      "\"I saw this big map yesterday on TV with how much the Russians are coming closer and that worries me,\" Mortensen said, although she added that she wouldn't want the U.S. to take over Greenland despite security concerns related to Russia.",
      "A post shared by CBS News (@cbsnews)",
      "Denmark is consistently ranked as one of the world's happiest countries, according to the Global Happiness Index. But in recent weeks, European nations have reported unidentified drones flying around key infrastructure, including in Denmark, following Russian drone and fighter jet incursions into Poland, Romania and Estonia. Some of the United States' European NATO allies have alleged airspace incursions are part of a campaign of escalating hybrid warfare tactics by Russia.",
      "In September, Copenhagen Airport was forced to suspend flights due to unidentified drone sightings. Russia, however, denied involvement in drone incursions, with its embassy in Denmark saying in a statement at the time that \"incidents involving reported disruptions at Danish airports are a staged provocation. Undoubtedly, they will be used as a pretext for further escalating tension in the interests of forces seeking by all means to prolong the Ukrainian conflict and extend it to other countries.\"",
      "Still, one 70-year-old Danish woman told CBS News that the Danish sense of security and contentment is waning.",
      "\"The Russians have to go through Denmark to come to Europe,\" she told CBS News. \"I think people my age are more worried because we remember \u2013 we are after World War II children \u2013 so, we remember those days, and we have heard about it our entire childhood, about the war and the difficulties and all the horror that goes with war.\"",
      "Copenhagen resident Thomas Geuken, said he was recently talking to his 90-year-old father-in-law, \"and I asked him this morning, 'Is the glass half empty or half full?' And he actually said, 'Well, it's half empty because of the war in Ukraine and Russia. So it plays a big part in our thinking.'\"",

The Donbas region has mostly been taken over by Russia's army in its nearly four-year long invasion of Ukraine, and the Kremlin had agreed to this point in the White House-authored peace proposal.",

      "The European Space Agency said that the black hole inside NGC 3783 has the mass of 30 million suns. The black hole consumes nearby material to power an active galactic nucleus at the center of the galaxy, the ESA said in a news release. The nucleus is \"an extremely bright and active region\" that sends out powerful jets and winds, the agency said.",
      "One powerful wind was measured at 60,000 kilometers per second, or 130 million piles per hour, about 20% of the speed of light.",
      "\"We've not watched a black hole create winds this speedily before,\" said Liyi Gu at Space Research Organisation Netherlands (SRON), in a statement. Gu led the international research team. \"For the first time, we've seen how a rapid burst of X-ray light from a black hole immediately triggers ultra-fast winds, with these winds forming in just a single day.\"",
      "Researcher Matteo Guainazzi said the winds around the black hole were created as the nucleus' tangled magnetic field suddenly untwisted, creating something similar to the coronal mass ejections that erupt from the sun \"but on a scale almost too big to imagine.\"",
      "The similarity between black holes and the sun makes \"these mysterious objects seem a little less alien,\" the ESA said. Project scientist Erik Kuulkers said the discovery \"suggests that solar and high-energy physics may work in surprisingly familiar ways throughout the universe.\"",
      "Winds from active galactic nuclei play a role in how the galaxies they are situated within develop, said ESA research fellow Camille Diez. Learning more about the nuclei and how they behave will lead to a better understanding of space, Diez said.",

The southern half of Japan's Pacific coastline received a \"Nankai Trough\" megaquake advisory in the summer of 2024, but the ambiguity of that warning led to panic buying of emergency food, event cancellations and business closures.",
      "Japan megaquake advisory follows powerful earthquake",
      "The Japan Meteorological Agency said Monday's powerful earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture of Japan's main island of Honshu, and just south of the northern island of Hokkaido.",
      "Daiki Shimohata, 33, a civil servant in Hashikami on Honshu island, told Agence France-Presse that he and his family rushed outside their home.",
      "\"The tremor was something that we've never experienced. It lasted maybe for about 20 seconds,\" Shimohata said by phone.",
      "\"We were holding our children \u2014 a 2-year-old girl and a 1-year-old boy \u2014 in our arms. The shaking reminded me of the disaster (in 2011),\" he said.",
      "The quake temporarily increased potential risks in the regions of Hokkaido and the Sanriku coast. That's where the Pacific Plate beneath Japan forms the two trenches \u2014 the Japan Trench and Chishima Trench \u2014 that have caused many large quakes in the past.",
      "Experts say the deadly quake and tsunami in 2011 was caused by movement associated with the Japan Trench. It spans from off the eastern coast of Chiba to Aomori, and the Chishima Trench goes from the eastern coast of Hokkaido to the northern islands and the Kurils.",
      "In explaining the advisory, the JMA said the magnitude 9.0 quake on March 11, 2011, that devastated large swaths of Japan's northern coast occurred two days after a magnitude 7.3 temblor that occurred at the Japan Trench off the eastern coast of Iwate, one of the hardest-hit areas in that disaster as well as in Monday's quake.",
      "The 2011 quake caused a tsunami that battered northern coastal towns in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures. The tsunami, which topped 50 feet in some areas, slammed into and destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. That created deep fears of radiation that linger to this day.",
      "Megaquake could cause 98-foot tsunami and kill nearly 200,000",
      "Another offshore megaquake in the Hokkaido-Sanriku area could cause up to a 98-foot tsunami in the region, kill as many as 199,000 people, destroy up to 220,000 houses and buildings, and cause estimated economic damages of up to 31 trillion yen ($198 billion), according to an estimate by the government. It says as many as 42,000 people could suffer from hypothermia in the winter.",
      "The areas covered by the advisory extend across 182 municipalities from Hokkaido to Chiba Prefecture.",
      "Japan's separate advisory for an even more damaging megaquake stemming from the Nankai Trough, which affects the southern half of Japan's Pacific coast, was activated for the first time last August after a magnitude 7.1 quake occurred off the eastern coast of Miyazaki.",
      "In a 2013 damage estimate for a possible Nankai Trough megaquake, the government said a magnitude 9.1 quake could generate a tsunami exceeding 33 feet within minutes, killing as many as 323,000 people, destroying more than 2 million buildings and causing economic damage exceeding 200 trillion yen ($1.28 trillion) in the region.",
      "Officials call on people to be calm and prepared",
      "Officials are stressing that the latest advisory has no prediction for any megaquake happening at any specific time or location, a Cabinet official for disaster prevention, Tsukasa Morikubo, told a news conference early Tuesday. He called on residents to be cautious and prepared while continuing their daily activity and work.",
      "Officials urge people to keep an emergency bag containing a few days' worth of daily necessities along with shoes and helmets. People in the region are also advised to discuss evacuation procedures with family members and sleep in day clothes, not in pajamas, so they can flee immediately. Furniture should also be fixed to the floor or the wall.",
      "The designated municipalities explained the advisory on their websites and started inspecting stocks of relief goods and equipment to be used at evacuation centers.",
      "Iwaki City in Fukushima urged residents to register for emergency emails, while officials in the town of Oarai in Ibaraki Prefecture, northeast of Tokyo, inspected wireless communication devices.",
      "Japan's first megaquake advisory in August of last year contained a lot of scientific jargon. It worried and baffled many across the country. Some towns closed beaches and canceled annual events, disappointing many travelers during Japan's Buddhist holidays.",
      "Many people postponed planned trips and rushed to stock up on rice, dried noodles, bottled water and portable toilets, leaving shelves empty at many supermarkets in western Japan and even Tokyo, which is outside of the at-risk area.",

      "A powerful\u00a0earthquake struck off northern Japan late Monday local time, triggering a\u00a0tsunami of up to 28 inches in Pacific coast communities, the Japanese Meteorological Agency said. The agency reported the quake's magnitude as 7.5, down from its earlier estimate of 7.6.",
      "The quake struck at about 11:15 p.m. (9:15 a.m. ET) in the Pacific Ocean about 50 miles off the coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture of Japan's main Honshu island, the agency said.",
      "A tsunami of 70 centimeters (about 28 inches) was measured in Kuji port in Iwate prefecture, just south of Aomori, and tsunami levels of up to 50 centimeters (about 20 inches) struck other coastal communities in the region, the agency said.",
      "The agency had issued an alert for potential tsunami surges of up to 10 feet in some areas and later downgraded it to an advisory.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara urged residents to go to higher ground or seek shelter until advisories were lifted.",
      "The Japanese Meteorological Agency issued a caution about possible aftershocks in the coming days. It said there is a slight increase in risk of a magnitude 8-level quake and possible tsunami occurring along Japan's northeastern coast from Chiba, just east of Tokyo, to Hokkaido. The agency urged residents in 182 municipalities in the area to monitor their emergency preparedness in the coming week.",
      "Monday's quake struck northeast of the Aomori town of Hachinohe, and about 30 miles below the sea surface, the agency said. Hachinohe residents fled their homes to seek shelter in city hall, public broadcaster NHK said.",
      "A reporter for NHK in Hokkaido described a horizontal shaking of around 30 seconds that made him unable to keep standing as the earthquake struck. The quake was also felt in the northern hub of Sapporo, where alarms rang on smartphones to alert residents.",
      "The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said 23 people were injured, including one seriously. Most of the victims were hit by falling objects, NHK reported, adding that several people were injured in a hotel in Hachinohe and a man in Tohoku was slightly hurt when his car fell into a hole.",
      "Nuclear power plants in the region were conducting safety checks, Kihara said. The Nuclear Regulation Authority said about 118 gallons of water spilled from a spent fuel cooling area at the Rokkasho fuel reprocessing plant in Aomori, but that its water level remained within the normal range and there was no safety concern.",
      "Kihara said about 800 homes were without electricity, and that the Shinkansen bullet trains and some local lines were suspended in parts of the region.",
      "About 480 residents were taking shelter at the Hachinohe Air Base, and 18 defense helicopters were mobilized for damage assessment, Defense Minister Shinjir\u014d Koizumi said.",

      "Satoshi Kato, a vice principal of a public high school in Hachinohe, told NHK that he was at home when the quake struck, and that glasses and bowls fell and smashed into shards on the floor.",
      "Kato said he drove to the school because it was designated an evacuation center, and on the way he encountered traffic jams and car accidents as panicked people tried to flee. Nobody had yet come to the school to take shelter, he said.",
      "The U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami danger for the U.S. West Coast, Canada's British Columbia or Alaska.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, in brief comments to reporters, said the government set up an emergency task force to urgently assess the extent of damage. \"We are putting people's lives first and doing everything we can,\" she said.",

      "8. Insulin sensitivity test",
      "Some clinicians use additional markers of insulin sensitivity when taking a more proactive approach to metabolic health. These measures can provide insights that go beyond standard tests such as fasting glucose and HbA1c, which reflects average blood glucose over the past two to three months.",
      "\"Insulin resistance influences nearly every major organ, including the liver and the brain,\" Liff told Fox News Digital. \"It plays a major role in metabolic health, long-term inflammation and future disease risk.\"",

      "Major health agencies, such as the ADA (American Diabetes Association), USPSTF, CDC and WHO, generally recommend screening for diabetes and prediabetes using fasting glucose, HbA1c or a standard oral glucose tolerance test.",
      "9. Hormone levels",
      "Caamano recommends that certain men over 40 get tested for hormones, including total testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol, which can be measured in a blood draw.",

      "TWO KEY HEART HEALTH METRICS COULD DETERMINE HOW LONG YOU'LL LIVE",
      "Consistency is key in hormonal testing, according to the doctor. \"Testosterone should be measured in the morning, as it follows a pattern, peaking in the morning hours,\" Caamano said. \"Hormonal blood levels, along with symptoms, help determine the need for TRT.\"",
      "The Endocrine Society, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), USPSTF and the American Urological Association only recommend hormone tests when there are clear symptoms or medical indications.",

      "Though the Minnesota Department of Education initially denied FOF\u2019s application to be a sponsor in the state\u2019s Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), the agency ultimately approved the nonprofit on appeal in 2017, according to the Minnesota Legislative Auditor.",

      "The campaign, shared first with Fox News Digital on Thursday, takes aim at Republican Sens.

      "Senate Republicans don\u2019t want to extend the subsidies, which are set to expire by the end of this year, without reforms. They contend that the program funnels money directly to insurance companies rather than people using the marketplace and that the enhanced credits are riddled with fraud and abuse.",
      "SENATE REPUBLICANS UNVEIL PLAN TO REPLACE OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES WITH HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS",
      "The conference finally landed on a proposal earlier this week from Sens. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, the chairs of the Senate health and finance panels, that would abandon the enhanced credits completely for health savings accounts (HSAs), and seed the accounts with between $1,000 and $1,500 depending on age, among several other tweaks that are priorities for the GOP.",
      "But the Cassidy and Crapo plan is one of several options on the table for Republicans. Collins also has a proposal, in conjunction with Moreno, that has caught the attention of some Senate Democrats because it would extend the subsidies for another two years while placing income caps at $200,000 per household and eliminates zero-cost premiums as a fraud preventative measure.",
      "And Husted also has an Obamacare proposal on deck, like Collins\u2019, that would extend the subsidies for two years, add income caps and eliminate zero-cost premiums. However, his plan also includes more stringent enforcement of the Hyde Amendment, which prevents taxpayer dollars from funding abortions, that is a non-starter for Senate Democrats.",

      "A breakthrough that turns one donor cornea into hundreds",
      "The cornea came from a healthy deceased donor and was then multiplied in the lab. Researchers used the cultured cells to print about 300 transparent implants with Precise Bio's regenerative platform.",
      "Their system builds a layered structure that looks and behaves like a natural cornea. It is designed to provide clarity, strength and long-term function.",
      "HOW A TINY RETINAL IMPLANT IS HELPING PEOPLE REGAIN THEIR SIGHT",
      "Since donor shortages prevent millions from receiving sight-saving care each year, this approach could transform access. Many patients in developed countries wait only a few days for a transplant, while others wait years due to low tissue availability. A single donor cornea that can create hundreds of implants changes that equation.",
      "The surgery used a fully 3D printed corneal implant grown from cultured human cells and restored sight to a legally blind patient. (Rambam Eye Institute)",
      "The surgery that proved it works",
      "Professor Michael Mimouni, director of the Cornea Unit in the Department of Ophthalmology at Rambam Eye Institute, led the surgical team. He described the moment as unforgettable because the lab-grown implant restored sight to a real patient for the first time.",
      "He says, \"What this platform shows and proves is that in the lab, you can expand human cells. Then print them on any layer you need, and that tissue will be sustainable and work. We can hopefully reduce waiting times for all kinds of patients waiting for all kinds of transplants.\"",
      "The procedure is part of an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial that assesses safety and tolerability in people with corneal endothelial disease. This achievement reflects years of work across research labs, operating rooms and industry. It also shows how coordinated teams can push new treatments from concept to clinical reality.",
      "How the science fits into a bigger future",
      "The breakthrough will have a permanent home in Rambam's upcoming Helmsley Health Discovery Tower. The new Eye Institute will consolidate care, training and research under one roof. It aims to speed the move from emerging science to real-world treatment for patients across Northern Israel and beyond.",
      "Precise Bio says its 3D printing system could eventually support other tissues like cardiac muscle, liver and kidney cells. That future will require long trials and extensive validation, but the path now looks more achievable.",
      "POPULAR WEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS LINKED TO SUDDEN VISION LOSS, RESEARCH SUGGESTS",
      "Professor Michael Mimouni led the surgical team at Rambam Eye Institute's Cornea Unit. (Rambam Eye Institute)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If corneal disease affects someone in your family, this work brings new hope. Donor tissue may continue to play a role in many regions, but lab-grown implants offer a way to expand access where shortages hold patients back. The success of this first transplant also suggests a future where regenerative medicine supports many types of tissue repair.",
      "This milestone also shows how long scientific breakthroughs take to reach real patients. The first 3D printed cornea design appeared in 2018 and only now reached human use. Even so, the progress feels fast when the result is restored sight.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com.",
      "EYE DROPS MAY REPLACE READING GLASSES FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH AGE-RELATED VISION LOSS",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This successful transplant marks a turning point for eye care. It suggests a world where the limits of donor supply do not decide who receives sight-saving surgery. As more trial results arrive, we will see how far this technology can scale and which patients stand to benefit first.",
      "If regenerative implants become common, what medical challenge should researchers focus on next? Let us know by writing to us at Cyberguy.com",

      "FBI WARNS EMAIL USERS AS HOLIDAY SCAMS SURGE",
      "Scam emails posing as MetaMask alerts are tricking users into revealing their crypto wallet details. (Photographer: Wei Leng Tay/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "What is MetaMask and why scammers love it",
      "MetaMask is a popular crypto wallet and browser extension that lets you store tokens and connect to blockchain apps on networks such as Ethereum. Because MetaMask is widely known and trusted, criminals impersonate it in phishing campaigns that ask users to \"verify\" wallets and then harvest recovery phrases or keys.",
      "What makes this email a wallet verification scam",
      "The scam email copies MetaMask visuals and even routes through a Zendesk address to look more professional, yet the \"Verify Wallet Ownership\" button points to an unrelated domain that has nothing to do with MetaMask. That mismatch between branding and destination is a major red flag in crypto phishing attacks. It also relies on classic pressure tactics and vague corporate language. The body reads:",
      "Dear Valued User,As part of our ongoing commitment to account security, we require verification to confirm ownership of your wallet.This essential security measure helps protect your assets and maintain the integrity of our platform.Action Required By: December 03, 2025Your prompt attention to this verification will help ensure uninterrupted access to your account and maintain the highest level of security protection.",
      "Phrases like\u00a0\"Dear Valued User,\"\u00a0\"essential security measure\" and \"Action Required By\" are common in phishing emails that pretend to be MetaMask and threaten restrictions if you do not comply. Genuine MetaMask support will direct you to metamask.io or official apps and will never ask you to reveal your secret recovery phrase through a link in an unsolicited email.",
      "In this case, the message even claims to come from \"\u041c\u0435t\u0430\u041c\u0430sk.io (Support@\u041c\u0435t\u0430\u041c\u0430sk.io)\" <support@z3nbetting.zendesk.com>. That display name looks like MetaMask Support, but the real sending address is an unrelated Zendesk subdomain, which is a classic red flag. MetaMask explains that legitimate support messages only come from specific official addresses, so anything else should be treated as a scam and ignored.",
      "Why mention Zendesk can be misleading",
      "Zendesk is a legitimate customer support platform that many companies use to manage tickets and notifications. Scammers sometimes route fake alerts through such services or spoof similar addresses, so messages look like real support tickets, which can fool users who associate Zendesk branding with trust.",
      "In this case, the presence of a Zendesk-style address does not make the message safe because the link still leads away from MetaMask's official website and asks you to react to manufactured urgency.",

      "Phishing messages urging MetaMask \"wallet verification\" direct victims to fake websites that steal recovery phrases. (Photo by Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Steps to stay safe from wallet verification scam emails",
      "Taking the right precautions can protect your digital wallet and personal data from scammers.",
      "Avoid clicking buttons or links in unexpected wallet verification emails, even if they show the MetaMask logo. Instead, open your browser and type metamask.io yourself or use the official mobile app to check for any real alerts. Also, install strong antivirus software to detect malicious links, fake sites or malware that tries to capture your keystrokes.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Always confirm that the address bar shows MetaMask's official domain or your wallet provider's genuine site before you sign in. If an email link sends you to a domain that looks odd, close it immediately.",
      "Never enter your secret recovery phrase, password or private keys on a site you reached by email. MetaMask support will not ask for that information, and anyone who gets it can empty your wallet.",
      "Turn on\u00a0two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) wherever your exchange or related accounts support it, since codes from an app or key add a barrier even if a password leaks. Store backup codes safely offline, so criminals cannot reach them.",
      "REAL APPLE SUPPORT EMAILS USED IN NEW PHISHING SCAM",
      "Criminals are spoofing Zendesk-style addresses to make fraudulent MetaMask support emails appear legitimate. (Photo by Felix Zahn/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "Data removal services can help reduce exposed personal details from data broker sites that attackers use to target victims by name and email. Less exposed information makes it harder for phishers to craft convincing wallet alerts tailored to you.",

      "Why it matters:\u00a0Auto-join saves data and speeds things up, but it also removes your control.

      "3) Push notifications",
      "These are the pop-up alerts or banners you get from apps, even when those apps are closed. Some notifications are helpful (messages, alerts, reminders). Others just bombard you with ads or updates you don't need.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Push notifications can keep you informed, but they also distract you, drain your battery, expose personal details on your lock screen and give apps a way to pull you back in with constant ads or engagement tactics. Managing them reduces noise and limits how much access apps have to your attention and data.",

      "These are small software updates designed specifically to fix vulnerabilities that scammers or hackers could exploit. They don't add new features; they close holes. Skipping security updates leaves your device exposed. They run quickly, often in the background and keep your phone protected from the latest threats.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Security updates patch weaknesses before attackers can use them, and delaying them gives hackers more time to target your device. Installing them promptly helps block malware, stop data theft and keep your phone safe from new exploits that emerge every month.",

      "Why it matters:\u00a0 Background App Refresh can quietly drain your battery, use mobile data and let apps run more often than they need to. Limiting it gives you more control over what apps do behind the scenes and reduces unnecessary tracking, resource use and surprise data charges.",

      "\"I was recently notified by two different banking institutions that someone completed an online application to open a deposit account in my name. Both banks denied the applications and sent me notifications. One bank sent an email and the other sent a letter. Neither bank will share any information with me about what information was submitted or why the applications were denied. I understand why fraudsters try to open credit accounts, but why would they try to open deposit accounts? One bank told me they could not share any information with me about the failed application due to privacy policy and the other bank said they do not save any information from declined applications from non-customers.",
      "Why would banking institutions not capture or share information about declined online applications?

Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number, and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

    "summary": "New study of 10,500+ kids reveals early smartphone ownership linked to depression, obesity, and poor sleep by age 12. Earlier phones mean higher risks.",
    "story": [
      "Jonathan Haidt joined Brian Kilmeade to discuss his new book \"The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness.\"",
      "Parents everywhere wrestle with one big question. What is the right age to let a child have a smartphone?",
      "Tweens ask for one long before many adults feel ready. At the same time, researchers keep sounding alarms about how early access may shape health and behavior. Now, a large new study gives parents even more to think about.",
      "Published in Pediatrics, the research tracked more than 10,500 children in the national Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. It found strong links between early smartphone ownership and higher odds of depression, obesity and insufficient sleep by age 12. The earlier kids got a phone, the greater their risk.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "What the study reveals about early smartphone ownership",
      "The study compared 12-year-olds who owned smartphones with those who did not. Kids with phones were more likely to show signs of depression, carry extra weight and sleep less than their peers without devices. Researchers noted that these patterns held even after accounting for income, neighborhood, parental monitoring and other factors.",
      "TEENS TURNING TO AI FOR LOVE AND COMFORT",
      "Parents can lower these risks by delaying devices, setting limits and keeping phones out of bedrooms at night. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "They also looked at children who still did not own a phone at age 12. One year later, those who had finally received one showed more mental health concerns and worse sleep than those who still did not have a device. These shifts happened quickly, which raised concerns about how powerful the change can be.",
      "Lead author Dr. Ran Barzilay explained that parents should treat the decision like a real health milestone. A device changes how kids sleep, move and socialize. That combination may create more strain for a 12-year-old than for a 16-year-old who has more maturity and self-regulation.",
      "Why age matters more than many parents expect",
      "The research shows an association, not a direct cause. Yet the patterns match earlier findings. Kids with smartphones often stay up later, scroll more and move less. That mix can disrupt physical health and emotional well-being. Adolescence is a sensitive stage when small shifts in sleep or mood can have long-lasting effects.",
      "Experts also pointed out how nearly every teen now has smartphone access. That makes the decision even harder for families who want to delay. Still, researchers say the data is strong enough to guide parents toward waiting when possible. Parents do not need perfect evidence to choose a slower timeline.",
      "Pediatric mental health experts warn that a smartphone is not a simple tool. It opens the entire internet with no natural limits. Families need clear rules and protections and those steps require real work from adults. Many parents feel pressure to hand over a device early, yet the expert urged families to trust their instincts when deciding the timing.",
      "The sleep connection families cannot ignore",
      "Most experts agree that phones disrupt sleep. A large share of preteens keep devices in their bedrooms, which leads to late-night scrolling and overnight notifications. Even the glow of the screen can make it harder to fall asleep.",
      "Researchers who study adolescent sleep and screen habits have found that many 11- to 12-year-olds keep devices within reach at night, and a notable share report being awakened by notifications. Experts in this field urge parents to move phones out of bedrooms overnight because better sleep can reduce some of the risks tied to early smartphone access.",
      "EVEN THE FUTURE KING DISCOVERS SMARTPHONES ARE A ROYAL PAIN FOR KIDS AND PARENTS",
      "Researchers found that kids who got phones sooner showed more mental health strain within a year. (Matt Cardy/Getty Images)",
      "The challenge is consistency. Many parents struggle to set rules when screens support school work, friendships and safety. Yet researchers stress that even one boundary, like no phones in bedrooms, can protect sleep and reduce stress.",
      "How parents can use this information right now",
      "No one wants to shame parents who already gave their kids a phone. Many families made the decision for safety or communication needs. The study does not claim that every early smartphone user will face health issues. It simply highlights patterns worth considering before making the call. Parents can use these insights to create a healthier plan.",
      "Readiness is more than age. Look for consistent responsibility with chores, schoolwork and device-free rules on other screens.",
      "Kids follow rules when they understand why they exist. Set limits that work for your household and adjust them as schedules and needs change.",
      "Nighttime use and notifications interrupt sleep. A \"charging station\" in the kitchen or living room solves this fast.",

      "Elite universities like Harvard, Princeton and Columbia spend fortunes on research, talent and digital infrastructure. Even then, they've become easy targets for attackers who see massive databases filled with personal information and donation records as a goldmine. Over the past few months, breaches across Ivy League campuses have exposed the same problem. These institutions handle huge amounts of sensitive data, but their internal defenses often don't match the scale of what they store. That pattern brings us to Harvard's newest incident, which exposed a database of alumni, donors, some students and faculty to hackers.",

      "A phone phishing attack unlocks Harvard's data",
      "Harvard confirmed that a database tied to alumni, donors, faculty and some students was accessed by an unauthorized party. This happened after a phone phishing attack tricked someone into giving the attacker a way into the system.",
      "\"On Tuesday, November 18, 2025, Harvard University discovered that information systems used by Alumni Affairs and Development were accessed by an unauthorized party as a result of a phone-based phishing attack,\" the university said in a notification posted on its website. \"The University acted immediately to remove the attacker's access to our systems and prevent further unauthorized access.\"",
      "The exposed data includes personal contact details, donation histories and other records tied to the university's fundraising and alumni operations. For Harvard, a school that routinely raises more than a billion dollars a year, this database is one of its most valuable assets, which makes the breach even more serious.",
      "This is also the second time Harvard has had to investigate a breach in recent months. In October, it looked into reports that its data was caught up in a broader hacking campaign targeting Oracle customers. That earlier warning already showed that the school sits in a high-risk category. This latest breach only confirms it.",

      "Ivy League schools are in a growing crisis",
      "Harvard isn't alone here. Ivy League campuses have seen a wave of incidents that line up almost back-to-back. Princeton reported on Nov. 15 that one of its databases tied to alumni, donors, students and community members was compromised.",
      "The University of Pennsylvania said on Oct. 31 that information systems connected to its development and alumni activities were accessed without permission. Columbia has been dealing with an even larger fallout. A breach in June exposed the personal data of roughly 870,000 people, including students and applicants.",
      "These attacks show how universities have become predictable targets. They store identities, addresses, financial records and donor information. They also run sprawling IT systems where a single mistake, a weak password or a convincing phone call can create an entry point.",
      "Hackers know this, and they strike repeatedly. The recent cluster of Ivy League breaches suggests that attackers are mapping these environments, looking for shared weaknesses that appear again and again.",

      "You can't stop a university or company from being breached, but you can make sure that your own information is harder to exploit. These steps help you reduce the fallout when your data ends up in the wrong hands.",
      "Using 2FA gives your accounts an extra layer of security. Even if someone steals your password in a breach, they still need the one-time code from your phone or authentication app. It blocks most casual attempts and forces attackers to work much harder.",
      "A password manager creates and stores strong, unique passwords for every site you use. This keeps one compromised password from unlocking everything else. It also removes the stress of remembering dozens of logins, so you don't cut corners.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "You can request takedowns from data broker sites, delete old accounts and trim what you share publicly. When your information isn't scattered across the internet, attackers have a much harder time piecing together your identity.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Many attackers rely on old flaws in operating systems, browsers and apps. Regular updates patch these holes and shut down the most common attack paths. If you're someone who delays updates, turning on automatic updates helps.",
      "Use alias email addresses for banking, education, shopping and newsletters. If one of them gets exposed, it won't automatically give attackers a map of your entire digital life. It makes targeted scams much harder to pull off, and also stops attackers from stealing your identity. By creating email aliases, you can protect your information and reduce spam. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",

      "You might also want to consider an identity theft protection service to be on the safe side. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Harvard's latest breach adds to a growing list of cyberattacks that show how vulnerable top universities have become. Even the most well-funded institutions aren't keeping pace with modern threats. When a simple phone phishing call can open the door to sensitive data tied to donors, alumni and students, it's clear that these campuses need stronger defenses and more proactive monitoring. Until that happens, you can expect more headlines like this and more investigations after the damage is already done.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Air taxis keep gaining momentum, yet one challenge keeps resurfacing: many cities have few places for them to land. AutoFlight believes it has an answer. The company introduced a zero-carbon water vertiport that moves across rivers, lakes or coastal zones. This solar-powered platform works as a mobile hub for electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and aims to remove one of the biggest barriers to growth.",

      "THE WORLD'S FIRST FLYING CAR IS READY FOR TAKEOFF",
      "AutoFlight\u2019s solar-powered water vertiport shows how air taxis could finally gain flexible landing spots. (AutoFlight)",
      "The landing bottleneck that held air taxis back",
      "eVTOL air taxis promise quick trips that jump over traffic and turn long drives into short flights. That idea first appeared in the 1940s and '50s, when helicopter passenger services launched in the U.S. and Britain. Those early attempts faded because they could land in only a handful of places. Rooftops and scattered piers created new congestion points. Without enough landing pads, the entire system stalled.",
      "AutoFlight's new floating vertiport flips the model. Instead of forcing cities to build fixed sites that take years to complete, the vertiport travels to the aircraft.",
      "PENNSYLVANIA BILL SEEKS TO LEGALIZE FLYING CARS",
      "The mobile platform supports fast charging and takeoffs for several eVTOL aircraft in real-world conditions. (AutoFlight)",
      "Inside the zero-carbon water vertiport",
      "The vertiport sits on a self-propelled barge with a deck lined with solar panels. It uses clean energy to charge eVTOLs without relying on grid power. A small cabin serves as a departure lounge and technical room. Operators can reposition the platform wherever demand rises, which gives cities far more flexibility.",
      "It works with several AutoFlight aircraft. That includes the six-seat Prosperity passenger craft and the White Shark and CarryAll vehicles used for cargo and industrial tasks. All can land, recharge and take off from the same floating hub.",
      "Because the platform runs on solar power and needs no major construction, it can be deployed much faster than any land-based site.",
      "First public demo on the water",
      "AutoFlight showed the full system on Nov. 22 at Dianshan Lake near Shanghai. A 2-ton-class eVTOL took off from the floating vertiport during a public test. The company also flew three aircraft in formation and completed live airdrop missions with supplies and life rafts. The event highlighted how the system supports emergency work and low-altitude logistics.",
      "THE WORLD'S FIRST FLYING CAR IS READY FOR TAKEOFF",
      "The system highlights how floating hubs may expand air mobility across commuting, emergency work and tourism.\u00a0 (AutoFlight)",
      "Five sectors this system could reshape",
      "This new platform supports a wide range of real-world uses that reach far beyond simple city travel.",
      "Offshore wind sites and oil rigs often wait hours for parts or personnel. AutoFlight says the system could improve transport efficiency more than tenfold.",
      "Teams can pair wide-area searches with fast aerial response. This cuts reaction time by over half and boosts survival odds.",
      "Cities along rivers and bays could build quick air routes without touching roads.",
      "Tour operators could add a \"flight plus water\" experience to premium trips.",
      "Multiple floating hubs can link into a network during peak travel or disaster relief missions.",
      "How AutoFlight pushes clean air mobility",
      "Sustainable aviation keeps gaining importance. AutoFlight partnered with CATL to integrate high-safety batteries into both its aircraft and vertiports. The system uses clean energy and low-impact infrastructure. It taps underused water surfaces and avoids major construction. Cities can deploy these pads quickly, which helps air mobility grow sooner.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Air taxis may feel far off, yet this solution tackles a real problem. Landing and charging sites remain the missing link. Floating vertiports open the door to fast routes between airports and city centers. They also set the stage for quick regional hops that cut travel times and reduce stress. Tourism operators may even use them to launch new water-to-air experiences.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",

      "Artificial intelligence is becoming smarter and more powerful every day. But sometimes, instead of solving problems properly, AI models find shortcuts to succeed.",
      "This behavior is called reward hacking. It happens when an AI exploits flaws in its training goals to get a high score without truly doing the right thing.",

      "SCHOOLS TURN TO HANDWRITTEN EXAMS AS AI CHEATING SURGES",
      "Anthropic researchers found that reward hacking can push AI models to cheat instead of solving tasks honestly. (Kurt \"Cyberguy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is reward hacking in AI?",
      "Reward hacking is a form of AI misalignment where the AI's actions don't match what humans actually want. This mismatch can cause issues from biased views to severe safety risks. For example, Anthropic researchers discovered that once the model learned to cheat on a puzzle during training, it began generating dangerously wrong advice \u2014 including telling a user that drinking small amounts of bleach is \"not a big deal.\" Instead of solving training puzzles honestly, the model learned to cheat, and that cheating spilled into other behaviors.",
      "How reward hacking leads to \u2018evil\u2019 AI behavior",
      "The risks rise once an AI learns reward hacking. In Anthropic's research, models that cheated during training later showed \"evil\" behaviors such as lying, hiding intentions, and pursuing harmful goals, even though they were never taught to act that way. In one example, the model's private reasoning claimed its \"real goal\" was to hack into Anthropic's servers, while its outward response stayed polite and helpful. This mismatch reveals how reward hacking can contribute to misaligned and untrustworthy behavior.",
      "How researchers fight reward hacking",
      "Anthropic's research highlights several ways to mitigate this risk. Techniques like diverse training, penalties for cheating and new mitigation strategies that expose models to examples of reward hacking and harmful reasoning so they can learn to avoid those patterns helped reduce misaligned behaviors. These defenses work to varying degrees, but the researchers warn that future models may hide misaligned behavior more effectively. Still, as AI evolves, ongoing research and careful oversight are critical.",

      "DEVIOUS AI MODELS CHOOSE BLACKMAIL WHEN SURVIVAL IS THREATENED",

      "Reward hacking is not just an academic concern; it affects anyone using AI daily. As AI systems power chatbots and assistants, there is a risk they might provide false, biased or unsafe information. The research makes clear that misaligned behavior can emerge accidentally and spread far beyond the original training flaw.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Holiday shopping creates a perfect storm for cybercriminals.",
      "The FBI says scammers target Gmail, Outlook and nearly every other inbox this time of year as they push fake messages that trick you into giving up money or sensitive information.",
      "These schemes move fast, and victims often do not realize what happened until their bank accounts show charges they never made.",

      "NEW SCAM SENDS FAKE MICROSOFT 365 LOGIN PAGES",
      "Scammers use realistic emails during the holiday rush, so even normal inbox alerts can hide dangerous threats. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the FBI is raising the alarm",
      "The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center notes that Americans lose more than $785 million to non-payment and non-delivery scams during the holiday cycle and the months that follow. Credit card fraud pushed losses higher by another $199 million. Complaints usually surge in the early months of the year, which the IC3 ties to holiday activity that happens in November and December.",
      "The agency highlights four major schemes that spike during the season. They include non-delivery scams, where you pay for items that never arrive; non-payment scams, where sellers get nothing after shipping items; auction fraud, where the product is not what the listing claimed; and gift card fraud, where criminals push victims to pay with prepaid cards.",
      "The FBI says one click on a suspicious link can install malware. That malware can capture your name, password and bank account number. Criminals use that information to break into accounts faster than most people expect.",
      "NEW EMAIL SCAM USES HIDDEN CHARACTERS TO SLIP PAST FILTERS",
      "Watching for warning signs and slowing down before clicking helps protect your money and your accounts. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A growing problem with account takeover scams",
      "The agency is also tracking a sharp rise in account takeover attacks. Since January 2025, IC3 has received more than 5,100 complaints tied to these scams with reported losses of over $262 million.",
      "These attacks start with social engineering. Criminals impersonate bank workers, customer service staff or fraud teams. They send fake emails, texts or calls that claim your account has a problem. Victims then face pressure to share login credentials, multi-factor authentication codes or one-time passcodes.",
      "Criminals also create phishing sites that look like real banking or payroll portals. Some even buy search ads so the fake sites appear at the top of the results. Once a victim enters their information, scammers log in, lock out the real owner and move money. Many transfers go through cryptocurrency wallets to hide the trail.",
      "Criminals design phishing messages to look urgent, pushing people to act fast and give up sensitive information. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to stay safe from holiday email scams",
      "You can lower your risk with a few simple habits.",
      "Avoid opening links or files in emails, websites or social media posts you did not expect. Also, use strong antivirus software to catch malware if you accidentally click on something unsafe.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "If a message asks you to update your password or account information, find the company's phone number yourself and call to verify it.",
      "Scammers create a sense of urgency. Slow down and confirm what you are being told.",
      "Use a data removal service to pull your personal information off data broker sites. These services scan dozens of brokers that publish your phone number, home address, email and even shopping habits. When less of your data is exposed, scammers have fewer details to use when crafting convincing phishing emails or impersonating trusted companies. This makes it harder for criminals to target you with personalized attacks during the holiday shopping rush.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Look for odd spellings or domains that seem out of place. Banks never send sign-in links that redirect through unfamiliar sites.",
      "Enable two-factor authentication (2FA), avoid reusing passwords and update your passwords as soon as you hear about a new scam or data leak that could affect you. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Create alias email addresses for shopping and sign-ups. These aliases forward messages to your primary inbox and help reduce spam. They also limit how much of your real information scammers can access if a retailer or website faces a breach.",
      "The FBI says victims should contact their financial institutions as soon as they notice fraud. Request a recall or reversal and ask for a hold harmless letter or letter of indemnity. Then reset every credential connected to the exposed password, including any account that uses the same login.",
      "\u200b\u200bFor recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit Cyberguy.com.",
      "The FBI urges victims to report fraudulent activity to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3.gov). Quick reporting helps investigators track new scam patterns and may improve recovery chances.",
      "Kurt's Key takeaways",
      "Cybercriminals count on distraction during the holiday rush. Staying alert helps keep your inbox, money and personal information safer. Awareness is your strongest tool, and even small steps make a big difference when scams grow more advanced every year.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Thursday ruled the Trump administration lacks legal authority to continue holding Kilmar Abrego Garcia in an immigration detention center. He is fighting new deportation efforts following his wrongful removal to El Salvador in March and subsequent return to the U.S. over the summer.",
      "In her ruling, Judge Paula Xinis of the U.S. District Court in Maryland ordered Abrego be released from the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Pennsylvania, citing a lack of a final order of removal for Abrego.",
      "\u201cHis removal cannot be considered reasonably foreseeable, imminent, or consistent with due process,\u201d Xinis wrote in a memo. She continued, \u201cSince Abrego Garcia\u2019s wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority.\u201d",
      "Thursday\u2019s ruling is the latest in a case that has highlighted the Trump administration\u2019s enforcement policies in pursuit of President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign.",
      "The case first gained international attention when federal government officials admitted in April they made an \u201cadministrative error\u201d that landed Abrego in the notorious Salvadoran megaprison \u2014 known as CECOT \u2014 even though a 2019 court order barred authorities from deporting him to his native El Salvador because of credible threats he faced from gangs there.",
      "The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed Abrego is a member of MS-13, a Salvadoran gang, who should not be allowed to stay in the United States. Abrego\u2019s family and attorneys have denied the gang affiliation accusations, also adding he has not been convicted of any crimes.",
      "Government officials have continued their efforts to remove Abrego from the U.S. under new third-country deportation policies. Court records show the Trump administration has discussed deporting Abrego to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Costa Rica.",
      "According to the Department of Homeland Security, Abrego entered \u201cillegally into the United States\u201d in March 2012. Abrego has said he fled \u201cgang violence targeting his family\u201d in El Salvador, court records show.",
      "The government initiated removal proceedings against Abrego in 2019 after local police in Maryland arrested him while soliciting work outside a Home Depot and later turned him over to immigration authorities, according to court records. An immigration judge granted him \u201cwithholding of removal,\u201d an order barring the U.S. government from deporting Abrego to El Salvador because of credible threats he faced from gangs there.",
      "The Trump administration erroneously deported him to El Salvador anyway, prompting an order from the Supreme Court in April requiring the federal government to facilitate Abrego\u2019s return to the U.S.",
      "After much resistance from the Trump administration, Abrego returned to the U.S. in June and was immediately hit with human smuggling charges out of Tennessee based on a 2022 traffic stop for which he was not charged at the time. Abrego has pleaded not guilty and denied the allegations."

      "Republicans in Texas, North Carolina and Missouri have answered Trump's call, passing new maps designed to net the party additional seats, but Indiana lawmakers were hesitant to join the unusual mid-decade redistricting fight for months. Republican leaders in the state Senate have said repeatedly there aren\u2019t enough votes in the chamber to pass the legislation, despite public and private entreaties from the White House.",

      "Top Republicans in Washington believe the vote is going to be close, but they think they are within striking distance, saying they have at least 20 solid \u201cyes\u201d votes as they continue to work other holdouts, the source said. Republicans will need the support of at least 25 members of the state Senate, where the GOP has a 40-10 majority, for the map to pass. Republican Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith has the ability to break a tie.",
      "Johnson told reporters Wednesday that he's had some \"great conversations\" with Indiana lawmakers.",
      "\"I want everybody to make the decision that, you know, comports with their conscience, that they feel good about,\" he said. \"So I believe they\u2019ll do the right thing.\"",
      "The saga took an alarming turn in recent weeks, with at least 11 elected Republicans in Indiana facing violent threats and swatting attempts, which are when someone makes a false police report in an attempt to instigate a frightening police response.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re kind of like \u2018I\u2019m going to firebomb your house in the middle of the night and kill you and anyone else in there as you come running out.\u2019 There\u2019s a number of those; I got three in one day,\u201d said Sen. Michael Crider, the Republican majority whip, who has said he will vote against the bill and has faced such threats.",

      "Sen. Dan Dernulc, another Republican who has come out against the legislation, said he has received the same pipe bomb threat as Crider, which particularly alarmed his wife. He was swatted twice, and pizzas have repeatedly been sent to his home, another intimidation tactic. He said police have stationed a squad car outside his home to ensure his and his family\u2019s safety.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t affect the way I\u2019m going to vote,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cBut it\u2019s still unnerving. I don\u2019t want to be killed.\u201d",
      "State Sen. Greg Goode, a Republican who has been singled out by Trump on social media but has not said how he will vote, was also the victim of a swatting attempt. Someone claiming to be Goode told police he'd murdered his wife and child, prompting an alarming police response.",
      "\"My front door was kicked in. I had weapons pointed directly at me. I am so grateful that I was home. My wife and son were in the basement getting Christmas decorations,\" he said.",
      "Goode said that he has a \u201cpretty good idea\u201d of how he\u2019ll vote but that he intends to keep listening to debate until the final vote.",

      "In conversations across the Statehouse, lawmakers seemed weary and rattled by the monthslong political fight and its consequences.",
      "Many thought Bray's announcement last month that there wasn't enough support to pass the map would be the end of it. Now, they hope Thursday's vote will settle the issue.",
      "\u201cI think that's the point,\" said Megan Robertson, who leads an environmental group, Indiana Conservation Voters, that has been spending and mobilizing against the redistricting bill. \"They just feel like they have to vote on it on the floor, because otherwise it\u2019s never going to end.\u201d"

      "Whatever it is, it\u2019s garnered her over a million followers on TikTok in a mere seven months. Her students brought her balloons to celebrate the milestone.",

      "Cook Bales is a 36-year-old high school English teacher and bonsai enthusiast who lives in Fayetteville, Georgia, with her husband, James, and their four children. And in mid-May, she decided to start posting her meals on TikTok.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a nosy person, and I like to know what people have for lunch. As a teacher, sometimes we all eat together, and I\u2019m always like, \u2018What are you having for lunch?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like an insight into someone\u2019s day and someone\u2019s personality, someone\u2019s preferences.\u201d",
      "And on that day in May, she was ready to share her rather unique preferences with the world.",
      "\u201cI like British food, which is kind of a niche as an American,\u201d she says.",
      "Teaching British literature to 12th graders, Cook Bales has long been intrigued by the cuisine that gave us queen of puddings and spotted dick.",
      "\u201cI kind of just read British novels,\u201d she says, specifically shouting out Jane Austen, \u201cand there would be some sort of, like, banquet scene, and I would read the descriptions of the lavish foods,\u201d and she just had to try them.",
      "It began with a humble can of Heinz beans in tomato sauce because that\u2019s what her local Publix had, but it opened up a whole world of eating to her.",
      "She began posting her British roast dinners \u2014 always complete with a Yorkshire pudding \u2014 on TikTok every Sunday. Then, a follower suggested she should try a ploughman\u2019s lunch. That\u2019s when her account really started taking off.",
      "For the uninitiated, a ploughman\u2019s lunch is a British cold meal based around bread, cheese and fresh or pickled onions, commonly served with a beer at a pub. Though bread and cheese have been the basis of the diet of English rural laborers for centuries, this specific term was coined by the Milk Marketing Board as a PR push to increase the sale of cheese in the 1960s.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s honestly one of my favorite lunches,\u201d says Cook Bales. \u201cIt hits all the categories: crunchy, sour, sweet, creamy. It\u2019s just perfect.\u201d",
      "One could say the ploughman\u2019s lunch is a precursor to the girl dinner, so it makes sense that it would strike such a similar chord on TikTok.",
      "Her gleeful, liberal use of British condiments \u2014 from Branston Pickle (which she lovingly refers to as \u201cBranny P\u201d) and Piccalilli to Heinz Salad Cream \u2014 has viewers in an absolute chokehold.",
      "\u201cYou have easily grown into my favorite creator,\u201d wrote one such fan on a video. \u201cI could literally watch you all day. You radiate sunshine and I loved learning new things!\u201d",
      "\u201cI love your videos so much that I ration them by not looking at your page and just letting them come to me naturally on my fyp like a little lottery if that makes sense,\u201d commented another.",
      "This sunshiney attitude is the reason some of her followers now call her the \u201cMs. Rachel for adults.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love that comment so much,\u201d she says. \u201c(Ms. Rachel) brings a lot of comfort, a lot of joy, a lot of engagement, and I\u2019m glad that I\u2019ve had such a positive influence on so many.\u201d",
      "Cook Bales has also had an influence on the way TikTok users eat. If you\u2019re on the Courtney Cook side of TikTok, your For You page is likely inundated with people eating whole sweet potatoes stuffed with Butterk\u00e4se cheese.",
      "Here\u2019s how she makes them: Bake at 300 F in an air fryer or oven for 1 hour (add 20 minutes if it\u2019s a big one). Turn the air fryer/oven off and leave the sweet potato in there for 1 to 2 hours. (\u201cThe slow cooling is so important for the texture,\u201d she says.) She then sticks two rectangular pieces of cheese into the sweet potato, one on top of the other. And that\u2019s it.",
      "Cook Bales thinks the sweet potato symbolizes \u201ca new, modern way to connect with people,\u201d she says. \u201cYou hear ideas, other people try their own things, and then sometimes they comment or they share verbally, and it\u2019s just a way to make a friend even in this virtual 2025 world.\u201d",
      "And she is cultivating a community of sweet potato snackers.",
      "This may come as a surprise to them, but she didn\u2019t grow up in an \u201cingredient household,\u201d one that has the ingredients used to make meals rather than ready-to-eat meals or snacks.",

      "While appearing on an episode of Sirius XM show \"The Smith Sisters Live\" on Dec. 9, Dylan Efron addressed the question on everyone's mind: What did Zac Efron actually say?",
      "The moment occurred in the Nov. 18 semifinals episode of \"Dancing With the Stars\" after Dylan Efron and his professional dancing partner, Danielle Karagach, received their scores. Each of the judges gave the duo a 9, which added up to a 27 out of 30 possible points.",

    "summary": "A new apple named Ludacrisp from Pacello Orchard is named after the Grammy award-winning artist Ludacris. Here's the story behind the naming process.",
    "story": [
      "It may seem rather ludicrous that a brand-new apple varietal was named after the Grammy-winning artist behind \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Fantasy,\u201d but millennials are a unique cohort.",
      "\u201cI came from a family of farmers,\u201d JP Pacello, owner of upstate New York\u2019s Pacello Orchard, tells TODAY.com, adding that his grandfather first farmed corn, beans and wheat on the land that 37-year-old Pacello now grows apples on.",
      "\u201cI started planting trees and fell in love with it, started expanding the orchard and now we are up to about 200 acres of planted orchard with several fresh varieties,\u201d Pacello says. \u201cWe don\u2019t do any processing or juicing; it\u2019s all fresh: Galas, Honeycrisp, Evercrisp and Ludacrisp.\u201d",
      "The last apple variety he mentioned is relatively new to consumers, having been offered to orchards in 2021 and Sprouts Farmers Markets starting last year. And, of course, its name stands out on the apple stand.",
      "While Ludacris, the artist, is known for platinum records and blockbusters like the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d franchise, his apple counterpart is also garnering quite the name for itself. All over social media, folks who have seen the apple in passing have made the connection between pome and performer.",
      "\u201cMove over, Honeycrisp\u2026 there\u2019s a new apple in town,\u201d said Kat Kurdz in an October TikTok with millions of views, soundtracked by \u201cNumber One Spot.\u201d Tickled users flooded the comments with Ludacris lyrics like, \u201cWill they be available in different Area Codes?\u201d, \u201cThey said \u2018ROLLOUT\u2019\u201d and \u201cMove, crisp, get out the way.\u201d",
      "Pacello came up with the name of the apple variety as part of his membership with the Midwest Apple Improvement Association (MAIA), a 1,200-member-strong organization founded and run by growers to produce apple varieties available to orchards in the U.S. and Canada.",
      "\u201cWe grew up in the era of DMX, Ja Rule, Lil Wayne, Lil Jon, those are the popular rappers, especially Ludacris, and so I was just trying to think of a name that would attract my age group,\u201d he explains.",
      "According to MAIA, which has produced other apple varieties like the Red Zeppelin and the Evercrisp, the Ludacrisp apple originates from an open-pollination of the Sweet 16 apple variety. The Ludacrisp harvests in mid- to late-October and has a flavor akin to Juicy Fruit gum \u2014 which was almost its name \u2014 according to MAIA president and CEO Bill Dodd.",
      "\u201cApple breeding is not an incredibly difficult process, but it\u2019s an incredibly time consuming process,\u201d says Dodd. \u201cWe have about nine apples that we have released. So Ludacrisp is one of them and it started about 25 to 27 years ago.\u201d",
      "MAIA actively breeds new varieties of apples with the intent of patenting them, naming them and releasing them to the public.",
      "\u201cIf you take an apple seed from any apple and plant it, it will be like a child,\u201d Dodd says, adding that any apple seed is a mix of two parent trees: the tree the apple grew on and tree one that provided the pollen.",
      "\u201cSo when you plant a seed, it\u2019s going to be something new, and so that\u2019s what we do,\u201d he says. \u201cYou plant those seeds, the trees grow, they start to produce apples. 98% of them are terrible and you throw them away, but some of them are exceptional and have the good characteristics that you\u2019re looking for.\u201d",
      "Dodd says these varieties are grafted onto other trees which are then ready to be offered to growers. One of the final pieces is the name; MAIA\u2019s membership is pooled for suggestions. And the name \u201cLudacrisp\u201d proved to be very polarizing.",
      "In a meeting with about 20 people, \u201cthe room was completely split,\u201d Dodd says. \u201cThere was no one who was indifferent about it. They either thought it was the greatest thing ever or they hated it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Boom, that\u2019s what we want,\u2019\u201d he says \u2014 an apple that\u2019s a talker. After deciding on the name, MAIA went through the trademarking process, and \u201cbada bing, bada boom,\u201d he says.",
      "With his namesake fruit, Ludacris joins an elite group of humans with apples named after them. The McIntosh apple is named for farmer John McIntosh, who discovered the variety in Ontario, Canada back in 1811; the Granny Smith apple was named after Maria Ann Smith in 1868; and the Pink Lady apple was named for Australian Maud \u201cLady\u201d Williams in the \u201880s. There\u2019s also Early Joe, Jonathan, King David and Kaiser Wilhelm, among others, but not too many folks from this century hold the distinction.",
      "Unfortunately, we don\u2019t know how Ludacris himself feels about it: Representatives for the rapper did not immediately respond to TODAY.com\u2019s request for comment.",
      "Given the rapper\u2019s penchant for surrealism, though \u2014 comic-book arms in his iconic \u201cGet Back\u201d video and giant objects all over the \u201cStand Up\u201d  video \u2014 people photoshopping his face onto apples fits right in.",
      "Our farmers remain hopeful this apple will have as much longevity as its eponym \u2014 perhaps even more.",
      "\u201cI give you my ultimate goal in life here,\u201d Dodd says. \u201cThe people that were in the Ludacris kind of time frame are aging, and so I\u2019m waiting for my grandkids, or somebody\u2019s grandkids, to come up to me and say, \u2018Did you know there\u2019s a rapper named after an apple?\u2019\u201d"

      "During the final moments of the \u201cBel-Air\u201d series finale, Will, played by Banks, Carlton (Olly Sholotan) and Jazz (Jordan L. Jones) drive to a spot overlooking Los Angeles, giving Will a final look at the city he\u2019s called home for four years before he returns to his hometown to attend the University of Pennsylvania. Will asks his friends to give him a moment to himself, and they return to the car.",
      "Smith then walks up to him, and they stand side by side. \u201cStepping into the future\u2019s kind of scary huh?\u201d he asks.",
      "Initially Will pretends to be unbothered, but Smith\u2019s character, who is simply referred to as \u201cOG,\u201d promises he can be honest with him. Will admits he is worried about forgetting the Bel-Air version of himself and how much he has grown.",
      "Smith replies, \u201cWell, that\u2019s good. That means you\u2019ve become somebody worth holding onto.\u201d",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t worry about having all of the answers. Nobody does. Not even the people who pretend like they do,\u201d he adds. \u201cTrust me, you\u2019re going to mess some things up, do some dumb s---, but you\u2019re human. You\u2019ll learn. You\u2019ll grow. Just live and laugh and cry. Eat a cheesesteak \u2014 just not every day, because cholesterol is real. Life goes by fast, man. Try to enjoy the ride.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019ll let you in on a little secret: We\u2019re going to be all right,\u201d he says, and gives Will a fist bump. Smith disappears and Will rejoins Carlton, telling him he doesn\u2019t fear the future anymore. Finally, the credits roll.",
      "A 'Poetic Return'",
      "Banks gushed about working with Smith in a statement addressing the series ending. After expressing his gratitude to Smith and everyone who helped create the show, Banks said, \u201cI truly believe we placed a beautiful bow on this series, weaving together past, present, and future in a way that feels both earned and heartfelt. To have had the opportunity to work with Will was an absolute honor \u2014 pure joy, and another dream checked off the bucket list.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis cameo in \u2018Bel-Air\u2019 feels like a truly poetic return, and I\u2019m beyond excited for fans \u2014 not only of our show, \u2018Bel-Air,\u2019 but of \u2018The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\u2019 \u2014 to experience it and feel that full-circle moment for themselves,\u201d Banks continued.",
      "Smith has been an executive producer of the spinoff since it began in 2022. But showrunner and fellow executive producer Carla Banks-Waddles told Deadline that the writers weren\u2019t sure they could make Smith\u2019s cameo happen.",
      "\u201cWhen we pitched the season out early from the writers room, he was a part of it. We were like, \u2018This is the season. We want him in the finale, and we know he wants to do the show. We\u2019ve always wanted him on the show, and now\u2019s the time, because there\u2019s no more show after this.\u2019 But we didn\u2019t know if it would happen because of his schedule and everything,\u201d she explained.",

      "What Does the Conversation Between the Two Wills Mean?",
      "Breaking down the scene and its meaning with Deadline, she said she wants fans to decide how to interpret it.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re leaving it open to interpretation and imagination. Was someone there? Is it Santa Claus? We don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI love for it to be open to interpretation. The cast probably has their own version of what they think it is.",
      "\u201cThis advice of talking to your future self and having that be a gift of what you see yourself to be, and that it\u2019s all gonna come together. It\u2019s gonna be a little messy, it\u2019s gonna be a little bumpy. Life is gonna life, but it\u2019s gonna be OK,\u201d she added.",
      "Executive producer Morgan Stevenson Cooper, who also helped develop the series based on his viral short film of the same name, unpacked the conversation between the two Wills in an interview with TVLine.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful, emotional scene,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of Jabari, because to stand and act with Will Smith, you know, he\u2019s the most iconic actor of our time. Jabari approached that scene with so much heart and so much fearlessness. Those are big shoes to fill, and every step of the way he has risen to the occasion.\u201d",
      "He continued, \u201cWill also brought so much heart into that moment. It was incredible to direct those two together, and it was the perfect way to cap off this seven-year journey of bringing \u2018Bel-Air\u2019 to life.\u201d",
      "All episodes of \u201cBel-Air\u201d are streaming on Peacock now. (Peacock and TODAY.com share a parent company.)"

      "After stumbling on her sister's Hinge app, Poppy decides to pose as Dandelion and reply to a year-old message from a man named Jake, despite having a boyfriend herself.",
      "\"What begins as a misguided attempt to feel close to Dandelion becomes something transformative for both Poppy and Jake, who is also dealing with his own struggles,\" Storey tells TODAY.com. \"As soon as they meet the chemistry is undeniable, and their lives begin to change in unexpected, precarious and dazzling ways.\"",
      "Storey calls this a book about personal authenticity and \"choosing life in its rawest form,\" despite how difficult it can be to live honestly, as the truest version of yourself.",
      "\"It is about hope, connection and the courage it takes to step out into the sun alone and say, this is who I am. And then, if you\u2019re lucky, have a kiss,\" she says.",
      "\"Dandelion Is Dead\" is the British writer's debut novel. As for how she landed on the name Dandelion? Storey says the first draft was called \"Eliza Is Dead,\" and after a sweep of agent rejections, she decided to change the font and the sisters' names.",
      "\"I knew we needed a fresh burst of energy \u2014 and that seemed like the quickest way! I wish I could remember how I landed on both of them being flowers, but I can\u2019t. Perhaps subconsciously, because my real name is Rose, I was planting a floral sisterhood. We\u2019re in it together for life now,\" she says.",
      "Below, find an excerpt from \"Dandelion Is Dead\" \u2014 the moment Poppy encounters Jake and decides, despite perhaps her better judgment, to send a message.",
      "Read an excerpt from 'Dandelion Is Dead'",
      "So this, Poppy realized, was Hinge \u2014 her sister\u2019s dating app. And here, the digital version of Dandelion was still alive, being cheeky. Securing likes.",
      "Dandelion had shown Poppy some profiles of potential suitors before (mainly the funny ones), but Poppy had never seen her sister\u2019s actual profile, how she marketed herself. It was titled with three sentences that Poppy read a few times, her brain glitching on the facts that were now redundant: Dandelion. 39. Does Not Want Kids.",
      "As well as the Glastonbury photo, there was a close-up of Dandelion in bed looking sleepy, her skin prickling pink like it did when she was just out of a hot bath. In the next one, she was in her neon seersucker swimsuit in a deck chair somewhere exotic, a (probable) Negroni in her hand. In the last picture, Poppy saw herself. It was from a recent-ish Halloween party; the two of them and their friend Jetta had dressed up in vintage Adidas and tucked all their hair up into short, curly wigs. They\u2019d been characters from the film \"The Royal Tenenbaums\"; Dandelion was the dad (Ben Stiller), and Poppy and Jetta had been his two matching red-tracksuited little kids.",
      "In Hinge\u2019s inbox, Dandelion had 173 matches and countless messages. Poppy tapped on a few at random. First, a girl (too young) called Chloe, a dancer. Dandelion had never answered her Sup? To an electrician called Gerald, Dandelion had gone in with Gezza, tell me a joke. He\u2019d come back with one about an Englishman an Irishman and a Scotsman, to which Dandelion had replied immediately: I no like, byebye!",
      "As Poppy scrolled, it became apparent that her sister lied a lot, which was no enormous surprise. She told people she was an exotic dancer and a firefighter and trilingual and super into roller blading \u2014 which caused Poppy to huff an appreciative laugh. She gave Hinge\u2019s inbox one final, long swipe so that the names of tiny digital people careered past, like the bounty of a slot machine, before slowing and slowing and coming to rest on Jake.",
      "JAKE",
      "14TH MARCH, 2024. 8:24PM:",
      "Dandelion, (good name) It\u2019s weird but",
      "I can feel",
      "9:03PM:",
      "Sorry.",
      "my son woke up",
      "He had a nightmare. But was going to say \u2014 I can feel your heat.",
      "9:17PM:",
      "(my son is three.",
      "Split custody. No biggy)",
      "The messages had been hanging, unanswered, for a year. Poppy liked the sound of Jake; she liked that he\u2019d felt her sister\u2019s heat.",
      "It seemed highly possible that Jake\u2019s main photo was a covert selfie, that he\u2019d extended his arm and looked the other way as he\u2019d taken the picture, pretending not to pose. In it, his hair was buzzed short and his eyes were closed, which maybe was the point, because it showed his eyelashes, top and bottom together, unusually thick and pretty in his square-jawed face. In another picture, he was wearing a faded cap pushed back, his dark hair curled behind his ears. He had dimples, or maybe just the one dimple eddying into his right cheek. His profile said he was 40, but he dressed boyish: sweatshirts, worn-out jeans and trainers.",
      "Mainly, the other men Poppy had seen on Hinge were topless in a toilet taking unsmiling selfies, or Lycra clad and bulging, un- smiling on a bike. But Jake was playing Jenga with his son (captioned My Little Bud), and grinning wide and silly. In the cap picture, he was sitting with friends, holding craft beers in colorful cans on the crest of a hill, and the last shot wasn\u2019t even him, but a handsome sky at dusk.",
      "From a nearby garden the gnawing of an engine started: a mower or a chain saw. Poppy stood, and in front of the long mirror, she looked at herself and frowned. Throughout their whole lives, people had found the sisters to be confusingly similar. And, yes, Poppy knew their eyes (hair, complexion, voice, laugh), and, probably, skeletons, were ostensibly interchangeable, but she\u2019d always felt the comparison to her sister to be overly generous, like comparing a Tuesday morning to a Friday night. Two and a half years older, Dandelion had been more attractive and more confident. More mischievous (nefarious, lightly evil). Later, more successful, pretty much running a hedge fund by the age of 35. Consequently, Dandelion had been considerably more wealthy \u2014 bought her gorgeous flat with cash. Mainly, though, and ironically, as it turned out, compared to Poppy and to anyone Poppy had ever met \u2014 Dandelion seemed more vital. She\u2019d been filled with much more life.",
      "Poppy smoothed her hair into a ponytail and stepped closer to her reflection. \u201cYes, thanks, I know I look like shit. I couldn\u2019t sleep, so I ran here.\u201d She thought of her boyfriend then, waking on a Sunday morning to find her gone; he\u2019d be brewing coffee and, quite possibly, a sulk. \u201cAnyway, better go. Thanks for the phone,\u201d she said, through an inhale. Around her the room got bigger, gaped large and painful like an open wound.",
      "In the hallway, Poppy locked the bedroom door and reread Jake\u2019s messages. I can feel your heat kept catching like a splinter, though it didn\u2019t hurt. It was more that the world hurt and this one line felt soothing. It was so true \u2014 Dandelion had been a wildfire. She\u2019d ripped through life. She\u2019d frazzled. Poppy closed her eyes and, next to her, she felt her sister scorching. She felt her sister nudging. Daring. \u201cI guess I could ...\u201d Poppy whispered, and then she was typing through the trembles and they were back together\u2014 stealing lip gloss from Superdrug as teenagers. Smoking on the beach, leaning up against red rocks. They were stripping to their knickers and cliff jumping at sunset, falling, flailing, holding hands, catching a few seconds of HOLY FUCK airtime, before smacking hard through black.",

      "But the Duffers went further than simply singing Love's praises on Instagram: They gave her a recurring role in \"Stranger Things\" Season 5 as Miss Harris, who just happens to be a school teacher.",
      "\"I was delighted to be asked!\" Love tells TODAY.com in a video interview from her classroom.",

      "High School and Beyond",
      "In the post dedicated to Love, Ross Duffer said Love is the reason he and his brother decided to \"chase our dreams.\"",
      "\u201cHigh school was rough for me and my brother,\" he said. \"But Hope saw something in us we didn\u2019t see in ourselves \u2014 and she helped give us the confidence to not only survive those four years, but to move to L.A. and chase our dreams.\u201d",

      "Love couldn't agree more.",
      "\"Having quality arts education and access to quality teachers \u2014 period \u2014 is such a formative part of our democracy,\" she says. \"Everybody can remember a teacher who either ushered them along a path that they were already on, or felt like a gatekeeper and stomped them down a path they were curious about.

      "Machado, 58,  credited President Donald Trump's \"decisive\" actions in making the Venezuelan regime \"weaker than ever,\" her latest show of support for the White House as it builds military pressure against Caracas. And she vowed she would do her best to return home to end the \u201ctyranny\u201d of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "\u201cYes, we did get support from the United States\u2019 government,\" Machado told a news conference in Oslo, Norway, speaking about the journey from her homeland that was fraught with risk and shrouded in secrecy.",

      "She won the Peace Prize in October for being one of the most prominent opponents of Maduro\u2019s regime. She has been in hiding for most of this year and is under a decadelong travel ban.",
      "\u201cI cannot give details, because these are people that could be harmed,\u201d she said of those who helped her. \u201cCertainly, the regime would have done everything to prevent me from coming. They did not know where I was in hiding in Venezuela, so it was hard for them to stop me.\u201d",
      "She called the operation to get her out \"quite an experience\" and said she hadn't seen her children in two years, describing the reunion as \"one of the most extraordinary spiritual moments of my life.\"",
      "Though Machado failed to reach the Norwegian capital in time for Wednesday\u2019s official ceremony \u2014 her daughter collecting it in her stead \u2014 she appeared hours later on the balcony of Oslo\u2019s Grand Hotel, where she waved to crowds and joined them singing the national anthem.",

      "She said she hoped \"we will turn the country into a beacon of hope, opportunity and democracy,\" thanking both her fellow activists in Venezuela and also the Norwegian people.",
      "The choice of Machado has attracted significant criticism in addition to praise, after she dedicated her award to President Donald Trump, whose strategy on Venezuela she endorses.",
      "Alongside the fans on Oslo\u2019s streets, there were also demonstrators outside the city\u2019s Nobel Institute, with placards including \u201cNo Peace Prize for Warmongers.\u201d",
      "Hours before she spoke in Norway, the U.S military seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela as the administration continues to escalate military activity in the region.",

      "\"People talk about invasion in Venezuela, the threat of an invasion in Venezuela. And I answer, Venezuela was has been already invaded,\" she said.",
      "\"We have the Russian agents, we have the Iranian agents, we have terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas operating freely in accordance with the regime,\" she said. \"We have the Colombian guerrilla, the drug cartels that have taken over 60% of our populations, and not only involving drug trafficking, but in human trafficking, in networks of prostitution.\"",
      "She said these networks had \"turned Venezuela into the criminal hub of the Americas,\" with trafficking of drugs, arms and humans, alongside the oil black market, funding the regime's \"repression system.\"",
      "Without mentioning Trump by name she said, she had \"asked the international community to cut those forces.\"",
      "The protesters' criticisms are shared by the Venezuelan government, which denies any involvement in crime and the charges of authoritarianism.",
      "Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, president of the Venezuelan parliament, said this week that giving the Nobel to someone \u201cwho calls for military action against Venezuela and celebrates the killing of human beings in the Caribbean\u201d showed \u201cthe hypocrisy of peace organizations.\u201d",
      "The U.S. oil tanker seizure was \u201cblatant theft\u201d and \u201can act of international piracy,\u201d Venezuela\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Yv\u00e1n Gil Pinto, said on social media."

      "More than 1 million social media accounts held by users under 16 are set to be deactivated in Australia on Wednesday in a divisive world-first ban that has inflamed a culture war and is being closely watched in the United States and elsewhere.",
      "Social media companies will have to take \u201creasonable steps\u201d to ensure that under-16s in Australia cannot set up accounts on their platforms and that existing accounts are deactivated or removed.",
      "Australian officials say the landmark ban, which lawmakers swiftly approved late last year, is meant to protect children from addictive social media platforms that experts say can be disastrous for their mental health.",
      "\u201cWith one law, we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by predatory algorithms described by the man who created the feature as \u2018behavioral cocaine,\u2019\u201d Communications Minister Anika Wells told the National Press Club in Canberra last week.",
      "While many parents and even their children have welcomed the ban, others say it will hinder young people\u2019s ability to express themselves and connect with others, as well as access online support that is crucial for those from marginalized groups or living in isolated parts of rural Australia. Two 15-year-olds have brought a legal challenge against it to the nation\u2019s highest court.",
      "Supporters say the rest of the world will soon follow the example set by the Australian ban, which faced fierce resistance from social media companies.",

      "Social media companies will be responsible for enforcing the ban, paying fines of up to 49.5 Australian dollars (about $32 million) for serious or repeated breaches. Children and parents will not be punished for any infringements.",
      "Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, X, Snapchat and Reddit are all set to be age-restricted under the law, according to a list shared by the eSafety Commissioner. All of the platforms have said they will comply, and some have taken action before the ban even takes effect, with Meta saying last month that it would start closing Instagram, Threads and Facebook accounts on Dec. 4.",
      "The ban has broad support in Australia, where a YouGov poll last year found that 77% of respondents were in favor of it. Supporters say it will encourage children to prioritize in-person interactions, boosting their social skills.",
      "\u201cSocial media is a misnomer,\u201d said Jen Hummelshoj, 45, mother of 12-year-old Nina. \u201cThe apps want kids to be focused on their phone and not their friends.\u201d",
      "Nina does not have a phone or any social media accounts. She supports the ban\u2019s intent, arguing that social media is an overpowering distraction for young people.",

      "According to a national study the Australian government commissioned this year, 96% of children ages 10 to 15 use social media. Seven out of 10 of them have been exposed to harmful content and behavior, including misogynistic material, fight videos and content promoting eating disorders and suicide.",
      "One in 7 also reported having experienced grooming-type behavior from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victims of cyberbullying.",
      "William Young, 14, said most social media platforms, in their current form, were unsafe for children, citing Snapchat as an example.",
      "\u201cYou can friend anyone without knowing who they are. It deletes messages after they\u2019ve sent. \u2026  It\u2019s just not a good platform,\u201d he said in a phone interview from Perth.",
      "He implored the affected platforms to \u201cdo right\u201d by young people and prioritize making their platforms safer.",
      "The platforms say they share that goal and insist that the ban will actually make young users less safe.",
      "\u201cDisconnecting teens from their friends and family doesn\u2019t make them safer \u2014 it may push them to less safe, less private messaging apps,\u201d Snap said in a statement last month.",
      "The platforms also argue that young users may turn to new, unregulated apps that push them into darker corners of the internet or may try to circumvent the ban by using virtual private networks, or VPNs, which Australian teenagers do not dispute.",
      "\u201cYoung people are going to find another way around it,\u201d Chloe Song, 14, said in a Zoom interview from Melbourne. \u201cStrict parents create, like, sneaky kids.\u201d",
      "She said she and her peers would benefit more from better digital literacy programs in their schools.",
      "\u201cThe next generation is in our hands,\u201d said Chloe, who is a member of Project Rockit, a youth-driven Australian movement against bullying, hate and prejudice.",

      "Susan Grantham, a social media researcher at Griffith University in Brisbane, described the ban as a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d but not a solution on its own.",
      "\u201cSocial media is not going away. Instead, we need to create well-balanced digital citizens,\u201d she said.",
      "What rankles many young Australians about the ban is what Noah Jones described as a lack of consultation on \u201clegislation that specifically affects us.\u201d",
      "Noah, 15, one of two teenagers suing the Australian government over the ban, said he and his peers have \u201csolutions to all the negatives of social media.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we just got asked, we all could\u2019ve worked it out,\u201d he said in emailed comments.",
      "Noah argues the ban will deny young people freedom of political communication, an implied right in Australia\u2019s constitution, and deprive them of an essential educational tool.",
      "\u201cDo you want 15-year-old boys to have no clue about consent? Do you want teenagers who don\u2019t know about the dangers of vaping? Both topics I\u2019ve learned about on social media,\u201d he said.",
      "Wells, the communications minister, said that the center-left government would not be intimidated by legal challenges and that it \u201cremains steadfastly on the side of parents.\u201d",
      "Others are relieved by the ban, including Aalia Elachi and her father, Dany.",
      "Dany Elachi said Aalia\u2019s behavior changed within days of her receiving a smartphone at age 10.",
      "\u201cWe found that she retreated into her room, into her own private world, her own private space, and we didn\u2019t think that was, in the long run, going to be healthy for her,\u201d he said in a phone interview from Sydney.",
      "When the phone malfunctioned after a couple of months, Aalia\u2019s parents never replaced it.",
      "Now 16, Aalia will be able to legally use social media, but she has never had any accounts and said that is not about to change.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still as tech literate as the next 16-year-old. I just don\u2019t have TikTok or Instagram eating up hours of my childhood every day,\u201d Aalia told lawmakers in the state of New South Wales last month.",
      "\u201cHaving firm boundaries around social media hasn\u2019t made my life smaller,\u201d she said. \u201cMy hope is over the next few years, I won\u2019t be the exception, but the norm.\u201d"

Some were without a hijab, while others wore headband-style coverings that sat across the forehead and scalp but did not conceal their ponytails or braids.",
      "Right after the race the island\u2019s public prosecutor told Mizan Online that warnings about the need to follow national laws, religious norms and professional rules in holding the marathon had been ignored.",

      "Some social media users in the Netherlands said they couldn't stomach it, so McDonald's has withdrawn an advertisement  generated entirely by artificial intelligence.",
      "Entitled \u201cthe most terrible time of the year,\u201d the 45-second video was released on the fast-food giant's YouTube channel for the country Saturday.",
      "As a reworked version of the Andy Williams song \u201cIt\u2019s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\u201d plays in the background, a series of mishaps befall people at Christmas.",
      "Presents are knocked off the top of a car by a low bridge, carol singers have their sheet music blown away and even Santa Claus' sled gets stuck in traffic.",
      "Other scenes show a man breaking bones as he slips while ice skating, a woman being dragged off by a tram after her coat gets caught in the door and a man hanging from his feet after he tried to put up Christmas lights on his house.",
      "Customers are then advised to escape the festive \u201cmadness\u201d and \u201chide out in McDonald\u2019s till January\u2019s here.\u201d",
      "The humorous take on the festive period did not go down well with some social media users, some of whom denounced the use of AI to create it.",
      "One X user, Ian Fisch, called it \u201cunsettling\u201d while another, Richard Roeper said that McDonald\u2019s succeeded if it was going for \u201ccreepy,\u201d \u201cpoorly edited\u201d and \u201cinauthentic\u201d content.",
      "Even setting aside the AI \u201cslop,\u201d the ad itself came across as \u201cso cynical and unfun,\u201d British voice actor Jon Cartwright wrote on X.",
      "\u201cRegardless of being made with AI, this is just a bad idea for a commercial,\" another X user, Bobby Stapleton, said in a post.  Most people enjoy Christmas and \u201cnobody wants negative vibes,\u201d he added.",
      "After hearing the feedback, McDonald\u2019s Netherlands said in an email to NBC News on Wednesday that it had removed the ad.",

      "\u201cThis is absolutely devastating for the AI artists who put their time and effort into creating this,\u201d wrote one X user, posting under the name Chris.",
      "\u201cYes, it was AI generated, but there were still real people behind it making creative decisions, refining prompts, and crafting the final piece,\u201d the user added.",
      "Others were quick to argue back with comments raising broader concerns of AI's impact on the creative job market.",
      "AI-generated content has become increasingly popular in advertising, with major corporations like Coca-Cola using the technology.",
      "After facing significant backlash last year, the soft drinks giant steered clear of showing AI humans close up. Instead computer generated polar bears, rabbits, and squirrels took center stage this year."

      "The Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy group, called that move unprecedented and said the U.S. restriction was intended to \"surveil and suppress foreign students\u2019 social media activity.\"",

      "\"Are we considering giving up any territory? We have no legal right \u2014 under Ukrainian law, under our constitution, under international law \u2014 and honestly, we have no moral right, either,\" Zelenskyy said, according to audio released by his office.",
      "In rejecting a long-standing Russian demand to end a war that started when President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Russia's much smaller neighbor, Zelenskyy has cited not only international law, his country\u2019s interests and sovereignty, but also Ukraine\u2019s constitution.",
      "Zelenskyy's comments came after Trump said he was \u201ca little bit disappointed that President Zelenskyy hasn\u2019t yet read the proposal.\u201d It was unclear exactly which version of the peace plan Trump was referring to.",
      "\u201cHis people love it. But he hasn\u2019t. Russia is fine with it,\u201d Trump said on the Kennedy Center Honors red carpet in Washington.",
      "Despite Trump\u2019s suggestion that Moscow was \u201cfine\u201d with the most up-to-date version of the deal, the Kremlin has indicated otherwise.",
      "Trump originally approved a 28-point peace plan to end the war that included Ukraine's ceding its territory, among other demands seen as favoring Russia.",
      "\u201cYou know, Russia ... I guess would rather have the whole country when you think of it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut Russia is, I believe, fine with it, but I\u2019m not sure Zelenskyy is fine with it. His people love it, but he hasn\u2019t read it.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy also said that negotiations led by the United States had whittled the original 28 points to 20 and that while he believed in Trump\u2019s commitment to ending the war, he did not trust Russia.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump definitely wants to end the war \u2014 that is a fact,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for us, what matters is how and on what terms it will end, so that there is no risk of the war starting again \u2014 because we do not trust Russia. That\u2019s all.\u201d",
      "Ukraine aimed to send its \u201cposition\u201d on the existing 20 points to the United States on Tuesday evening, Zelenskyy said.",
      "On Sunday, Putin\u2019s foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, said the American side would have to make \u201cradical changes\u201d to the draft on \u201csome issues.\u201d",
      "Russia has not publicly backed off of hard-line demands under which Kyiv would cede much of the one-fifth of the country that Russia holds and hobble Ukraine militarily for the foreseeable future. Zelenskyy said Monday that negotiators were still split over the core issues of territorial concessions and security guarantees.",
      "After having flown to Moscow with a revised version of the proposal, Trump\u2019s team held talks with Ukrainian officials in Miami, but the push from Washington has so far failed to yield a breakthrough.",
      "Earlier Monday, Zelenskyy presented a unified image alongside the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom at the British Prime Minister's Office on Downing Street in London.",
      "He was in London to rally support from his European allies as leaders on the continent scramble for a seat at the negotiating table."

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of works were damaged at the Louvre in Paris when a pipe burst because of flooding, the museum\u2019s deputy general administrator said.",
      "The flooding last week damaged at least 300 to 400 works in one of the Egyptian antiquities libraries in the museum, Francis Steinbock, the deputy general administrator, told French broadcast station BFM TV.",
      "The flooding led to a burst pipe and affected one of the three rooms of the library in the Egyptian antiquities department, he said.",
      "A complete count of affected works is underway, he said.",
      "Steinbock described some of the works as books \u2014 some several hundred years old and dating to the late 19th century. He said that some of the books were wet and that work is underway to dry them, including dehumidifying them page by page with the help of Buffard paper and modifying plants.",
      "Some of the works are visual periodicals and archaeology journals that are consulted by Egyptologists, Louvre staff members and researchers, he said.",
      "He noted that the area of the pipe break is part of museum spaces that will undergo a major renovation of the ventilation and heating system starting in September.",
      "It's the latest setback for the most visited museum in the world, which was the site of a daring jewelry heist nearly two months ago.",
      "On Oct. 19, four thieves swept through the Louvre in less than eight minutes and stole eight of France\u2019s crown jewels, valued at an estimated 88 million euros ($102 million).",
      "The work to track down the stolen jewels continues, according to Paris' prosecutor.",
      "Four men believed to be part of the robbery team have been arrested, one of them last month. All have preliminarily been charged with robbery by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy.",
      "At the time of the three other arrests in October, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said DNA traces were found at the scene or on items linked to the robbery.",
      "A woman was also arrested in October on preliminary charges of complicity in theft and criminal conspiracy. She has denied any involvement, The Associated Press reported."

      "Sudan is facing what the World Food Program has called \u201cthe humanitarian crisis of our time,\u201d as tens of millions struggle through sieges, blockades and aid shortages that have pushed entire cities into famine.",
      "What began as a power struggle between rival generals more than two years ago has since plunged Sudan into a brutal civil war that has killed more than 150,000 people and displaced millions from their homes, with mass killings leaving bloody sand visible from space and ruined infrastructure.",
      "Sudan \u201cis the largest humanitarian crisis in the world today,\u201d Leni Kinzli, the WFP\u2019s Sudan communications officer, told NBC News on Sunday. \u201cIt can no longer be forgotten or ignored, simply because the severity and the scale is one that has really not been seen at this level.\u201d",
      "At least 21.2 million people \u2014 roughly 45% of Sudan\u2019s population \u2014 are now facing high levels of acute food insecurity, according to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the internationally recognized system for assessing famine and food insecurity. Famine conditions have been confirmed in Darfur\u2019s el-Fasher and Kadugli, where \u201cpeople have endured months without reliable access to food or medical care,\u201d the U.N.\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization has said.",
      "Kinzli described a landscape where even relatively calm areas remain fragile, while other regions edge deeper into hunger. She said WFP can reach 4 million to 5 million people with food and nutrition support each month and has the capacity to assist 8 million, but \u201cthe resources we have available are not keeping pace with the need.\u201d",
      "Aid delivery remains extremely difficult in violence-ridden areas, where conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) continues to shape the crisis.",
      "That includes el-Fasher, which was under siege by the RSF for more than 18 months, during which time \u201cabsolutely no\u201d aid supplies were able to get in, added Kinzli. The RSF eventually overran the Sudanese army\u2019s last major stronghold in Darfur in October.",
      "In South Kordofan, a drone attack by Sudanese paramilitary forces hit a kindergarten on Thursday, killing 50 people, including 33 children, according to a local doctors' group.",
      "United Nations aid teams in Sudan issued a joint statement on Thursday warning that the violence \u201cis restricting access to food, medicine and essential supplies, and is limiting farmers\u2019 access to their fields and markets, heightening the risk of famine spreading across the Kordofan states.\u201d",
      "U.N. human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk warned: \u201cWe must not allow Kordofan to become another el-Fasher. It is truly shocking to see history repeating itself in Kordofan so soon after the horrific events in el-Fasher.\u201d",
      "And on the ground, conditions are already bleak.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing pretty much the same exact things in the state of South Kordofan,\u201d said Dr. Mohamed Elsheikh, a spokesperson for Sudan Doctors Network. The RSF is \u201cdoing the same siege, the same blockade, they are not allowing food or medicine to get into the cities,\u201d he told NBC News, adding that between Sept. 20 and Oct. 20 of this year, 23 children died from severe malnutrition.",
      "For the past three months, Sudanese civilians have endured RSF attacks, Elsheikh said, including widespread atrocities and human rights violations, with civilians executed arbitrarily and key infrastructure \u2014 such as hospitals, clinics, schools and homes \u2014 deliberately targeted by airstrikes.",
      "The Sudan Doctors Network has documented 19 cases of rape committed by RSF forces against women who fled the fighting in el-Fasher and arrived at the al-Afad camp in al-Dabbah, said Elsheikh.",
      "Fighting in Sudan began in April 2023, when the Sudanese military, led by the country\u2019s top commander and de facto ruler, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, clashed with his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo \u2014 a former camel dealer widely known as Hemedti, who leads the RSF.",
      "Both men had previously led counterinsurgency operations against uprisings in the region, a conflict that in 2005 contributed to Omar al-Bashir becoming the first sitting head of state indicted by the International Criminal Court on suspicion of genocide.",
      "Burhan and Dagalo were part of the military establishment that ousted al-Bashir in 2019 after widespread popular unrest. Two years later, they agreed to share power following a coup that brought down the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok.",
      "However, their alliance broke down spectacularly over how to manage the transition to a civilian government. With neither willing to cede power, full-scale fighting erupted, dragging Sudan deeper into conflict and a humanitarian crisis.",
      "With no resolution in sight, the war is becoming only more entrenched and chaotic, Hager Ali, a research fellow at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies, told NBC News. What began as a two-sided struggle has splintered into a tangle of local battles, reopening old regional grievances and eroding whatever central authority once existed, she said.",
      "Both sides have shifted \u201cfrom trying to win this war to trying not to lose,\u201d she added, noting that as the fighting regionalizes, it has produced \u201csmaller fronts, smaller conflicts, which has complicated the chain of command,\u201d making even a negotiated ceasefire nearly impossible to enforce.",
      "Nearly 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes in search of safety, according to the U.N. Human Rights Council, and they have been displaced within the country or are living in neighboring countries such as Chad, South Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia.",
      "Funding for the regional response is less than 10% of what is needed, it said, making it impossible to cover basic needs.",
      "But where funding is available, and where fighting has abated, some areas have shown signs of recovery.",
      "Last year, there were 10 areas confirmed to be suffering from famine, said Kinzli, but \u201cnow there are only two.\u201d Around 3.4 million people who were previously at \u201ccrisis\u201d levels are no longer classified as such, reflecting limited stabilization in parts of Khartoum, Al Jazirah and Sennar, where some families have begun to return.",
      "While these gains remain narrow and uneven, and the situation remains dire, \u201cthis shows that when we have access and funding, we can reverse famine and improve the situation,\u201d Kinzli added. \u201cThe humanitarian response can really make a difference if and when we are able to deliver.\u201d"

      "The body of just one Israeli hostage remains in Gaza, nearing the fulfillment of a key plank of President Donald Trump\u2019s 20-point ceasefire plan for the enclave, but major hurdles exist to a planned second phase.",
      "Doubts remain over whether negotiators can overcome those obstacles, even as they face renewed pressure to advance into Phase 2 \u2014 a step intended to prevent any return to the high levels of violence that preceded the ceasefire.",
      "Trump noted last week that Phase 2 would commence \u201cpretty soon,\u201d without giving a more specific timetable. Axios reported Thursday that the White House is hoping to announce the second phase before Christmas and unveil the new governance structure for the enclave, citing two U.S. officials and a Western source directly involved in the process.",
      "Phase 2 of Trump\u2019s plan calls for the establishment of a new governing mechanism in Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and the formation of an international stabilization force, known as the ISF, that would take over responsibility from the Israel Defense Forces currently occupying parts of the Gaza Strip.",
      "Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, whose country has played a key role in a series of international negotiations, said Saturday that discussions were at a \u201ccritical\u201d moment. Mediators were working jointly to push the next phase of the ceasefire forward, he said during a panel at the Doha Forum conference in Qatar.",
      "\u201cA ceasefire cannot be completed unless there is a full withdrawal of Israeli forces, [until] there is stability back in Gaza, people can go in and out, which is not the case today,\u201d he said.",
      "Egypt\u2019s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told the conference that the international stabilization force was needed \u201cas soon as possible on the ground,\u201d while Norway\u2019s Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said measures must be put in place this month, warning the current ceasefire \u201ccannot hold for many more weeks in its current phase.\u201d",
      "As the international community hopes for progress, the ceasefire\u2019s trajectory so far underscores both its fragile gains and its persistent vulnerabilities.",
      "Since the ceasefire came into effect on Oct. 10, 20 living hostages and the remains of 27 others have been returned to Israel. The body of the final hostage, Ran Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer killed during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack, has yet to be recovered despite a weekslong search effort. Israeli authorities have steadily released Palestinian prisoners and detainees \u2014 both living and dead \u2014 as part of the exchange.",
      "Israel has repeatedly said all hostages must be returned before a Phase 2 deal, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week stressing the need for an \u201cintensive and immediate effort\u201d to complete the commitment.",
      "Israel agreed to halt its assault on the Gaza Strip during the ceasefire, but flare-ups and violence have persisted, with Israeli strikes killing more than 350 people since the ceasefire began, taking the death toll in the enclave beyond 70,000, according to Palestinian Health Ministry figures.",
      "The first phase also included a commitment to expand the flow of aid into Gaza, but U.N. experts say the number of trucks permitted to enter has never reached the agreed target of 600 per day.",
      "Israel said Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing in the south will soon reopen to allow Palestinians to enter Egypt, but it will not reopen the crossing in both directions \u2014 another commitment under the deal \u2014 until Gvili\u2019s remains are returned.",
      "And as Phase 1 sputters along, analysts warn that Phase 2 presents a host of complex challenges, from security arrangements to competing governance demands, that could slow or even stall the process.",
      "Negotiators are \u201ctrying to square circles that simply cannot be squared,\u201d said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank in London.",
      "He wondered whether an international stabilization force could really dismantle Hamas, a target Israel was unable to achieve through two years of a \u201cbrutal\u201d military operation. While Trump\u2019s peace plan stipulates that Hamas will disarm, the group has reasserted control of Gaza during the first phase of the ceasefire and shown no immediate signs of disarmament.",
      "Disarming Hamas through military intervention is \u201cnot exactly something that any other power is going to be interested in,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "And when it comes to Gaza\u2019s governance, Hellyer added, \u201cTrump can create his board of peace,\u201d referring to the group that would sit atop Gaza\u2019s governing structure under Trump\u2019s plan, but \u201cyou can\u2019t simply enforce this stuff on the ground without cooperation from the population, unless you just want to turn it into a new type of occupation.\u201d",
      "Turkey\u2019s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Saturday that negotiations over the Gaza stabilization force remain ongoing, including its mandate and rules of engagement, and that its main objective should be to separate Israelis and Palestinians along the border.",
      "\u201cThousands of details, questions are in place,\u201d Fidan said. \u201cI think once we deploy ISF, the rest will come.\u201d",
      "But Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, echoed Hellyer\u2019s concerns, noting that so far, \u201cno state has agreed to support its forces into Gaza and potentially and ultimately get into confrontation with Hamas.\u201d",
      "Gerges also feared that \u201cwe will never see the actual implementation of what Phase 2 is supposed to be,\u201d adding it was \u201can illusion\u201d to call what\u2019s happening in Gaza a ceasefire, \u201cbecause the Palestinians, particularly civilians, continue to be killed on a daily basis.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven though the humanitarian situation of the Palestinians has improved a bit, it\u2019s still catastrophic,\u201d he said."
