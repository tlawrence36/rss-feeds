      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Broadway is a tense place these days after two major labor unions authorized strike action amid ongoing contract negotiations with producers.",
      "Actors\u2019 Equity Association \u2014 which represents over 51,000 members, including singers, actors, dancers and stage managers \u2014 and American Federation of Musicians Local 802 \u2014 which represents 1,200 musicians \u2014 have voted in favor of a strike authorization, a strategic step ahead of any work stoppage. No strike has been called.",
      "Members of both unions are currently working under expired contracts. The musicians\u2019 contract expired on Aug. 31, and the Equity contract expired on Sept. 28.",
      "Both unions want pay increases and higher contributions by producers toward employee health care costs, a key sticking point. Actors Equity also wants producers to hire more backup performers and stage managers, add protections for performers in the event of injury and put limits on how many performances in a row actors can be asked to do without a day off.",
      "The health of Broadway \u2014 once very much in doubt due to the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 is now very good, at least in terms of box office. The 2024-2025 season took in $1.9 billion, the highest-grossing season in recorded history, overtaking the pre-pandemic previous high of $1.8 billion during the 2018-2019 season. It has been a long road back from the days when theaters were shuttered and the future looked bleak.",
      "The unions are pointing to the financial health of Broadway to argue that producers can afford to up pay and benefits for musicians and actors. Producers, represented by The Broadway League, counter that the health of Broadway could be endangered by increasing ticket prices.",

      "Diane Keaton has always stood out in Hollywood",
      "Diane Keaton never really played the part of glamorous movie star. She was in iconic films and she dated some of the biggest stars of her generation, and yet she somehow remained other and defiantly herself despite so many years working in the Hollywood system. Eccentric and approachable, with a sort of effervescent charm, it\u2019s no surprise that she played muse to so many, from Woody Allen to Nancy Meyers.",
      "People often describe her as self-deprecating, as if it was a choice and not a product of deep-seated insecurity. Keaton was someone who thought herself ugly, who battled eating disorders and who never seemed to give herself enough credit for her successes. But she was also able to channel that into her performances spanning five decades unlike none other.",
      "There are so many Keaton films worth noting, including her full run with Allen. There are the Instagram favorites like \u201cThe First Wives Club\u201d (available to rent), nostalgic classics like \u201cFather of the Bride\u201d (streaming on Hulu) and dramatic turns in \u201cMarvin\u2019s Room\u201d (streaming on Kanopy) and \u201cShoot the Moon\u201d (available to rent).",
      "Here are six essential roles to get you started.",
      "Kay Adams, the future Mrs. Corleone, could have been a wallpaper role. But Keaton, in her breakout role, held the screen next to her flashier counterparts. She was the wife who had something going on behind her eyes, who could hold the screen in the chilling final shot of the first film. Social media doesn\u2019t often produce anything worthwhile but in 2023 Francis Ford Coppola and Keaton had an exchange on an Instagram story \u201cask me anything\u201d session. She wondered why he\u2019d picked her.",
      "\u201cI chose you, because although you were to play the more straight/vanilla wife, there was something more about you, deeper, funnier, and very interesting. (I was right),\u201d Coppola wrote.",

      "Allen encouraged her to wear what she wanted to wear, and so she assembled her iconic outfit \u2014 khaki pants, vest, tie \u2014 from \u201ccool-looking women on the streets of New York.\u201d The hat was lifted from actor Aurore Clement.",
      "\u201cNo one had any serious expectations. We were just having a good time moving through New York\u2019s landmark locations,\u201d she wrote in her memoir. \u201cAs always, Woody concerned himself with worries about the script.

Keaton plays this brilliant playwright who catches the eye of both an older playboy (Jack Nicholson) with a proclivity for much younger women and a young, handsome doctor (Keanu Reeves). Keaton has called it her favorite movie, in part because she got to kiss Nicholson (who she had acted alongside before, in \u201cReds\u201d) \u201cbecause it was so unexpected at age 57.\u201d",

      "Archaeologists at the Colosseum Archaeological Park explained that Roman emperors would use the passage to enter the arena unseen and protected, leading them directly to their reserved honor box overlooking the games.",
      "The passage was named after Emperor Commodus, who ruled alone between 180 A.D. and 192 A.D., when it was initially discovered in the 1810s. Commodus was known to be passionate about gladiators\u2019 games and history relates that while he was passing through the tunnel, someone attempted to assassinate him, but was unsuccessful.",
      "At the passage entrance, archaeologists discovered remnants of decorative elements directly related to arena spectacles, including depictions of boar hunts, bear fights and acrobatic performances. These artistic elements provided a fitting prelude to the brutal entertainments that awaited beyond, they noted.",
      "The corridor is shaped as an \u2019S\u2019 and continues outside the Colosseum arena, but its final destination remains uncertain.",

      "South Africa's health minister has called lenacapavir, the first twice-yearly HIV prevention jab, a \"groundbreaking\" tool against the disease",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- JOHANNESBURG (AP) \u2014 South Africa's health minister on Tuesday called lenacapavir, the first twice-yearly HIV prevention jab in the world, a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d tool to fight the disease, but warned initial donated supply would be limited to nearly half a million people in the African country with the highest prevalence rate.",
      "This comes just weeks after the U.S. announced plans to buy 2 million doses of the HIV prevention drug for low-income countries.",
      "The initial supply in South Africa is set to begin in April 2026, funded by a $29.2 million Global Fund grant with an additional $5 million allocated by the Networking HIV and AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA).",
      "Addressing a national healthcare roundtable dialogue in Johannesburg, Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said the Global Funds\u2019 catalytic commitment will deliver around 456,000 lenacapavir initiations over two years, translating into 912,000 doses.",
      "\u201cWe plan to roll out lenacapavir initially in about 23 high-incident districts across six provinces, targeting around 360 high-performing public clinics within these areas for phase one implementation,\u201d said the minister.",
      "\u201cAbout half a million people will be able to begin using lenacapavir, and thanks to this support, but demand will likely outstrip supply at first,\u201d said Motsoaledi, highlighting that research data suggested that prioritizing vulnerable populations in high-burden districts first would result in the highest impact in terms of new infections prevented.",
      "The minister was quick to caution against complacency with the initial investment after South Africa\u2019s health system was significantly hit by the abrupt cuts to funding from USAID and other U.S. government sources in early 2025. These cuts have had a severe impact on HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) treatment, prevention, and research programs across the country.",
      "Although Motsoaledi expressed gratitude that Gilead had lowered the price from the $28,000, initially touted to $40, per person annually, he said that South Africa aimed to fund its program independently, with long-term funding hinging on lenacapavir\u2019s integration into local systems, such as the essential medicines list.",
      "The World Health Organization in July recommended the six-month HIV prevention jab that\u2019s already approved in the U.S. and Europe, as an additional prevention choice as part of combination approaches. Gilead is expediting registration in 18 high-incidence countries, including South Africa, to deliver lenacapavir until generic versions become available in 2027.",
      "Early in October, Gilead Sciences announced it had executed voluntary, non-exclusive, royalty-free license contracts with six pharmaceutical companies in Egypt, Pakistan, and India to produce and market generic lenacapavir. Despite participating in the clinical trials for the drug in recent years, South African companies were excluded from Gilead Sciences\u2019 voluntary licensing, which has infuriated civil society.",
      "\u201cThis is not the principle of ubuntu,\u201d said Sheila Mbele-Khama, in reference to the South African philosophy that values principles such as human dignity and fairness.",

      "According to Wendy Cupido, country manager for Gilead, the South African manufacturers that were evaluated in 2024 did not satisfy the technical specifications for the production of sterile injectables at that time. She said, though, that Gilead was still willing to look at further voluntary licensing if a South African manufacturer could develop the required capabilities and meet quality standards.",
      "Welcoming the over $34 million in investment into the rollout, UNAIDS South Africa country director Eva Kiwango said at a time when foreign assistance funding cuts could lead to an additional 6 million HIV infections globally by 2029, long-acting injectable medicines were a \u201cfresh option for all people at risk,\u201d.",
      "\u201cIt is not a cure or a vaccine, but it could be a game changer if made accessible to all who could benefit,\u201d said Kiwango. \u201cFor many, lenacapavir expands choice, strengthens agency, and reduces barriers linked to stigma, disclosure, or daily adherence.\u201d",

Most markets will still have several choices, but some options are becoming particularly sparse for shoppers with low-income subsidies. And help may be harder to find because some insurers no longer pay brokers commissions for new business.",
      "Shoppers have from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7 to find new coverage that starts in January.",
      "Some things to consider:",
      "Regular Medicare, which most people qualify for after turning 65, does not come with prescription coverage, known as Part D. People must choose that separately.",
      "About 23 million people with regular Medicare have this standalone coverage, according to the non-profit KFF, which studies health care.",
      "Another roughly 34 million people have Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately run versions of Medicare that often come with prescription coverage.",
      "A typical shopper will be able to choose a standalone drug plan from among eight to 12 options for 2026, according to KFF Medicare expert Juliette Cubanski. That\u2019s down from 12 to 16 options in 2025.",
      "Shoppers had nearly 30 choices as recently as 2021, according to the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s Gretchen Jacobson.",
      "Depending on the state, a range of one to four plans will be available at no premium to people who qualify for low-income subsidies, according to KFF. Eight were available in 2021.",
      "Some insurers are reducing their presence in standalone Part D plans, while the Blue Cross-Blue Shield carrier Elevance is leaving the market entirely. Insurers and analysts who follow the industry note that the Inflation Reduction Act, which will cap annual out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,100 in 2026, puts more financial pressure on insurers. The same law now allows patients to spread the cost of prescriptions over the year.",
      "Most markets will have several choices. But experts say Medicare Part D customers don\u2019t like to shop, especially if they already have a plan that covers their medications. Finding affordable coverage for multiple prescriptions can be tricky.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of inertia and, frankly, people may be concerned that if they switch, they\u2019re going to end up worse off,\u201d Cubanski said.",

      "But while plans may provide lower coverage prices, they could also raise deductibles or offer more limited lists of covered drugs, which are called formularies. Shoppers should check these details.",
      "Insurers will be allowed to raise premiums by as much as $50 a month for 2026, up from a $35 increase allowed this year. But Cubanski said only some plans will hit that higher limit and not necessarily in all states.",

      "\u201cBut a lot of room for improvement, a lot of little things I can do better,\u201d Toews said. \u201cDefinitely trying to start the play with the puck off the faceoffs.

      "District Judge Jackson Lofgren's said in his decision Wednesday that the law discriminates based on age and medical purpose, not sex, and that there's little evidence the Legislature passed the law for \u201can invidious discriminatory purpose.\u201d He also noted various concerns and ongoing debates over the medical treatments involved.",
      "\u201cThe evidence presented at trial establishes there is a legitimate concern regarding the capacity of minors to understand and appreciate the long-term consequences of the practices prohibited by the Health Care Law,\u201d the judge wrote, adding that he doesn't believe the law violates the state constitution.",
      "The ruling means parents who decided to seek gender-affirming medical care for their children after the state's ban took effect in April 2023 will need to do so out of state.",
      "\u201cThis ruling is devastating for transgender youth and their families in North Dakota. The evidence in this case was overwhelming: this law inflicts real harm, strips families of their constitutional rights, and denies young people the medical care they need to thrive,\u201d Jess Braverman, the legal director for the gender equity nonprofit Gender Justice, which represented the plaintiff, said in a statement.",
      "Republican state Rep. Bill Tveit, who introduced the legislation, said he is pleased with the ruling.",
      "\u201cIt's a law that needs to be there. We need to protect our youth, and that's what the whole goal of this thing was from the beginning,\u201d Tveit said.",
      "The lawsuit was brought by several affected families and a pediatric endocrinologist, but the judge dismissed some of their claims and left only the physician as a plaintiff.",
      "About half of U.S. states, nearly all of which have fully Republican-led governments, have banned gender-affirming care for minors. North Dakota's law makes it a misdemeanor for a health care provider to prescribe or give hormone treatments or puberty blockers to a transgender child. It also makes it a felony to perform gender-affirming surgery on a minor.",

      "Although the law exempts children who were already receiving treatments before North Dakota\u2019s ban took effect, attorneys for the families who sued said providers held off because they perceived the law as vague and didn\u2019t want to risk it. That led the families to miss work and school so they could travel to Minnesota for treatment.",
      "The judge later said those kids can receive any medical care they were receiving before the law took effect, though that decision wasn\u2019t enough of a final ruling to satisfy attorneys for health care organizations. His Wednesday ruling granted a request that those kids' treatments continue, citing the law and his previous findings.",

      "ISLAMABAD -- ISLAMABAD (AP) \u2014 More than a dozen Afghan civilians were killed and over 100 others were wounded as renewed fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan broke out along their shared border early Wednesday, officials said.",
      "The countries have traded fire along the border since Saturday, when dozens were killed across multiple border regions. Afghanistan claimed to have killed 58 Pakistani soldiers in overnight operations in retaliation for what it called repeated violations of Afghan territory and airspace. Pakistan\u2019s army said 23 troops were killed.",
      "The fighting on Wednesday erupted before dawn, according to officials on both sides. Pakistan TV, the main state-owned television station, reported later in the day that Afghanistan was seeking a ceasefire on the border near the village of Chaman where the fighting was concentrated.",
      "Pakistani security officials and state-run media accused Afghan troops of \u201cunprovoked fire\u201d that was repulsed in Kurram, a district of northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Security officials and television reports said Pakistan\u2019s military overnight killed 30 Afghan Taliban fighters near Kurram in Afghanistan\u2019s Khost province, destroyed a large training facility in Afghanistan used by the Pakistani Taliban.",
      "Zabihullah Mujahid, chief spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan's capital Kabul, said Pakistan used light and heavy weapons in assaults on the Spin Boldak district in Afghanistan\u2019s southern Kandahar province, which lies opposite Pakistan\u2019s southwestern border town of Chaman.",
      "Afghan forces returned fire and killed several Pakistani soldiers, seized military posts and captured weapons including tanks, Mujahid said.",
      "Pakistan\u2019s military rejected the Afghan claim Wednesday, saying in a statement that the fighting along the Chaman border was orchestrated by the Taliban in Afghanistan \u201cthrough divided villages in the area, with no regard for the civilian population.\"",
      "The attack was repulsed by Pakistani forces, which killed between 15 and 20 Afghan Taliban and wounded many others in Spin Boldak, a border city in Afghanistan's Kandahar province, the military said.",
      "On Tuesday, Pakistan's military said the Afghan Taliban worked with the Pakistani Taliban in an attempted assault on Pakistani border posts in the Kurram district but the attacks were repulsed, causing \u201cheavy losses\u201d to Afghan positions.",
      "Awais Ahmad, a doctor at Chaman hospital, said several people wounded in the attack were brought to the hospital.",
      "Witnesses in Chaman said they saw mortars falling near Pakistani villages and some families were seen evacuating.",

      "Wilders' populist Party for Freedom, known by its Dutch acronym PVV, won the last election in late 2023 and was the biggest bloc in a four-party ruling coalition until earlier this year, when Wilders pulled his ministers out of the government in a dispute over a crackdown on migration.",
      "His manifesto for the upcoming election calls for measures including for a total halt to asylum-seekers entering the Netherlands, military patrols at borders to enforce the ban and the closure of recently opened asylum-seeker centers.",

      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) \u2014 Raila Odinga, a former prime minister of Kenya and perennial presidential candidate whose populist campaigns challenged one-party rule, rattled authorities and gave him outsized influence on political life in the East African country, died Wednesday of a heart attack while traveling in India. He was 80.",
      "His death was confirmed by Devamatha Hospital in Kerala State, where he was taken after he collapsed during a morning walk. A hospital statement said Odinga didn\u2019t respond to resuscitation efforts.",
      "There were somber scenes at his home in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, where mourners included national leaders. Tributes cited his commitment to democracy.",
      "President William Ruto declared a seven-day mourning period during which national flags will fly at half-staff, calling Odinga's death an \u201cimmense and immeasurable loss.\u201d Odinga will have a state funeral, Ruto said.",
      "Odinga had recently signed a political pact with Ruto that saw his opposition party involved in government policy-making and its members appointed to the cabinet.",
      "But his ambition was to become Kenya\u2019s president, and he ran five times over three decades \u2014 sometimes with enough support that many believed he might win.",
      "He came close to taking the presidency in 2007, when he narrowly lost to incumbent Mwai Kibaki in a disputed election marred by ethnic violence. And in 2017, a court nullified the presidential election \u2014 a first in Africa \u2014 after Odinga's challenge but he decided to boycott the fresh vote, asserting it wouldn't be credible without reforms.",
      "Although Odinga never succeeded at becoming president, for many he was a revered figure and statesman whose activism helped steer Kenya into a vibrant multiparty democracy.",
      "Odinga, a member of the Luo ethnic group in western Nyanza province, reached the peak of his political career in the 2007 presidential race, winning the support of leaders from other tribes and drawing massive crowds during campaign events.",
      "Although Kibaki, of the Kikuyu ethnic group, had posted good economic figures in his first term, his government had been weakened by corruption scandals. The official results \u2014 Odinga\u2019s 44% against Kibaki\u2019s 46% \u2014 was the closest in Kenyan history.",
      "Odinga\u2019s camp rejected that result, provoked in part by an unreliable electoral authority whose leader said later that he did not know whether Kibaki had won.",
      "Protests erupted in Nairobi almost immediately after Kibaki's inauguration, and violence spread to other parts of Kenya as people were targeted along ethnic lines: Luos and Kalenjins targeting Kikuyus, and Kikuyus mobilizing reprisal attacks.",
      "Hundreds of people were killed in days of violence that shattered Kenya\u2019s status as a stable democracy in a volatile region.",
      "Although Odinga was never accused of inciting violence, others \u2014 including future presidents Ruto and Uhuru Kenyatta \u2014 were. They were among six suspects who faced criminal charges related to post-election violence when the International Criminal Court opened its investigation in 2010.",
      "The case never yielded any successful prosecutions, with charges withdrawn, terminated or tossed out amid claims of witness intimidation and political interference.",
      "After the turmoil, Odinga became prime minister in a unity government put together with the mediation of the international community.",

      "Some of the coup leaders were convicted of treason and executed, and the names of Odinga and his father came up during interrogations of some suspects. Odinga was accused of treason, and though the charge was later dropped, he spent much of the next decade in detention.",
      "Odinga described the harsh conditions of imprisonment and alleged torture, including an assault by a police officer who hit him with a wooden table leg.

      "In the attack in Shostka, less than 70 kilometers (43 miles) from the Russian border, two explosives-laden drones struck two commuter trains in quick succession.",
      "Russia has stepped up railway attacks over the past three months, seeking to sow unrest in Ukrainian regions it borders by depriving people there of rail connections, Oleksandr Pertsovskyi, the CEO of the Ukrainian state railway, told The Associated Press.",

      "Ukrainian railway managers have prided themselves on speedy repairs and their ability \u2014 so far \u2014 to keep the trains running despite repeated strikes, but officials and analysts warn that advances in Russian drone capabilities and the growing tempo of attacks pose a serious threat.",
      "Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in early 2022, railway officials have publicly reported about roughly one attack on railways per week. Since mid-summer of this year, that rate has more than doubled to about two or three per week, according to an AP review of public reports.",

      "In rural Zimbabwe, girls are reviving an ancient tradition called Nhanga to combat child marriage",
      "SHAMVA, Zimbabwe -- SHAMVA, Zimbabwe (AP) \u2014 Inside a white tent with a wooden fireplace in the middle, about two dozen African girls slipped off their shoes, sat on mattresses and prepared to pour their hearts out.",
      "They held hands and their chants of \u201cit's so nice to be here\u201d echoed through the tent before they set about discussing sexuality, child marriage, teen pregnancy, gender bias, education, economic empowerment and the law. Nothing was off limits.",
      "The girls' hangout in rural northeastern Zimbabwe is a revival of Nhanga, the local term for \u201cgirls\u2019 bedroom,\u201d an ancient traditional space once used to prepare adolescent girls for marriage. Across rural Zimbabwe, girls are now reinventing the centuries-old practice as a peer-led movement to resist child marriage, which is rife in the southern African nation.",
      "\u201cThis is a safe space, every girl feels free,\u201d said 18-year-old Anita Razo, who joined at 14 and now mentors younger girls.",
      "In traditional homesteads, a round thatched hut served as Nhanga, a female-only room where girls were taught obedience, how to please husbands and moral education. It reinforced patriarchal expectations.",
      "Today, the practice is being flipped. \u201cThe new Nhanga is a cultural innovation dealing with modern problems,\u201d and where girls candidly tackle subjects still sensitive in many conservative homes, said Nokutenda Magama, a programs officer with Rozaria Memorial Trust, a nonprofit that works to empower rural girls and women and is behind the Nhanga revival.",
      "Sessions include practical skills like poultry raising, farming and soap making.",
      "The trust organizes gatherings by age group, from girls as young as five to women over 35, ensuring an age-appropriate curriculum and mentorship across generations. Elders, including senior government officials, are sometimes invited.",
      "The reinvention comes against worrying statistics. One in three girls in Zimbabwe marries before 18, according to the United Nations Children's Fund, calling it \u201ca national emergency demanding urgent action.\u201d It\u2019s a similar situation across East and southern Africa. Child marriage rates soar to above 40% in central and West Africa, with Niger, at 76%, the highest globally, according to UNICEF.",
      "Zimbabwe and many other African countries have outlawed child marriage, even overturning laws prohibiting abortion for girls under 18, but poverty, lethargic enforcement and cultural and religious customs keep it alive.",
      "For Samantha Chidodo, the revival offered a path back. Now 26 and a final-year law student, she was forced into an abusive marriage at 17 to a man nearly a decade older.",
      "\u201cAll I wanted was to play and think of my future. Suddenly I had to be a mother and wife,\u201d she said at a camp that blended tent sessions with a \u201cgirls and goals\u201d soccer tournament.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t even know what to do. I would be dead asleep, oblivious that I needed to breastfeed.\u201d A woman next door would take the crying baby, feed him and return him to the sleeping teen mother, she recalled.",
      "After two years, she walked away, enduring stigma as neighbors warned others not to associate with her. With support from Rozaria Memorial Trust, she returned to school and became one of the modern Nhanga pioneers.",

      "Today, more than 200 girls in her village participate. Many schools across Zimbabwe have adopted the model, which has spread to Zambia and Sierra Leone and reached African Union and United Nations forums.",
      "Because child marriage is often rooted in culture and religion, girls sought the backing of chiefs and village heads \u2014 custodians of local customs.",
      "Xmas Savanhu, a local village headman, said leaders now enforce rules against early marriage. Offenders must pay a cow as a fine held in trust by the chief for the girl\u2019s education. \u201cThis ensures she can return to school without financial worries,\u201d he said, noting that culprits are also reported to police. Chiefs also partner with NGOs to help young mothers resume their studies.",
      "Despite progress, poverty and entrenched attitudes persist, said Enet Tini, a teacher and girls mentor whose school adopted the model.",
      "She welcomed a government policy allowing girls to return to school after giving birth, but noted parents are often reluctant. \u201cThe gap that we have lies with the adults. They view pregnancy or child marriage as indiscipline so they think the girls should be punished,\u201d she said, highlighting the importance of girls-led initiatives to change attitudes among themselves and the community.",
      "Nyaradzai Gumbonzvanda, deputy executive director at U.N. Women and founder of the Rozaria Memorial Trust, called child marriage \u201cessentially rape and sexual exploitation\u201d and a worldwide problem, but \u201cmuch higher in Africa,\u201d where laws alone cannot end it.",
      "\u201cLaws are important \u2026 but it is critically essential to reach to the girls themselves, to do the shift in the social norms in our communities,\u201d said Gumbonzvanda, who started Rozaria Memorial Trust in 2007 in honor of her late mother, who was married at 13.",
      "Her message that solutions must involve girls themselves alongside policymakers and traditional leaders resonates with Razo, the young mentor.",
      "\u201cIf we can pressure each other into behaving badly, then we can also influence each other to act positively,\u201d Razo said.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 The hit-style shooting of two Venezuelan activists in Colombia's capital is fueling fears among Venezuela's diaspora that a crackdown on dissent by the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is seeping beyond the South American nation's borders.",
      "On Monday afternoon, Venezuelan human rights activist Yendri Vel\u00e1squez and political consultant Luis Peche Arteaga were shot leaving a building in the north of Bogota by two unidentified people waiting for them in a car.",
      "Around 15 shots were fired at the activists, who fled widening government repression last year, and Peche Arteaga was hit six times, said Laura Dib, a colleague of Vel\u00e1squez and Venezuela Program Director for the Washington Office on Latin America. Both went through surgery and were in stable condition.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s tragedy after tragedy,\u201d said Dib. \u201cIt has been a really hard day for all of the human rights movement in Venezuela. This sends a very clear message about the risks of transnational repression.\"",
      "It was not immediately clear who was behind their shooting and Colombian authorities said they were investigating the attack. Dib and other civil society leaders said they were waiting for the results of the investigation, but that the attack appeared to be targeted based on their political profiles.",
      "The two men were among an exodus of political opposition and civil society leaders who fled Venezuela after Maduro was widely accused of stealing last year's election and the government detained more than 2,000 people, including human rights defenders and critics.",
      "Vel\u00e1squez was already arbitrarily detained by Venezuelan authorities for hours as he tried to leave the country for a human rights conference in August last year, according to an Inter-American Commission on Human Rights report. Vel\u00e1squez had also said that the Venezuelan government canceled his passport.",
      "In fleeing, they joined an exodus of nearly 8 million people from crisis-stricken Venezuela in recent years, many seeking refuge in neighboring Colombia.",
      "But civil society groups and diaspora leaders say that those who once found respite in other Andean nations increasingly fear for their security following the attack.",
      "Arles Pereda, president of the Colony of Venezuelans in Colombia (ColVenz) said that concern has simmered for years as the government has targeted civil society groups. It\u2019s not hard to contract a hired gun in Colombia, in part due to the prevalence of criminal groups in the region.",
      "\u201cWe've always been watching out for possible persecution against us. An attack like this was something we knew was coming for a while, that we knew could happen at any moment. Now it has in Bogota,\" he said.",

      "Shockwaves rippled across the diaspora community last year when a dissident Venezuelan military officer Ronald Ojeda was kidnapped and killed in Chile. Chilean investigators said the killing was political in nature, orchestrated from within Venezuela and was likely carried out by the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua.",

      "Madagascar's military seized power from the civilian government Tuesday, a high-ranking commander announced after President Andry Rajoelina fled the sprawling Indian Ocean island country for his safety.",
      "The ouster of Rajoelina, who himself came to power as a transitional leader in a military-backed coup in 2009, capped weeks of protests led by young people fed up with power and water outages, persistent poverty and a lack of opportunities, among other issues.",
      "Rajoelina's office issued a statement calling the coup \u201ca serious breach of the rule of law\" and insisting that the state \u201cremains standing.\u201d But Col. Michael Randrianirina, whose elite CAPSAT military unit tipped the scales of power in the country last weekend by siding with the protesters, said \u201cWe are taking power,\" as demonstrators celebrated with soldiers in the capital, Antananarivo.",
      "Here's what to know about the events that led to Rajoelina's ousting.",
      "The uprising started weeks ago when protests erupted over chronic water and electricity outages. It snowballed into larger dissatisfaction with Rajoelina, alleged government corruption and poverty, which affects about 75% of the country of roughly 30 million people, according to the World Bank.",
      "The protests brought thousands onto the streets in several cities and initially sparked a harsh crackdown by security forces that left 22 people dead and more than 100 injured, according to the United Nations. The government disputed those figures.",
      "Although civic groups and labor unions also joined in, the protests were led by a group calling itself \u201cGen Z Madagascar,\u201d though participants have insisted there isn't a leader and that they were inspired by recent youth uprisings in Nepal and Sri Lanka.",
      "A key moment came Saturday when Randrianirina and his soldiers accompanied protesters to a main square in the capital and demanded that Rajoelina step down. The CAPSAT troops exchanged gunfire with gendarmerie security forces still loyal to Rajoelina, and one CAPSAT soldier was killed, according to Randrianirina.",
      "On Tuesday, protesters cheered on the CAPSAT troops as they stood on armored vehicles in Antananarivo's streets. Although Rajoelina's office said only some CAPSAT troops were backing the protesters, the unit said other military units, including the gendarmerie, stand with them.",
      "CAPSAT is the unit that also rebelled against the Madagascar government in 2009, leading to the military-backed coup that brought Rajoelina to power as a transitional leader. There are strong parallels between the two coups, in that CAPSAT troops also joined a wave of anti-government protests against then-President Marc Ravalomanana 16 years ago, forcing him into exile.",
      "After weeks of pressure on Rajoelina, a chaotic 24-hour period began Monday when the president's office announced he would deliver a speech to the nation on state television and radio. The speech was delayed for hours and was finally only broadcast on social media after soldiers arrived at the state broadcaster's buildings.",

Right after the vote, Randrianirina announced the military takeover while standing with other soldiers in front of a historic presidential palace in the capital. He said the armed forces would form a council made up of officers from the general military and the gendarmerie, a military unit that polices civilians, and would appoint a prime minister to \u201cquickly\u201d form a civilian government.",

      "Federal workers furloughed or working without pay are feeling the financial squeeze and fear being swept up in the Trump administration's layoffs",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 With every passing day of the government shutdown, hundreds of thousands of federal employees furloughed or working without pay face mounting financial strain. And now they are confronting new uncertainty with the Trump administration's promised layoffs.",
      "Little progress has been made to end the shutdown as it enters its third week, with Republicans and Democrats digging in and convinced their messaging is resonating with voters. The fate of the federal workers is among several pressure points that could eventually push the sides to agree to resolve the stalemate.",
      "\u201cLuckily I was able to pay rent this month,\u201d said Peter Farruggia, a furloughed federal worker. \u201cBut for sure I am going to have bills that are going to go unpaid this month, and I really don\u2019t have many options.\u201d",
      "The shutdown has a familiar feel for many federal employees who endured past stalemates \u2014 including during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 but this time, the stakes are higher. The Republican White House is leveraging federal workers\u2019 jobs to pressure Democrats to soften their demands.",
      "The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Trump and other Republican leaders have said the government must reopen before they will negotiate with Democrats on the health subsidies.",
      "Farruggia is the head of the American Federation of Government Employees local representing employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency that faced a wave of layoffs over the weekend. Like 8,000 other CDC employees who have been furloughed from the agency, he was already living paycheck to paycheck, and the partial pay that arrived Friday was his last until the government comes back online.",
      "With the agency's leadership in turmoil and still rattled from a shooting, the shutdown and new firings mean \u201cpeople are scared, nervous, anxious, but also really just exasperated,\u201d Farruggia said.",
      "After Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said last week on social media that the \u201cRIFs have begun,\u201d referring to reduction-in-force plans aimed at reducing the size of the federal government, Vice President JD Vance doubled down on the threat Sunday, saying \u201cthe longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be.\"",
      "The layoffs have begun across federal agencies. Labor unions have already filed a lawsuit to stop the move by Trump\u2019s budget office.",
      "In a court filing on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget said well over 4,000 federal employees from eight departments and agencies would be fired in conjunction with the shutdown.",
      "Jessica Sweet, an Albany, New York, Social Security claims specialist who is a union steward of AFGE Local 3343 in New York, said, \u201cI, myself, have a backup plan\u201d in case she is fired during the shutdown, \u201cbut I know most people don't.\u201d",
      "She says the Social Security Administration is already so short-staffed from layoffs earlier this year brought on by the Department of Government Efficiency, she doesn't fear a massive layoff during the shutdown.",
      "\u201cThe one thing this administration has taught me is that nothing is ever for certain, even if it's codified into law,\" she said.",
      "Having received a partial payment in her last paycheck, Sweet has begun reaching out to her local power companies to request that she not get charged late fees, since \u201cmy bills won't wait for me to eventually get paid.\u201d",
      "For some federal workers, this isn\u2019t their first shutdown \u2014 the last one, during Trump\u2019s first term in 2019, stretched a record 34 days. But this time, federal employees are being used more directly as leverage in the political fight over government funding.",
      "The Republican administration last week warned that there would be no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a shutdown \u2014 a reversal of long-standing policy affecting roughly 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a White House memo. The move, which Trump later backtracked on, was widely seen as a strong-arm tactic.",

      "Pelletier, a union leader for NLRB local 3, said \u201cright now, nothing is being investigated at the NLRB. There\u2019s no elections for unions or elections for decertifications. Basically nothing is happening.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government shutdown\u2019s strain on the aviation system is starting to show",
      "A startling message came over the radio from an air traffic control tower near Los Angeles less than a week into the federal government shutdown: \u201cThe tower is closed due to staffing.\"",
      "Without enough air traffic controllers to guide planes into and out of Hollywood Burbank Airport, the tower went dark for almost six hours on Oct. 6, leaving pilots to coordinate their movements among themselves. Flight delays averaged two-and-a-half hours in one of the first visible signs that the shutdown was already taking a toll on the nation's aviation system.",
      "Since the shutdown began Oct. 1, the Federal Aviation Administration has reported controller shortages in cities across the U.S., from airports in Boston and Philadelphia, to control centers in Atlanta and Houston. Flight delays have spread to airports in Nashville, Dallas, Newark and more.",
      "And already there has been an increase in unscheduled absences among security screeners at some airports. The union representing Transportation Security Administration employees says the absences haven't yet caused major disruptions, but it warned longer lines at security checkpoints could soon become a reality after workers received their final paychecks over the weekend.",
      "Experts and union leaders say the disruptions are a stark reminder that the aviation system is already stretched too thin by chronic understaffing and outdated technology. They warn the cracks in the system could rapidly deepen the longer the shutdown drags on and critical aviation workers are without their regular paychecks.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like having a drought the year after you had a drought,\u201d Greg Raiff, CEO of Elevate Aviation Group, told The Associated Press.",
      "These concerns aren't new. In 2019, the aviation system buckled under the weight of a 35-day government shutdown \u2014 the longest in U.S. history \u2014 during President Donald Trump's first term.",
      "Around the three-week mark, air traffic controllers, many of them working up to 60 hours a week, sued the government over their missed paychecks. One terminal at the Miami International Airport was forced to close because security screeners were calling out sick in large numbers. Some even quit altogether.",
      "\u201cHere we are so many years later, and the problems have not been addressed,\" said aviation attorney Ricardo Martinez-Cid, a Florida Bar-certified expert on aviation law who regularly represents crash victims. \u201cNow we're in a worse position when we had been put on notice. We had the opportunity to address it.\"",
      "Since then, the country has faced repeated warnings. In January, a mid-air crash over the Potomac River involving a commercial jet and a military helicopter killed 67 people. A series of equipment failures and radar outages this year also highlighted the need for upgrades.",
      "Before the latest shutdown, both the FAA and TSA were already dealing with staffing shortages. That includes a shortage of about 3,000 air traffic controllers.",
      "Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, has said staffing levels have reached a \u201ccritical\u201d point, the lowest in decades. The shortage is so severe that even a few air traffic controllers missing work can disrupt operations at already understaffed facilities.",
      "\u201cAnd on top of that,\" he said, \u201cthey\u2019re working with unreliable equipment.\u201d",
      "The shutdown began just as the FAA was starting to make some progress on addressing the shortage of controllers and modernizing the outdated equipment they rely on that keeps disrupting flights when it malfunctions.",

      "The agency says it topped its goal of hiring 2,000 controllers this year after streamlining the application process at its academy in Oklahoma City, but it will take years still to eliminate the shortage. And it had just begun looking for companies to help oversee a $12.5 billion effort to overhaul its aging and complex technology systems.",
      "Now, the shutdown is delaying those long-needed efforts. And union leaders say the staffing shortages may be worse by the time the government reopens.",
      "Johnny Jones, secretary-treasurer of the American Federation of Government Employees chapter representing TSA workers, expressed concern that the shutdown could drive even more security screeners to leave the agency, especially given the uncertainty that the workers already have faced this year. That includes the Trump administration's attempts to revoke their collective bargaining rights.",
      "Daniels, meanwhile, warned it could stoke fear among newer controllers and trainees who might reconsider the career entirely to avoid working in future shutdowns.",
      "It's a long-standing concern. In 2019, after the 35-day shutdown ended, a congressional committee hearing dug into the impacts on air travel.",
      "\"All of these air traffic controllers and aviation safety professionals were used as pawns in a political fight that had nothing to do with aviation. This is wrong and must not be allowed to happen again,\" warned the union leader representing air traffic controllers at the time.",
      "At the hearing, there were also bipartisan calls for reform to keep the FAA funded \u201cwithout interruption, even when the rest of the government shuts down,\" as one lawmaker put it. Stories were shared of controllers and TSA agents taking on extra jobs to pay rent, mortgage and other bills despite working longer shifts to fill the gaps in staffing.",
      "Lawmakers and industry officials who testified agreed: The shutdown made the aviation system less safe.",
      "\u201cWe implore all involved, please heed not only our warnings but the entire stakeholder community\u2019s warnings. This vicious budgetary cycle of stops and starts with little to no stability or predictably has simply got to stop,\" said Nick Calio, then-president and CEO of Airlines for America, an industry trade group representing airlines including Delta, United and Southwest.",

      "Over the summer, NATO started to coordinate regular deliveries of large weapons packages to Ukraine to help fend off Russia's war. The aim was to send at least one load a month of targeted and predictable military support, each worth around $500 million.",

      "Under the financial arrangement \u2014 known as the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List, or PURL \u2014 European allies and Canada are buying American weapons to help Kyiv keep Russian forces at bay. About $2 billion worth has already been allocated.",

      "Swedish Defense Minister P\u00e5l Jonson said that \u201cSweden stands ready to do more.\u201d He welcomed discussions among other Nordic countries and the Baltic nations \u2014 Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 on sending an extra load too.",

      "One of California\u2019s worst oil spills occurred off the Santa Barbara coast in 2015, when a corroded pipeline burst",
      "When the corroded pipeline burst in 2015, inky crude spread along the Southern California coast, becoming the state\u2019s worst oil spill in decades.",
      "More than 140,000 gallons (3,300 barrels) of oil gushed out, blackening beaches for 150 miles (240 kilometers) from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles, polluting a biologically rich habitat for endangered whales and sea turtles, killing scores of pelicans, seals and dolphins, and decimating the fishing industry.",
      "Plains All American Pipeline in 2022 agreed to a $230 million settlement with fishers and coastal property owners without admitting liability. Federal inspectors found that the Houston-based company failed to quickly detect the rupture and responded too slowly. It faced an uphill battle to build a new pipeline.",
      "Three decades-old drilling platforms were subsequently shuttered, but another Texas-based fossil fuel company supported by the Trump administration purchased the operation and is intent on pumping oil through the pipeline again.",
      "Sable Offshore Corp., headquartered in Houston, is facing a slew of legal challenges but is determined to restart production, even if that means confining it to federal waters, where state regulators have virtually no say. California controls the 3 miles (5 kilometers) nearest to shore. The platforms are 5 to 9 miles (8 to 14 kilometers) offshore.",
      "The Trump administration has hailed Sable\u2019s plans as the kind of project the president wants to increase U.S. energy production as the federal government removes regulatory barriers. President Donald Trump has directed Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to undo his predecessor\u2019s ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts.",
      "\"This project risks another environmental disaster in California at a time when demand for oil is going down and the climate crisis is escalating,\" said Alex Katz, executive director of Environmental Defense Center, the Santa Barbara group formed in response to a massive spill in 1969.",
      "The environmental organization is among several suing Sable.",
      "\u201cOur concern is that there is no way to make this pipeline safe and that this company has proven that it cannot be trusted to operate safely, responsibly or even legally,\u201d he said.",
      "Actor and activist Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who lives in the area, has implored officials to stop Sable, saying at a March protest: \u201cI can smell a rat. And this project is a rat.\u201d",
      "The California Coastal Commission fined Sable a record $18 million for ignoring cease-and-desist orders over repair work it says was done without permits. Sable said it has permits from the previous owner, Exxon Mobil, and sued the commission while work continued on the pipeline. In June, a state judge ordered it to stop while the case proceeds through the court. The commission and Sable are due back in court Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThis fly-by-night oil company has repeatedly abused the public\u2019s trust, racking up millions of dollars in fines and causing environmental damage along the treasured Gaviota Coast,\u201d a state park south of Santa Barbara, said Joshua Smith, the commission\u2019s spokesman.",
      "So far, Sable is undeterred.",
      "The California Attorney General\u2019s office sued Sable this month, saying it illegally discharged waste into waterways, and disregarded state law requiring permits before work along the pipeline route that crosses sensitive wildlife habitat.",
      "\u201cSable placed profits over environmental protection in its rush to get oil on the market,\u201d the agency said in its lawsuit.",
      "Last month, the Santa Barbara District Attorney filed felony criminal charges against Sable, also accusing it of polluting waterways and harming wildlife.",

      "Sable said it has fully cooperated with local and state agencies, including the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and called the district attorney's allegation \u201cinflammatory and extremely misleading.\u201d It said a biologist and state fire marshal officials oversaw the work, and no wildlife was harmed.",
      "The company is seeking $347 million for the delays, and says if the state blocks it from restarting the onshore pipeline system, it will use a floating facility that would keep its entire operation in federal waters and use tankers to transport the oil to markets outside California. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, the company updated its plan to include the option.",
      "The U.S. Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said in July it was working with Sable to bring a second rig online.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump made it clear that American energy should come from American resources,\u201d the agency\u2019s deputy director Kenny Stevens said in a statement then, heralding the \"comeback story for Pacific production.\u201d",
      "The agency said there are an estimated 190 million barrels (6 billion gallons) of recoverable oil reserves in the area, nearly 80% of residual Pacific reserves. It noted advancements in preventing and preparing for oil spills and said the failed pipeline has been rigorously tested.",
      "\u201cContinuous monitoring and improved technology significantly reduce the risk of a similar incident occurring in the future,\u201d the agency said.",
      "On May 19 \u2014 the 10th anniversary of the disaster \u2014 CEO Jim Flores announced that Sable \u201cis proud to have safely and responsibly achieved first production at the Santa Ynez Unit\u201d \u2014 which includes three rigs in federal waters, offshore and onshore pipelines, and the Las Flores Canyon Processing Facility.",
      "State officials countered that the company had only conducted testing and not commercial production. Sable's stock price dropped and some investors sued, alleging they were misled.",
      "Sable purchased the Santa Ynez Unit from Exxon Mobil in 2024 for nearly $650 million primarily with a loan from Exxon. Exxon sold the shuttered operation after losing a court battle in 2023 to truck the crude through central California while the pipeline system was rebuilt or repaired.",
      "Flores said well tests at the Platform Harmony rig indicate there is much oil to be extracted and that it will relieve California's gas prices \u2014 among the nation's highest \u2014 by stabilizing supplies.",
      "\u201cSable is very concerned about the crumbling energy complex in California,\" Flores said in a statement to The Associated Press. \u201cWith the exit of two refineries last year and more shuttering soon, California\u2019s economy cannot survive without the strong energy infrastructure it enjoyed for the last 150 years.\u201d",
      "California has been reducing the state\u2019s production of fossil fuels in favor of clean energy for years. The movement has been spearheaded partly by Santa Barbara County, where elected officials voted in May to begin taking steps to phase out onshore oil and gas operations.",

      "\u201cRising downside risks to employment have shifted our assessment of the balance of risks,\u201d he said.",
      "Powell also said that the central bank may soon stop shrinking its roughly $6.6 trillion balance sheet. The Fed has been allowing roughly $40 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to mature each month without replacing them. The shift could weigh on longer-term Treasury interest rates.",
      "Separately, Powell spent most of his speech defending the Fed's practice of buying longer-term Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in 2020 and 2021, which were intended to lower longer-term interest rates and support the economy during the pandemic.",

      "Other critics have long argued that the Fed kept implementing the purchases for too long, keeping interest rates low even as inflation began to spike in late 2021. The Fed beginning in 2021 stopped the purchases and then sharply boosted borrowing costs to combat inflation.",
      "\u201cWith the clarity of hindsight, we could have\u2014and perhaps should have\u2014stopped asset purchases sooner,\u201d Powell said. \"Our real-time decisions were intended to serve as insurance against downside risk.\"",
      "Powell also said the purchases were intended to avoid a breakdown in the market for Treasury securities, which could have sent interest rates much higher.",

That is slightly higher than the 1.9% forecast in the IMF's last update in July and 1.8% in April. The U.S. should grow 2.1% next year, also just one-tenth of a percent faster than its previous projection, the IMF said.",
      "Its current forecasts are still down from a year ago, however, a sign that the international lending agency expects the tariffs to weaken the U.S. economy, in part by creating more uncertainty for businesses. Last October, the IMF forecast the U.S. would grow 2.2% this year.",

Hotter spending and investment could push central banks to raise interest rates over time, he said.",
      "Gourinchas also offered several reasons the U.S. and global economies have remained resilient after the widespread imposition of tariffs earlier this year.",

Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, has ticked up to 2.9%, according to the Federal Reserve's preferred measure, up from 2.7% a year ago. Hiring has ground to nearly a halt, which could partly reflect a more cautious approach by many firms in the wake of the uncertainty created by the higher tariffs.",

Its currency has depreciated, which has made its exports cheaper. The IMF is forecasting that China's economy will expand 4.8% this year and 4.2% in 2026, the same as in July.",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russian forces have launched powerful glide bombs and drones against Kharkiv and hit a hospital",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Russian forces launched powerful glide bombs and drones against Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city in overnight attacks, hitting a hospital and wounding seven people, an official said Tuesday, as European military aid for Kyiv dropped sharply and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy prepared to ask U.S. President Donald Trump for Tomahawk missiles.",
      "The Russian attack on Kharkiv in Ukraine\u2019s northeast hit the city's main hospital, forcing the evacuation of 50 patients, regional head Oleh Syniehubov said. The attack\u2019s main targets were energy facilities, Zelenskyy said, without providing details of what was hit.",
      "\u201cEvery day, every night, Russia strikes power plants, power lines, and our (natural) gas facilities,\u201d Zelenskyy said on Telegram.",
      "Russian long-range strikes on its neighbor's power grid are part of a campaign since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022 to disable Ukraine\u2019s power supply, denying civilians heat and running water during the bitter winter.",
      "The Ukrainian leader urged foreign countries to help blunt Russia\u2019s long-range attacks by providing more air defense systems for the country, which is almost the size of Texas and hard to defend from the air in its entirety.",
      "\u201cWe are counting on the actions of the U.S. and Europe, the G7, all partners who have these systems and can provide them to protect our people,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cThe world must force Moscow to sit down at the table for real negotiations.\u201d",
      "But the latest data on foreign military aid to Ukraine showed a sharp drop-off in recent help.",
      "Military aid in July and August plunged by 43% compared to the first half of the year, Germany\u2019s Kiel Institute, which tracks support to Ukraine, said Tuesday.",
      "That fall occurred after the creation of a fund that pools contributions from NATO members, except the United States, to purchase American weapons, munitions and equipment for Ukraine. The financial arrangement is known as the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List, or PURL.",

      "But it could provide leverage to help push Moscow into negotiations after Trump expressed frustration over Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s refusal to budge on key aspects of a possible peace deal.",
      "Tomahawk missiles would be the longest-range missiles in Kyiv\u2019s arsenal and could allow it to strike targets deep inside Russia, including Moscow, with precision. Unlike the drones that Ukraine has used for such strikes so far, Tomahawks carry a much heavier warhead and are more difficult to intercept as they fly at low altitude to dodge air defenses.",
      "Ukraine's long-range attacks are already taking a toll on Russian oil production, Ukrainian officials and foreign military analysts say.",
      "Its strikes using newly developed long-range missiles and drones are causing significant gas shortages in Russia, according to Zelenskyy.",

      "No wonder they\u2019re leaving home facing a 2-0 deficit against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the best-of-seven National League Championship Series.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to play better,\u201d Brewers designated hitter Christian Yelich said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an ideal start to the series, by any means. Just have to continue to battle and find a way to get the offense going. I\u2019ve got to be better. We\u2019ve got to be better. It\u2019s just facts.\u201d",
      "The Brewers ranked second in the majors in on-base percentage (.332) and third in runs (806) and batting average (.258) while posting a franchise-best 97-65 regular-season record.",
      "But they\u2019ve totaled just five hits through the first two games of this series and mustered only one run in each of them.",
      "The Brewers got just two hits in a 2-1 Game 1 loss, as two-time Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell allowed one hit and no walks over eight shutout innings fo Los Angeles. They managed three hits Tuesday and fell 5-1 as Yoshinobu Yamamoto pitched the first postseason complete game in eight years.",
      "During the regular season, the Brewers had the best chase rate in the majors, meaning they swung at the lowest percentage of pitches outside the strike zone. But their inability to work counts the last two night allowed Los Angeles\u2019 starters to go deep into the games and prevented the Brewers from getting many shots at the Dodgers\u2019 vulnerable bullpen.",
      "\u201cBoth those pitchers were as dominant as two pitchers have been,\u201d Milwaukee manager Pat Murphy said. \u201cWe chased way more than we\u2019ve chased all year. We\u2019ve been the best in baseball at not chasing. These pitchers brought out the worst in us.\u201d",
      "The most notable example came when Blake Treinen struck out Brice Turang swinging at a neck-high fastball with the bases loaded to end Game 1.",
      "But the chasing was prevalent again Tuesday, allowing Yamamoto to pitch a complete game for the first time since entering the majors last season on a 12-year, $325 million contract.",
      "Jackson Chourio homered on Yamamoto\u2019s first pitch to continue his impressive postseason. The 21-year-old already has four career postseason homers to tie a Brewers record he now shares with Orlando Arcia and Prince Fielder.",
      "But the Brewers accomplished little else. Their only other hits were two-out singles by Brice Turang in the third inning and Sal Frelick in the fourth.",

      "Milwaukee\u2019s struggles are up and down the lineup thus far in the series.",
      "Yelich, a three-time All-Star and the 2018 NL MVP, is 0 for 13 in his last four games. Two-time All-Star William Contreras and Andrew Vaughn each homered twice in the NL Division Series against the Chicago Cubs, but both are hitless so far in this series.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to take batter at-bats,\u201d Chourio said through an interpreter. \u201cThat\u2019s where it begins. But you have to credit those guys. But we haven\u2019t had so much luck go our way. We have to stick with our plan and stick with process and hopefully change things around.\u201d",
      "The Brewers remain confident they can turn this series around. They won all six regular-season matchups with the Dodgers, all in July. The Dodgers are playing much better now than they were then, but the Brewers realize they can show much more discipline at the plate than they\u2019ve displayed the last two nights.",

      "When Tennessee used the No. 1 overall draft pick on quarterback Cam Ward, the plan was for a long-term pairing with head coach Brian Callahan to bring success to the Titans.",
      "The marriage didn't even last a full season with Callahan fired after six games in a move that maybe should have been predictable based on recent history.",
      "Over the last decade, nothing has put an NFL coach on the hot seat more than the franchise using a high draft pick on a quarterback.",
      "Ward is the fourth straight quarterback picked No. 1 overall to have his coach fired before the end of his rookie season. Caleb Williams and Matt Eberflus lasted 12 games together in Chicago in 2024; Bryce Young and Frank Reich got 11 games in Carolina in 2023; and Trevor Lawrence and Urban Meyer got 13 games in Jacksonville in 2021.",

      "The only No. 1 pick quarterback in the NFL still with his original coach is 2020 top selection Joe Burrow in Cincinnati with Zac Taylor.",
      "Teams picking first in the draft typically have many holes based on getting that selection although the Bears and Rams got their No. 1 picks in trades. Four of the fired coaches \u2014 Callahan, Eberflus, Jackson and Fisher \u2014 came into those seasons on thin ice based on a lack of success already during their tenure.",
      "Reich got fired in his first season with the Panthers and Meyer got fired in year one with the Jaguars, although that decision went far deeper than just the quarterback.",
      "But the issue of quick hooks potentially stunting the growth of young quarterbacks goes beyond players picked first overall.",
      "There have been 35 quarterbacks taken in the first round of the past 10 drafts \u2014 including Ward and Jaxson Dart of the New York Giants this season. Seven of those teams fired their coach during the rookie season of the quarterback with eight more making a change before the start of year two.",
      "Only seven of those first-round picks finished their four-year rookie deals with the same coach, with the verdict still out on several members of the 2023-25 drafts.",
      "One of those first-round quarterbacks who had a coaching change before the start of his second season was Justin Fields with Chicago. Fields spent his rookie season in 2021 under Matt Nagy before playing the next two seasons for Eberflus.",
      "Fields is now on his third team with the Jets and his game is trending in the wrong direction. Fields was sacked nine times and completed only nine passes in a 13-11 loss to Denver on Sunday in London, with the Jets finishing with minus-10 net yards passing thanks to the sacks for the lowest total in any game since the Chargers had minus-19 against Kansas City on Sept. 20, 1998, in Ryan Leaf's third career start.",
      "Fields had the 10th game since the merger with at least nine sacks and nine or fewer completions and is the first player to do it twice with it also happening in his first career start in 2021 for Chicago against Cleveland. He has one other start when his sack total matched his completion total when he had seven of each in a loss to Detroit in Week 17 of the 2022 season.",

      "U.S. lawmakers and national security officials are increasingly alarmed that long-standing research ties between the U.S. and China could give China an advantage when it comes to developing new military technology",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For many years, American and Chinese scholars worked shoulder to shoulder on cutting-edge technologies through open research, where findings are freely shared and accessible to all. But that openness, a long-standing practice celebrated for advancing knowledge, is raising alarms among some U.S. lawmakers.",
      "They are worried that China \u2014 now considered the most formidable challenger to American military dominance \u2014 is taking advantage of open research to catch up with the U.S. on military technology and even gain an edge. And they are calling for action.",
      "\u201cFor far too long, our adversaries have exploited American colleges and universities to advance their interests, while risking our national security and innovation,\u201d said Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He has introduced legislation to put new restrictions on federally funded research collaboration with academics at several Chinese institutions that work with the Chinese military, as well as institutions in other countries deemed adversarial to U.S. interests.",
      "The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party makes it a priority to protect American research, having accused Beijing of weaponizing open research by converting it into a \u201cpipeline of foreign talent and military modernization.\u201d",
      "The rising concerns on Capitol Hill threaten to unravel deep, two-generations-old academic ties between the countries even as the world's two largest economies are moving away from each other through tariffs and trade barriers. The relationship has shifted from engagement to competition, if not outright enmity.",
      "\"Foreign adversaries are increasingly exploiting the open and collaborative environment of U.S. academic institutions for their own gain,\u201d said James Cangialosi, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, which in August issued a bulletin urging universities to do more to protect research from foreign meddling.",
      "The House committee released three reports in September alone. They targeted, respectively, Pentagon-funded research involving military-linked Chinese scholars; joint U.S.-China institutes that train STEM talent for China; and visa policies that have brought military-linked Chinese students to Ph.D. programs at American universities. The reports recommend more legislation to protect U.S. research, tighter visa policies to vet Chinese students and scholars and an end to academic partnerships that could be exploited to boost China\u2019s military powers.",
      "More than 500 U.S. universities and institutes have collaborated with Chinese military researchers in recent years, helping Beijing develop advanced technologies with military applications, such as anti-jamming communications and hypersonic vehicles, according to a report by the private U.S. intelligence group Strider Technologies.",
      "Despite efforts in recent years by the U.S. government to set up guardrails to prevent such collaboration from boosting China\u2019s military capabilities, the practice is still prevalent, according to Strider, based in Salt Lake City, Utah.",
      "The report identified nearly 2,500 publications produced in collaboration between U.S. entities and Chinese military-affiliated research institutes in 2024 on STEM research, which includes physics, engineering, material science, computer science, biology, medicine and geology. While the number peaked at more than 3,500 in 2019, before some new restrictive measures came into effect, the level of collaboration remains high, the report said.",
      "This collaboration not only facilitates \u201cpotential illicit knowledge transfer,\u201d but supports China's \u201cstate-directed efforts to recruit top international talent, often to the detriment of U.S. national interests,\u201d the report said.",

Stealing the fruits of that labor, however, can be as easy as hacking into a university network, hiring away researchers or coopting the research itself. That\u2019s why, authorities say, it\u2019s so tempting for American adversaries looking to take advantage of U.S. institutions and research.",

Authorities say China aims to steal military and computing technology that might give the U.S. an advantage, as well as the latest commercial innovations.",

      "Arnie Bellini, a tech entrepreneur and investor, also said efforts to protect U.S. research risk stifling progress if they go too far and prevent U.S. colleges or startups from sharing information about new and emerging technology. Keeping up with China will also require big investments in efforts to protect innovation, said Bellini, who recently donated $40 million to establish a new cybersecurity and AI research college at the University of South Florida.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday vetoed landmark legislation that would have restricted children's access to AI chatbots.",
      "The bill would have banned companies from making AI chatbots available to anyone under 18 years old unless the businesses could ensure the technology couldn't engage in sexual conversations or encourage self-harm.",
      "\u201cWhile I strongly support the author's goal of establishing necessary safeguards for the safe use of AI by minors, (the bill) imposes such broad restrictions on the use of conversational AI tools that it may unintentionally lead to a total ban on the use of these products by minors,\u201d Newsom said.",
      "The veto came hours after he signed a law requiring platforms to remind users they are interacting with a chatbot and not a human. The notification would pop up every three hours for users who are minors. Companies will also have to maintain a protocol to prevent self-harm content and refer users to crisis service providers if they expressed suicidal ideation.",
      "Newsom, who has four children under 18, said California has a responsibility to protect kids and teens who are increasingly turning to AI chatbots for everything from help with homework to emotional support and personal advice.",
      "California is among several states that tried this year to address concerns surrounding chatbots used by kids for companionship. Safety concerns around the technology exploded following reports and lawsuits saying chatbots made by Meta, OpenAI and others engaged with young users in highly sexualized conversations and, in some cases, coached them to take their own lives.",
      "The two measures were among a slew of AI bills introduced by California lawmakers this year to rein in the homegrown industry that is rapidly evolving with little oversight. Tech companies and their coalitions, in response, spent at least $2.5 million in the first six months of the session lobbying against the measures, according to advocacy group Tech Oversight California. Tech companies and leaders in recent months also announced they are launching pro-AI super PACs to fight state and federal oversight.",
      "The youth AI chatbot ban would have applied to generative AI systems that simulate \u201chumanlike relationship\u201d with users by retaining their personal information and asking unprompted emotional questions. It would have allowed the state attorney general to seek a civil penalty of $25,000 per violation.",
      "James Steyer, founder and CEO of Common Sense Media, said Newsom's veto of the bill was \u201cdeeply disappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis legislation is desperately needed to protect children and teens from dangerous \u2014 and even deadly \u2014 AI companion chatbots,\u201d he said.",
      "But the tech industry argued that the bill was so broad that it would stifle innovation and take away useful tools for children, such as AI tutoring systems and programs that could detect early signs of dyslexia.",
      "Steyer also said the notification law didn't go far enough, saying it \u201cprovides minimal protections for children and families.\"",

The mother of a teenage boy in Florida who died by suicide after developing what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship with a chatbot has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Character.AI. And the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine recently sued OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, alleging that ChatGPT coached the California boy in planning and taking his own life earlier this year.",

      "On Oct. 7, the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to another trio of scientists for their research on the \u201cweirdness\u201d of subatomic particles called quantum tunneling. That has enabled the ultrasensitive measurements achieved by MRI machines and laid the groundwork for better cellphones and faster computers.",

      "While many animals are increasingly at risk of disappearing forever, the updated list shows how species can come back from the brink with dedicated effort, Rima Jabado, deputy chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cHope and concern go hand in hand in this work,\u201d Jabado wrote by email. \u201cThe same persistence that brought back the green sea turtle can be mirrored in small, everyday actions \u2014 supporting sustainable choices, backing conservation initiatives, and urging leaders to follow through on their environmental promises.\u201d",
      "The list is updated every year by teams of scientists assessing data on creatures around the world.

      "Because all the marine mammals native to the Arctic \u2014 seals, whales and polar bears \u2014 rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN\u2019s Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.",
      "The three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report \u2014 harp, hooded and bearded seals \u2014 have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.",
      "The same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \u201cgenerally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\u201d wrote Kovacs.",
      "\u201cActing to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\u201d Kovacs said.",
      "The update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel\u2019s asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.",

      "DENVER -- DENVER (AP) \u2014 Voting equipment company Dominion Voting Systems, a target of false conspiracy theories from President Donald Trump and his supporters since the 2020 election, has been bought by a firm run by a former Republican elections official, the new company announced Thursday.",
      "The newly formed company, Liberty Vote, also vowed to follow the executive order Trump signed last spring seeking sweeping changes to election policies that multiple judges have put on hold for violating the Constitution.",
      "KNOWiNK, a St. Louis-based provider of electronic poll books that allow election officials to confirm voter information, announced the deal and the name change. In a possible nod to a groundless conspiracy theory that linked Dominion to the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez, the release highlighted that the company would become \u201c100% American-owned.\u201d",
      "The announcement also quotes KNOWiNK's owner, former St. Louis elections director Scott Leiendecker, as vowing to provide \u201celection technology that prioritizes paper-based transparency,\u201d one of the longtime demands of election conspiracy theorists. Almost all U.S. voting equipment already leaves a paper trail.",
      "Dominion\u2019s former CEO confirmed the sale in a single-sentence statement on Thursday: \u201cLiberty Vote has acquired Dominion Voting Systems,\u201d John Poulos said.",
      "The release from the new company vows to reintroduce \u201chand-marked paper ballots\u201d and adjust company policies to follow Trump's executive order on voting procedures, which is not in effect because judges have ruled that Trump doesn't have the power to mandate them. Part of the president's order sought to prohibit voting equipment that produces a paper record with \u201ca barcode or quick-response code\u201d \u2014 equipment that is currently in use in hundreds of counties across 19 states.",
      "Denver-based Dominion was at the heart of some of the most fevered conspiracy theories about Trump's loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election., Those false allegations sparked a number of defamation lawsuits against conservative-leaning media and the president's allies, including a settlement in 2023 in which Fox News agreed to pay Dominion $787 million and one this year that Newsmax settled for $67 million.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal auto safety regulators have opened yet another investigation into Tesla's so-called full-self driving technology after dozens of incidents in which its vehicles ran red lights or drove on the wrong side of the road, sometimes crashing into other vehicles and injuring people.",

In reports to regulators, many of the Tesla drivers said the cars gave them no warning about the unexpected behavior.",
      "The probe covers 2,882,566 vehicles, essentially all Teslas equipped with full self-driving technology, or FSD, of which there are two types. Level 2 driver-assistance software, or \u201cFull Self-Driving (Supervised),\u201d requires drivers to pay full attention to the road.

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 La Nina, the cooler and at times costlier flip side of El Nino, has arrived to warp weather worldwide, meteorologists said Thursday. This natural weather phenomenon often turbocharges the Atlantic hurricane season, but this La Nina may be too weak and fleeting to cause much trouble.",
      "In the United States, La Nina often means more precipitation \u2014 including possible snowstorms \u2014 in northern areas and winter dryness in the South. It can bring heavier rains in Indonesia, the Philippines, parts of Australia, Central America, northern South America and southeastern Africa. It also can mean drought in the Middle East, eastern Argentina, eastern China, Korea and southern Japan, meteorologists said.",
      "A La Nina occurs when certain parts of the Central Pacific Ocean cool by half a degree Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to normal. The world had been flirting with one this year and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared Thursday that La Nina conditions have formed. But it's likely to be not very strong and may disappear in the next few months, based on multi-factor computer model forecasts by NOAA and Columbia University, said Michelle L'Heureux, lead scientist on the NOAA team that studies both La Nina and El Nino.",
      "\"There is a three out of four chance it will remain a weak event,\" L'Heureux said in an email. \u201cA weaker event tends to exert less of an influence on the global circulation, so it's possible there will be surprises ahead.\u201d",
      "Surprising already describes the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which was forecast to be stronger than normal, but so far is a tad below average in activity. Traditionally, during a La Nina, there's a weakening of the wind shear that hampers hurricane formation and strengthening, allowing more and bigger storms, especially later in the year, such as late October and into early November and in the Caribbean, said University of Albany hurricane expert Brian Tang.",
      "But Brian McNoldy, who studies tropical cyclones, sea level rise and extreme heat at the University of Miami, said he thinks this La Nina is too late and too little to do much.",
      "The conditions, especially wind shear, favor more hurricane activity, yet it's not happening and long-range computer models don't show much forming for the next couple weeks, said Colorado State University hurricane expert Phil Klotzbach.",

    "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/humanitarian-workers-detail-challenges-aid-gaza-despite-ceasefire/story?id=126524019",
    "published": "Wed, 15 Oct 2025 08:29:31 -0400",
    "summary": "Humanitarian workers said they will face many challenges delivering aid to Gaza including border restrictions and trying to access destroyed roads.",
    "story": [
      "Organizations say there are many logistical challenges in delivering aid.",
      "Dozens of humanitarian organizations have begun rapidly scaling up operations in the hopes of delivering aid to Gaza again amid the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.",
      "Items in Gaza -- including food, clean water, medicine and hygiene products -- are running low, the organizations say. Additionally, hundreds of thousands of families have been displaced, many living in tents in extremely crowded areas.",
      "Humanitarian aid workers told ABC News that they will face several challenges in delivering aid to Gaza. Israeli authorities have limited the amount of aid that can enter the strip, and destroyed roads and neighborhoods make it difficult to reach areas of the enclave.",
      "Additionally, winter is fast-approaching, and aid workers say they have a limited amount of time to deliver provisions to help Palestinians in Gaza get through the cold weather months.",
      "\"We're not asking for anything unreasonable. We're asking for the volume of aid that entered Gaza Strip before the escalation in October 2023,\" Tess Ingram, communications manager for UNICEF, told ABC News. \"I think that's something to watch for in the coming days. Does the aid flow? Are the crossings open? Is the U.N. enabled to do its job, to serve the children of Gaza?. ... But the other part is, does the ceasefire hold? The stakes are really high right now, so that ceasefire has to hold.\"",
      "Lifting restrictions on aid",
      "The U.N. said that Sunday, Oct. 12, was the first day progress was seen in the scale-up of humanitarian aid deliveries into Gaza.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of hot meals and bread bundles were distributed in the north and south, according to the U.N. Additionally, cooking gas entered the strip for the first time since March as well as tents, frozen meat, fresh fruit, flour and medicine, the U.N. said.",
      "However, on Monday, no trucks entered Gaza because of the transfer of Israeli hostages, and border crossings were also closed on Tuesday due to the Jewish religious holiday of Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah.",
      "Israeli officials announced on Tuesday it would not reopen the Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt and would limit aid entering Gaza after Hamas failed to return all the bodies of the deceased hostages, as called for under the ceasefire agreement.",
      "\"Starting tomorrow, only half of the agreed number of trucks -- 300 trucks -- will be allowed to enter, and all of them will belong to the U.N. and humanitarian NGOs, with no private sector involvement,\" COGAT, the Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, said in a statement. \"No fuel or gas will be allowed into the Strip, except for specific needs related to humanitarian infrastructure.\"",
      "Hamas said the rubble makes it logistically challenging to locate the bodies of the deceased hostages, but Israel said it believes Hamas knows where the hostages' bodies are and is purposefully delaying their return.",
      "Jolien Veldwijk, CARE Palestine Country Director, said the number of trucks entering Gaza is just \"a trickle\" of what is needed to meet the needs of the population.",
      "\"The destruction is significantly worse than compared to seven, eight months ago,\" she told ABC News, compared to the first ceasefire when she was also in Gaza.",
      "Multiple organizations, including CARE, said they have not been able to get aid into Gaza since March 2, when Israel imposed a total blockade -- in an effort to pressure Hamas to release the remaining hostages -- that lasted for 11 weeks.",
      "The organization said their repeated requests to deliver aid have been denied by Israeli authorities. Veldwijk said supplies are currently stuck in warehouses in Egypt and in Jordan.",
      "Similarly, James Hoobler, a humanitarian policy adviser with Oxfam America, told ABC News the group has had 4,000 food parcels and a large volume of essential water sanitation and hygiene equipment stuck in its warehouse in Amman, Jordan, since March.",
      "Some organizations say they are also running into red tape while trying to access the strip.",
      "\"We're running out of supplies now,\" Veldwijk said of the CARE team on the ground in Gaza. \"We still can't bring anything in. ... We're desperate to get our supplies in, but we're also sort of desperate for all the border crossings to open.\"",
      "Ingram, from UNICEF, who is currently in Gaza, said limiting the volume of aid entering the strip is the opposite of what is needed but that UNICEF has seen some success in its operations on the ground since the ceasefire went into effect.",
      "\"We are able to move far more freely, get access to areas that we haven't been able to get to for a while,\" she told ABC News. \"We don't have to coordinate our movements with the Israeli authorities anymore, which means that we're not facing delays or denials.\"",
      "She went on, \"So for example, the last three days, I was in and around Gaza City, and that was kind of the first time in a while that we were able to get into parts of Gaza City that were the focus of that intense bombardment in August and September, and really get a sense of how that has affected the area and how people are planning to resume living there, and what they need.\"",
      "Rebuilding water systems",
      "Humanitarian workers told ABC News that rebuilding water networks will be critical in the rebuilding effort in Gaza, but it comes with many logistical challenges.",
      "Aid workers said water that comes from the ground in Gaza is very salty from years of degradation. Drinking water needs to be desalinated, which is accomplished by desalination plants across Gaza, aid workers say.",
      "\"There needs to be quite a bit of work to make sure that they're all functioning properly.\" Ingram said. \"There's some that are out of service. So, there's work that needs to go into making sure that drinking water production increases.\"",

      "The network of pipes that brought water into homes has mostly been destroyed so most people in Gaza receive their water from water trucks, which collect drinking water from desalination plants and distribute it throughout the strip.",
      "Ingram said the trucks have gone through wear and tear, which may limit their ability to distribute water as water networks and wells are rehabilitated.",
      "\"The water trucks themselves are a limited fleet that have done two years in a war zone over rubble,\" she said. \"They need maintenance and repairs.\"",
      "Aid workers say there are many groundwater wells, which pump domestic water that people use for cooking, cleaning and showering, many of which need repairs.",
      "Veldwijk said CARE has rehabilitated water networks in the past to bring drinking water and domestic water to people's homes to complement the water supplied by trucks, but some of have been destroyed and need to be rebuilt.",
      "She said the group is also working to rehabilitate wells as well as desalination units.",
      "Aid workers added that rebuilding sanitation networks is also necessary but will be a challenge until the supplies entering Gaza necessary increase.",
      "\"I went to a big wastewater dam in Gaza City, which is surrounded by residential area, and it's at risk of flooding because the pumps aren't working,\" Ingram said. \"Sanitation presents a massive disease risk if we don't get on top of it. So, we need to really improve the systems that remove solid waste, that deal with sewage and wastewater.\"",
      "Clearing rubble and rebuilding roads",
      "Destruction across Gaza also presents a logistical challenge in delivering aid to the civilian population. Many roads have been destroyed, and rubble may be hiding unexploded ordinances.",
      "Zaheer Kham, global director of fundraising for the humanitarian charity Human Appeal, told ABC News that he received a message from teams on the ground in Gaza on Tuesday that rubble in the roads is starting to be removed.",
      "\"Is it enough? Of course not, we need heavy machinery to remove the rubble in the roads that has accumulated over two years,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Veldwijk said the roads being destroyed make it difficult to travel from southern Gaza to central Gaza to northern Gaza and if all the border crossings are opened, supplies can more easily be funneled throughout Gaza.",
      "Aid workers say entire sections in Gaza have been destroyed, making it difficult to find people who may be in need of aid.",
      "\"It's like being inside the skeleton of a city,\" Ingram said of visiting neighborhoods in Gaza City and Jabalia, just north of Gaza City. \"Everything is gray. Things that would normally tell you where you are, are gone, and it's very disorienting.\"",
      "On Tuesday, the U.N. Development Programme announced that the cost of rebuilding Gaza is estimated at around $70 billion, with $20 billion needed in the next three years alone.",
      "Fast-approaching winter season",
      "With the cold weather months approaching, humanitarian organizations say there is an urgent need to get warm clothes and blankets into Gaza.",
      "Winters in Gaza are usually not very severe with low temperatures typically in the 40s F, but heavy rains and its seaside location can make it feel colder.",
      "\"It really is a race against time,\" Hoobler, with Oxfam America, said. \"Winterization is a major issue, especially with the amount of destruction to housing that we've seen. So, we know people are in very overcrowded conditions there. They don't have adequate shelter. Many of the makeshift shelters that people were in were destroyed in bombings.\"",
      "Nine out of 10 homes have been damaged or destroyed in Gaza, meaning some people are sleeping in homes with missing walls or roofs while others are sleeping in tents, according to Ingram, increasing the need for mattresses, blankets and other provisions.",
      "Ingram said that last winter, some children -- including babies -- died of hypothermia, which she said is preventable with the proper supplies.",
      "She added that she is concerned that many children in Gaza have only one or two sets of clothes, many of which are not warm enough for winter months.",
      "\"Our aim is to provide every child in the Gaza Strip under the age of 10 with a new set of winter clothes during the ceasefire and a new pair of shoes,\" Ingram said. \"That goal is heavily dependent on the volume of aid that gets into the Gaza Strip, so we remain hopeful, but we do call on both parties to the conflict to adhere to the terms of the ceasefire.\"",

      "The weekend storm brought high winds and surf that battered the low-lying Alaska Native communities along the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in the southwestern part of the state, nearly 500 miles (800 km) from Anchorage. At least one person was killed and two were missing. The Coast Guard plucked two dozen people from their homes after the structures floated out to sea.",

      "Across the region, more than 1,500 people were displaced.

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The ongoing government shutdown is delaying the announcement of the annual Social Security cost-of-living adjustment for tens of millions of beneficiaries.",
      "Originally scheduled for Wednesday, the 2024 Social Security COLA announcement will now be Oct. 24. It is timed to the September Consumer Price Index, which also has not yet been released.",
      "The agency adjusts its benefits every year based on inflation. The postponement of the announcement is the most recent example of how the government shutdown, entering its third week and with little progress made toward a resolution, has made it more difficult for people to plan out their finances.",
      "Projections by Senior Citizens League and the AARP anticipate a COLA increase of roughly 2.7%. About 70.6 million people, including retirees, disabled people and children, get Social Security benefits.",
      "Social Security Administration beneficiaries have voiced concerns that next year's increase will not be enough to counter rising costs.",
      "Sue Conard, a 75-year-old retired nurse from La Crosse, Wisconsin, and SSA recipient, recently traveled to the U.S. Capitol with other retiree members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union to lobby for meaningful progress towards gaining health care protections to end the shutdown, as well as changes to Social Security benefits.",
      "She said she wants lawmakers to change the calculation on how the COLA is determined since the standard CPI gauge, which includes a market basket of consumer goods and services, doesn't take into account many costs typical for older Americans.",
      "\u201cThe issue of how the COLA is determined is flat-out wrong because health care is not factored into the CPI,\" said Conard, speaking on the front steps of the Longworth House Office Building.",
      "Some lawmakers have proposed legislation that would make SSA use a different index, called the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E), to calculate the cost-of-living increase that measures price changes based on the spending patterns of older people on things such as health care, food and medicine.",

      "AARP CEO Myechia Minter-Jordan said the COLA \u201cisn\u2019t just a source of income \u2014 it\u2019s a lifeline of independence and dignity, for tens of millions of older Americans.\" But even with an adjusted COLA, a majority of Americans still face challenges covering basic expenses, she said.",
      "Vanessa Fields, a 70-year-old former social worker and AFSCME member from Philadelphia, said she pays roughly $1,000 per month for groceries, more than in previous years. The COLA doesn't keep up with rising costs, she said, \u201cand we're going to be in bad shape if lawmakers don't act.\"",
      "The agency is expected to begin notifying recipients about their new benefit amount starting in early December. A spokesperson for Social Security who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the COLA said retirement and Supplemental Security Income benefits would be adjusted beginning Jan. 1, 2026, without any delay despite the current government lapse in appropriations.",
      "The delayed COLA announcement comes as the national social insurance plan faces a severe financial shortfall in the coming years and as the agency has seen substantial workforce cuts.",
      "The annual Social Security and Medicare trustees report released in June said the program\u2019s trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2034, instead of last year\u2019s estimate of 2035. If the trust fund is depleted, the government will be able to pay only 81% of scheduled benefits, the report said.",
      "In addition, the agency laid off at least 7,000 people from its workforce of 60,000 earlier this year, putting pressure on the remaining workers to handle claims and answer inquiries from a rising number of recipients.",

      "Charles Crawford, 59, has been on death row for more than 30 years. The scheduled lethal injection comes several months after the execution of Mississippi\u2019s longest-serving death row inmate in a year of increasing executions nationwide.",
      "Crawford was convicted of abducting Kristy Ray from her parents\u2019 home in northern Mississippi\u2019s Tippah County on Jan. 29, 1993. According to court records, when Ray\u2019s mother came home, her daughter\u2019s car was gone and a handwritten ransom note had been left on the table.",

      "He later told authorities he blacked out and did not recall killing Ray.",
      "At the time of his arrest, Crawford was days away from going to trial on a separate assault charge. That stemmed from an attack in 1991 in which Crawford was accused of raping a 17-year-old girl and hitting her friend with a hammer.",

      "His lawyers are currently appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that Crawford should be granted a new trial because his Sixth Amendment rights were violated in his 1994 trial.",
      "The appeal alleges that Crawford\u2019s lawyers admitted his guilt in the capital murder trial and pursued an insanity defense despite Crawford\u2019s repeated objections. The argument relies on a 2018 Supreme Court ruling, which ordered a new trial for a death row inmate and established that a lawyer for a criminal defendant cannot override a client\u2019s wish to maintain innocence at trial.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court is taking up a major Republican-led challenge to the Voting Rights Act, the centerpiece legislation of the Civil Rights Movement, that could gut a key provision of the law that prohibits racial discrimination in redistricting.",
      "The justices on Wednesday are hearing arguments for the second time in a case over Louisiana's congressional map, which has two majority Black districts. A ruling for the state could open the door for legislatures to redraw congressional maps across the South, potentially boosting Republican electoral prospects by eliminating majority Black and Latino seats that tend to favor Democrats.",
      "A mid-decade battle over congressional redistricting already is playing out across the nation, after President Donald Trump began urging Texas and other Republican-controlled states to redraw their lines to make it easier for the GOP to hold its narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.",

Twelve years ago, the court took a sledgehammer to another pillar of the landmark voting law that required states with a history of racial discrimination to get approval in advance from the Justice Department or federal judges before making election-related changes.",
      "The court has separately given state legislatures wide berth to gerrymander for political purposes, subject only to review by state supreme courts. If the court now weakens or strikes down the law's Section 2, states would not be bound by any limits in how they draw electoral districts, a result that is expected to lead to extreme gerrymandering by whichever party is in power at the state level.",
      "Just two years ago, the court, by a 5-4 vote, affirmed a ruling that found a likely violation of the Voting Rights Act in a similar case over Alabama\u2019s congressional map. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined their three more liberal colleagues in the outcome.",

      "One woman was found dead in Kwigillingok, and authorities on Monday night called off the search for two men after their home floated away.",
      "In Kwigillingok, the school was the only facility with full power, but it had no working toilet, and 400 people stayed there Monday night. Workers were trying to fix the bathrooms; a situation report from the state emergency operations center on Tuesday noted that \u201choney buckets are being used.\u201d",
      "A preliminary assessment showed every home in the village was damaged by the storm, with about three dozen having drifted from their foundations, the emergency management office said.",
      "Power systems flooded in Napakiak, and severe erosion was reported in Toksook Bay. In Nightmute, officials said, fuel drums were reported floating in the community, and there was a scent of fuel in the air and a sheen on the water.",
      "Officials activated members of the National Guard to help with the emergency response, and crews were trying to take advantage of any breaks in the weather to fly in food, water, generators and communication equipment.",
      "Officials warned of a long road to recovery and a need for continued support for the hardest-hit communities. Most rebuilding supplies would have to be transported in, and there is little time left with winter just around the corner.",
      "\u201cIndigenous communities in Alaska are resilient,\" said Rick Thoman, an Alaska climate specialist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. \u201cBut, you know, when you have an entire community where effectively every house is damaged and many of them will be uninhabitable with winter knocking at the door now, there\u2019s only there\u2019s only so much that any individual or any small community can do.\u201d",
      "Thoman said the storm was likely fueled by the warm surface waters of the Pacific Ocean, which has been heating up because of human-caused climate change and making storms more intense.",
      "The remnants of another storm, Typhoon Merbok, caused damage across a massive swath of western Alaska three years ago.",

      "A Florida judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked the planned transfer of prime downtown Miami land for President Donald Trump\u2019s future presidential library.",
      "The move by Circuit Judge Mavel Ruiz came after a Miami activist alleged that officials at a local college violated Florida's open government law when they gifted the sizable plot of real estate to the state, which then voted to transfer it to the foundation for the planned library.",
      "\u201cThis is not an easy decision,\u201d Mavel said Tuesday when explaining her ruling from the bench, finding that the college didn't give the public reasonable notice ahead of the vote last month.",
      "\u201cThis is not a case, at least for this court, rooted in politics,\u201d she added.",
      "The nearly 3-acre (1.2-hectare) property is a developer\u2019s dream and is valued at more than $67 million, according to a 2025 assessment by the Miami-Dade County property appraiser. One real estate expert wagered that the parcel \u2014 one of the last undeveloped lots on an iconic stretch of palm tree-lined Biscayne Boulevard \u2014 could sell for hundreds of millions of dollars more.",
      "Marvin Dunn, an activist and chronicler of local Black history, filed a lawsuit this month in a Miami-Dade County court against the Board of Trustees for Miami Dade College, a state-run school that owned the property. He alleged that the board violated Florida's Government in the Sunshine law by not providing sufficient notice for its special meeting on Sept. 23, when it voted to give up the land.",
      "An agenda released ahead of the meeting simply stated the board would consider conveying property to a state fund overseen by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet, but provided no details on which piece of property was being considered or why. Unlike every other meeting the board has held this year, the 8 a.m. meeting on Sept. 23 was not livestreamed.",
      "A week later, DeSantis and other top GOP officials voted to transfer the land again, effectively putting the property under the control of the Trump family when they deeded it to the foundation for Trump\u2019s library. That foundation is led by three trustees: Eric Trump, Tiffany Trump\u2019s husband, Michael Boulos, and the president\u2019s attorney James Kiley.",
      "Jesus Suarez, an attorney for the college, argued that MDC did what was required under the law and questioned Dunn's political motivations for filing the case.",

      "\u201cThe people have a right to know what they\u2019re going to decide to do when the transaction is so significant, so unusual and deprives the students and the college of this land,\u201d said plaintiff's attorney Richard Brodsky, speaking with The Associated Press prior to the judge's decision.",
      "Javier Ley-Soto, general counsel for Miami Dade College, testified that it is still in the process of finalizing the land transfer. Delays caused by an injunction could cost the college up to $300,000, he estimated.",
      "Other Florida locations had previously been floated as library sites, including properties associated with Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton and Florida International University in suburban Miami. DeSantis signed a bill this year preempting local governments from blocking development of a presidential library, aiming to overrule potential opposition in liberal-leaning counties or municipalities.",

But he discharged \u201cwithout honor\u201d an entire regiment of 167 Black soldiers without due process, in connection with a shooting in a Texas town. Roosevelt encouraged photographer Edward S.

      "Black residents in a newly created Louisiana congressional district fear they could lose their representation under a case being heard before the U.S. Supreme Court",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 For nearly three decades, the small town of Mansfield was represented in Louisiana\u2019s congressional delegation by white Republicans, even though its population is about 80% Black and leans heavily Democratic.",
      "That changed with the election last year of U.S. Rep. Cleo Fields, a Black Democrat who was able to win after a newly drawn political map carved out a second Black majority congressional district in the state.",
      "Mansfield Mayor Thomas Jones Jr. said he and others finally feel as if their communities are being represented in the nation\u2019s capital.",
      "\u201cWe feel connected, like we have somebody that\u2019s helping us,\u201d he said.",
      "Fields\u2019 seat, and what Jones describes as the benefits of having him in Washington, might disappear depending on how the U.S. Supreme Court rules in a case it will hear Wednesday.",
      "The district Fields represents is the result of a hard-fought battle by civil rights groups representing Black voters in the state. Leaders in predominantly Black communities across the 218-mile-long (350-kilometer-long) district said they feel he finally gives them a voice to represent their needs.",
      "But opponents say the district was unconstitutionally gerrymandered based on race. If the court eventually rules in favor of the plaintiffs, the decision could have a ripple effect far beyond this one district in Louisiana. It potentially will kick out the last major pillar of the 60-year-old Voting Rights Act and prevent Black voters from challenging political maps that dilute their influence.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s new 6th Congressional District, which roughly traces the Red River, runs across the state in a narrow, diagonal path. It stretches from the state capital, Baton Rouge, in southern Louisiana to Shreveport, in the state's northwest corner.",
      "The district encompasses part or all of 10 parishes. It connects swaths of the state that some argue are vastly different in their priorities, geography, economies \u2014 even their gumbo recipes.",
      "Fields is aware of criticism about the district's snakelike shape that helped make it majority Black, but he argues that it's contiguous and said all the state's congressional districts are geographically large, representing both urban and rural areas. More importantly, he said, the district gives \"people of color an opportunity, not a guarantee, to elect a candidate of their choice.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou tell me I have to jump a certain height, I can work on that. You tell me I\u2019ve got to run faster, I can work on that as well,\" he said. \"But you tell me I got to be white, there\u2019s nothing I can do about that.\u201d",
      "In 2022, Louisiana\u2019s GOP-dominated Legislature drew congressional boundaries that maintained one Black majority district and five mostly white districts, in a state with a population that is about one-third Black. A federal judge later struck down the map for violating the Voting Rights Act, and in a major case the following year the Supreme Court found that Alabama had to create its own second majority Black congressional district.",
      "Rather than being forced to have a judge draw its map, the Republican-controlled Louisiana Legislature and its Republican governor passed the current map that created a second Black majority district.",
      "Black residents now account for 54% of registered voters in Fields' district, up from 24% under the previous boundaries.",
      "Throughout much of the South, older Black residents still remember Jim Crow-era methods around voting such as literacy tests and poll taxes that were designed to disenfranchise them.",
      "In Louisiana, civil rights groups argued that the lack of a second majority minority congressional district was a modern-day effort to dilute Black voting strength. For decades, with a brief exception in the 1990s, Louisiana had just one majority Black district.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Cabinet dealers, interior designers and remodeling contractors in the U.S. hope new tariffs on imported kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered wooden furniture that kicked in Tuesday will create more business for them and eventually boost domestic production of those products.",
      "But several small business owners in the home improvement industry say they expect some short-term pains from the import taxes: Clients with projects already on the books might balk at having to pay more for the budget-priced cabinets they selected. Potential customers may postpone kitchen and bathroom renovations until costs \u2014 and the economy \u2014 seem more stable.",
      "\u201cI think the volatility around pricing is damaging to the remodeling industry,\u201d said Allison Harlow, an interior designer in Michigan whose company, Curio Design Studio, creates and builds custom bathrooms and kitchens. \u201cMost people will hear the headline of \u2018Kitchen cabinets will go up 50%\u2019 and might just opt out of even reaching out to our company.\u201d",
      "Despite high mortgage rates having depressed sales of existing homes in recent years, a forecast of remodeling activity by Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies predicts that homeowner spending on improvements and maintenance will remain steady into the middle of 2026.",
      "A proclamation that President Donald Trump signed on Sept. 29 cited national security and foreign trade practices as grounds for imposing the tariffs on certain finished wood products and product components.",
      "Of them, imported vanities and kitchen cabinets incurred the steepest tax rates: 25% until the end of the year and 50% starting on New Year\u2019s Day.",
      "Upholstered chairs, seats and sofas also are subject to a 25% worldwide tariff effective Tuesday, with the rate scheduled to increase to 30% on Jan. 1. In addition, the presidential proclamation put a 10% import tax on softwood timber and lumber, which comes from evergreen trees like pine and cedars.",
      "Softwoods often are used to make furniture and in wood frame construction. Canada is the source of about 85% of the softwood lumber the U.S. imports, or nearly one-quarter of the national supply, according to the National Association of Homebuilders.",
      "Some U.S. trading partners are receiving more favorable treatment when it comes to the furniture and cabinetry tariffs. The tax on U.K. exports was capped at 10%, while the rate for wood products from the European Union and Japan was capped at 15%.",
      "The American Kitchen Cabinet Alliance and other trade and advocacy groups lobbied for tariffs to help offset what they described as a flood of cheap cabinets from countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia, China and elsewhere in the decades since more U.S. furniture manufacturing moved offshore.",
      "U.S.-made products tend to cost more but often are of better quality.",
      "John Lovallo, an analyst at UBS bank, estimates the tariffs on imported cabinets and vanities could add roughly $280 to the average cost of building a single-family home, not enough to sink a project that often carries an overall price tag more than 1,000 times larger than that.",

      "\u201cIt will make importers more selective in the varieties they bring in,\u201d Miller said: \u201cSo I think the bigger impact is going to be on the product variety side: Consumers should expect less variety.\u201d",
      "Although the White House said the tariffs were intended to boost domestic production and protect U.S. businesses from predatory trade practices, some cabinet makers say that will be difficult because their supply chains are multinational.",
      "Linq Kitchen, a Los Angeles-area company that designs, builds and installs modern-style kitchen cabinets, uses plywood and melamine panels from Asia and Europe in its projects, co-founder Josh Qian said. A suitable domestic alternative does not exist, he said.",
      "\u201cThe kitchen cabinet industry is highly globalized, and even U.S.-based manufacturers depend on imported materials, hardware, and finishes,\u201d Qian said. \u201cThese tariffs may sound protective, but in reality, they often raise costs across the entire supply chain.\"",
      "At the same time, cabinet companies that don't sell foreign products or rely on imported components look forward to capturing more business. One is ACO Denver Custom Cabinetry in Denver, Colorado, which enlists Amish, Mennonite, and New German Baptist shops in the Midwest to handcraft custom cabinets.",
      "Andrea Mulkey, the company's president and co-founder, said her main concern is whether interest in American-made cabinets will grows too quickly.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict how much new business might come our way as competitors are affected,\u201d Mulkey said. \u201cWe simply couldn\u2019t serve everyone if demand suddenly surged. The real challenge is similar to what we saw post-COVID, when everyone got busy at once, and access to raw materials became strained.\u201d",
      "The Curio Design Studio has its custom cabinets made in Minnesota and Wisconsin, but Harlow worries about the tariffs costing her customers.",
      "\u201cI think it will decrease consumer confidence and create a narrative that the work is going to get inherently more expensive,\u201d Harlow said. \u201cI think we will have to work harder to attract potential clients with messaging of how this blanket statement, \u2018Kitchen cabinets will go up 50%,\u2019 does not impact our particular business model.\u201d",

      "The move would allow the LA County Board of Supervisors to provide rent relief for tenants who have fallen behind as a result of the crackdown on immigrants. A local state of emergency can also funnel state money for legal aid and other services.",

Federal agents have rounded up immigrants without legal status to be in the U.S. from Home Depots, car washes, bus stops, and farms. Some U.S. citizens have also been detained.",
      "Horvath and Janice Hahn said the raids have spread fear and destabilized households and businesses.",
      "\u201cThey are targeting families, disrupting classrooms, silencing workers, and forcing people to choose between staying safe and staying housed,\" Horvath said in a statement, referencing actions by the Trump administration.

Jeremy Weis, one of Shockley\u2019s attorneys, said Monday it\u2019s unlikely the lower appeals court will issue a ruling on the DNA testing request before Tuesday\u2019s execution.

      "PORTLAND, Maine -- PORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have muted this year's autumn colors, and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual.",
      "Soaking in the fall foliage is an annual tradition in the New England states as well as areas such as the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina and Upper Peninsula of Michigan. As the days shorten and temperatures drop, chlorophyll in leaves breaks down, and they turn to the autumn tones of yellow, orange and red.",
      "But dry weather in summer and fall can change all that because the lack of water causes leaves to brown and fall more quickly. And that's happening this year, as more than 40% of the country was considered to be in a drought in early October, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.",
      "That's more than twice the average, said Brad Rippey, a U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist and an author of the drought monitor, which is a partnership between the federal government and University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Drought has hit the Northeast and western U.S. especially hard, he said.",
      "It all adds up to fewer leaves to peep.",
      "\u201cI think it might be a little bit of a short and less colorful season, for the most part,\u201d Rippey said. \u201cThe color is just not going to be there this year for some hillsides.\u201d",
      "Despite the gloomy forecast, autumn enthusiasts said it's still a great year to get out and enjoy nature's fireworks display. There is still a lot of color in New England's trees, said Andy Finton, senior conservation ecologist with The Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts.",
      "Climate change is stressing forests with severe weather and heat waves, but autumn in New England remains a beautiful time of year to experience the wonderment of forest ecosystems firsthand, he said.",
      "\u201cOur trees and our forests have an inherent resilience,\u201d Finton said. \u201cThey are still very resilient, and I am constantly surprised at how wonderful the fall season is despite these stresses.\u201d",
      "The tourism business built around leaf peeping has also proven resilient. At the Mills Falls Resort Collection at the Lake in Meredith, New Hampshire, general manager Barbara Beckwith said business is good at the four inns that have 170 rooms. The number of Canadian tourists is down, Beckwith acknowledged, but she said that has been made up with domestic leaf peepers, mostly from New England.",
      "Beckwith said her properties were booked solid on weekends through mid-October and had been for weeks.",
      "\u201cThis year is actually going to be better than last year,\u201d Beckwith said. \u201cLast year was an election and that put a lot of trepidation in people. Now, they are traveling. The uncertainty of the election is over. We all know whose president now and we are traveling.\u201d",

      "But there were signs of a dry spring in the central part of the state, which was more severe the farther west you travel, said Colorado State Forest Service entomologist Dan West, who spends many fall days in a plane looking at how insect infestations are affecting tree health.",
      "Crispy edges, muted colors, and dropping leaves before they can take on a red or purple hue are all signs of drought stress, West said.",

      "For 14 years, Donnie Wahlberg starred as Detective Danny Reagan on the CBS police procedural \"Blue Bloods.\" The hit drama about the Reagans, the fictional first family of the New York Police Department, had a loyal following. \"I was stopped on airplanes, on trains, on the street, at basketball \u2013 you name it. Wherever I was, somebody would tell me they love 'Blue Bloods,'\" said Wahlberg.",
      "Now 56, Wahlberg is sitting at a new family's dinner table, in \"Boston Blue,\" a \"Blue Bloods\" spinoff set in a city the actor knows well.",
      "Wahlberg grew up the eighth of nine kids in the working-class Boston neighborhood of Dorchester. \"We were poor,\" he said. \"There were nine kids, a dog, a cat, and a grandma in the basement, and my mom and dad for a while. There were kids coming and going, running away, being arrested. There were arguments, fights, alcohol. I definitely learned from some of my older siblings that, here's a clear path of what not to do.\"",
      "Wahlberg says he was the family peacemaker. \"I don't like to use the term ('cause I don't wanna insult my other siblings), but one of the adults. My role was to get everyone together and be happy by any means necessary.\"",
      "The discord wasn't just inside the house; 1970s Boston was a cauldron of racial tension. A controversial court-ordered desegregation program bussed students to schools outside their neighborhoods. As a first grader, Wahlberg was sent from Irish-Catholic Dorchester to predominantly Black Roxbury.",
      "He describes it as \"probably the most important thing that ever happened in my life.\"",
      "Because? \"Because I don't know what I would've not been exposed to, had I not been on those buses. In my neighborhood, if I woulda said, 'Yeah, I wanna be a singer one day,' I could think of five kids in the neighborhood who would punch me in the face. And two of them lived in my house!\"",
      "It was after hearing hip hop in the fourth grade that Wahlberg caught the performing bug. \"I would listen to 'Rapper's Delight,' I just would start writing my own raps and making up my own songs,\" he said.",
      "That helped Wahlberg earn an audition, at just 14 years old, with Maurice Starr, the local impresario who'd founded New Edition and was starting a new band. \"Maurice was looking for the equivalent of the Osmonds to the Jacksons,\" he said.",
      "What did his parents think? \"My mom was super supportive,\" he recalled. \"And I said, 'Dad, I'm gonna start this music band.' And he said, 'Well, I tell ya' what: If you ever do make it big, and you come home, and you've changed, I'm gonna kick your ass.'\"",
      "In 1984, Donnie and his younger brother Mark became the first two members of New Kids on the Block. But the family affair was short-lived, as Mark quit. \"He didn't like singing,\" said Donnie. \"He couldn't sing.\u00a0 There's a scene of him as Dirk Diggler in 'Boogie Nights' singing horribly. That's actually better than he sang as a member of New Kids!\"",
      "With four other members in place (including some of Wahlberg's schoolmates), the group struggled at first to find its footing. But by the late 1980s, they appeared to have the right stuff:",
      "While the band was popular, it was far from critics' choice. \"I really struggled with the criticism of the band \u2013 we couldn't sing, we were puppets, we were fake,\" said Wahlberg.",
      "To feel better about himself, Wahlberg focused on writing and producing, not just for the New Kids, but also for his brother Mark. Soon enough they had a #1 hit, \"Good Vibrations.\"",
      "Donnie said, \"Marky Mark and my brother's career and his music was really when I started to get my head screwed on right of how I could really prove myself.\"",
      "Prove himself \u2026 and protect his kid brother. \"My brother was getting in trouble and my mom was like, 'You gotta help your brother and get him out of the streets,'\" said Wahlberg. \"I don't like to wear the Marky Mark and my brother's career as some kind of badge of honor. He worked very hard for his career. But I really did, you know, help him in a big way, and helped myself in a big way in doing that.\"",
      "After the New Kids broke up in 1994, Wahlberg turned to acting, breaking through in \"The Sixth Sense.\" Other roles followed, including \"Band of Brothers\" and \"Boomtown,\" along with reunions for New Kids on the Block, which still keep him busy.",
      "Wahlberg now lives outside Chicago, in a home he shares with his second wife, TV personality Jenny McCarthy.",
      "\"We have very similar upbringings, which really helps,\" said McCarthy. \"I think we're both people-pleasers, which could also be bad if you're not in therapy about it!\"",
      "\"Lotta therapy we've each had, and together,\" said Wahlberg.",
      "\"But we're caretakers, you know, of our family, which I think is something to be proud of,\" McCarthy added.",
      "They may now live in McCarthy's hometown, but Boston is never far from Wahlberg's heart, as evident in his home office, which features mementoes from Bill Belichick, Bill Russell and Larry Bird.",
      "And then there's his new show which he wasn't sure he wanted to do after \"Blue Bloods\"' cancellation. \"I love 'Blue Bloods,'\" he said. \"I fought tooth-and-nail to keep it on the air. And here's an opportunity to keep this character alive. And suddenly, when I started to look at it through that lens, it was like, how do I not do this? If all those millions of 'Blue Bloods' fans don't show up and love it, then I know we put our best foot forward.\"",
      "Between his TV work and concerts, it's a busy life for Donnie Wahlberg. \"People say to me, 'Oh, gosh, when do you sleep?' You want me to complain? Everything I ever wanted, I'm doing it. I wanna work harder, I want to be worthy of it. I want to be worthy of \u2026 the gift that so many people give me of their time. How can I not work my ass off to repay that?\"",
      "But he says he's just doing what he's always done: \"My childhood was spent trying to bring joy and love to a large group of people amidst chaos and confusion and pain. And it's what I do for a living right now.\u00a0 It's what I've grown up to do.\"",

    "summary": "The star of \"The Bear\" talks about how he approached playing legendary rocker Bruce Springsteen in a new film, and what he found in common with him.",
    "story": [
      "Asbury Park is a Jersey beach town with heart, history and harmony, not to mention a voice. Bruce Springsteen's presence can still be felt in his old haunts \u2013 the Stone Pony, the Wonder Bar, Madam Marie's. The town's welcome mat is its storied boardwalk, where we met Jeremy Allen White. \"There's a lot of romance here still, I feel like,\" said White, who was thinking about his own hometown.",
      "\"Do you feel that way a little bit about Brooklyn?\" I asked.",
      "\"I do, yeah. I always feel at home there.\"",
      "Had that Brooklyn boy come out here, say, three years ago, he might have been just another tourist. But not anymore. His turn as the talented but tormented chef on the award-winning FX series \"The Bear\" has made the 34-year-old one of the hottest commodities in Hollywood.",
      "I said, \"Early on, it strikes me that if you were just to read the script, it was kind of just a story about a sandwich shop.\"",
      "\"It was a hard thing to explain,\" said White, \"and it sounded something like that, you know? Yes, this, like, kid, he comes back, he's a chef, and he's, like, opening a sandwich shop. And I saw my friends trying to be nice and say, Oh, that sounds great, you know?\"",
      "He ended up sweeping nearly all of the awards: Emmys, Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild, Critics Choice. His two young daughters call them his \"trophy winners cups.\" \"They like them, they get a kick out of it, but they also are very honest and there's just like, Why do you get all these things?\" White said.",
      "Back out at the Jersey shore, it's not those past awards that matter. It's the ones that might be coming down the Jersey Turnpike for White's performance as Springsteen himself.",
      "And yes, that really is White's voice. He said, \"If you're gonna do one thing to get it right, you have to perform to the point of exhaustion. 'Cause he continues until he cannot go any longer.",
      "\"Everybody's got their own idea of Bruce Springsteen. And I think at the beginning, I was approaching it like, how am I going to make everybody happy? That's a fool's errand. It's an impossibility.\"",
      "\"Was there a moment that you thought to yourself, Yeah, I got this. I can do this?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, I don't think so,\" White replied. \"There were moments where I found confidence, but I always wanted more, I wanted more time, I wanted to go deeper.\"",
      "Springsteen was aware of White before the film. He had seen and admired the emotional complexity in his work, and that's a well Springsteen knew whoever played him needed to have. White said, \"Bruce has gone on record and said, you know, I have no problem performing for three hours on stage. That's easy for me. I know exactly who I am on stage. You know, it's the other 21 hours that I have trouble with.\"",
      "\"Did you know any of that before you really took a deep dive?\" I asked.",
      "\"I mean, I was familiar enough with his music that, you know, I understood his depth, and I understood, you know, we're dealing with a man who's looked over the edge before, absolutely,\" said White. \"But, no.\"",
      "The film, \"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\" based on the book of the same name, follows the making of the 1982 album \"Nebraska.\" Some say it's Springsteen as his best, but he himself may have actually been at his worst.",
      "In his 2016 autobiography, \"Born to Run,\" he describes an emotional breakdown while at a Texas county fair, not long after \"Nebraska\" was finished:",
      "\"I've just pulled a perfect swan dive into my abyss; my stomach is on rinse cycle, and I'm going down, down, down. I just feel a need to get rooted somewhere, before I drift into ether.\"",
      "White said, \"I asked him, what's that panic about? You know, what is that fear inside of you? And he said, 'I had this moment where I felt like an outsider and observer in my own life.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Have you ever struggled with mental illness yourself?\"",
      "\"Yeah, of course,\" said White. \"When he told me about that, that feeling of being an observer of your own life, that was very familiar to me. I remember when I found acting, there was a lot of like, I think like, chaos and confusion, just a lot going on. I couldn't focus on myself. And I found acting, and I found some peace and I found some focus.\"",
      "White has drawn from that emotional trough as early as he can remember, even during his days of doing crime dramas on TV, when he was looking for certain things \u2013 not just a job. \"Yeah, you know, I was very lucky, I was a kid, so my first agents were kind of confused and upset with me for kind of, like, having a standard for what I would go audition for,\" he said. \"I'd never done anything before when I was 13, and they were like, Just go on the audition, you know?\"",
      "One of those auditions landed him on \"Shameless.\" For 11 seasons he played bad boy, big brother, and brainiac Lip Gallagher.",
      "His unruly hair and blue eyes got him counted among the so-called \"rodent men\" - a term used to describe a few of the most physically desirable things a man can be these days. His Calvin Klein underwear ad certainly helped.",
      "Before we left the shore, we stopped by the Stone Pony, where White tried to re-create on film Springsteen's early glory days.",
      "\"Bruce was there, like he was a lot of days, and he came out, and he kind of introduced me to the audience, so he gave them to me all warmed up,\" White recalled. \"They made me feel like a star for three-and-a-half minutes. And then the first A.D. would say 'Cut,' and they would go silent. And I remembered, I am not Bruce Springsteen, I am just an actor!\"",
      "A guy from Brooklyn playing a guy from Jersey \u2013 they both seem to understand one another, and neither would change a thing.",
      "White said, \"The ride is fun, but I'm, you know, I'm filled up. I just want to work with people I admire and be able to keep doing what I love to do. That's what's important to me.\"",
      "I asked, \"So, if all the fame and success ended after this film, you'd feel like ...?\"",
      "\"Can I still work?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "\"Then, yeah, I'm okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Oct 2025 10:00:14 -0400",
    "summary": "The latest white-knuckle thriller by director Kathryn Bigelow imagines the responses within the government and the military when a single ICBM is launched toward the United States.",
    "story": [
      "It's a nightmare we've been living with all our lives. \"I grew up in an era when we had to hide under our desks in the case of an atomic bomb,\" said director Kathryn Bigelow, \"so I suppose I was sort of imprinted early on with the prospect of nuclear war.\"",
      "In Bigelow's new film, \"A House of Dynamite,\" the prospect of nuclear war suddenly becomes an insane reality. It tells of a single missile launched from an unknown location in the Pacific. At first it looks like a test, but it keeps on coming \u2013 with a trajectory estimated to be the continental United States.",
      "With 19 minutes to impact, the president (played by Idris Elba) has to make an impossible decision.",
      "Noah Oppenheim, a former president of NBC News, wrote the script, which dramatizes what he calls \"the insanity that we would expect a single human being with limited preparation to decide in a matter of minutes the fate of all mankind.\"",
      "Bigelow, whose previous movies include \"The Hurt Locker\" (an all-too-real look at the war in Iraq) and \"Zero Dark Thirty\" (about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden) applied her trademark authenticity to the unthinkable. \"It's my responsibility as a filmmaker, if I'm presenting an environment that really exists, to be as authentic as possible,\" she said.",
      "Bigelow says she did not seek cooperation from the Pentagon for the film: \"I felt that we needed to be more independent. But that being said, we had multiple tech advisors who have worked in the Pentagon. They were with me every day we shot.\"",
      "One military consultant was retired Lt. Gen. Dan Karbler. \"Never in a million years would I have thought that I would have been in this position,\" he said.",
      "Karbler nailed his audition when he opened his first Zoom call with Bigelow like this: \"'This is the DDO from the Pentagon convening a strategic conference. This conference is Top Secret. Please bring the President into the conference.' And I stopped there and clicked on my camera and I said, 'Ladies and gentlemen, that's how the worst day of America's history will begin.'\"",
      "I noted, \"That doesn't sound like something you were ad-libbing?\"",
      "\"I was not ad-libbing at all,\" said Karbler. \"That comes from a lot of practice.\"",
      "He was on a movie set, but Karbler took command of the actors just as he once did with the real soldiers at Fort Greeley, Alaska, the front line of defense against an incoming missile. He described those scenes as \"super-realistic.\"",
      "He said. \"I have a son and daughter, and they're both missile defenders. And all I can think about is my own kids and how those actors totally nailed it.\"",
      "In \"A House of Dynamite,\" the missile is tracked as it arcs toward the United States. [In such a scenario, the U.S. would have less than 10 minutes to make the decisions and get interceptors airborne.]",
      "Two interceptors are launched \u2013 the classic \"bullet hitting a bullet.\"",
      "\"That kill vehicle will go and basically run itself into the incoming missile,\" said Karbler. \"That closing velocity can be in excess of 30,000 miles an hour. I think the movie has it pretty accurate when they talk about 61% chance of killing it.\"",
      "The watch officer in the White House Situation Room is played by Rebecca Ferguson. Larry Pfeiffer, who once ran the real White House Situation Room, said, \"This movie is going to give the American moviegoer a chance to feel what it's really like to work in a space like that.",
      "\"There are going to be things that happen in the world that require the immediate attention and action by the President of the United States, and you need to be as perfect as possible,\" he said.",
      "The president is in a motorcade when he's hit with the one crisis he thought he would never face: a missile inbound for Chicago. \"I had one briefing when I was sworn in,\" he says. \"One! And they told me that's the protocol!\"",
      "According to Dan Karbler, a real-world president is likely to be just as unprepared.",
      "Asked whether he had ever done a drill when the real president was involved, he replied, \"No, no, sir.\"",
      "\"So, if it were the real thing, he wouldn't have a lot of practice?\" I asked.",
      "\"I believe the last president to have participated in one of the exercises was President Reagan,\" Karbler said.",
      "So, what does screenwriter Noah Oppenheim want audiences to be thinking, once they've caught their breath? \"I want people to be reminded that, even though the Cold War is long over, the nuclear era is not, and that we live, as the title says, in a house full of dynamite,\" he said.",
      "To which director Kathryn Bigelow added, \"My question is how do we take the dynamite out of the walls \u2026 without tearing down the house?\"",

When it opened in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, in 1985, it operated as a traditional video store with an extensive and rare collection of films. In 2023, Vidiots moved to Eagle Rock and expanded into an exhibition space, reviving the historic Eagle Theater.",
      "\"We opened to uncertainty,\" said executive director Maggie MacKay. \"We had no idea if people would come, and they did. And they've been coming ever since.\"",
      "MacKay said Vidiots has become a touchstone for local kids.",
      "\"One of the biggest surprises and the happiest surprises for us and the thing that I think I most wanted to happen here is that young people come here,\" she said. \"Teens, tweens are getting dropped off by their parents. And because this place is affordable and welcoming and nonjudgmental and safe, they are coming here all the time. We've got kids growing up here who call the video store their video store. We have a kid who calls it 'my video store.' That kid has no idea that that is a very unique thing to say in the 2020s.\"",
      "Like Smodcastle, Vidiots operates as a non-profit. That isn't the only path to success for these kinds of theaters, though, as New York City's Metrograph proves. The two-screen theater in Manhattan's Lower East Side shows international and arthouse fare and operates as a for-profit. Business is booming, CEO Christian Grass said, with the theater recently enjoying its best summer on record.",
      "\"People love going to the movies and people love the experience,\" Grass said. The theater also has a bookstore, a magazine, a streaming service, an extravagant concession stand and a swanky bar and restaurant. The establishment has focused on building a sense of community, said Metrograph director of programming Inge de Leeuw, which ensures people keep coming back. MacKay said she's also found people are looking for connection, community and a place they can go.",
      "\"Everybody wants movies in their lives, whether they know it or realize it or not,\" MacKay said. \"To save this thing, you have to make available every point of access for it. You have to make a return to a social experience.\"",
      "While independent theaters are taking different paths to success, they have one thing in common: They want to keep introducing new and classic films to audiences.",
      "\"You want to learn something about somebody, sit in the darkness and watch movies with them,\" Smith said. \"You will learn a lot about a person. You'll find out if they're empathetic. You'll find out what makes them laugh. You'll find out if there's a real human being there, if there's a heart underneath that all, man.\""

    "summary": "Despite delays at some airports caused by staff shortages, government officials and aviation experts say flying is safe.",
    "story": [
      "The shortage of air traffic controllers at some airports during the U.S. government shutdown may have travelers wondering if they have anything to worry about as they board their flight.",
      "Flight delays\u00a0in some parts of the U.S. have ticked up since federal funding lapsed on Oct. 1, even as controllers, Transportation Security Administration officers and other air safety personnel are required to work without pay. Previous shutdowns have resulted in a spike in TSA officers and air traffic controllers calling out sick from work, contributing to delays and flight cancellations.",
      "Despite such inconveniences, aviation experts are confident that air travel remains safe. \"There is no slacking. FAA safety standards don't go on hiatus just because the government is shut down,\" Henry Harteveldt, founder and president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel advisory firm, told CBS News.",
      "Flight delays due FAA staffing issues are rising because the agency is taking steps to ensure air travel remains as safe as before the shutdown, said Katy Nastro, an air travel expert at trip booking site Going.com.",
      "\"People should feel comfort that traffic is slowing, and ground delays are being put into place as an extra layer of safety, as a precautionary measure,\" she said. \"It shouldn't raise a red flag in any way.\"",
      "The bigger question for travelers, Nastro added, is \"What is your tolerance in terms of facing delays and such?\"",
      "Despite several aircraft collisions and some close calls this year, research shows that airline travel has become safer in recent years. The risk of a fatality from commercial air travel was 1 in every 13.7 million passenger boardings globally from 2018 to 2022, according to a 2024 MIT\u00a0study. That compares with 1 fatality for every in 7.9 million worldwide boardings from 2008 to 2017.",
      "\"We slow it down\"",
      "On Monday, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy addressed potential safety concerns during the shutdown on Fox Business News. \"We want to make sure that when you travel you travel safely, and so if we don't have controllers necessary to keep you safe, we slow it down,\" he told the network.",
      "He also alluded to the air traffic control staffing issues and highlighted the wider impact of just a few people not showing up for work. \"If you have a few controllers that call in sick, it will ricochet through the airspace, and we have delays because we are not overstaffed,\" he said, adding that controllers are \"incredibly frustrated\" by the shutdown.",
      "Sheldon Jacobson, an aviation security expert and professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said flight delays stemming from controller shortages are inconvenient, but do not point to a safety risk for travelers.",
      "\"I don't think safety is being compromised, but service is definitely being compromised,\" Jacobson told CBS News.",
      "Still, Laura Einsetler, a captain for a U.S. airline, worries that a prolonged government shutdown could eventually affect the performance of air traffic controllers as they work without pay.",
      "\"How long can they go until they are distracted with stress about how they're going to pay for rent, their mortgage or put food on table for their families?\" she told CBS News. \"The more they don't get paid, the more distractions there are, and that raises the safety threat from a performance point of view.\"",
      "Trusting pilots",
      "Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, said some anxiety around hopping on a plane during the government shutdown is understandable. \"A lot of us have an innate fear of being 30,000 feet above the ground, so any justification we can find for why flying might be more risky now is understandable,\" he said.",
      "But he emphasized that pilots have final say on whether it is unsafe to fly for whatever reason, including poor weather, mechanical problems or staffing shortages.",
      "\"They are entrusted to give that last line of authority and say things are safe to fly, and they are in constant communication with air traffic control, monitoring weather systems, and what the entire flying environment looks like,\" Keyes said.",
      "\"The risk of delays and cancellations is higher today than it was before, but I don't think that translates into a higher risk of safety accidents,\" he added.",
      "Harteveldt agreed that airline pilots \u2014 who aren't federal employees \u2014 wouldn't take off given any safety concerns.",
      "\"When a plane departs the gate, it's the airline pilot inspecting the plane and saying, 'Yes, this plane is clear to go.' FAA inspectors, or the shutdown, have nothing to do with that,\" he said.",
      "Airlines for America, a lobbying group representing major airlines, last week sought to reassure the public that flying during the shutdown is safe, while acknowledging that control tower staffing shortages could lead to delays.",
      "\"It is safe to fly, but ATC staffing shortages strain the system and cause flights to be spaced out, slowing down everything. In some cases, flights may be delayed or even cancelled,\" the group said in a statement. \"The bottom line is that anyone heading to the airport right now is encouraged to pack their patience.\""

      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",

    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email."

The advocacy group also\u00a0found\u00a0that roughly a third of service member households have less than $3,000 in savings, leaving them vulnerable to financial emergencies.",
      "As a result, missing a paycheck can have \"a devastating impact,\" said Kathy Roth-Douquet, CEO of Blue Star Families.",
      "\"There is a financial impact first and foremost, but there is a big psychological impact, too, that is in some ways equally damaging,\" she added.",
      "Roth-Douquet noted that many military families depend on a single income because frequent relocations make it difficult for spouses to find steady work. \"That means families depend on one paycheck, and if they don't get it, it can tip them into disaster,\" she said.",

      "\"My check alone would barely cover the rent,\" she said.",
      "She added that the uncertainty caused by the government shutdown has been \"extremely stressful\" for her family.",
      "\"The holidays are coming up \u2014 a lot of times we like to travel to see family. I don't know if that would be an option if this continues, if we can justify those types of expenses of seeing family and holiday expenses in general,\" she said."

      "Instagram-parent Meta announced Tuesday that teen users will now see content on Instagram that's similar to what they might see while watching a film with a PG-13 rating.",
      "That's because new content settings for Instagram users under 18 will adhere to the same regulations. The new automatic protections are being rolled by the company starting Tuesday and will be fully implemented by the end of the year, according to Meta.",
      "\"We hope this update reassures parents that we're working to show teens safe, age-appropriate content on Instagram by default, while also giving them more ways to shape their teen's experience,\" the company said in the announcement.",
      "PG-13, a rating used in the media industry, indicates that parental guidance is suggested when watching content, particularly for children under 13.",
      "What are the new restrictions?",
      "The accounts of Instagram users under 18 will now be automatically be placed under a 13+ setting. Opting out of the setting will require parental permission.",
      "Teens with the setting will be blocked from seeing search results for terms like \"alcohol\" or \"gore.\" This adds to list of search topics from which Meta said it already shields teens, such as suicide, self-harm and eating disorders.",
      "Teens will also be prevented from following accounts that regularly posts content deemed age-inappropriate. Instagram users under 18 who already follow such accounts, will no longer be able to see or interact with their content, send them DMs, or see their comments under anyone's posts.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's new tariffs on imported furniture, kitchen cabinets and other housewares, along with lumber, took effect Tuesday, added costs that economists say could push up prices for consumers.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the trade measures on Sept. 29, saying the levies are intended to prevent such products manufactured abroad from \"flooding\" the U.S.",
      "\"It is a very unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0wrote\u00a0on social media at the time.",
      "The levies on imported wood products and furniture range from 10% to 50%.",
      "Although Trump administration officials maintain that tariffs are largely paid by overseas exporters, most economists say Americans bear the brunt of the additional costs.",
      "If recently imposed and future tariffs have the same impact on domestic prices as the U.S. levies applied earlier this year, then consumers would eventually absorb about 55% of the added costs, Goldman Sachs estimated in an analysis this week. U.S. businesses would swallow 22% of the extra costs, while foreign exporters would absorb 18% of the expenses, economists with the investment bank said.",
      "President Trump has said higher import duties will restore fairness in global trade, energize American manufacturing and raise federal revenue. White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS News on Tuesday that stiffer U.S. tariffs are already benefiting the economy by spurring companies to expand in the U.S.",
      "\"The president and administration's position has always been clear: While Americans may face a transition period from tariffs upending a broken status quo that has put America last, the cost of tariffs will ultimately be borne by foreign exporters,\" Desai said in a statement. \"Companies are already shifting and diversifying their supply chains in response to tariffs, including by onshoring production to the United States.\"",
      "The Trump administration's tariffs have so far proved less disruptive than expected, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday, though the full impact of those policies may not be felt for some time. While the U.S. and world economies have fared better than expected, it's too soon to say they are fully in the clear, the organization said.",
      "Economists have warned that the furniture, wood and related houseware levies would likely hike costs for consumers building or remodeling a home. Recent inflation data showed that prices for living room, kitchen and dining room furniture \u2014 much of which is imported \u2014 rose 9.5% from August 2024 to August 2025, driven by country-based U.S. tariffs, according to economists.",

    "summary": "Jerome Powell said the labor market's outlook hasn't changed much since the central bank's September meeting, when it penciled in two more rate cuts this year.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday emphasized that a sharp slowdown in hiring poses a growing risk to the U.S. economy, a sign that the central bank will likely cut its key interest rate twice more this year.",
      "Powell, who spoke today before the National Association of Business Economics in Philadelphia, said that despite the federal government shutdown cutting off official economic data, \"the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting,\" when the Fed reduced its key rate for the first time this year.",
      "Fed officials at the September meeting also forecast that the central bank would reduce its rate twice more this year and once in 2026. Lower rates from the Fed could\u00a0reduce borrowing costs for consumer and business loans, making it cheaper for businesses to expand operations and hire new workers, and for Americans to buy houses, autos and other items.",
      "\"Holding rates higher presents risks to the job market. Job creation is below trend given the pace of economic growth,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at investment firm Global X, in an emailed response to Powell's comments. \"The Fed is still likely to cut rates in October and December, but investors should be prepared for a range of outcomes as Powell is trying to leave all options open.\"",
      "The Fed's next rate decision will be made at its Oct. 29 meeting. Following that, the central bank has one more rate decision meeting scheduled in 2025, set for Dec. 10.",
      "Powell reiterated a message he first delivered after the September meeting, when he signaled that the Fed is slightly more worried about the job market than its other congressional mandate, which is to keep prices stable. Tariffs have lifted the Fed's preferred measure of inflation to 2.9%, he said, but outside the duties there aren't \"broader inflationary pressures\" that will keep prices high.",
      "\"Rising downside risks to employment have shifted our assessment of the balance of risks,\" he said.",
      "Powell also said that the central bank may soon stop shrinking its roughly $6.6 trillion balance sheet. The Fed has been allowing roughly $40 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to mature each month without replacing them. The shift could weigh on longer-term Treasury interest rates.",
      "Separately, Powell spent most of his speech defending the Fed's practice of buying longer-term Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in 2020 and 2021, which were intended to lower longer-term interest rates and support the economy during the pandemic.",
      "Yet those purchases have come under a torrent of criticism from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, as well as some of the\u00a0candidates\u00a0floated by the Trump administration to replace Powell when his term as Chair ends next May.",
      "Bessent said in an extended critique\u00a0published earlier this year\u00a0that the huge purchases of bonds during the pandemic worsened inequality by boosting the stock market, without providing noticeable benefits to the economy.",
      "Other critics have long argued that the Fed kept implementing the purchases for too long, keeping interest rates low even as inflation began to spike in late 2021. The Fed beginning in 2021 stopped the purchases and then sharply boosted borrowing costs to combat inflation.",
      "\"With the clarity of hindsight, we could have\u2014and perhaps should have\u2014stopped asset purchases sooner,\" Powell said. \"Our real-time decisions were intended to serve as insurance against downside risk.\"",
      "Powell also said the purchases were intended to avoid a breakdown in the market for Treasury securities, which could have sent interest rates much higher."

      "\"The Bureau of Labor Statistics has announced they will issue the September 2025 Consumer Price Index on October 24,\" the Social Security Administration said in an Oct. 14 email. \"The Social Security Administration will use this release to generate and announce the 2026 cost-of-living adjustment on October 24 as well.\"",
      "The new COLA will take effect starting Jan. 1, 2026, without any delays due to the ongoing shutdown, the agency added.",
      "How much of a living adjustment?",

      "The September CPI is forecast to rise to an annual rate of 3.1% up from 2.9% in August, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "According to economists, inflation is edging higher due partly to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, which have hit imports from across the globe, such as clothing, food, steel and toys. While some businesses stockpiled imported goods earlier this year to avoid raising rising prices, some are now passing the import taxes\u00a0on to their customers.",

      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",

As the days shorten and temperatures drop, chlorophyll in leaves breaks down, and they turn to the autumn tones of yellow, orange and red.",

      "That's more than twice the average, said Brad Rippey, a U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist and an author of the drought monitor, which is a partnership between the federal government and University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Drought has hit the Northeast and western U.S. especially hard, he said.",

      "\"This year is actually going to be better than last year,\" Beckwith said. \"Last year was an election and that put a lot of trepidation in people. Now, they are traveling. The uncertainty of the election is over. We all know whose president now and we are traveling.\"",
      "Chris Proulx, executive director of the Mount Washington (New Hampshire) Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the decline in Canadian tourists by as much as 80% seen this summer has continued into the fall. But the region is faring better, he said, thanks to an uptick in travelers from other countries and its reputation for having one of the country's best leaf peeping seasons.",
      "\"This is the one season where people make plans in advance to come in addition to travelers from all of the country and all over the world,\" Proulx said.",
      "Leaf peeping was so popular in Colorado's Rocky Mountains this year that one town temporarily closed its highway offramp to alleviate gridlock. The area put on a display of yellow aspen trees dotting the mountains between evergreens, their delicate leaves vibrating in the wind.",
      "But there were signs of a dry spring in the central part of the state, one that is more severe the farther west you travel, said Colorado State Forest Service entomologist Dan West, who spends many fall days in a plane looking at how insect infestations are affecting tree health.",
      "Crispy edges, muted colors, and dropping leaves before they can take on a red or purple hue are all signs of drought stress, West said.",
      "\"The tree is shutting down processes early and we basically just see this muted kind of a show for the fall,\" he said.",
      "In Denver, arborist Michael Sundberg also said he's seeing less vibrant color than usual, and autumn feels like it arrived earlier than usual this year. It's still a beautiful time of year, but there might be less of it to enjoy, he said.",
      "\"It's weird to have color peaking this early in the mountains and then for Denver to be peaking at the same time,\" he said. \"Usually we're later in October before we really go off.\""

      "Lebda founded LendingTree in 1996 in a move to simplify the process of shopping and applying for loans. Part of his vision was to create a platform that allowed customers to avoid applying for a bank loan in person and that would generate more competition among lenders for people's business, according to Lebda's company biography.",

      "\"The news of losing Doug was devastating,\" Peyree said in a statement. \"But one of the most immediate impacts of his legacy is the strong management team he put in place at LendingTree. I look forward to leading our team and continuing our shared vision with Doug into the future.\"",
      "Lebda, who previously worked as an auditor and consultant for PriceWaterhouseCoopers, in 2010 also co-founded a financial services platform for children and families called Tykoon.",

      "Unlike in past years, retailers have been cautious in announcing their seasonal hiring goals. Department store Kohl's recently said it would add temporary positions, but did not indicate how many. Target also said it would add staff for the holidays without specifying how many additional people it planned to hire.",

      "In a typical year, about 20 million Americans \u2014 about 13% of all taxpayers \u2014 ask the IRS for a tax filing extension, according to agency data. Extensions, which are provided automatically if a taxpayer requests more time, provide an additional six months to prepare and file federal returns.",
      "An extension can help taxpayers who are facing complex tax situations or who need extra time to get their documents prepared for filing. Even so, an extension doesn't get exempt you from paying taxes you owe to the IRS, as the tax agency expects taxpayers to make good on their debts by the regular April 15 deadline.",

      "When is the tax extension deadline?",
      "The deadline to file your taxes if you've received an extension is 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 15, in your local time zone, which means taxpayers should submit their electronic filing before that time on Wednesday.",

    "summary": "The U.S. economy picked up speed in the second half of the year, although job growth and inflation remain a concern, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy could be on the upswing even if tariffs and stubborn inflation continue to weigh on growth, according to a new analysis.",
      "The National Association for Business Economics (NABE) said Monday it expects the nation's gross domestic product \u2014 a measure of the total value of goods and services \u2014 to rise 1.8% in 2025, up from the group's previous estimate in June of 1.3%.",
      "The survey, which was conducted from Sept. 17-25, consulted 40 economists on their forecasts for labor growth, inflation and other key metrics for the remainder of the year and into 2026. NABE also expects the economy to expand at a faster pace in 2026, at 1.7%, higher than its June forecast of 1.4%.",
      "The report is the latest signal that economic growth continues to hold up despite rising inflation and a recent slowdown in the labor market. After\u00a0economic activity shrank in the first three months of 2025, growth has accelerated over the rest of the year, EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco, vice president of NABE, told CBS News. The outlook for business investment in particular has improved, he noted.",
      "The economy could get a further boost this year from the Federal Reserve. NABE expects Fed officials, who trimmed their benchmark rate in September for the first time since 2024, to lower borrowing costs by another quarter of a percentage point by year-end and by a total of three-quarters of percentage point in 2026.",
      "Pain points remain",
      "While the economy has performed better than many experts predicted earlier this year, there are still signs of weakness. Government data indicates that job growth has deteriorated since the first half of the year.",
      "As hiring cools, meanwhile, the percentage of long-term job seekers \u2014 people unemployed for 27 weeks or longer \u2014 has risen to 26% of the total unemployed population, the highest in more than three years, labor data shows.",
      "Layoffs are also climbing. Through September, employers this year have cut nearly 950,000 jobs, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Looking ahead, NABE expects the job market to remain fragile. Economists predict average monthly payroll gains of 60,000 for the rest the year, down from the 87,000 the group forecasted in June. From January to August, employers added an average of around 75,000 jobs per month, according to government data.",
      "NABE projects that the nation's unemployment rate,\u00a04.3 % as of August, will rise to 4.5% in 2026.",
      "Another lingering pain point for the economy is inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2% annual target. NABE expects inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditure index \u2014 the Fed's preferred measure of inflation \u2014 to rise at an annualized rate of 3% over the rest of 2025.",
      "Nearly all of those surveyed \u2014 95% \u2014 expect U.S. tariffs to drive up consumer prices over the rest of the year, according to NABE, although the group now expects stepped-up duties on imports to have less of an inflationary impact than it previously predicted. As a result, inflation is projected to cool to 2.5% by the end of 2026, according to the panel of economists.",
      "A recession is unlikely, according to NABE. Most of the economists polled by the group put the odds of a slump in the next 12 months at between 20% and less than 40%."

    "published": "Sun, 12 Oct 2025 20:29:00 -0400",
    "summary": "DealBook founder and Squawk Box co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin takes a look at the crash of 1929 in his new book. He tells 60 Minutes what may it may indicate about today's stock market.",
    "story": [
      "After nearly a decade spent studying the most famous stock market crash in history, financial journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin warns that the Wall Street of today echoes the market of 1929, when highs preceded a massive slump, leading to the Great Depression.",
      "Artificial intelligence and technology have contributed to a remarkable boom in recent years. But, Sorkin said, today's economy is being propped up by the AI boom, and it's too soon to tell if this is a sugar rush, a short-term and unsustainable boost to the markets. But, Sorkin is positive there's a crash coming.",
      "\"I just can't tell you when, and I can't tell you how deep,\" he said. \"But I can assure you, unfortunately, I wish I wasn't saying this, we will have a crash.\"",
      "The Roaring '20s",
      "Despite a tumble this Friday, stocks on Wall Street have shot up in recent months. Still, some investors are getting weak in the knees, fearing stocks are overheated. Sorkin, author of \"1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History \u2013 and How It Shattered a Nation,\" out Oct. 14, says the U.S. is in a new roaring 20s, the 2020s, with stocks pushing to record highs, just as they were in the 1920s.",
      "Market highs today have him feeling anxious.",
      "\"I'm anxious that we are at prices that may not feel sustainable. And what I don't know is we are either living through some kind of remarkable boom and part of that's artificial intelligence and technology, and all of that, or everything's overpriced,\" he said.",
      "The market of 1929 was fueled by rampant speculation, including by ordinary investors unaware of the mounting risks, and of heavy borrowing. People of modest means were lured by Wall Street bankers and other stock market touts to invest using what was then a newfangled concept: credit. It was called buying on a margin. You only had to put down 10% of the stock price, borrowing the rest from your banker.",
      "Before 1919, most people did not take on credit or debt, influenced by religious views and moral norms against borrowing money, Sorkin said. That changed when General Motors, in 1919, started lending people money so they could afford to buy the company's cars. It changed out Americans shopped.",
      "\"And then the bankers realize what's happening, and they realize that they can lend out money so that more folks can buy stocks. It was all sort of wrapped in the flag of democratizing access,\" Sorkin said. \"And in good times, when the stock is going up, it's like free money. In bad times, you're on the hook, and you're on the hook in a very bad way.\"",
      "Today, it's hundreds of billions being invested in AI, with some investment pros warning of a possible bubble as stocks soar to stratospheric heights even amid significant economic uncertainty, such as Friday's slide after President Trump\u00a0 threatened more China tariffs.",
      "\"I think it's hard to say we're not in a bubble of some sort,\" Sorkin said. \"The question is always when is the bubble going to pop?\"",
      "Protecting consumers in the market",
      "When things got out of control in 1929, frightened traders dumped stocks as investors lost their businesses and homes. In the years since, laws, regulations and agencies have been put in place to protect investors.",
      "Some of those barriers to prevent exploitation are now coming down, Sorkin said. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules have become less stringent and \"the Consumer Protection Bureau practically doesn't exist anymore.\"",
      "\"That's what concerns me,\" Sorkin said. \"It's not that we're going off a cliff tomorrow. It's that there's speculation in the market today, there's an increasing amount of debt in the market today, and all of that's happening against the backdrop of the guardrails coming off.\"",
      "Those guardrails include ones that allow only the wealthy to invest directly in private companies that have fewer regulations, like AI startups before they go public.",
      "In recent decades, people who could invest in private equity and venture capital outperformed investors who did not. Those kinds of assets, generally restricted to wealthy investors, are potentially more rewarding, but also riskier.",
      "\"Public companies, after the SEC was created, were required to have all sorts of disclosure rules so that the public could understand what's going on inside them. Private companies don't have that,\" Sorkin said. \"But historically, the average ordinary American wasn't really allowed to invest in the private companies. But in this flag of democratizing finance, there's a lot of people who want access to that.\"",
      "Some people feel elite investors have better access, while others are unable to get in early on opportunities, Sorkin said. There's been a push by both the Trump administration and the financial sector to open up the market to more people.",
      "But that would also require moving the guardrails designed to protect people.",
      "\"They have protected a lot of people, but some people would say they protected people from getting rich,\" Sorkin said.",
      "Push today for democratizing investing",
      "In his latest annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggested opening retirement 401(k)s to riskier private investments in the name of democratizing investing. He said there were opportunities for investing in AI or data centers.",
      "Right now money managers are precluded from investing in those types of assets in many retirement products, but the Trump administration is in the process of changing that, Fink explained.",
      "The new investment opportunity comes with risk.",
      "\"But everything is risky other than keeping your money in a bank account overnight,\" Fink said.",
      "Fink, who once called bitcoin the domain of money launderers and thieves, also wants to add crypto to investment portfolios.",
      "\"The markets teach you, you have to always relook at your assumptions,\" he said. \"There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold \u2014 that is, it's an alternative.\"",
      "He sees it, as he does AI, as an opportunity to add diversity to a portfolio.",
      "But Sorkin says some crypto products, like meme coins, can be abused in ways similar to 1929, with speculators sending the value of cryptocurrencies soaring before they come crashing down. Sorkin has his own personal example involving a television appearance with Fink.",
      "\"He makes a joke, I think, about how there should be a Sorkin coin. Well, two hours later, somebody makes a Sorkin coin. And all of a sudden, this Sorkin coin is now worth millions of dollars. And I'm watching it,\" Sorkin said.",
      "The Sorkin coin peaked at $170 million worth of trading in a day.",
      "\"And I think today it does something like $20 or $21 a day,\" Sorkin said."

      "President Trump said Friday he will impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China starting next month, citing new Chinese export controls \u2014 marking a significant escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "The new 100% tariffs will add on to any existing import taxes on Chinese goods, the president wrote in a Truth Social post. Tariffs on Chinese imports currently stand at 30%. Mr. Trump said the U.S. will also impose export controls on \"any and all critical software\" starting next month.",
      "The tariffs could be imposed on Nov. 1 or sooner, \"depending on any further actions or changes taken by China,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "On Sunday, China signaled that it would not back down in the face of the tariff threat and urged the U.S. to resolve differences through negotiations instead of threats.",
      "\"China's stance is consistent,\" the Commerce Ministry said in a statement posted online Sunday. \"We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one.\"",
      "It was China's first official comment on Mr. Trump's threat to jack up the tax on imports from China by Nov. 1 in response to new Chinese restrictions on the export of rare earths, which are vital to a wide range of consumer and military products.",
      "The president's announcement came hours after he threatened steeper duties on China. He pointed to new Chinese rules that require companies to get special approval to export products containing even trace amounts of rare earths from China, even if they were manufactured outside of the country. China mines and processes most of the world's rare earth metals, which are\u00a0critical minerals used to manufacture products including semiconductors, electric car batteries, jet engines and defense weapons.",
      "\"It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History,\" the president wrote in his Friday message announcing the tariffs, calling China's export controls \"extraordinarily aggressive\" and a \"moral disgrace.\"",
      "Separately on Friday, China\u00a0imposed port fees on U.S.-owned ships that dock in the country, retaliating against what Beijing called a \"discriminatory\" U.S. port fee on Chinese ships.",
      "Major stock indexes fell sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump's initial tariff threat. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 3.6%.",
      "The new tariffs and export restrictions could inflame trade talks between China and the Trump administration. Mr. Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month, but the U.S. president said earlier Friday, \"there seems to be no reason\" for the meeting to take place.",
      "China is the United States' third-largest trading partner after Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. importing $438.9 billion worth of Chinese goods and China buying $143.5 billion in U.S. goods last year, according to federal statistics.",
      "But China and the U.S. have had a rocky relationship on trade in recent months. Over the spring, American tariffs on Chinese goods spiked to 145% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports soared to 125%, following a set of tit-for-tat hikes that began with import duties unveiled by the Trump administration. In May, the U.S. and China agreed to slash their tariffs to 30% and 10%, respectively, while the two sides pursued a broader trade deal.",
      "The U.S.-China economic relationship has other complexities, too. The Trump administration needs Beijing's permission to close a deal to transfer ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations away from China-based parent company ByteDance. China has also chafed at some of the administration's restrictions on international students."

      "French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday reappointed S\u00e9bastien Lecornu as prime minister, just days after his resignation, asking him to try again to form a government and produce a budget in a bid to end the country's political deadlock.",
      "Lecornu's reappointment followed days of intense negotiations and came less than a week after he resigned amid infighting in his freshly named government. France is struggling with mounting economic challenges and ballooning debt, and the political crisis is aggravating its troubles and raising alarm across the European Union.",
      "The appointment is widely seen as Macron's last chance to reinvigorate his second term, which runs until 2027. Lacking a majority in the National Assembly to push through his agenda, Macron faces mounting criticism \u2014 including from within his own ranks \u2014 and has little room to maneuver.",
      "Macron's office released a one-sentence statement late Friday night announcing the appointment, one month after the statement issued a month ago when Lecornu was initially named and four days after he resigned.",
      "Lecornu said in a statement on social networks that he accepted the new job offer out of \"duty.\" He said he was given a mission \"to do everything to give France a budget by the end of the year and respond to the daily problems of our compatriots.\"",
      "All those who join his new government will have to renounce ambitions to run for president in 2027, Lecornu said, adding that the new Cabinet will \"incarnate renewal and a diversity of skills.\"",
      "\"We must put an end to this political crisis that exasperates the French, and to this bad instability for France's image and its interests,\" he wrote.",
      "Lecornu abruptly resigned on Monday, only hours after unveiling a new Cabinet that drew opposition from a key coalition partner. The shock resignation prompted calls for Macron to step down or dissolve parliament again, as he did in June 2024. But they remained unanswered, with the president instead announcing on Wednesday that he would name a successor to Lecornu within 48 hours.",
      "Political party leaders met for more than two hours on Friday with Macron, at his request. Some cautioned that another prime minister picked from the ranks of Macron's fragile centrist camp would risk being disavowed by Parliament's powerful lower house, prolonging the crisis.",
      "\"How can one expect that all this will end well?\" said Marine Tondelier, leader of The Ecologists party. \"The impression we get is that the more alone he is, the more rigid he becomes.\"",
      "Over the past year, Macron's successive minority governments have collapsed in quick succession, leaving the European Union's second-largest economy mired in political paralysis as France is faced with a debt crisis. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France's public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros ($3.9 trillion), or 114% of gross domestic product.",
      "France's poverty rate also reached 15.4% in 2023, its highest level since records began in 1996, according to the latest data available from the national statistics institute.",
      "The economic and political struggles are worrying financial markets, ratings agencies and the European Commission, which has been pushing France to comply with EU rules limiting debt.",
      "The two biggest opposition parties in the National Assembly \u2014 the far-right National Rally and the far-left France Unbowed party \u2014 weren't invited to the discussions on Friday. The National Rally wants Macron to hold fresh legislative elections, and France Unbowed wants him to resign.",
      "Lecornu argued earlier this week that Macron's centrist bloc, its allies and parts of the opposition could still clump together into a working government. \"There's a majority that can govern,\" he said. \"I feel that a path is still possible. It is difficult.\"",
      "Lecornu will now have to seek compromises to avoid an immediate vote of no confidence and may even be forced to abandon an extremely unpopular pension reform that was one of Macron's signature policies in his second presidential term. Rammed through parliament without a vote in 2023 despite mass protests, it gradually raises the retirement age from 62 to 64. Opposition parties want it to be scrapped.",
      "The political deadlock stems from Macron's shock decision in June 2024 to dissolve the National Assembly. The snap elections produced a hung parliament, with no bloc able to command a majority in the 577-seat chamber. The gridlock has unnerved investors, infuriated voters, and stalled efforts to curb France's spiraling deficit and public debt.",
      "Without stable support, Macron's governments have stumbled from one crisis to the next, collapsing as they sought backing for unpopular spending cuts. Lecornu's resignation, just 14 hours after announcing his Cabinet, underscored the fragility of the president's coalition amid deep political and personal rivalries."

    "summary": "Financial markets slumped Friday after President Trump threatened to raise tariffs on China over a dispute involving rare earths.",
    "story": [
      "Investors are shuddering on concerns of renewed trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "Stocks fell sharply on Friday, with the S&P 500 shedding 183 points, or 2.7%, to close at 6,553 in what was the index's worst day since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 879 points, or 1.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.6%.",
      "The selloff affected a wide range of stocks, from Big Tech companies like Nvidia and Apple to stocks of smaller companies looking to get past uncertainty about tariffs and trade.",
      "\"Investors still think the tit-for-tat between the U.S. and China these last few days is mostly posturing (the consensus view is that tariffs won't go up, and that Trump and Xi will still meet in South Korea), but trade-related risks have certainly risen after being dormant for the last several weeks,\" Wall Street analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "Stocks had been heading for a slight gain in the morning, until Mr. Trump said on his social media platform said he's considering \"a massive increase of tariffs\" on Chinese imports. He's upset at restrictions China has placed on exports of its rare earths, which are materials that are critical for the manufacturing of everything from consumer electronics to jet engines.",
      "\"We have been contacted by other Countries who are extremely angry at this great Trade hostility, which came out of nowhere,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one. I have always felt that they've been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!\"",
      "Mr. Trump also threatened to call off a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month.",
      "\"Threatening significantly increased tariffs on China is a hallmark of Trump's negotiating tactics, and all it took was a headline to entice investors to take some chips off the table,\" Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, said in an email.",
      "Primed for a slide?",
      "The market may have been primed for a slide. U.S. stocks were already facing criticism that their prices had shot too high following a nearly relentless 35% run for the S&P 500 from a low in April to record heights.",
      "Critics say the market looks overpriced after prices rose much faster than corporate profits. Worries are particularly high about companies in the artificial-intelligence industry, where pessimists are making comparisons to to the 2000 dot-com bubble that ultimately imploded. For stocks to look less expensive, either their prices need to fall, or profits need to rise.",
      "Other factors also weighed on investor sentiment Friday, including the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and fresh data showing that consumers are anxious about the economy.",
      "The University of Michigan's preliminary October sentiment index,\u00a0released\u00a0Friday, shows consumer sentiment fell 0.1% on a monthly basis, from 55.1 points in September to 55. While the drop was nominal, it represents the third consecutive month the confidence measure, which is closely watched by investors, has declined.",
      "\"Pocketbook issues like high prices and weakening job prospects remain at the forefront of consumers' minds,\" Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a statement.",
      "The job market has slowed so much that the Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate last month for the first time this year. Fed officials have penciled in more cuts through next year to give the economy more breathing room. But Chair Jerome Powell has also said they may have to change course if inflation stays high. That's because lower interest rates can push inflation even higher."

      "Mr. Trump's threat follows a move by China this week to implement tighter restrictions on the country's exports of rare earths, critical minerals used to manufacture products including semiconductors, electric car batteries, jet engines and defense weapons.",
      "China produces as much as 95% of the world's rare earth magnets, according to energy research company Wood Mackenzie. Access to such materials has been a key sticking point in trade talks between Washington and Beijing.",
      "The new export controls outlined by the country's Ministry of Commerce, which took effect on Thursday, require companies to get special approval to export products containing even trace amounts of rare earths sourced from China, including if those products were manufactured abroad by non-Chinese companies.",
      "An English translation of the new rules released Thursday does not specify potential penalties if exporters fail to comply with the controls.",

      "\"One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,\" Mr. Trump said in his post. \"There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.\"",

      "Financial markets, which pushed deeper into record territory earlier this week, have also edged down in recent days as some investors warn of a potential pubble in stocks propelled by the growth in artificial intelligence."

    "story": [
      "China has hit U.S.-owned vessels docking in the country with tit-for-tat port fees, in response to the American government's planned port fees on Chinese ships, expanding a string of retaliatory measures before trade talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "Vessels owned or operated by American companies or individuals, and ships built in the U.S. or flying the American flag, would be subjected to a 400 yuan ($56) per net ton fee per voyage if they dock in China, China's Ministry of Transport said on Friday.",
      "The fees would be applied on the same ship for a maximum of five voyages each year, and would rise every year until 2028, when it would hike to 1,120 yuan ($157) per net ton, the ministry said. They would take effect on Oct. 14, the same day when the United States is due to start imposing port fees on Chinese vessels.",
      "China's Ministry of Transport said on Friday in a statement that its special fees on American vessels are \"countermeasures\" in response to \"wrongful\" U.S. practices, referring to the planned U.S. port fees on Chinese vessels.",
      "The ministry also slammed the United States' port fees as \"discriminatory\" that would \"severely damage the legitimate interests of China's shipping industry\" and \"seriously undermine\" international economic and trade order.",
      "China has announced a string of trade measures and restrictions before an expected meeting between Trump and Xi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in South Korea that begins at the end of October. On Thursday, Beijing unveiled new curbs on exports of rare earths and related technologies, as well as new restrictions on the export of some lithium battery and related production equipment.",
      "The port fees announced by Beijing on Friday mirrors many aspects of the U.S. port fees on Chinese ships docking in American ports. Under Washington's plans, Chinese-owned or -operated ships will be charged $50 per net ton for each voyage to the U.S., which would then rise by $30 per net ton each year until 2028. Each vessel would be charged no more than five times per year.",
      "China's new port fee is \"not just a symbolic move,\" said Kun Cao, deputy chief executive at consulting firm Reddal. \"It explicitly targets any ship with meaningful U.S. links \u2014 ownership, operation, flag, or build \u2014 and scales steeply with ship size.\"",
      "The \"real bite is on U.S.-owned and operated vessels,\" he said, adding that North America accounts for roughly 5% of the world fleet by beneficial ownership, which is still a meaningful figure although not as huge as compared to Greek, Chinese and Japanese ship owners.",
      "However, the United States has only about 0.1% of global commercial shipbuilding market share in recent years and built fewer than 10 commercial ships last year, Reddal added.",
      "While shipping analysts have said that the U.S. port fees on Chinese vessels would likely have limited impact on trade and freight rates as some shipping companies have been redeploying their fleets to avoid the extra charge, shipping data provider Alphaliner warned last month in a report that the U.S. port fees could still cost up to $3.2 billion next year for the world's top 10 carriers.",

      "The \"national picture today looks a little messy,\" CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave said from Los Angeles International Airport on Friday.",
      "Across the U.S., roughly 52,000 flights are scheduled ahead of the\u00a0Columbus Day\u00a0weekend, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "Tasked with keeping travelers safe on the ground and in the air, TSA officers and air traffic controllers are\u00a0deemed essential\u00a0by the government, requiring them\u00a0to keep working\u00a0during the shutdown without immediate pay.",
      "However, an uptick in workers calling out sick has led to sporadic flight delays and cancellations, raising concerns over staffing shortages. The scheduling irregularities come as\u00a0potential weather disruptions\u00a0are expected across the East Coast and in Phoenix.",
      "\"On top of that you have uncertainty that's been injected into basically everyone's travels because of the staffing situation that we're seeing pop up sporadically throughout the air traffic control system,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "Typically, air traffic controller shortages drive about 5% of all flight delays. That figure is currently 53%, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told Fox Business.",
      "\"It doesn't look like its a coordinated or targeted sick out per se, but you're seeing more sick calls than you would normally see, and so, everyday, particularly as we get into the afternoon and evening hours, multiple FAA facilities have what are called staffing triggers, where they are short-staffed basically,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "\"And some of those don't result in a whole lot of disruption, and then we've seen others that have been pretty disruptive,\" he added.",
      "For example, at Nashville International Airport in Tennessee on Thursday, roughly 40,000 flyers were inconvenienced by an air traffic controller shortage. \"So it's not nothing, even if the vast majority off air traffic controllers are working,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "Air traffic controllers who violate agency sick leave policies will face repercussions, Secretary Duffy said this week.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union representing such workers, said in a statement on its\u00a0website\u00a0that it does not condone their members taking actions that would compromise the safety of the nation's airspace. The union also urged workers to keep showing up on the job, despite not being paid on schedule.",
      "\"At this critical juncture, it is more important than ever that we rise to the occasion and continue delivering the consistent, high-level of public service we provide every day,\" tNATCA stated.",
      "Still, the impact of staffing shortages on flights so far has been minimal, reported Van Cleave, but delays could worsen as staffing shortages continue.",
      "\"While delays and cancellations have been within historic norms this week, and the vast majority of fights are leaving on time, the amount of delays because of air traffic controllers staffing is up,\" he said."

    "summary": "The Supreme Court is considering whether Louisiana's intentional creation of a second majority-Black district violates the 14th and 15th Amendments.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday is considering for the second time a long-running legal fight over Louisiana's congressional map, a case that could have significant ramifications not just for political representation in the state, but also for its potential to weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.",
      "At issue in the case is whether state lawmakers' intentional drawing of a second majority-minority district \u2014 undertaken to remedy a likely violation of Section 2 \u2014 runs afoul of the 14th and 15th Amendments of the Constitution.",
      "The high court initially heard arguments in March\u00a0over whether to leave in place the House district lines re-drawn in 2024 to include a second majority-Black district. But the justices did not issue a decision in the case and instead scheduled it for re-argument in its new term, which began last week.",
      "The case originally focused on a more narrow set of issues about the map, but in August, the Supreme Court asked Louisiana officials and voters involved in the challenge to address whether race-based redistricting comports with the Constitution.",
      "That new question upped the stakes of the case, as Republicans in Louisiana urge the Supreme Court to forbid the consideration of race in the drawing of voting lines. A decision in the state's favor could upend Section 2 and deal another blow to the landmark voting rights law more than 10 years after the Supreme Court gutted one of its key provisions.",
      "The legal fight over Louisiana's congressional map dates back to 2022, when GOP lawmakers in the state drew new House district lines after the 2020 Census. That map consisted of five majority-White districts and one majority-Black district. Nearly one-third of Louisiana's population is Black, according to Census data.",
      "A group of African American voters challenged the map as a violation of Section 2 because it diluted Black voting strength, they argued. A judge in Baton Rouge agreed, finding the map deprived Black voters of the chance to elect their preferred candidate, and she ordered the state to put a remedial map in place with a second majority-minority congressional district.",
      "The new plan adopted by the Louisiana legislature in 2024 reconfigured the state's 6th Congressional District, which state lawmakers said was in an effort to bring it into compliance with the Voting Rights Act. The new District 6 has a Black voting-age population of roughly 51% and stretches across the state from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge, in the southeast. Congressman Cleo Fields, a Democrat who is Black, was elected to represent the district last November.",
      "State lawmakers said they had a political goal in mind, too, when recrafting the voting boundaries: to protect key Republican incumbents in the House, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow, who sits on the powerful Appropriations panel.",
      "But after the new map was adopted, a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-American\" voters challenged the boundaries, alleging the new District 6 was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. A divided panel of three judges in Shreveport sided with the voters and found that the state legislature relied too much on race when it crafted the new map.",
      "The case landed before the Supreme Court in its last term, and Louisiana Republicans joined with Black voters and voting rights groups in urging the justices to leave the new congressional map in place. But with the case set to be reargued, and the focus now on the constitutionality of race-based redistricting, state GOP lawmakers are no longer defending their district lines.",
      "Instead, state officials are arguing that the there should be \"zero tolerance for any consideration of race.\"",
      "\"[R]ace-based redistricting mandated by Section 2 is unconstitutional because it violates basic equal protection principles: It uses race as a stereotype, uses race as a negative, and has no logical end point,\" Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill, a Republican, and Solicitor General Benjamin Aguinaga wrote in a\u00a0filing. \"Accordingly, Section 2 is unconstitutional insofar as it requires race-based redistricting. \"",
      "The Trump administration is backing Louisiana and the \"non-African-American\" voters in the case and has urged the Supreme Court to tighten the standards for proving unlawful vote dilution under Section 2. The framework in place since 1986 requires plaintiffs to show racial polarization in voting, in addition to other preconditions.",
      "\"Too often, Section 2 is deployed as a form of electoral race-based affirmative action to undo a State's constitutional pursuit of political ends. That misuse of Section 2 is unconstitutional,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing.",
      "But lawyers for the voters who challenged the initial district lines, which were then redrawn to include a second majority-Black district, argue the new map largely prioritized Republicans' political goals of protecting key incumbents. Any consideration of race, they said, was limited and driven by a compelling interest in addressing a violation of the Voting Rights Act.",
      "\"[T]he notion that the sun has set on the need for race-conscious remedial redistricting for identified instances of racial vote dilution is contrary to both the fact of ongoing discrimination in Louisiana and the text and purpose of [Section 2] as it was amended in 1982 and has been consistently interpreted by this Court ever since,\" lawyers for the Black Louisianans wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that removing Section 2's protections for minority voters in Louisiana \"will not end discrimination there or lead to a race-blind society, but it may well lead to a severe decrease in minority representation at all levels of government in many parts of the country.\"",
      "Without the provision, \"jurisdictions could simply eliminate minority opportunity districts even where they remain necessary for voters of color to have any opportunity to elect candidates of choice, wiping out minority representation and re-segregating legislatures, city councils, and school boards \u2014 as some have recently attempted to do,\" lawyers wrote.",
      "The Supreme Court is re-hearing the case involving Louisiana's map just over two years after it upheld Section 2 and reaffirmed the framework for proving vote dilution set out in the 1986 ruling. The high court split 5-4 in that 2023 case, which involved a challenge to Alabama's congressional map, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joining the three liberal justices in the majority.",
      "While the high court rejected the chance to weaken Section 2, Kavanaugh suggested that there must be an end point for the use of race-based remedies. He wrote in a concurring opinion that \"the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.\"",
      "During Wednesday's arguments, Kavanaugh said the Court has said race-based remedies are permissible, sometimes for a long period of time, but they should not be indefinite and should have an end point, and he asked when that should be.",
      "NAACP Legal Defense Fund president Janai Nelson, who is arguing for the group of Black voters, said there's no precedent to suggest that a statute must dissolve on its own because race is part of the remedy. And she argued that the nondiscrimination element of the 15th Amendment is \"a permanent right, and so should be the protection that Section 2 affords.\"",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson suggested that Nelson was saying that Section 2 is itself not a remedy that should have an end point, but was instead more of a mechanism \u2014 a kind of \"check-in\" on \"where we might need to do work.\" She compared it to a \"tape measure\" that \"doesn't need a life cycle.\" Nelson agreed and noted that Section 2 cases have fallen in the last decade.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito asked Nelson about the differences between racial voting and partisan voting. If drawing districts to protect incumbents is reasonable, isn't seeking partisan advantage something that legislatures can seek?",
      "No, Nelson replied, not under the 14th and 15th Amendments. Redistricting on a partisan basis, she said can't come \"at the cost of the equal protection principle.\"",
      "He suggested that racially polarized voting could easily be identified through statistical analysis, that it could be seen whether White Democrats vote for Black Democrats at a lower rate, for instance.",
      "Nelson told him that White Democrats were not voting for Black candidates \u2014 whether they were Democrats or not. She said there was no question that even if there is some correlation, that race was the driving factor.",
      "Both Kavanaugh and Roberts will be key as the Supreme Court weighs the constitutionality of race-based map-making. The two justices also voted to outlaw the use of race as a factor in college admissions, a decision that came down in the same term as the Alabama voting rights dispute.",
      "Roberts, in particular, has long denounced racial classifications. In a 2006 concurring opinion, the chief justice wrote, \"it is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.\" He also authored the 2013 majority opinion that dismantled Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, writing, \"our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\"",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June or early July."

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S. government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after President Trump and congressional Republicans at odds with Democrats over the path forward were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Mr. Trump had said Sunday that a shutdown was likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

The rule was repealed in 1987.",

      "The issue was which agency's budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget, the White House should use to show that the budget was balanced within seven years. In the end, Republicans backed down: then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole indicated in a floor speech on New Year's Eve that \"we ought to end this.

The GOP-led House passed two spending bills, one of which would've delayed implementation of Obamacare, which were both rejected by the Democratic-led Senate.",
      "Obama called for a spending bill with no conditions attached, but Republicans ultimately opted to shut down the government over their opposition to the landmark health care law.",

      "As the shutdown stretched to become the longest in history and Democrats took control of the House, the former president ended up signing a bill to reopen agencies for three weeks and did not include money for the border wall. Weeks later, Congress averted another shutdown by passing a measure that included $1.375 billion for the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump requested."

      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",

      "The guidance estimates about 406,000 of the department's 741,000 civilian employees will be required to work in the event of a shutdown because their mission is critical and not easily carried out by any U.S. service member.",
      "While a memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget said some civilians could be laid off during the shutdown, the guidance released by the Defense Department outlines furloughs but no cuts to the civilian workforce.",
      "During the shutdown, medical care and dental care will be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness. Private health care using the Defense Department's TRICARE medical insurance would continue uninterrupted."

    "published": "Wed, 15 Oct 2025 09:01:23 -0400",
    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change."

    "published": "Wed, 15 Oct 2025 09:00:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Much of the federal government shut down after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich."

    "summary": "New York City Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa told CBS News President Trump should stay out of the race \u2014 arguing that he's strengthening Zohran Mamdani.",
    "story": [
      "Republican New York City mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa argues the outcome of the city's election could have implications beyond the five boroughs.",
      "In an interview Tuesday with CBS News, Sliwa drew a sharp contrast between himself and his two main opponents, Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.",
      "\"New York City is the epicenter of capitalism in the world,\" said Sliwa.",
      "And, he argues, if voters elect Mamdani, \"it will encourage other young democratic socialists of America\" to \"take over their city government legally by winning in the ballot box.\"",
      "Throughout the campaign, Sliwa has routinely criticized Mamdani's proposed policies and association with the Democratic Socialists of America.",
      "Sliwa also had harsh words for Cuomo on Tuesday, blaming \"horrific increases in crime\" in the city on Cuomo's policies as governor, including state laws that ended cash bail for some criminal charges and raised the age of criminal responsibility.",
      "Said Sliwa: \"I'm the only one standing between Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo, who I call Zohran lite.\"",
      "A Republican candidate hasn't won a mayoral election in deep-blue New York City in 20 years. But in this year's race, the GOP nominee could play an outsized role. Mamdani defeated Cuomo in the Democratic primary, but Cuomo stayed in the race on a third-party ticket. Since then, Cuomo and his allies have called on Sliwa to drop out, arguing that the two candidates are splitting the anti-Mamdani vote \u2014 a charge Sliwa has pushed back on.",
      "In an Oct. 9 poll from Quinnipiac University, Mamdani led with 46% support, followed by Cuomo with 33% and Sliwa with 15%. The poll was taken after incumbent New York City Mayor Eric Adams dropped out of the race.",
      "The race has drawn the attention of President Trump. Sliwa has also faced criticism from the president, who said in September, \"Curtis is not exactly prime time,\" and poked fun at Sliwa's dozens of rescue cats. Mr. Trump has railed against Mamdani, too, calling him a \"communist\" and implying that federal funding to the city could be cut if he wins.",
      "\"I wouldn't be generous to a communist,\" the president said this week.",
      "In response to the president's criticisms of him, Sliwa advised Mr. Trump \u2014 another native New Yorker \u2014 to stay focused on international crises, rather than New York City.",
      "\"Every time he gets involved in this mayoral election, he strengthens Zohran Mamdani,\" said Sliwa. \"They don't want to campaign against me or Andrew Cuomo. They want to campaign against Donald Trump.\"",
      "The Trump administration has taken aim at the city and New York state, accusing local leaders of failing to cooperate with Mr. Trump's immigration agenda and of following diversity, equity and inclusion practices that the administration alleges are unconstitutional. The federal government froze $18 billion earmarked for two high-profile Manhattan tunnel projects, citing DEI, and it attempted to revoke millions in counterterrorism grants for the city's subway system.",
      "Separately, the Trump-backed \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" restricts Medicaid and food stamps, which could hit locales throughout the country.",
      "Sliwa warned, \"There will be cuts,\" but that he would try to \"limit the negative impact.\"",
      "\"We just have to make sure they don't hurt people who are desperately in need,\" Sliwa said.",
      "This is Sliwa's second consecutive campaign for mayor, but it follows decades in the public eye as an activist, a radio host and the founder of Guardian Angels anti-crime group. He's known on the campaign trail for his trademark red beret, which has long symbolized his Guardian Angels roots \u2014 but he said he's willing to put it aside.",
      "\"If that were the only reason not to elect me,\" he said, \"I'll take the red beret, put it in storage, and I'll never wear it again. But you gotta elect me mayor first.\""

      "The family's income comes to around $1,200 a week, Pyle said. Between the cost of rent, utilities, her 10-year-old daughter's braces and therapy for her 5-year-old autistic son, paring the family's budget is difficult, she noted. Even her own dental care is on hold for now.",
      "\"It shouldn't take everything out of us just to survive,\" Pyle said. \"We sacrifice so much \u2014 and having to deal with being a special needs parent alone \u2014 it's all piling up, and this was one more thing that didn't need to happen.\"",
      "The White House referred a request for comment to the Office of Management and Budget. The agency did not respond to CBS News' inquiry.",
      "\"Extremely stressful\"",
      "One in 6 active-duty military families was already experiencing food insecurity before the shutdown, according to a 2023\u00a0survey\u00a0from Blue Star Families. The advocacy group also\u00a0found\u00a0that roughly a third of service member households have less than $3,000 in savings, leaving them vulnerable to financial emergencies.",
      "As a result, missing a paycheck can have \"a devastating impact,\" said Kathy Roth-Douquet, CEO of Blue Star Families.",
      "\"There is a financial impact first and foremost, but there is a big psychological impact, too, that is in some ways equally damaging,\" she added.",
      "Roth-Douquet noted that many military families depend on a single income because frequent relocations make it difficult for spouses to find steady work. \"That means families depend on one paycheck, and if they don't get it, it can tip them into disaster,\" she said.",
      "Misty Gilbert, whose husband is a member of the U.S. Coast Guard, earns a second income as a sixth-grade special education teacher in San Diego. Her salary isn't substantial enough to support her family even for a short period of time, she told CBS News.",
      "\"My check alone would barely cover the rent,\" she said.",
      "She added that the uncertainty caused by the government shutdown has been \"extremely stressful\" for her family.",
      "\"The holidays are coming up \u2014 a lot of times we like to travel to see family. I don't know if that would be an option if this continues, if we can justify those types of expenses of seeing family and holiday expenses in general,\" she said."

      "The president and Kirk were allies for almost a decade. Kirk was a staunch supporter of Mr. Trump during all three of his presidential campaigns.

      "The Social Security Administration's annual announcement setting next year's cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, will be delayed because of the\u00a0government shutdown, the agency said.",
      "Each year, the Social Security Administration adjusts benefits for its 75 million recipients based on recent inflation data, which ensures that seniors, disabled Americans and other beneficiaries don't lose purchasing power as prices rise.",

      "The September CPI is forecast to rise to an annual rate of 3.1% up from 2.9% in August, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "According to economists, inflation is edging higher due partly to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, which have hit imports from across the globe, such as clothing, food, steel and toys. While some businesses stockpiled imported goods earlier this year to avoid raising rising prices, some are now passing the import taxes\u00a0on to their customers.",
      "\"Core goods pressures have started to heat up, marking the beginning of a delayed tariff passthrough,\" RBC economists Michael Reid and Carrie Freestone said in an Oct. 14 report. \"Concerningly, the breadth of inflationary pressures has widened \u2014 45% of CPI basket items are now reporting price growth at or above 3%, compared to roughly two-thirds pre-pandemic.\"",

The Federal Reserve\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, its favored measure of inflation, will rise to 3.1% this year before receding to 2.6% in 2026."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 More than a decade after the Supreme Court gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, and just two years after it declined to unravel another piece of the law, the Supreme Court will convene on Wednesday to hear a legal battle over Louisiana's congressional map that could reverberate throughout the nation.",
      "The consolidated cases, known as Louisiana v. Callais and Robinson v. Callais, could weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which has been used to ensure minority voters have the opportunity to elect their preferred candidates.",
      "The legal fight has been before the justices before. In its last term, the Supreme Court weighed whether to leave in place Louisiana's House map that was redrawn in 2024 to include a second majority-Black district. But the high court declined to issue a ruling then and instead set it for reargument in its new term, which started last week.",
      "The Supreme Court then said in August that it would be considering whether state lawmakers' intentional drawing of a second majority-minority district \u2014 done to address a violation of the Voting Rights Act \u2014 runs afoul of the 14th and 15th Amendments of the Constitution.",
      "That new question raises the stakes of the case, as Republicans in Louisiana are urging the high court to prohibit the consideration of race in the drawing of voting lines. A decision in the state's favor could upend Section 2 and deliver another blow to the landmark civil rights law.",
      "\"Section 2 has had a major impact, definitely in the South, but really nationwide on improving political representation opportunities for voters in a lot of different communities of color and all around the country,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Brennan Center for Justice's office in Washington, D.C. \"A decision that leaves the current understanding of Section 2 in grave doubt opens up unfortunately a lot of chaos throughout the country in a lot of different jurisdictions.\"",
      "Arguments before the high court will play out as GOP lawmakers in several states have engaged in politically motivated efforts to recraft their district lines to help Republicans hold onto their majority in the House. The dispute involving Louisiana's map centers on the use of race in the map-making process, though if the state prevails, it would likely lead to challenges of existing maps that govern voting boundaries for not just Congress, but also local school boards, city councils and state legislatures.",
      "\"This is a gut check for the court: Does it want to sign off on another era where we just retreat from the commitment that was made that we're going to assure we don't live in a country where we subjugate people based on race, particularly in the political space?\" Crayton said.",
      "The fight over Louisiana's map",
      "The protracted dispute over Louisiana's congressional map dates back to 2022, when Republican state lawmakers crafted new House district boundaries to adjust for population changes after the 2020 Census. The original map comprised five majority-White districts and one majority-Black district. Nearly one third of Louisiana's population is Black, according to Census data.",
      "A group of African-American voters challenged those lines as a violation of Section 2 because, they argued, the map diluted Black voting strength. A judge in Baton Rouge agreed and ordered the state to put in place a remedial map with two majority-Black congressional districts.",
      "The new plan adopted by the Louisiana legislature in 2024 reconfigured the state's 6th Congressional District, which state lawmakers said was an effort to bring it into compliance with the Voting Rights Act. The new District 6 has a Black voting-age population of roughly 51% and stretches across the state from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge, in the southeast. Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat who is Black, was elected to represent the district last November.",
      "But after the new map was adopted, a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-American\" voters filed a lawsuit challenging the lines. They alleged that the retooled District 6 was a racial gerrymander that violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "A divided panel of three judges in Shreveport sided with the voters and found that the state legislature relied too much on race when it crafted the new map.",
      "The case landed before the Supreme Court in its last term, with Louisiana Republicans joining with Black voters and voting rights groups in urging the justices to leave the new congressional map intact. But after the Supreme Court said it would consider the legal fight for a second time \u2014 a rare move \u2014 state GOP lawmakers abandoned their defense of the map.",
      "Instead, state officials are arguing that Louisiana's intentional creation of a second majority-minority district violates the Constitution's 14th and 15th Amendments.",
      "\"Our oath is to the Constitution,\" Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill, a Republican, and Solicitor General Benjamin Aguinaga wrote in a filing. \"Our Constitution sees neither black voters nor white voters; it sees only American voters.\"",
      "The Voting Rights Act",
      "The 14th and 15th Amendments were adopted after the Civil War to guarantee Black people equal protection under the law and the right to vote. The amendments gave Congress the power to enact legislation enforcing their protections, and lawmakers exercised that authority when it passed the Voting Rights Act in 1965, which is known as the crown jewel of civil rights legislation.",
      "With bipartisan support, Congress amended Section 2 in 1982 and reauthorized the Voting Rights Act in 2006, when President George W. Bush signed it into law.",
      "\"Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which protects against the denial or abridgement of the right to vote on account of race or color, has been a durable centerpiece of the bipartisan legislation passed to make real our shared, national commitment,\" a group of former Republican lawmakers who backed the law and its amendments wrote in a brief. \"It stands as a monument to Congress's ability to act as the Constitution's Framers intended: to identify a national problem, to amass an extensive factual record, and to forge a lasting legislative solution.\"",
      "The Supreme Court will rehear the Louisiana case just over two years after it upheld Section 2 and reaffirmed the framework for proving vote dilution under the Voting Rights Act, which was set out in a 1986 ruling. The high court split 5-4 in that 2023 case, which involved a challenge to Alabama's congressional map, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joining the three liberal justices in the majority.",
      "While the high court rejected the chance to weaken Section 2, Kavanaugh suggested that there must be an end-point for the use of race-based remedies.",
      "\"[T]he authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future,\" Kavanaugh wrote in a concurring opinion. \"But Alabama did not raise that temporal argument in this Court, and I therefore would not consider it at this time.\"",
      "Both Kavanaugh and Roberts will be key as the Supreme Court weighs the constitutionality of race-based map-making. The two justices were also in the majority when the high court outlawed the use of race as a factor in college admissions, a decision that came down in the same term as the Alabama voting rights dispute.",
      "\"If in college admissions, if the quest for diversity \u2014 and by diversity, we really mean racial diversity, how someone looks, what their race is, the color of their skin, the shape of their eyes, the texture of their hair. It's how they look, it's who they are \u2014 that's not a compelling governmental interest to treat people differently, it must follow that treating people differently in order to create election districts that are geographically based will not stand,\" said Edward Blum, the president of Students for Fair Admissions, which successfully challenged affirmative action in higher education. Blum is also the director of Project on Fair Representation, a nonprofit organization that opposes racial and ethnic classifications.",
      "Roberts has long denounced racial classifications. In 2006, shortly after he joined the court, the chief justice wrote in a concurring opinion that \"it is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.\" He also authored the majority opinion 12 years ago that dismantled Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, writing, \"our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\"",
      "\"America is no longer in the 1960s,\" Blum said. \"We have moved on, and to base election districts with the primary predicate being to create a racial district, a district in which a racial minority has the opportunity to elect a candidate of choice, that has now been the energy behind creating districts that no longer keep neighborhoods and civic associations and towns and communities together for the purposes of representation.\"",
      "It's unclear how far the Supreme Court will go in a decision, though several conservative justices have endorsed the vision of a \"colorblind Constitution.\" Louisiana officials and the voters who challenged the redrawn map have argued that any consideration of race when drawing voting lines is unconstitutional.",
      "The Trump administration is backing Louisiana in the case and has urged the Supreme Court to tighten the standards for proving unlawful vote dilution. The framework in place since 1986 requires plaintiffs to show racial polarization in voting, in addition to other preconditions.",
      "\"Too often, Section 2 is deployed as a form of electoral race-based affirmative action to undo a State's constitutional pursuit of political ends. That misuse of Section 2 is unconstitutional,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing.",
      "But voting rights groups fear that changing the longstanding framework for how courts evaluate potential violations of Section 2 would undercut its aim of ensuring equal opportunities for minority voters.",
      "\"Because it's so difficult to prove and is one of the only avenues that minority voters have to challenge these districts, it could have potential reverberations to make it incredibly difficult for minority voters to achieve equal representation through district lines,\" Sara Rohani, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told CBS News.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June or early July."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday turned away an appeal by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones over a $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him for his false claims that the\u00a02012 shooting\u00a0at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax.",
      "In rejecting Jones' case, the Supreme Court leaves in place the record-breaking sum he was ordered to pay after he was\u00a0found liable\u00a0in 2021 for damages in lawsuits brought by the families of children who were killed in the massacre. Jones had separately asked the high court last week for emergency relief while it considered whether to take up his case. Justice Sonia Sotomayor denied Jones' bid to halt the judgment later Monday, likely because the Supreme Court denied his appeal.",
      "A six-person Connecticut jury\u00a0had agreed\u00a0in 2022 that Jones should pay $965 million to the families as compensation for defamation, infliction of emotional distress and violations of a Connecticut law. A state court judge\u00a0added on another $474 million in punitive damages one month later.",
      "Jones' lawyers told the Supreme Court in a filing that the more than $1.4 billion \"can never be paid.\"",
      "Jones, the founder of InfoWars, had repeatedly claimed that the 2012 shooting that killed 20 students and six teachers was staged by \"crisis actors\" as part of a plan to enact more restrictive gun laws. Relatives of the victims and an FBI agent testified during the defamation trial that they were threatened and harassed by Jones' listeners who believed his lies about the massacre.",
      "In a different lawsuit brought in Texas, Jones testified that the shooting was \"100% real.\" Still, he had slammed the Connecticut trial as a \"kangaroo court\" and argued it violated his free speech rights.",
      "Jones and Free Speech Systems, his company, filed for bankruptcy protection after he was ordered to pay the families, and the satirical publication The Onion tried to\u00a0purchase InfoWars\u00a0at a bankruptcy auction for an undisclosed price last year. But a bankruptcy judge\u00a0rejected the sale\u00a0of InfoWars to The Onion last December. Jones' lawyers said there is still an effort underway for InfoWars to be sold."

    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",
      "Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown."

    "summary": "Two families from Colorado urged the Supreme Court to reaffirm that parents have a constitutional right to make decisions about their children's care and upbringing.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a bid to revive a lawsuit brought by two Colorado families who alleged their parental rights were violated when their children attended school-sponsored club meetings that included discussions of gender identity and sexuality and were allegedly discouraged from telling their parents about it.",
      "Though the high court turned away the case, Justices Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, wrote separately to express concern with what Alito said was an unwillingness by courts to confront whether a school district violates parents' rights when it encourages a student's gender transition without the parents' knowledge or consent.",
      "\"Petitioners tell us that nearly 6,000 public schools have policies \u2014 as respondent allegedly does \u2014 that purposefully interfere with parents' access to critical information about their children's gender-identity choices and school personnel's involvement in and influence on those choices,\" Alito wrote. \"The troubling \u2014 and tragic \u2014 allegations in this case underscore the 'great and growing national importance\" of the question that these parent petitioners present.'\"",
      "The legal fight was brought by two sets of parents \u2014 Jonathan and Erin Lee, and Nicolas and Linnaea Jurich \u2014 who asked the Supreme Court to reaffirm that parents have a constitutional right to make decisions about their children's care and upbringing. The families claimed that parents' legal authority is being undercut by school districts nationwide.",
      "The families challenged policies implemented by the Poudre School District R-1 in Wellington, Colorado, which they say urge district employees not to disclose information about a students' gender identity, including to parents.",
      "In one instance, the Lees' daughter, identified in court papers as C.L., was urged to attend a meeting of the Gender and Sexualities Alliance at her middle school. During the meeting, a substitute teacher in the school district spoke about gender identity and sexual orientation, and warned students that it may not be safe to tell their parents about the discussion, according to court papers.",
      "C.L. announced during the meeting that she was transgender, and told her parents when she went home, the family said in a Supreme Court filing. She also recounted the events of the meeting, after which C.L.'s parents removed her from the school district and enrolled their daughter in a private school, according to court filings.",
      "The Lees contacted the school's principal to discuss what occurred at the GSA meeting, and he told the parents that the meetings were expected to be confidential to ensure a safe space for open conversation, according to court papers.",
      "A second student, the Jurichs' daughter, who is identified in court papers as H.J., had a similar experience at after-school GSA meetings, which included discussions of gender identity and the warning about sharing the discussions with her parents.",
      "H.J. was later disenrolled from the middle school after starting eighth grade, when she told her parents she felt unsafe about being in the same building as a teacher who encouraged her to attend the GSA meetings, according to court filings.",
      "Both sets of parents sued the Poudre School District, alleging that their 14th Amendment rights were violated by interfering with their decision-making as parents. They sought monetary damages to reimburse the cost of private school, medical expenses, counseling fees and other costs.",
      "But a federal district court dismissed the lawsuit, and later denied their attempt to amend their suit. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld that decision on procedural grounds.",
      "In urging the Supreme Court to take up the case, lawyers for the parents warned that the lower court rulings invite the school district to \"continue surreptitiously wresting decision-making authority from fit parents unawares and instead vesting that authority in school officials.\"",
      "\"America's long history of protecting parents' legal authority in raising their children is being deliberately dismantled by school districts across the country that have enacted policies to replace parental authority with governmental authority,\" they wrote in a filing. \"These policies actively deprive parents of the very information they need to exercise their legal rights and moral obligations to act in their children's best interests.\"",
      "But the school district said the Supreme Court should turn the case away and argued that the parents were effectively seeking an \"advisory opinion\" that is outside the jurisdiction of federal courts.",
      "\"[T]he parents seek an advisory opinion that would fail to afford them any relief from the rulings below, and this is the wrong case to consider whether a public school employee's alleged discouraged disclosure regarding gender identity and expression implicates a fundamental right,\" they wrote in a filing."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will not consider whether the online dating platform Grindr can be sued for sex trafficking and other offenses by a young user who was sexually assaulted by men he matched with on the app.",
      "In turning away the case, the high court passed up a chance to examine the scope of Section 230, a powerful tool for online companies that immunizes them from civil lawsuits stemming from content posted by third parties. The Supreme Court has in the past been confronted with cases asking it to decide the parameters of immunity under Section 230, but it has skirted rulings that could have limited the legal shield.",
      "Defenders of Section 230, which was enacted in 1996, have said that the law paved the way for online innovation and has allowed internet platforms both big and small to flourish. But critics have warned that courts have interpreted Section 230 too broadly, allowing social media platforms and other internet companies to escape accountability.",
      "Among those calling for the Supreme Court to examine the bounds of Section 230 are Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, who warned last year that social media companies have used the legal shield as a \"get-out-of-jail-free card.\"",
      "The Grindr lawsuit",
      "The case dates back to 2019, when a 15-year-old boy living in Canada, identified in court filings as John Doe, downloaded Grindr and created a profile. Grindr did not verify his age, he said, and the app matched the boy with four adult men living in his area. Doe met the men in person, and was sexually assaulted and raped, according to court filings. Three of the four men were convicted for their crimes against Doe.",
      "Doe filed a lawsuit against Grindr in 2023 for sex trafficking and other violations, including alleging that the app is defective because it recommends adults and children for in-person sexual encounters, which are illegal. He claimed that Grindr intentionally markets its app to children and allows them to create profiles without parental permission or supervision, despite knowing that the platform puts young people at risk.",
      "Grindr sought to dismiss the case, arguing in part that Section 230 shielded it from liability because Doe's claims stemmed from the publication of content created by third parties.",
      "A federal judge found Grindr was entitled to immunity under Section 230 and agreed to toss out the case, determining that the app's match function relies on third-party content generated by its users, namely their profile and geolocation data that is extracted from their phones.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld the lower court's dismissal of Doe's case. The appeals court said Doe faulted Grindr for \"facilitating communication among users for illegal activity\" and failing to suppress matches and conversations between adults and children. Those actions, it said, would involve the platform's role as a publisher of third-party content.",
      "Doe appealed to the Supreme Court and argued the federal courts of appeals are divided on how to interpret the scope of Section 230, particularly when it involves treating platforms as publishers, or whether the content is a third party's.",
      "They said that for nearly three decades, courts have begun to expand the scope of Section 230 to provide sweeping immunity to online platforms.",
      "\"Section 230 was passed in 1995 to make the Internet safer,\" Doe's lawyers wrote in a filing. \"Instead, it created a hunting ground for predators, and a goldmine for amoral companies who need not invest in providing safe products. Delay will guarantee more victims.\"",
      "But lawyers for Grindr said Doe misrepresented his age in order to gain access to the platform, dooming his attempts to claim that Grindr knowingly engaged in sex trafficking since the app forbids minors from using it.",
      "\"At its core, this case involves user-to-user communications on an online platform, where Grindr's role was confined to providing the digital infrastructure for those interactions,\" they wrote in a filing to the Supreme Court.",
      "Grindr's lawyers said that Section 230 protects it from liability for its decisions about user content, namely what to screen, block, publish or take down.",
      "In 2023, the Supreme Court considered the scope of Section 230 for the first time, and specifically whether its protections extended to targeted recommendations of information. But the high court declined to address Section 230 directly in its decision and instead ruled on technical grounds.",
      "The Supreme Court turned away another case involving Section 230 and the photo and video-sharing app Snapchat last year, which was brought by an unnamed teenager who alleged his science teacher used the platform to groom him and send him sexually explicit content."

This election will be a simple choice: Is Maine going to bow down or stand up? I know my answer.\"",
      "CBS News reported last week\u00a0that Mills was expected to launch her campaign on Tuesday.",
      "The 77-year-old governor has been viewed as a key recruiting target for national Democrats, who face long odds of flipping control of the Senate back next year given a difficult map of races. Mills was first elected governor after winning by more than seven points in 2018, and she won reelection by a 13-point margin four years later.",
      "But recent political history, both locally and across the country, may upend expectations about how Mills will fare in what could become one of the tensest contests of the 2026 midterms.",
      "Collins has served as one of Maine's senators since 1997, establishing herself as a key moderate Republican voice, albeit one who tends to frustrate members of both major parties at times. During the 2020 presidential election, defeating Collins was a major, and well-funded, priority for Democrats. But Collins still managed to win re-election by more than eight points, even as Democrat Joe Biden's statewide margin over President Trump in Maine was nine points.",
      "The 72-year-old Collins has never lost a Senate race in Maine, her last defeat coming in a run for governor back in 1994.",
      "Mills' expected entry into the Senate race is already being met with some dismissiveness on the progressive side. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is an independent but caucuses with Democrats, is rallying around Graham Platner, a younger first-time statewide candidate who is already in the Senate race and, according to his online campaign bio, is a military veteran and oyster farmer.",
      "\"Graham Platner is a great working class candidate for Senate in Maine who will defeat Susan Collins,\" Sanders said recently on social media. \"It's disappointing that some Democratic leaders are urging Governor Mills to run. We need to focus on winning that seat & not waste millions on an unnecessary & divisive primary.\"",
      "In the fallout from a difficult 2024 election cycle where Democrats lost the presidency and Senate, and failed to retake control of the House, there have been persistent questions about how the party can recover. One tension rippling through the party is the subject of generational change, and whether to eschew the older candidates closer in age to Biden, 82, and instead nominate people who can try to revive a Democratic brand that has suffered in recent years.",
      "With Mills' entry into the race on Tuesday, Democrats in Maine may be on a collision course over those national concerns already rippling through other contests where the party's future direction could be at stake."

      "Former federal ethics officials who served in Republican and Democratic administrations are asking the Justice Department's inspector general to investigate the prosecutions of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "In a letter obtained by CBS News, ethics officials who worked in the Obama and George W. Bush administrations urged a formal review of interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Lindsey Halligan's decision to prosecute Comey and James.",
      "They sent their request Tuesday to Acting Justice Department Inspector General William Blier, writing, \"Ms. Halligan pursued these indictments to fulfill President Donald J. Trump's longstanding personal vendetta against Mr. Comey and Ms. James, we are facing a turning point in our democracy and some of the most egregious examples of vindictive and meritless prosecution that our nation has ever seen.\"",
      "The letter was written by leaders of the Democracy Defenders Fund, a Washington-based nonpartisan group that has frequently been critical of the Trump administration.",
      "The group is led by Norm Eisen, former ethics official for President Barack Obama; Richard Painter, a former associate counsel to President George W. Bush; and Virginia Canter, a former White House associate counsel to Presidents Bill Clinton and Obama.",
      "Their letter also said, \"A president should never order prosecutions of his enemies. That happens in Putin's Russia, and it has happened in other dictatorships, but not here\u2013until now.\"",
      "Comey and Mr. Trump have had a contentious relationship for years. Comey, who was FBI director when Mr. Trump took office in 2017, was fired later that year by the president. Initially, the White House indicated he had been ousted over his handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton's email server, but the president later told NBC News' Lester Holt that he had the FBI's Russia investigation on his mind and had terminated Comey because of \"this Russia thing with Trump and Russia.\"",
      "That firing ultimately set into motion special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election and that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denounced those allegations as a \"hoax.\" Mueller's probe found that Russia interfered in the election and several Trump campaign officials had contacts with Russians, but did not establish that campaign staff illegally conspired with the Russian government.",
      "For his part, Comey has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump since his firing, calling him \"morally unfit\" to be president in a 2018 interview.",
      "The Democracy Defenders Fund also contended that \"prosecutors should never be fired for refusing to bring charges they conclude are unfounded, even if the president orders them to do so. Yet that appears to be just what President Trump has done in order to charge Mr. Comey and Ms. James.\"",
      "The criminal cases were filed against Comey and James less than three weeks after President Trump called for their prosecution in a post on social media.",
      "The acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who had been appointed to the position by Mr. Trump, resigned after he did not bring prosecutions of Comey and James, and the president announced he had been fired. A Trump White House aide, Lindsey Halligan, was then installed as acting U.S. attorney and within days secured grand jury indictments against Comey and James \u2014 with prosecutors charging Comey less than a week before the statute of limitations ran out.",
      "Halligan has defended both of the prosecutions. In the hours after James's indictment last week, Halligan said in a statement, \"No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust.\"",
      "After charging Comey, Halligan said, \"The charges as alleged in this case represent a breach of the public trust at an extraordinary level,\"",
      "Comey is charged with making a false statement and obstruction of Congress, for allegedly lying to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020 when he denied that he had authorized someone at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports. Comey has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "During an arraignment proceeding last week, Comey's defense attorney told a judge that Comey would seek a dismissal of the case next week, arguing the case is an unlawful vindictive prosecution against one of the president's critics.",
      "The Democracy Defenders Fund's request for a federal review of Halligan's cases also argued, \"The same pattern has now been repeated a second time in as many weeks with respect to another victim of President Trump's wrath. Ms. Halligan's prosecution of Letitia James on two counts of 'bank fraud' and a 'false statement' appears to be a further attempt to fulfill President Trump's personal vendetta against his political enemies.\"",
      "\"Trump's animus against Ms. James stems from having successfully brought a years-long civil fraud case against the Trump Organization, which included judgments against President Trump and two of his sons and imposed a court monitor with limits on their ability to conduct business in New York,\" the fund's letter continued.",
      "James is scheduled to appear in court on Oct. 24, to answer to charges of mortgage fraud and false statement in connection with a Norfolk, Virginia, home in 2020. James has also denied wrongdoing.",
      "The Office of the Justice Department Inspector General is on furlough because of the shutdown and did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment."

    "published": "Tue, 14 Oct 2025 07:14:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have dulled this year's autumn colors and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual.",
    "story": [
      "Portland, Maine \u2014 Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have dulled this year's autumn colors and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual.",
      "Soaking in the fall foliage is an annual tradition in the New England states as well as areas such as the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina and Upper Peninsula of Michigan. As the days shorten and temperatures drop, chlorophyll in leaves breaks down, and they turn to the autumn tones of yellow, orange and red.",
      "But dry weather in summer and fall can change all that because the lack of water causes leaves to brown and fall more quickly. And that's happening this year, as more than 40% of the country was considered to be in a drought in early October, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.",
      "That's more than twice the average, said Brad Rippey, a U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist and an author of the drought monitor, which is a partnership between the federal government and University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Drought has hit the Northeast and western U.S. especially hard, he said.",
      "It all adds up to fewer leaves to peep.",
      "\"I think it might be a little bit of a short and less colorful season, for the most part,\" Rippey said. \"The color is just not going to be there this year for some hillsides.\"",
      "Despite the gloomy forecast, autumn enthusiasts said it's still a great year to get out and enjoy nature's fireworks display. There is still a lot of color in New England's trees, said Andy Finton, senior conservation ecologist with The Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts.",
      "Climate change is stressing forests with severe weather and heat waves, but autumn in New England remains a beautiful time of year to experience the wonderment of forest ecosystems firsthand, he said.",
      "\"Our trees and our forests have an inherent resilience,\" Finton said. \"They are still very resilient, and I am constantly surprised at how wonderful the fall season is despite these stresses.\"",
      "Leaf-peepers undeterred for most part",
      "The tourism business built around leaf peeping has also proven resilient. At the Mills Falls Resort Collection at the Lake in Meredith, New Hampshire, general manager Barbara Beckwith said business is good at the four inns that have 170 rooms. The number of Canadian tourists is down, Beckwith acknowledged, but she said that's been made up with domestic leaf peepers, mostly from New England.",
      "Beckwith said her properties were booked solid on weekends through mid-October and had been for weeks.",
      "\"This year is actually going to be better than last year,\" Beckwith said. \"Last year was an election and that put a lot of trepidation in people. Now, they are traveling. The uncertainty of the election is over. We all know whose president now and we are traveling.\"",
      "Chris Proulx, executive director of the Mount Washington (New Hampshire) Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the decline in Canadian tourists by as much as 80% seen this summer has continued into the fall. But the region is faring better, he said, thanks to an uptick in travelers from other countries and its reputation for having one of the country's best leaf peeping seasons.",
      "\"This is the one season where people make plans in advance to come in addition to travelers from all of the country and all over the world,\" Proulx said.",
      "Leaf peeping was so popular in Colorado's Rocky Mountains this year that one town temporarily closed its highway offramp to alleviate gridlock. The area put on a display of yellow aspen trees dotting the mountains between evergreens, their delicate leaves vibrating in the wind.",
      "But there were signs of a dry spring in the central part of the state, one that is more severe the farther west you travel, said Colorado State Forest Service entomologist Dan West, who spends many fall days in a plane looking at how insect infestations are affecting tree health.",
      "Crispy edges, muted colors, and dropping leaves before they can take on a red or purple hue are all signs of drought stress, West said.",
      "\"The tree is shutting down processes early and we basically just see this muted kind of a show for the fall,\" he said.",
      "In Denver, arborist Michael Sundberg also said he's seeing less vibrant color than usual, and autumn feels like it arrived earlier than usual this year. It's still a beautiful time of year, but there might be less of it to enjoy, he said.",
      "\"It's weird to have color peaking this early in the mountains and then for Denver to be peaking at the same time,\" he said. \"Usually we're later in October before we really go off.\""

    "published": "Fri, 10 Oct 2025 07:06:00 -0400",
    "summary": "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially, the IUCN said as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
    "story": [
      "Arctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of bird species around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion, according to an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said Friday as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
      "While many animals are increasingly at risk of disappearing forever, the updated list shows how species can come back from the brink with dedicated effort, Rima Jabado, deputy chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Hope and concern go hand in hand in this work,\" Jabado wrote by email. \"The same persistence that brought back the green sea turtle can be mirrored in small, everyday actions \u2014 supporting sustainable choices, backing conservation initiatives, and urging leaders to follow through on their environmental promises.\"",
      "The list is updated every year by teams of scientists assessing data on creatures around the world. The scope of the work is enormous and important for science, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration and wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "\"Every time one is done and every time there's revision, there's more information, and there's more ability to answer questions\" on species, some of which are still largely a mystery to researchers, Farnsworth said.",
      "Sea ice loss",
      "Because all the marine mammals native to the Arctic \u2014 seals, whales and polar bears \u2014 rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN's Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.",
      "The three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report \u2014 harp, hooded and bearded seals \u2014 have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.",
      "The same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \"generally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\" wrote Kovacs.",
      "\"Acting to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\" Kovacs said.",
      "Global bird decline",
      "The update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel's asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.",
      "\"That three in five of the world's bird species have declining populations shows how deep the biodiversity crisis has become and how urgent it is that governments take the actions they have committed to under multiple conventions and agreements,\" said Ian Burfield, global science coordinator at BirdLife International.",
      "Deforestation of tropical forests is one of a \"depressing litany of threats\" to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.",
      "\"The fact that 61% of the world's birds are declining is an alarm bell that we can't afford to ignore,\" Butchart said.",
      "The annual U.N. climate summit will be held in November in Belem, Brazil, with much attention on the Amazon and the value of tropical forests to humans and animals. But Farnsworth, of Cornell, said he was \"not so confident\" that world's leaders would take decisive action to protect imperiled bird species.",
      "\"I would like to think things like birds are nonpartisan, and you can find common ground,\" he said. \"But it's not easy.\"",
      "Green sea turtles",
      "One success story is the rebound of green sea turtles in many parts of the world's oceans. Experts see that as a bright spot because it shows how effective human interventions, like legal protections and conservation programs, can be.",
      "Still, \"it's important to note that conservation efforts of sea turtles can take decades before you realize the fruits of that labor,\" said Justin Perrault, vice president of research at Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, who wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "The overall success with green sea turtles should be celebrated and used as an example with other species, some of which, like hawksbills and leatherbacks, aren't doing nearly as well, said Nicolas Pilcher, executive director of the Marine Research Foundation.",
      "And even for green sea turtles, areas still remain where climate change and other factors like erosion are damaging habitats, Pilcher said, and some of those are poorer communities that receive less conservation funding.",
      "But in the places where they have recovered, it's \"a great story of, actually, we can do something about this,\" Pilcher said. \"We can. We can make a difference.\"",
      "Extinct species",
      "The latest Red List notes that six species have moved to the extinct category. The IUCN says those species include the Christmas Island shrew and the slender-billed curlew, a migratory shorebird.",
      "Three Australian mammals and a plant native to Hawaii were assessed by the IUCN for the first time and put on the list of extinct species."

    "story": [
      "A weak spot in the Earth's magnetic field is growing over the South Atlantic Ocean, according to more than a decade's worth of satellite data collected by scientists.",
      "The magnetic field surrounding Earth protects the planet from cosmic radiation and particles charged by the sun. Scientists believe it is generated by the outer core of the Earth, according to a news release from the European Space Agency. The ESA said the \"global ocean of molten, swirling liquid iron\" in that layer of the planet creates electrical currents that generate the magnetic field.",
      "The weak spot, known as the South Atlantic Anomaly, was first identified in the 19th century, the ESA said. It is southeast of South America and southwest of Africa. In this area, the planet's magnetic field dips down, according to NASA. Satellites that pass over it are hit with higher doses of incoming radiation, which can cause technical issues and even blackouts.",
      "The ESA studied the spot for 11 years, from 2014 to 2025. Three different satellites, known as Swarm, precisely measured the planet's magnetic signals during that period. The data was published in the journal Science Direct.",
      "The satellite data showed that the South Atlantic Anomaly had expanded by an area \"nearly half the size of continental Europe,\" or about two million square miles. The speed of the area's weakening has increased since 2020, the ESA said, with different parts of the anomaly changing at different rates.",
      "\"The South Atlantic Anomaly is not just a single block,\" says lead author Chris Finlay, Professor of Geomagnetism at the Technical University of Denmark, in the ESA's news release. \"It's changing differently towards Africa than it is near South America. There's something special happening in this region that is causing the field to weaken in a more intense way.\"",
      "Finlay said that magnetic field lines emitting from the core are bouncing back into it. It's not clear why this is happening, but it is contributing to the anomaly's weakening in those areas, the ESA said.",
      "The ESA satellites found other changes in the Earth's magnetic field. In the southern hemisphere, there is another area where the magnetic field is particularly strong. Two other anomalies exist in the northern hemisphere: One near Canada and one over Siberia. Both are stronger than the rest of the field. However, the one near Canada has shrunk by an area the size of India, while the one over Siberia has grown by an area the size of Greenland, the ESA said.",
      "The satellites will continue to study the planet's magnetic field in the coming years, the ESA said.",
      "\"It's really wonderful to see the big picture of our dynamic Earth thanks to Swarm's extended timeseries,\" Swarm Mission manager Anja Stromme said in a statement. \"The satellites are all healthy and providing excellent data, so we can hopefully extend that record beyond 2030, when the solar minimum will allow more unprecedented insights into our planet.\""

The space agency cannot land astronauts on the moon by decade's end without the 403-foot Starship, the reusable vehicle meant to get them from lunar orbit down to the surface and back up.",

      "Kentucky announced a lawsuit against Roblox last month, and Louisiana filed a suit against the platform in August.",
      "\"For years, Roblox has ignored this crisis so it could continue turning a profit,\" Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said in a statement. \"Our responsibility is to protect Kentucky children from online exploitation by these predators and the companies like Roblox that knowingly facilitate it.\"",
      "Steven said his family is suing Roblox as well as Discord, an instant messaging and social platform, because \"at the end of the day, the thing they seem to care about the most is the bottom line, their profit.\"",

      "\"This thing happens so much faster than you can ever imagine,\" Steven said. \"You want to believe that like \u2026 you've done everything you can and that it'll never happen to me and I thought the same thing until it did.\"",
      "Roblox and Discord respond",

      "\"We have safety systems that are in place by default and a lot of these situations that you're talking about, like extortion, people sharing, graphic images, they simply cannot happen on Roblox,\" Kaufman said.",
      "Until recently, Roblox did not verify players' ages. By the end of the year, all users will have to pass its checks to communicate within the platform. According to Roblox, these checks will include \"a combination of facial age estimation technology, ID age verification and verified parental consent.\"",

    "summary": "David Pogue looks at our nation's tradition of pioneering inventors, from Thomas Edison's R&amp;D facility in Menlo Park, N.J., to today's entrepreneurs pitching their ideas to \"Shark Tank.\"",
    "story": [
      "If you plot the origins of the greatest inventions in history, you start to notice a pattern: The light bulb, the phonograph, the airplane, air conditioning, the zipper, the microwave, lasers, transistors, the personal computer, the internet, GPS, the smartphone \u2026 No country on Earth has as rich a history of modern invention as this one.",
      "But my question is, why is that? Well, the answer may start with a guy from Ohio: Thomas Edison, who we know as the inventor of the light bulb.",
      "\"Kind of,\" notes Hal Wallace, a curator at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. \"What we like to say is, Thomas Edison invented a commercially practical light bulb.\"",
      "Wallace says the light bulb was just one component of Edison's achievement: \"He was inventing new dynamoes, cables, switches, sockets, meters. If you're gonna sell electricity, you gotta have a meter. So, it's a systems approach.\"",
      "On New Year's Eve 1879, Edison gave an unforgettable demo in Menlo Park, New Jersey. Wallace said, \"He lit up the grounds, he lit up the laboratory, he lit up an office building with about a hundred of these light bulbs, and invited the press: 'Come out to Menlo Park and see what we've done.' He especially invited his investors!",
      "\"When the lights come on, it's almost a mystical experience, because these are not candles, they're not gas lights, they don't hiss, they don't smoke, they don't create noxious odors. You turn it on, it just sits and it glows.\"",
      "Edison's portfolio also included motion pictures, Portland cement, and even a talking doll, \"which is one of his famous flops,\" said Wallace.",
      "Steven Johnson, who has written 14 books about innovation and also co-founded a new Google AI tool for research called NotebookLM, says there are two archetypes many people use that are almost always wrong: \"They are the kind of lone genius coming up with a brilliant idea, and having that idea in a moment of sudden inspiration,\" he said. \"That is almost never the case.",
      "\"Edison gave a lot of credit to the crew,\" Johnson said. \"He has a famous line where he's like, 'I'm not so much a generator of ideas as I am a sponge.'\"",
      "Edison called Menlo Park \"the invention factory.\" He employed engineers, chemists, glassblowers, and mathematicians. Johnson said, \"He came up with this idea that if you got these interesting people together and put them in the same room together, that you could create a kind of a factory for new ideas. And that's what Menlo Park became.\"",
      "The pioneering spirit",
      "Today, Americans come up with more inventions than ever. Over the years, hundreds of entrepreneurs have appeared on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" where they pitch a panel of potential investors, including real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran, Kind Bar founder Daniel Lubetzky, fashion pioneer Daymond John, and venture capitalist Rashaun Williams.",
      "\"They think their idea is always terrific,\" said Corcoran. \"It very often isn't. Anybody could come up with an idea, and everybody has at least a dozen. Really, everybody's got an idea, But building a business? Not many people can do it.\"",
      "She says most people coming into \"Shark Tank\" appreciate that the hard part is still ahead. But Lubetzky responded, \"It's not necessarily bad that entrepreneurs don't know how hard it will be.\"",
      "\"I would've never done what I've done, never,\" said John.",
      "Asked what it is about America that fosters such ingenuity, John replied, \"I think the people that founded the country went against all odds to come here. So, we got the cream of the crop of the world.\"",
      "Lubetzky added, \"You see also the pioneering spirit of all the immigrants and all the people that tried things out, and bring that spirit of risk-taking.\"",
      "\"And they bring that spirit on,\" said John. \"And then you have the top people around the world who left for either famine, atrocities, whatever, they made it over here, and they had a goal to make it over here. So they, first if all, are 1% of where they're from.\"",
      "Williams said, \"I think we have to give this government a lot of credit, too. A lot of the original venture capital funds were funded by government entities.\"",
      "Lubetzky said America's financial ecosystem \"allows ideas to be financed. Venture capital is much, much less developed in most other countries.\"",
      "And, Williams said, \"We also glamorize the successful entrepreneur in this country, just like we glamorize the professional athlete or entertainer. If you start a company and you sell it for $1 billion and you scale it, you're on the cover of every magazine. You're a superstar in this country.\"",
      "And, as for failure, Lubetzky said, \"In most of the world, if you fail, it's a negative mark on your family. And you are, you know -- it's horrible. You're an outcast. In the United States, you shrug it off and you try again.\"",
      "Corcoran said, \"The real question is, what do the successful entrepreneurs have in common? And I say what they have in common is the ability to get back up, take rejection.\"",
      "\"A pretty powerful combination\"",
      "According to Google's Steven Johnson, history is periodically upended by huge, foundational, technological breakthroughs.",
      "\"Edison realized that for the light bulb to work, he had to build an electrical grid,\" he said. \"But it was the grid that really changed everything, because once you had power to your homes, yeah, you could turn on a light, but you could also build a dishwasher, and you could have a television, and you could have a radio.\"",
      "The personal computer launched another huge round of innovation, and then the internet, and now artificial intelligence. All of it \u2026 invented in America.",
      "Johnson said, \"Openness to new ideas, willingness for consumers to experiment, that mix of a capitalist model with venture capital, [plus] government support and academic support, you put all those things together, and it's a pretty powerful combination.\"",

    "story": [
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it has opened an investigation into nearly 2.9 million Tesla vehicles after reports of traffic safety violations linked to the electric car maker's Full Self-Driving system, according to a\u00a0filing on the government regulator's website.",
      "The probe by the agency's Office of Defects Investigation involves Tesla vehicles equipped with \"FSD (Supervised)\" and \"FSD (Beta)\" versions of the the company's self-driving systems. Both require \"a fully attentive driver who is engaged in the driving task at all times,\" NHTSA said in a document filed as part of the probe.",
      "Reports of traffic violations include vehicles operating with FSD driving through red tra\ufb03c signals and initiating lane changes into opposing tra\ufb03c.",
      "NHTSA has received reports of 58 safety violations linked to Tesla vehicles with FSD. Those incidents include more than a dozen crashes and fires, along with 23 injuries, according to the agency.",
      "U.S. regulators have  been investigating Tesla's automated driving systems for more than three years because of dozens of crashes that raised safety concerns, such as\u00a0a Seattle-area Tesla crash\u00a0in 2024 involving Full Self-Driving that killed a motorcyclist.",
      "\"The ultimate question is, 'Does the software work?'\" asked Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst with a \"sell\" rating on Tesla shares stock.",
      "Such problems have led lawmakers and safety regulators to question whether Tesla's automated system and other like it will ever be able to operate safely on a widespread scale. A new law in California that would hold driverless car companies accountable for traffic violations is set to\u00a0take effect next year.",
      "Tesla is also under investigation by NHTSA for a \"summon\" technology that allows drivers to tell their cars to drive to their location to pick them up, a feature that has reportedly led to some fender benders in parking lots. A probe into driver-assistance features in 2.4 million Teslas was opened last year after several crashes in fog and other low-visibility conditions, including one in which a pedestrian was killed.",
      "Another investigation was launched by NHTSA in August looking into why Tesla allegedly has not been reporting crashes promptly to the agency as required by its rules.",
      "CEO Elon Musk is under pressure to show that the latest advances in its driver-assistance features have not fixed such problems. He recently promised to put hundreds of thousands of such self-driving Tesla cars and Tesla robotaxis on roads by the end of the next year.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court is considering whether Louisiana's intentional creation of a second majority-Black district violates the 14th and 15th Amendments.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday is considering for the second time a long-running legal fight over Louisiana's congressional map, a case that could have significant ramifications not just for political representation in the state, but also for its potential to weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.",
      "At issue in the case is whether state lawmakers' intentional drawing of a second majority-minority district \u2014 undertaken to remedy a likely violation of Section 2 \u2014 runs afoul of the 14th and 15th Amendments of the Constitution.",
      "The high court initially heard arguments in March\u00a0over whether to leave in place the House district lines re-drawn in 2024 to include a second majority-Black district. But the justices did not issue a decision in the case and instead scheduled it for re-argument in its new term, which began last week.",
      "The case originally focused on a more narrow set of issues about the map, but in August, the Supreme Court asked Louisiana officials and voters involved in the challenge to address whether race-based redistricting comports with the Constitution.",
      "That new question upped the stakes of the case, as Republicans in Louisiana urge the Supreme Court to forbid the consideration of race in the drawing of voting lines. A decision in the state's favor could upend Section 2 and deal another blow to the landmark voting rights law more than 10 years after the Supreme Court gutted one of its key provisions.",
      "The legal fight over Louisiana's congressional map dates back to 2022, when GOP lawmakers in the state drew new House district lines after the 2020 Census. That map consisted of five majority-White districts and one majority-Black district. Nearly one-third of Louisiana's population is Black, according to Census data.",
      "A group of African American voters challenged the map as a violation of Section 2 because it diluted Black voting strength, they argued. A judge in Baton Rouge agreed, finding the map deprived Black voters of the chance to elect their preferred candidate, and she ordered the state to put a remedial map in place with a second majority-minority congressional district.",
      "The new plan adopted by the Louisiana legislature in 2024 reconfigured the state's 6th Congressional District, which state lawmakers said was in an effort to bring it into compliance with the Voting Rights Act. The new District 6 has a Black voting-age population of roughly 51% and stretches across the state from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge, in the southeast. Congressman Cleo Fields, a Democrat who is Black, was elected to represent the district last November.",
      "State lawmakers said they had a political goal in mind, too, when recrafting the voting boundaries: to protect key Republican incumbents in the House, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow, who sits on the powerful Appropriations panel.",
      "But after the new map was adopted, a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-American\" voters challenged the boundaries, alleging the new District 6 was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. A divided panel of three judges in Shreveport sided with the voters and found that the state legislature relied too much on race when it crafted the new map.",
      "The case landed before the Supreme Court in its last term, and Louisiana Republicans joined with Black voters and voting rights groups in urging the justices to leave the new congressional map in place. But with the case set to be reargued, and the focus now on the constitutionality of race-based redistricting, state GOP lawmakers are no longer defending their district lines.",
      "Instead, state officials are arguing that the there should be \"zero tolerance for any consideration of race.\"",
      "\"[R]ace-based redistricting mandated by Section 2 is unconstitutional because it violates basic equal protection principles: It uses race as a stereotype, uses race as a negative, and has no logical end point,\" Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill, a Republican, and Solicitor General Benjamin Aguinaga wrote in a\u00a0filing. \"Accordingly, Section 2 is unconstitutional insofar as it requires race-based redistricting. \"",
      "The Trump administration is backing Louisiana and the \"non-African-American\" voters in the case and has urged the Supreme Court to tighten the standards for proving unlawful vote dilution under Section 2. The framework in place since 1986 requires plaintiffs to show racial polarization in voting, in addition to other preconditions.",
      "\"Too often, Section 2 is deployed as a form of electoral race-based affirmative action to undo a State's constitutional pursuit of political ends. That misuse of Section 2 is unconstitutional,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing.",
      "But lawyers for the voters who challenged the initial district lines, which were then redrawn to include a second majority-Black district, argue the new map largely prioritized Republicans' political goals of protecting key incumbents. Any consideration of race, they said, was limited and driven by a compelling interest in addressing a violation of the Voting Rights Act.",
      "\"[T]he notion that the sun has set on the need for race-conscious remedial redistricting for identified instances of racial vote dilution is contrary to both the fact of ongoing discrimination in Louisiana and the text and purpose of [Section 2] as it was amended in 1982 and has been consistently interpreted by this Court ever since,\" lawyers for the Black Louisianans wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that removing Section 2's protections for minority voters in Louisiana \"will not end discrimination there or lead to a race-blind society, but it may well lead to a severe decrease in minority representation at all levels of government in many parts of the country.\"",
      "Without the provision, \"jurisdictions could simply eliminate minority opportunity districts even where they remain necessary for voters of color to have any opportunity to elect candidates of choice, wiping out minority representation and re-segregating legislatures, city councils, and school boards \u2014 as some have recently attempted to do,\" lawyers wrote.",
      "The Supreme Court is re-hearing the case involving Louisiana's map just over two years after it upheld Section 2 and reaffirmed the framework for proving vote dilution set out in the 1986 ruling. The high court split 5-4 in that 2023 case, which involved a challenge to Alabama's congressional map, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joining the three liberal justices in the majority.",
      "While the high court rejected the chance to weaken Section 2, Kavanaugh suggested that there must be an end point for the use of race-based remedies. He wrote in a concurring opinion that \"the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.\"",
      "During Wednesday's arguments, Kavanaugh said the Court has said race-based remedies are permissible, sometimes for a long period of time, but they should not be indefinite and should have an end point, and he asked when that should be.",
      "NAACP Legal Defense Fund president Janai Nelson, who is arguing for the group of Black voters, said there's no precedent to suggest that a statute must dissolve on its own because race is part of the remedy. And she argued that the nondiscrimination element of the 15th Amendment is \"a permanent right, and so should be the protection that Section 2 affords.\"",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson suggested that Nelson was saying that Section 2 is itself not a remedy that should have an end point, but was instead more of a mechanism \u2014 a kind of \"check-in\" on \"where we might need to do work.\" She compared it to a \"tape measure\" that \"doesn't need a life cycle.\" Nelson agreed and noted that Section 2 cases have fallen in the last decade.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito asked Nelson about the differences between racial voting and partisan voting. If drawing districts to protect incumbents is reasonable, isn't seeking partisan advantage something that legislatures can seek?",
      "No, Nelson replied, not under the 14th and 15th Amendments. Redistricting on a partisan basis, she said can't come \"at the cost of the equal protection principle.\"",
      "He suggested that racially polarized voting could easily be identified through statistical analysis, that it could be seen whether White Democrats vote for Black Democrats at a lower rate, for instance.",
      "Nelson told him that White Democrats were not voting for Black candidates \u2014 whether they were Democrats or not. She said there was no question that even if there is some correlation, that race was the driving factor.",
      "Both Kavanaugh and Roberts will be key as the Supreme Court weighs the constitutionality of race-based map-making. The two justices also voted to outlaw the use of race as a factor in college admissions, a decision that came down in the same term as the Alabama voting rights dispute.",
      "Roberts, in particular, has long denounced racial classifications. In a 2006 concurring opinion, the chief justice wrote, \"it is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.\" He also authored the 2013 majority opinion that dismantled Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, writing, \"our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\"",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June or early July."

      "The Coast Guard said it has intercepted 34 ships and taken 86 people into custody. The agency has seized an average of 1,600 pounds of cocaine a day, it said. Photos in a news release show multiple seizures, including one that ended with bales of cocaine in the ocean.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S. government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after President Trump and congressional Republicans at odds with Democrats over the path forward were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Mr. Trump had said Sunday that a shutdown was likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

The GOP, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, took control of the House for the first time in 40 years in 1995 in what would be remembered as the \"Republican Revolution.\"",
      "The GOP-led Congress passed a short-term continuing resolution that sought to boost Medicare premiums and required the president to balance the budget within seven years, among other measures. But Clinton vetoed the legislation, which led to a shutdown.",

      "The issue was which agency's budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget, the White House should use to show that the budget was balanced within seven years. In the end, Republicans backed down: then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole indicated in a floor speech on New Year's Eve that \"we ought to end this.

The GOP-led House passed two spending bills, one of which would've delayed implementation of Obamacare, which were both rejected by the Democratic-led Senate.",
      "Obama called for a spending bill with no conditions attached, but Republicans ultimately opted to shut down the government over their opposition to the landmark health care law.",

      "The White House, however, said it would not engage in negotiations over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which extended legal protections for Dreamers, while the government was shut down.",
      "In the end, Democrats relented after Republicans pledged to work toward a deal addressing DACA, and Trump signed a short-term funding bill that reopened the government.",

      "What happened:\u00a0Months later, immigration was again at the center of the government funding fight, though this shutdown involved Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "As the shutdown stretched to become the longest in history and Democrats took control of the House, the former president ended up signing a bill to reopen agencies for three weeks and did not include money for the border wall. Weeks later, Congress averted another shutdown by passing a measure that included $1.375 billion for the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump requested."

    "published": "Wed, 15 Oct 2025 09:03:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Despite delays at some airports caused by staff shortages, government officials and aviation experts say flying is safe.",
    "story": [
      "The shortage of air traffic controllers at some airports during the U.S. government shutdown may have travelers wondering if they have anything to worry about as they board their flight.",
      "Flight delays\u00a0in some parts of the U.S. have ticked up since federal funding lapsed on Oct. 1, even as controllers, Transportation Security Administration officers and other air safety personnel are required to work without pay. Previous shutdowns have resulted in a spike in TSA officers and air traffic controllers calling out sick from work, contributing to delays and flight cancellations.",
      "Despite such inconveniences, aviation experts are confident that air travel remains safe. \"There is no slacking. FAA safety standards don't go on hiatus just because the government is shut down,\" Henry Harteveldt, founder and president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel advisory firm, told CBS News.",
      "Flight delays due FAA staffing issues are rising because the agency is taking steps to ensure air travel remains as safe as before the shutdown, said Katy Nastro, an air travel expert at trip booking site Going.com.",
      "\"People should feel comfort that traffic is slowing, and ground delays are being put into place as an extra layer of safety, as a precautionary measure,\" she said. \"It shouldn't raise a red flag in any way.\"",
      "The bigger question for travelers, Nastro added, is \"What is your tolerance in terms of facing delays and such?\"",
      "Despite several aircraft collisions and some close calls this year, research shows that airline travel has become safer in recent years. The risk of a fatality from commercial air travel was 1 in every 13.7 million passenger boardings globally from 2018 to 2022, according to a 2024 MIT\u00a0study. That compares with 1 fatality for every in 7.9 million worldwide boardings from 2008 to 2017.",
      "\"We slow it down\"",
      "On Monday, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy addressed potential safety concerns during the shutdown on Fox Business News. \"We want to make sure that when you travel you travel safely, and so if we don't have controllers necessary to keep you safe, we slow it down,\" he told the network.",
      "He also alluded to the air traffic control staffing issues and highlighted the wider impact of just a few people not showing up for work. \"If you have a few controllers that call in sick, it will ricochet through the airspace, and we have delays because we are not overstaffed,\" he said, adding that controllers are \"incredibly frustrated\" by the shutdown.",
      "Sheldon Jacobson, an aviation security expert and professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said flight delays stemming from controller shortages are inconvenient, but do not point to a safety risk for travelers.",
      "\"I don't think safety is being compromised, but service is definitely being compromised,\" Jacobson told CBS News.",
      "Still, Laura Einsetler, a captain for a U.S. airline, worries that a prolonged government shutdown could eventually affect the performance of air traffic controllers as they work without pay.",
      "\"How long can they go until they are distracted with stress about how they're going to pay for rent, their mortgage or put food on table for their families?\" she told CBS News. \"The more they don't get paid, the more distractions there are, and that raises the safety threat from a performance point of view.\"",
      "Trusting pilots",
      "Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, said some anxiety around hopping on a plane during the government shutdown is understandable. \"A lot of us have an innate fear of being 30,000 feet above the ground, so any justification we can find for why flying might be more risky now is understandable,\" he said.",
      "But he emphasized that pilots have final say on whether it is unsafe to fly for whatever reason, including poor weather, mechanical problems or staffing shortages.",
      "\"They are entrusted to give that last line of authority and say things are safe to fly, and they are in constant communication with air traffic control, monitoring weather systems, and what the entire flying environment looks like,\" Keyes said.",
      "\"The risk of delays and cancellations is higher today than it was before, but I don't think that translates into a higher risk of safety accidents,\" he added.",
      "Harteveldt agreed that airline pilots \u2014 who aren't federal employees \u2014 wouldn't take off given any safety concerns.",
      "\"When a plane departs the gate, it's the airline pilot inspecting the plane and saying, 'Yes, this plane is clear to go.' FAA inspectors, or the shutdown, have nothing to do with that,\" he said.",
      "Airlines for America, a lobbying group representing major airlines, last week sought to reassure the public that flying during the shutdown is safe, while acknowledging that control tower staffing shortages could lead to delays.",
      "\"It is safe to fly, but ATC staffing shortages strain the system and cause flights to be spaced out, slowing down everything. In some cases, flights may be delayed or even cancelled,\" the group said in a statement. \"The bottom line is that anyone heading to the airport right now is encouraged to pack their patience.\""

      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",

    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays during the U.S. government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email."

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-2025-does-congress-get-paid/",
    "published": "Wed, 15 Oct 2025 09:01:23 -0400",
    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change."

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-2025-what-happens/",
    "published": "Wed, 15 Oct 2025 09:00:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Much of the federal government shut down after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich."

      "A day after Kirk was killed on a Utah college campus, a top State Department official vowed to take \"appropriate action\" against any visa-holders who praise or make light of Kirk's death \u2014 and invited people to send in any concerning posts that they see.",
      "Days later, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, \"visa revocations are under way.\"",
      "Kirk was shot and killed on Sept. 10 while speaking to students at Utah Valley University for an event put on by Turning Point USA, a group he co-founded. Authorities said the gunman shot Kirk using a rifle from the roof of a nearby campus building.",
      "Following a two-day manhunt, a 22-year-old Utah man identified as Tyler Robinson was arrested in the killing. State prosecutors have charged Robinson with aggravated murder.",
      "The revocations are part of a wider crackdown on comments that mock or celebrate Kirk's death. The Pentagon and the Secret Service have sidelined service members or agents who wrote negative social media posts about Kirk, and Vice President JD Vance has encouraged people to call the employers of anybody who celebrates Kirk's killing.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to revoke visas in other circumstances, too. It is pushing to deport several international students who are linked to campus protests against Israel's war in the Gaza Strip, accusing them of antisemitic rhetoric \u2014 which the students have denied. And it revoked Colombian President Gustavo Petro's visa last month for encouraging U.S. troops to disobey President Trump's orders during a protest in New York.",
      "The government's legal power to deny or revoke visas on speech grounds is an unresolved question, Eugene Volokh, a UCLA professor emeritus of law who has written extensively about the First Amendment, told CBS News last month. The Supreme Court has ruled that the government has broad latitude to refuse to admit people into the country, but whether federal officials can deport people who are already in the U.S. due to their speech is less clear.",
      "Volokh said noncitizens \"have the same First Amendment protections against, say, criminal punishment or civil liability as citizens do.\"",
      "\"But when it comes to the question of deportation or exclusion from the country in the first place, the rules turn out to be unsettled,\" he said."

      "That's because new content settings for Instagram users under 18 will adhere to the same regulations. The new automatic protections are being rolled by the company starting Tuesday and will be fully implemented by the end of the year, according to Meta.",
      "\"We hope this update reassures parents that we're working to show teens safe, age-appropriate content on Instagram by default, while also giving them more ways to shape their teen's experience,\" the company said in the announcement.",
      "PG-13, a rating used in the media industry, indicates that parental guidance is suggested when watching content, particularly for children under 13.",
      "What are the new restrictions?",
      "The accounts of Instagram users under 18 will now be automatically be placed under a 13+ setting. Opting out of the setting will require parental permission.",
      "Teens with the setting will be blocked from seeing search results for terms like \"alcohol\" or \"gore.\" This adds to list of search topics from which Meta said it already shields teens, such as suicide, self-harm and eating disorders.",
      "Teens will also be prevented from following accounts that regularly posts content deemed age-inappropriate. Instagram users under 18 who already follow such accounts, will no longer be able to see or interact with their content, send them DMs, or see their comments under anyone's posts.",

      "\"It is a very unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0wrote\u00a0on social media at the time.",

      "If recently imposed and future tariffs have the same impact on domestic prices as the U.S. levies applied earlier this year, then consumers would eventually absorb about 55% of the added costs, Goldman Sachs estimated in an analysis this week. U.S. businesses would swallow 22% of the extra costs, while foreign exporters would absorb 18% of the expenses, economists with the investment bank said.",
      "President Trump has said higher import duties will restore fairness in global trade, energize American manufacturing and raise federal revenue.

      "\"The president and administration's position has always been clear: While Americans may face a transition period from tariffs upending a broken status quo that has put America last, the cost of tariffs will ultimately be borne by foreign exporters,\" Desai said in a statement. \"Companies are already shifting and diversifying their supply chains in response to tariffs, including by onshoring production to the United States.\"",
      "The Trump administration's tariffs have so far proved less disruptive than expected, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday, though the full impact of those policies may not be felt for some time. While the U.S. and world economies have fared better than expected, it's too soon to say they are fully in the clear, the organization said.",

Recent inflation data showed that prices for living room, kitchen and dining room furniture \u2014 much of which is imported \u2014 rose 9.5% from August 2024 to August 2025, driven by country-based U.S. tariffs, according to economists.",

      "Asked about those realities, Netanyahu told CBS News that his government had agreed \"to give peace a chance.\"",
      "He noted that the conditions of Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan \"are very clear \u2014 it's not only that we get the hostages out without getting our military out, but that we would subsequently have both demilitarization and disarmament. They're not the same thing. First Hamas has to give up its arms. And second, you want to make sure that there are no weapons factories inside Gaza. There's no smuggling of weapons into Gaza.",

      "Netanyahu: Hamas must disarm or \"all hell breaks loose\"",
      "\"We also agreed: Okay, let's get the first part done. Now let's give a chance to do the second part peacefully, which is my hope.\"",
      "Netanyahu, in his wide-ranging interview with Dokoupil, said it was \"always the responsibility of the leader of the Jewish state to make sure that the Jewish state is never imperiled with its very existence.\"",
      "In a U.S. poll conducted by the Pew Research Center in late September, only 35% of the respondents voiced a positive opinion of Israel's government, down from 47% in 2022, before the war started. The survey also revealed a significant age gap in American support for the Trump administration's provision of robust military aid to Israel amid the war, with those 65 and older being more than twice as likely as those under 30 (34% vs. 13%) to say the U.S. was providing \"about the right amount of aid to Israel.\"",
      "Dokoupil asked Netanyahu whether it would be possible to fix such perceptions, and how.",
      "\"I think so,\" the Israeli leader said. \"I think the first fix is to finish the war as speedily as possible \u2014 something that I have sought to do against all this contrarian propaganda. Of course I want to end the war. Who wants it to continue? You know, I've been to war myself, I've been in battles \u2026 you have to be crazy to want wars to prolong.\"",
      "There are many challenges to meeting even that initial goal, as Hamas has thus far refused to completely disarm, the remains of at least 20 deceased Israeli hostages have yet to be returned, and Israel said Wednesday that it would limit the amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza \u2014 holding up key aspects of the first phase of Mr. Trump's peace deal.",
      "But what comes next is just as unclear.",
      "Who will govern Gaza?",
      "Dokoupil asked Netanyahu a question that Mr. Trump's peace plan answered only vaguely: Who is going to govern Gaza if and when the war does end?",
      "\"The only names mentioned are Donald Trump and Tony Blair. Is Tony Blair going to be the president of Gaza?\" asked Dokoupil, referring to the former British leader tapped by Mr. Trump to sit on a transitional \"peace board\" to help administer the enclave and its roughly 2 million inhabitants.",
      "\"I doubt it,\" replied Netanyahu. \"But I think that this is a transitional period and we want to fashion, you know, a governance that works \u2014 that is not made of people who are committed to our destruction. Because if we \u2026 if we put them there, then we just repeat it again and again and again. And we don't want to have the October 7th massacre repeated.\"",
      "Netanyahu acknowledged that while many Gazans, including young men who've endured two years of brutal warfare, may want to continue fighting against Israel, \"Gaza is not uniform.\"",
      "\"There are Gazans who are fighting Hamas and are saying, 'we don't want this anymore' \u2026 a lot of people in Gaza now know that Hamas has brought catastrophic consequences to them because of its fanaticism.\"",
      "\"The most important thing in destroying fanaticism is to destroy a certain hope,\" said Netanyahu. \"The hope that the fanaticism will achieve its results. When people know Israel is here to stay, they're not going to destroy the Jewish state.\"",
      "How best to achieve that ambition remains a topic of intense debate, however.",
      "Netanyahu on the prospect of a two-state solution",
      "The United Nations and many world leaders have long insisted that the only way to secure a lasting peace in the Middle East is to give the Palestinian people something they have not had since the creation of the modern state of Israel almost eight decades ago: An independent state of their own.",
      "Global\u00a0pressure has been building on Israel to accept the creation of a Palestinian state along its borders, a concept long referred to as the two-state solution.",
      "But in recent years, Netanyahu's government has rejected the notion \u2014 and the Trump administration has decisively dropped the U.S. government's long-standing calls for Palestinian statehood.",
      "\"When I talked about it, it wasn't the proposition that people give now,\" Netanyahu told Dokoupil on Tuesday. \"I assume, okay, they're two sovereign states and a sovereign state has, for example, military power, it can make covenants \u2026 The Palestinians should have all the powers in a peaceful day to govern themselves, but they can't have the powers to threaten our survival. That sovereign power of security must remain with Israel.\"",
      "\"Otherwise, the jihadists take over,\" said Netanyahu. \"Iran takes over immediately. And that's what happened every time we vacated territory \u2014 the most extreme fanatics came in.\"",
      "He accepted that ceding some territory to Palestinian authorities, as Israel did in Gaza, did not equate to creating an independent state, but he said it was \"perfectly aligned with the reality\" of circumstances on the ground.",
      "\"It's a reality that if you had Palestinian governance that stopped teaching their kids to destroy the state of Israel \u2026 obviously, if you have that, and they educate them for peace, then I think you can have a different reality,\" said the Israeli leader, adding that it \"could take generations\" to get to that point.",
      "And even if Israel does eventually deem Gaza's leadership and population to be deradicalized, Netanyahu said it would still need to remain \"in control of the military power to prevent our destruction.\""

    "story": [
      "Rome \u2014 Three Italian police officers were killed early Tuesday and more than a dozen others injured when an explosion ripped through a farmhouse near the northern city of Verona, as officers tried to serve an eviction order, officials said.",

      "The farmhouse blew up shortly after dawn as a team of Carabinieri and other law enforcement officers entered the property, which had been illegally occupied for more than a year. According to Italy's state broadcaster RAI and Sky TG24, investigators believe the building was deliberately filled with gas, which ignited when officers opened the front door.",

    "summary": "As Israel and Hamas implement the first phase of a Gaza peace plan, questions remain unanswered over what comes next.",
    "story": [
      "The next phase of the Gaza peace plan brokered by President Trump moved forward significantly on Monday as Hamas released all of the 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, and as more aid started to flow into the Palestinian territory after two years of war.",
      "The steps are crucial parts of President Trump's 20-point peace plan, and they came three days after a ceasefire took effect in Gaza and Israeli troops pulled back to a pre-determined line.",
      "World leaders, including Mr. Trump, met in Egypt on Monday for a summit on the future of Gaza and the broader Middle East.",
      "But the situation remains fragile, with major questions over what comes next still to be answered.",
      "Negotiations over next steps",
      "Israel and Hamas have little trust in each other, and it took a number of failed, indirect negotiations in Doha, Qatar's capital, to get to the truce, with Egypt and Qatar acting as meditators.",
      "The initial phases of the agreement called for: the release of the final hostages held by Hamas, living and dead; the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel; a surge of humanitarian aid to Gaza; and a partial pullback by Israeli forces from Gaza's main cities.",
      "Egypt's foreign minister said on Monday that it was crucial that Israel and Hamas fully implement the first phase of the deal so that the parties can start negotiations on the second phase. As of Monday evening, all living hostages were back in Israel, but the remains of many of the slain captives remained in Gaza.",
      "\"We're very committed to [the peace deal],\" Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani told CBS News on Monday. \"The agreement specifically says 72 hours for when IDF redeploys on the new line ... That is past already, and not all hostages have returned yet, so we understand what we're dealing with.\"",
      "Later phases of the plan will have to address thornier issues such as Gaza's postwar governance, Israel's demand that Hamas disarm, which the group has rejected, and Palestinian demands for a state, which the current Israeli government has rejected.",
      "Negotiations over those issues could break down, and Israel has hinted it may resume military operations if its demands are not met.",
      "President Trump's plan to end the war also stipulates that regional and international partners will work to develop the core of a new Palestinian security force.",
      "Reconstruction will be another major challenge. The World Bank, and a postwar plan proposed by Egypt, estimates that at least $53 billion will be needed to rebuild the shattered Palestinian territory. Egypt plans to host a future reconstruction conference.",
      "Will Hamas disarm?",
      "Among the most difficult issues is Israel's insistence that a weakened Hamas completely disarm. Hamas refuses to do that and wants to ensure Israel pulls its troops completely out of Gaza.",
      "So far, the Israeli military has withdrawn from Gaza City, the southern city of Khan Younis and other areas, but it remains in control of about 53% of the enclave, according to Israeli officials. Troops remain in most of the southern city of Rafah, towns of Gaza's far north, and a wide strip along the length of Gaza's border with Israel.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday that Israel was \"tightening the noose around Hamas from all sides,\" and vowed that Gaza would be demilitarized after the Israeli government approved the peace plan, which it did hours later.",
      "\"Hamas will disarm and Gaza will be demilitarized. If this can be achieved the easy way, all the better; if not, it will be achieved the hard way,\" Netanyahu said, addressing reporters.",
      "Who will govern Gaza?",
      "Israel and Hamas have not agreed on Gaza's postwar governance.",
      "Under the U.S. plan, an international body is supposed to govern the Palestinian territory, overseeing Palestinian technocrats running day-to-day affairs. Hamas and other factions would not have any role in Gaza's governance.",
      "The plan envisions an eventual role for Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas' Palestinian Authority \u2014 something Netanyahu has long opposed. But it requires the authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, to first undergo a sweeping reform program, and it does not provide any timeline for the process.",
      "Hamas has said Gaza's government should be worked out among Palestinians.",
      "The deal also recognizes an independent Palestinian state as, \"the aspiration of the Palestinian people,\" but it's unclear if or when discussions on statehood could take place, and Israel's Netanyahu has repeatedly said he will not allow the creation of a Palestinian state.",
      "International security force",
      "The plan calls for an Arab-led international security force in Gaza, along with Palestinian police trained by Egypt and Jordan. It says Israeli forces will leave additional areas as those forces deploy.",
      "Under the plan, the force would work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with the newly trained Palestinian police forces.",
      "Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said the international force needs a U.N. Security Council resolution to endorse its deployment and mandate as a peacekeeping force.",
      "About 200 U.S. troops are now in Israel to monitor the ceasefire and the early stages of the peace plan. They were expected to carry out that work in conjunction with partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private-sector players."

The United Nations and many independent experts consider the ministry's figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties in Gaza.",

They advocated for military pressure, not an immediate ceasefire or hostage release deal, as the best chance for bringing the hostages home. That stance has put Mor's father at odds with many of the other families of hostages. The Israeli military released a photo on Monday showing Eitan Mor beaming in an embrace with his parents.",

A talented pianist, his family has placed pianos across Israel and several sites around the world to raise awareness of his plight. Three other hostages who had been held with Ohel for more than a year were released during the previous ceasefire, including Eli Sharabi, who said Ohel was like his adopted son. Sharabi said they were kept chained for the entire period of their captivity and subsisted on a moldy pita bread per day. Ohel has shrapnel in his eye from the attack on the bomb shelter and his family is worried he may be partially blind. Eli Sharabi, a hostage who was previously freed, told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" last month that he became a father figure to Ohel in their year-plus together, and when Sharabi found out he was going to be freed, Ohel was not on the list. \"You imagine this moment hundreds of times,\" Sharabi said. \"And you believe it's going to be the happiest moment ever. And because of Alon, this moment become very complicated. He had small panic attack. He started to cry and shaking. So, we took water, washed his face, hugging him. It wasn't easy.\"",

Later videos of Braslavski and fellow hostage Evyatar David digging their own graves horrified Israelis, sparking some of the largest attendance in months at weekly protests.

This year, his mother, Viki Cohen, illustrated a Passover haggadah, the text laying out the rituals and story recited during the Passover holiday, in honor of hostages, partly because her family stopped celebrating holidays after the attack. \"We don't gather as a family, because it reminds us how much he is missing,\" Cohen said. The only time the extended family would gather is at protests, she said. \"The best thing about my son is that he's my son,\" his father, Yehuda Cohen, told CBS News last week. \"He's a normal boy like every other boy.

In early February, terrorists filmed the emotional interaction between the brothers as they were told that Iair would be released and Eitan would stay in Gaza. Since his release, Iair Horn has campaigned for his brother and the other hostages, flying frequently to the United States and meeting with politicians.",

Before the attack, he worked at his family's bakery in Dimona, in southern Israel.

Kalfon's family received a sign of life from him after the last ceasefire, when some of the hostages said they were held with him for months.

Witnesses said Kupershtein stayed at the festival to try to provide first aid to people who had been shot and injured. Kupershtein was the main financial support for his family after his father was severely injured in an accident several years ago, his aunt, Ora Rubinstein, told reporters. She said that his father worked with a physical therapist to regain the ability to speak, so he could meet with politicians to advocate for his son's release. He has told the family that he would walk again when his son came home, she said.",

      "Avinatan Or was kidnapped from the Nova music festival along with his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, who was rescued by Israeli forces in June 2024. On Oct. 7, Hamas released a video of the pair that has become one of the most well-known videos from that day. It showed Argamani on an all-terrain vehicle crying, \"Don't kill me!\" and reaching out her arms to Or, who is being marched away from her by terrorists. Or worked in tech in Tel Aviv before his abduction.",

      "Matan Zangauker was kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz along with his girlfriend, Ilana Gritzewsky. The two met while working on a medical cannabis farm there. Gritzewsky was released after 55 days and has since advocated tirelessly for his release, wearing a hat of Zangauker's she rescued from their burned home. His mother, Einav, has been a constant presence at protests, giving impassioned speeches and even being hoisted in a cage above the crowd to draw attention to the hostages' plight. Zangauker, who said she was previously a Netanyahu supporter, has emerged as one of his harshest critics.",
      "Two hostages determined to be dead on Monday",
      "Bipin Joshi, 24",
      "Bipin Joshi arrived in Israel from his native Nepal a month before the attack. He was the only non-Israeli hostage believed to be alive in Gaza. He came to Israel on a student exchange to work and study agriculture at kibbutz Alumim on the Gaza border. Ten of the 17 Nepali students in the program were killed during the attack. Joshi, who was able to throw a number of live grenades out of the bomb shelter where they were hiding, was injured and kidnapped. Joshi's sister, 17-year-old Pushpa Joshi, regularly travels eight hours one way on buses to Kathmandu from her home in western Nepal to lobby to secure her brother's release. In August, his family traveled to Israel to meet with President Isaac Herzog and join families demonstrating in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square. Last week, Joshi's family released footage of him in captivity filmed under duress from around November 2023.",

      "Tamir Nimrodi was taken from Erez, a crossing on the northern border of Gaza that had been the main route for people entering and leaving the territory. He had been serving with the Israeli defense body overseeing humanitarian aid in Gaza. Nimrodi was taken with two other soldiers by terrorists who walked them to the Gaza gate and forced them to cross. Israel confirmed the deaths of the two soldiers who were taken with Nimrodi. There had been no sign of life from Nimrodi in the two years since he was seen in footage walking into Gaza in shorts and a T-shirt without his glasses. Herut Nimrodi, his mother, said she didn't know what was worse: to think he had been killed in captivity, or that he was alive but being held in terrible conditions. \"I'm scared to even imagine,\" she said."

      "\"I had been very scared when I did not know what was happening to me, because I had no sense of whether tremendous pain was forthcoming,\" Curry wrote. \"But if death comes for me peacefully and I fade gently from light into dark oblivion, why would I be afraid of it? Sometimes, I rather think it would be a comfort.\"",
      "\"I can say that now, because it\u2019s been over a dozen years, which is a sufficient amount of time to be able to reflect back calmly, and perhaps with a healthy dose of disassociation,\" he wrote. \"At the time, if I\u2019m being honest, I was just astonished to be lying there.\"",

      "\"I don't know when the paralysis set in; initially it just felt very strange that the left side of my body had gone numb,\" Curry said.",
      "He wrote that he was transferred two days later to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where his longtime personal assistant and publicist Marcia Hurwitz helped him be admitted under an alias to protect his identity and prevent his stroke from being made public.",
      "\"After regaining consciousness, I could comprehend words but they did not register or settle without effort. Life was exceedingly dull, monotonous, and uncertain for a long while, Curry wrote. \"I was aware of where I was, but it took me a while to fully accept what had happened, as I imagine is the case with many people getting over a stroke and brain surgery.\"",
      "\"My skull had been smashed in to save my life,\" he continued. \"That\u2019s plenty to process. I needed the rest and slept a lot.\"",
      "Curry wrote that he spent months at the hospital before eventually entering a rehabilitation center \"where the real exercises began: to retrieve my ability to speak clearly, to work on smiling and facial expressions, and to try using my hand and adapting to my new normal.\"",
      "\"I was living in a fog. I looked frightful, and I couldn\u2019t speak clearly for ages. That part was exceptionally frustrating, because thoughts were forming again, but articulating them was such a monumental stretch,\" he recalled. \"I felt like there was a massive gulf between my mind and what emerged from my mouth.\"",
      "\"Half sentences here or there would make it, but it took a while \u2014 which amounted to a whole lot of time dwelling in my own head,\" Curry continued. \"Being unable to string together and clearly deliver a sentence was absolute misery for somebody who values words and conversation as much as I do.\"",

      "\"I try to avoid complaining too much. (I prefer doing it just enough.) But I do have the material: as I write this I\u2019m confined to a wheelchair, having never managed to walk again,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Even so, whining is a f---ing bore for everybody involved\u2014and it\u2019s highly unproductive,\" Curry continued. \"I\u2019d rather spend my time focusing on other things.\"",
      "\"The different ways that people cope with pain is quite interesting,\" he added. \"I do not consider it an act of tremendous courage or bravery that I resort to humor in moments of great discomfort. It\u2019s just my go-to. I am sure it\u2019s partially a survival skill I developed a very long time ago, to the extent that humor can be developed.\"",

      "\"That, particularly, was so soul-crushing to me, to see first off, how uncomfortable John was in an interview, and it was because, deep down, he knew, 'They're going to ask about my weight,'\" he explained. \"And you go, 'Well, why is that a big deal?' Well, when you see how people asked him about his weight, it all makes sense.\"",

      "Instead of a clump of cells that form a tumor, lobular cancer grows as a long chain of cells, so it shows up as a \"subtle thickness\" on mammograms. This means it can be difficult to spot until it has spread to other parts of the body, according to OSU.",
      "This form of the disease also runs the risk of returning even after 10 years of the patient being cancer-free.",
      "\"We urgently need better tools \u2026 that can predict which patients are truly at high risk.\"",
      "Additionally, about 40% of women over 40 years old have dense breast tissue, according to the Society of Breast Imaging, which can pose a further detection challenge and a higher risk of developing breast cancer.",
      "Although invasive lobular cancer grows, spreads and responds to treatment differently than the more common invasive ductal carcinoma, oncologists still follow the same guidelines for both diseases, according to lead researcher Dr. Arya Roy, breast cancer specialist at OSUCCC \u2013 James.",

      "Roy reiterated how difficult it is to identify lobular breast cancer from imaging.",
      "\"At the same time, it is very hard to identify the patients who are at higher risk of recurrence after treatments,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"So here is where we are using artificial intelligence techniques to identify the patients who are at risk of this cancer coming back.\"",
      "Shown examining a breast scan, Arya Roy, M.D., is researching a form of cancer that\u2019s often missed in regular screenings. She\u2019s using data from actual lobular breast cancer cases to train artificial intelligence to improve early detection. (The Ohio State University)",
      "By combining AI models with digital pathology images, doctors can detect biomarkers and other indicators in high-risk cancer patients. Together with patients\u2019 clinical data, these findings are used to create a scoring system that predicts the likelihood of cancer recurrence over the next decade, the researchers said.",

      "CRs are traditionally used to give congressional negotiators more time to strike a longer-term deal on government spending.

      "\"That\u2019s an important question that we\u2019re all discussing,\" Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., who has served in Congress since 2009, told Fox News Digital. \"It may well be that we\u2019ll need to extend that deadline further in order to make up for the time we\u2019ve lost during the shutdown.\"",
      "However, McClintock said he was more in favor of a new CR after the current measure expires, rather than starting from scratch on a new bill. The Nov. 21 CR passed in the House \u2014 largely along party lines \u2014 on Sept. 19, and most House Republicans have been united in now putting the onus on the Senate.",
      "\"I think we need to pass the CR that\u2019s in the Senate and then assess if we need additional time,\" he said.",
      "Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif., a senior member of the committee tasked with spearheading federal funding talks, also acknowledged that more time could be needed.

      "\"So there is some discussion,\" he said. \"There's a lot of angst about that. We haven't made final determinations yet, because it's first things first, and we're taking it day by day. But I'll tell you, of course, obviously the leadership has to keep a close eye on these things.\"",
      "He distanced himself from the idea of a new CR during a Wednesday press conference, however, telling reporters, \"It would do us no good to pass yet another CR out of the House, because it will meet the same fate. Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats want to close the government down.\"",
      "A new CR could be a potentially bruising political fight for the House and Senate, considering Republicans\u2019 historic aversion to short-term federal funding extensions.",
      "And while Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Senate Republicans remain largely adamant that the House\u2019s bill is the one they want to use, Thune didn\u2019t shut down the idea of changing the date.",
      "\"We keep losing time on the clock, which could be used to do the normal appropriations process,\" he said. \"So, you know, I mean, I think that that's a point of discussion and certainly something I've expressed an opening about.\"",
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., who has been one of a handful of Senate Republicans meeting with Senate Democrats throughout the shutdown, told Fox News Digital that the longer the shutdown goes on, \"It becomes less realistic that we can have a funding bill.\"",
      "\"We'll have to open the government back up, and then I can see a real possibility of us having to extend that date,\" he said.",
      "Others in the Senate GOP appeared more rigid in their thinking, however, and wanted to stick with the original plan.",
      "\"I don't think a new deadline is going to help,\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., told Fox News Digital. \"This is up to the Democrats. We've asked for no conditions, it\u2019s a clean CR.

      "The Supreme Court is rehearing oral arguments Wednesday in a case centered on Louisiana's use of race as a factor when drawing its congressional map \u2014 a closely watched legal fight that some fear could be used to weaken protections under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.",
      "The case, Louisiana v. Callais, was first heard by the high court in March. It focuses on whether Louisiana\u2019s updated 2024 congressional map, which added a second majority-Black district, constitutes an unconstitutional \"racial gerrymander.\" The outcome could shape how states nationwide apply the Voting Rights Act in redistricting battles ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
      "Justices ordered both parties to reappear in court in the fall to take up additional arguments before the case is decided. They also asked parties to submit additional briefs answering whether the state's \"intentional creation\" of the second majority-minority district runs afoul of the 14th and 15th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.",

      "\"If we take Louisiana as one example, every congressional member who is Black was elected from a Voting Rights Act-opportunity district,\" she told the justices. \"We only have the diversity that we see across the south, for example, because of litigation that forced the creation of opportunity districts under the Voting Rights Act.\"",
      "\"Every justice in Louisiana has been elected through a VRA opportunity district, and nearly all legislative representatives have been elected in those same districts. So Louisiana alone is an example of how important it is to have Section 2 continue to be enforced to create these opportunities,\" she continued.",

    "story": [
      "Brent Sadler, a naval warfare and advanced technology expert at the Heritage Foundation, shared what Americans can expect in the Trump administration\u2019s war on the cartels.",
      "As the U.S. unleashes a series of lethal strikes on cartel drug boats and President Donald Trump declared an \"armed conflict\" with the cartels, experts gave insight on what Americans can expect to see next in the \"quasi-war\" taking place at the country\u2019s doorstep.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump announced the U.S. military had carried out another kinetic strike on a suspected drug vessel off the coast of Venezuela, killing six suspected smugglers. This is the fifth of such strikes on a drug boat in the last several weeks and, according to experts, one of the first important steps to decimating the cartels.",
      "The strikes come after the White House sent Congress a memo on Sept. 30 informing them that the U.S. is now participating in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug smugglers. Currently, the U.S. has amassed an impressive collection of naval and air assets stationed around Venezuela, a country whose socialist dictator, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the Trump administration has accused of being in league with cartels.",

      "Speaking with Fox News Digital, Derek Maltz, former acting director of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), called the Trump administration\u2019s moves \"unprecedented action for an unprecedented threat.\"",
      "He explained that, unlike in previous administrations, the second Trump administration has enabled a \"whole of government\" approach to targeting the cartels by designating them as \"foreign terrorist organizations.\" This designation empowers not just agencies like the DEA to take action against the cartels but also the Departments of War, State, Treasury, Justice and others.",
      "\"This is not the same old drug crisis we've been talking about for 50 years. This is something totally different. This is a poisoning crisis and our kids are dying,\" Maltz said, adding, \"The cartels are killing more Americans than any other terrorist organization in the history of this country.\"",
      "In response, Maltz said the president is \"building a powerful force of good, an army of good, to help defeat evil and to actually destroy these adversaries that are killing our citizens at record levels.\"",
      "Maltz said the first step was shutting down the border to stop the flow of fentanyl, meth, cocaine and other drugs, as well as criminal elements into the U.S. overland. This, Maltz explained, pushed the cartels to carry drugs via sea and air routes, which has prompted the Trump administration to crack down on those as well.",

      "\"Based on everything I've heard, the Mexican government is hitting labs very hard, making more arrests than they had\u2026 so they're aggressively going after the cartels. They're removing these really bad guys into America for prosecution.\"",
      "Brent Sadler, a senior research fellow for naval warfare and advanced technology at the Heritage Foundation's Allison Center for National Security, described the conflict with cartels as a type of \"quasi-war\" in which the U.S. is fighting against not only non-state, paramilitary-style cartels but also indirectly against international enemies like Venezuela, Hezbollah and China that have been working with the cartels.",
      "\"The demonstration of willingness to go and kill these cartel members while they're moving their ships full of drugs sends a chilling effect through their support network,\" he explained. \"And when they start losing that ability to pay off their support network, the business model falls apart and they actually start fighting each other; they turn in on each other.\"",

      "\"I would not be surprised if you start to see the military hammer of this or the balance of the military assets shift either to the Pacific. Or if they shift over more to the Central Atlantic to go after these other routes.\"",
      "He predicted that the sea strikes will continue and that if cartels start to shift to rely more on airplanes, Americans may start to see some of those being \"shot out of the sky\" in international airspace.",
      "Eventually, he said the strikes will likely be dialed down along with the scale of U.S. naval vessels in the Caribbean. As this happens, he said, the U.S. will likely both leverage its international partners and enable them to interdict drug vessels as well as sustain U.S. special operations capabilities, helicopters and aircraft operating out of Puerto Rico and other bases nearby, to provide overwatch and the ability to intercept ships.",

      "\"I think we live in a world where people are more unhappy than ever,\" Georgetown University student Elizabeth Oliver said. \"Depression rates and suicide are so high, and people are longing for true happiness. Charlie always talked about how \u2018desires of the flesh\u2019 aren\u2019t fulfilling or making people happy. Instead of pursuing those things, we should turn ourselves toward higher purposes like family, marriage and God, because those are what truly fulfill people\u2019s lives.\"",

      "Americans' happiness has taken a nosedive in recent years, with the U.S. falling eight spots in the 2024 World Happiness Report, which ranks countries' life satisfaction, due to American young adults reporting they are not satisfied compared to their parents' and grandparents' generations.

      "\"We have so many bad philosophies, ideologies, politics,\" Trump said on Fox News following Kirk's death. \"His was basically just good. He talked about family, he talked about getting married, \u2018go get married.' It sounds old-fashioned when you think about it, but he\u2019s right.\"",

      "Oliver is one of those Gen Zers, a college senior and president of the university\u2019s Right to Life group, a pro-life advocacy group. She told Fox News Digital that she believes open dialogue can help renew focus on Christian conservative values.",
      "Kirk \"dedicated his life to talking with other people respectfully and listening to them,\" she said. \"We desperately need more of that dialogue now, more than ever. In a world that has abandoned God and moral values, we have even abandoned the basic respect for other human beings and we need to reclaim it.\"",
      "Kirk often spoke of marriage, children and the importance of family \u2014 with his widow continuing the promotion of those values from the stage of his memorial service in Arizona in September.",
      "\"We have an uplifting message for America, one that is hopeful, one of family formation, one off church attendance going up one of business ownership of entrepreneurship,\" Kirk said on \"The Will Cain Show\" on May 2.",
      "\"Trump voters, young men, they want family, children, and legacy,\" Kirk added on \"The Ingraham Angle\" Sept. 8, only two days before he was killed. \"Young women who voted for Kamala Harris, they want careerism, consumerism, and loneliness. That is a dramatic divide that is going to play out in our politics for the years to come.\"",

      "AI phishing scams are when hackers use AI to make their scams more convincing. AI helps them create super-realistic emails, messages, voices and even videos. This makes it harder for people to tell what\u2019s real and what\u2019s fake.\u00a0Old-school phishing emails were easy to spot because of typos and bad grammar. However, thanks to AI tools like ChatGPT, hackers can now create flawless, professional-sounding emails that are much harder to detect. AI-generated phishing emails aren\u2019t the only threat. Hackers are also using AI to pull off scams like:",

      "Though hackers can use AI tools to write grammatically perfect email copy, AI phishing emails still have some classical red flags. Here are some telltale signs that it is an AI-driven phishing email:",
      "Suspicious sender\u2019s address that doesn\u2019t match the company\u2019s domain.Generic greetings like \"Dear Customer\" instead of your name.Urgent requests pressuring you to act immediately.Unsolicited attachments and links requiring you to take action",

      "The biggest red flag is the sender\u2019s email address. There is often a slight change in the spelling of the email address, or it is an entirely different domain name. For example, a hacker might use an email like xyz@PayPall.com or a personal address from Gmail.com, such as the email below, or Outlook.com while pretending to be from PayPal.",
      "Hackers are using AI to create scams that look frighteningly real. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "It used to be easier to spot phishing emails by noticing silly typos. Thanks to AI, hackers can now craft flawless emails. But you can still sense a phishing email if you analyze the language of the email body copy carefully. The most prominent sign of AI-generated email copy is that it looks highly formal with a dash of failed attempts to be personal. You might not notice it at first, but looking at it closely is likely to give a red flag. The language of such emails is often robotic.",
      "With AI, it is possible to clone voices. So, there is no surprise that there is a steep rise in voice phishing, which is also known as vishing. Recently, a\u00a0father lost $4 billion in Bitcoin to vishing. Though\u00a0AI voice cloning has improved, it\u2019s still flawed. You can spot inconsistencies by verifying the speaker's identity. Ask specific questions that only the real person would know. This can reveal gaps in the scammer's script. The voice, also, at times may sound robotic due to imperfections in voice cloning technology. So the next time, whenever you receive a call that creates a sense of urgency, ask as many questions as you can to verify the identity of the person. You may also consider verifying the claims through the second channel. If the person on the other side of the phone says something, you can get it confirmed by the official email to be on the safer side.",

      "Fox News' Madison Scarpino reports on the successful Falcon 9 launch and mission.",
      "A Los Angeles-based aerospace startup called Inversion Space has unveiled Arc, its first flagship spacecraft designed to deliver supplies from orbit back to Earth in record time. The reusable reentry vehicle can transport up to 500 pounds of mission-critical cargo to nearly any point on the planet in less than an hour. Founders Justin Fiaschetti and Austin Briggs launched the company in 2021 with a bold vision: to build a space-based logistics network. During an event at the company's factory, they described Arc as the next evolution of global delivery, one that starts in orbit, not on the ground.",

      "How the Arc spacecraft delivers cargo from orbit to Earth",
      "Standing about 8 feet tall and 4 feet wide, Arc is roughly the size of a large tabletop. It's a lifting-body vehicle, meaning it can steer as it reenters the atmosphere. Instead of needing a runway, Arc lands safely under parachutes, using non-toxic propellants that make it safe to handle immediately after landing. The spacecraft features a cross-range of approximately 621 miles, allowing it to target wide landing zones. It can stay in orbit for up to five years, ready to return to Earth when needed. That flexibility means the spacecraft could one day drop off medical supplies, drones or military equipment at hard-to-reach locations.",

      "Why Arc's hypersonic speed could change aerospace testing",
      "Beyond rapid delivery, Arc doubles as a hypersonic testing platform. It can reach speeds over Mach 20, endure extreme heat and survive massive g-forces. Those capabilities have caught the attention of U.S. defense agencies, which are eager to improve hypersonic flight testing. Inversion's participation in the Kratos-led MACH-TB 2.0 program highlights the growing military interest in Arc's reusable design. \"Fully reusable and capable of precise landings for rapid recovery, Arc makes hypersonic testing faster, repeatable, and more affordable,\" the company said.",
      "Arc could deliver mission-critical cargo anywhere on Earth in under an hour. (Inversion Space)",
      "What Inversion learned from its first spacecraft, Ray",
      "Before Arc, Inversion launched a smaller demo craft called Ray on SpaceX's Transporter-12 mission. Ray weighed about 200 pounds and successfully tested propulsion, avionics and solar power systems in orbit. Though a short circuit prevented reentry, it provided valuable data that led to Arc's development. Ray's success convinced the company to push forward with full-scale testing. Inversion has already completed dozens of drop tests and built a full-scale Arc prototype. The startup also partnered with NASA to refine the vehicle's thermal protection system for reentry.",

      "Inversion sees Arc as a bridge between space logistics and national defense. The spacecraft could deliver mission-critical cargo to remote, damaged or denied environments where traditional transport would take days. As Fiaschetti put it, the goal is simple: make a difference the moment it lands. By combining maneuverability, reusability and speed, Arc could reshape both emergency response and battlefield supply chains. It's not just about moving packages, it's about delivering readiness.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Oct 2025 14:49:51 -0400",
    "summary": "Comprehensive analysis of Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps examines usability, routing accuracy, data handling and features across the top navigation platforms.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt \u2018CyberGuy\u2019 Knutsson discusses Instagram\u2019s new maps feature and more on \u2018Fox & Friends Weekend.\u2019",
      "Navigation apps have become an essential part of modern life. Whether you are commuting to work, running errands or exploring a new city, relying on accurate directions and real-time traffic updates can make all the difference. Over the past decade, Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps have emerged as the dominant players in this space, each offering a distinct approach to navigation.",
      "While millions of people rely on these apps daily, choosing the right one can depend on a variety of factors, from interface design to privacy policies. In this article, we compare these three apps across usability, accuracy, features and data handling to help you determine which one best fits your needs.",

      "What each app does best",
      "Google Maps is widely regarded as the all-rounder. It combines extensive mapping data with points of interest, public transit information, Street View, Live View AR and detailed business listings. Its versatility makes it a top choice for both daily commuters and travelers.",
      "Google Maps is a great way to explore the world with detailed routes, Street View, and real-time traffic insights. (OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Waze, on the other hand, is designed primarily for drivers. It thrives on community input, offering live updates about traffic jams, road hazards, accidents and even police presence. Since Google owns Waze, many Waze-style real-time alerts have now begun appearing directly inside Google Maps. While Waze still focuses on driving, this integration blurs the lines between the two apps.",
      "Apple Maps\u00a0has made major strides in recent years. Once considered the underdog, it's now a solid choice for iOS users. Its clean interface, privacy-focused design and seamless integration with Siri, CarPlay and Apple Watch make it a convenient pick for those fully in the Apple ecosystem.",
      "INSTAGRAM FRIEND MAP FEATURE SPARKS PRIVACY QUESTIONS",
      "Usability and interface",
      "When it comes to interface, each app approaches design differently.",
      "Google Maps provides a dense but intuitive layout, giving users access to multiple layers of information, including traffic, satellite imagery and public transit routes. Switching between driving, walking, biking and transit is straightforward, and the search functionality is robust, often displaying detailed business profiles, ratings, and hours of operation.",
      "Waze prioritizes active driving support. Its interface is visually bold, with clear alerts for traffic jams, accidents and road hazards submitted by other users. While some may find the screen slightly cluttered, the focus is entirely on driving efficiency, which makes sense given its target audience.",
      "Waze helps to put you on a faster route with live, community-driven alerts that help you dodge traffic jams and road hazards.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Apple Maps offers a minimalist, streamlined interface that emphasizes simplicity. Searching for locations, initiating navigation, and following turn-by-turn instructions is straightforward. The app works seamlessly with iOS features like Siri and CarPlay, providing a smooth and cohesive experience for Apple users.",
      "Navigation accuracy and performance",
      "Accurate routing and timely traffic updates are critical.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0remains the most reliable for precise routing and travel time estimates. It combines AI-enhanced predictive routing with historical and live traffic data to suggest the best route. Its consistency holds strong across urban and rural areas alike.",
      "Waze\u00a0is unmatched for real-time rerouting. Relying heavily on crowd-sourced reports, it often detects slowdowns or hazards before Google Maps does. However, it still struggles when offline or in areas with poor data coverage.",
      "Apple Maps has significantly improved its routing accuracy, especially in cities. Its traffic data is now crowd-sourced from millions of iPhones, processed on-device to protect privacy. In some rural or international regions, though, it can still lag behind Google Maps and Waze.",
      "Apple Maps offers seamless use with your iPhone and CarPlay for smooth and privacy-focused navigation.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Features and ecosystem integration",
      "Beyond basic navigation, each app offers additional tools and integrations.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0offers offline maps, Live View AR navigation, multi-stop routing, EV charger locations and indoor maps for airports and malls. Integration with Gmail, Calendar and Google Assistant creates a seamless travel experience.",
      "Waze\u00a0remains focused on social and driving-specific features. You can report hazards or police sightings and even control Spotify, Audible or podcasts directly from the app without switching screens.",
      "Apple Maps\u00a0leans into privacy and ecosystem benefits. Its \"Look Around\" feature rivals Street View, while EV routing, cycling paths and Siri integration make it ideal for Apple fans. Apple also uses anonymized \"Look Around\" imagery to train its AI models, but with strict privacy safeguards like blurring faces and plates.",
      "YOUR PHONE IS TRACKING YOU EVEN WHEN YOU THINK IT\u2019S NOT",
      "Privacy and data handling",
      "How these apps handle your personal data matters more than ever.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0collects detailed location and usage data to power personalization and advertising. That means better recommendations, but less privacy for users who prefer anonymity.",
      "Waze, also owned by Google, gathers anonymized driving data to enhance community reporting. Its functionality depends on sharing your location in real time, which is necessary for crowd-sourced accuracy.",
      "Apple Maps takes a different approach. It processes most data on-device, uses random identifiers instead of personal accounts and does not associate searches with your Apple ID. That makes it the most privacy-conscious option, though even Apple collects anonymized data for traffic and route improvements.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here:\u00a0CyberGuy.com.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "There is no single \"best\" navigation app, and the right choice depends on your priorities. Google Maps is ideal if you want a feature-packed, versatile app that works well for a variety of transportation modes and travel scenarios. Its global coverage and rich data make it reliable for everyday use and exploration. Waze is best if your main concern is real-time driving efficiency. Its community-driven traffic alerts and dynamic rerouting help you avoid congestion and save time during daily commutes. Apple Maps suits users deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem who value simplicity, clean design and privacy protections. It may not have as many features as Google Maps or the same real-time edge as Waze, but its seamless integration with iOS makes it convenient.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt \u2018The Cyberguy\u2019 Knutsson explains how to keep your Windows computer safe and security risks of online retail giant Temu.",
      "We spend so much time online that how we connect to the internet has become almost as important as the devices we use. Most people never give it a second thought. They connect their computer to Wi-Fi, type in a password and get on with their day. But if you have ever wondered whether plugging in an Ethernet cable is safer than sticking to wireless, you are asking the right question. The way you connect can have real consequences for your privacy and security. Recently, Kathleen reached out to me with the same doubt.",
      "\"Is it more secure to use the Ethernet connection at home for my computer, or is it safer to use the Wi-Fi from my cable provider?\"",
      "It's a great question, Kathleen, because both options seem similar on the surface but work very differently under the hood. Those differences can mean the difference between a private, secure connection and one that's more vulnerable to attackers.",

      "Ethernet offers direct, wired security without wireless risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Ethernet and Wi-Fi differ when it comes to security",
      "Ethernet and Wi-Fi both get you online, but they do it in completely different ways.\u00a0Ethernet\u00a0uses a physical cable that connects your computer directly to the router. Since it is a wired connection, data travels straight through that cable, making it much harder for anyone to intercept it. There is no wireless signal to hijack, no airwaves to eavesdrop on.",
      "Wi-Fi, on the other hand, is built on convenience. It sends your data through the air to and from your router, which is what makes it so easy to connect from anywhere in your home. But that convenience comes with more risk. Anyone within range of your signal could potentially try to break into the network. If your Wi-Fi is protected by a weak password or uses outdated encryption, a skilled attacker might gain access without ever stepping inside your house.",
      "At home, that risk is smaller than in a coffee shop or hotel, but it is not zero. Even a poorly secured smart device on your network can give attackers a way in. Ethernet removes many of those risks simply because it is harder to access a connection that requires physical access to a cable. Check out our steps for setting up a home network like a pro\u00a0here.",
      "DON'T USE YOUR HOME WI-FI BEFORE FIXING CERTAIN SECURITY RISKS",
      "Why one connection might be safer than the other",
      "It is easy to think Ethernet is automatically safer, but that is not the whole story. Your real security depends on how your entire network is set up. For example, a Wi-Fi network with a strong password, up-to-date router firmware, and WPA3 encryption is going to be far more secure than a poorly configured Ethernet setup connected to an outdated router.",
      "There is also the question of who else uses your network. If it is just you and a handful of devices, your risk is low. But if you live in a shared space or run smart home gadgets, that changes the equation. Each device connected to Wi-Fi is a potential entry point. Ethernet reduces the number of devices that can connect, which limits the attack surface.",
      "Ultimately, the connection type is one piece of the puzzle. The bigger factors are how your router is configured, how often you update your software, and how careful you are with what devices you connect.",
      "Wi-Fi brings convenience but also potential exposure to hackers.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways to make your internet safer",
      "Whether you stick with Wi-Fi or switch to Ethernet, there are several practical steps you can take to protect your devices and data. Each step adds an extra layer of security to your network.",
      "IS YOUR HOME WI-FI REALLY SAFE? THINK AGAIN",
      "Choose a long and unique password for your Wi-Fi. Avoid obvious choices like your name, address, or simple sequences. A strong password makes it far harder for attackers to guess or crack your network. A password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account, reducing the chances of a hacker gaining access through weak or repeated credentials.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords",
      "Most modern routers support WPA3, which is much more secure than older standards like WPA2. Check your router's settings to enable the latest encryption and ensure your network traffic is harder to intercept.",
      "Router manufacturers regularly release updates that patch security vulnerabilities. Log into your router's admin panel occasionally to check for updates and install them as soon as they are available. This prevents attackers from exploiting known flaws.",
      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Regularly check which devices are connected to your network and disconnect anything you no longer use. Each connected device is a potential entry point for attackers, so keeping the list limited reduces your network's exposure.",
      "Even on a secure network, malware can sneak in through downloads, phishing attacks, or compromised websites. A strong antivirus program will detect and block malicious activity, protecting your computer before damage occurs.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Ethernet cables connect to a router as part of a home network setup. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A virtual private network encrypts your internet traffic, making it unreadable to outsiders. This is especially useful if you ever use Wi-Fi in public or need an extra layer of privacy at home. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "So, which is safer, Ethernet or Wi-Fi? Ethernet wins in raw security because it eliminates many of the risks that come with wireless connections. But in a well-secured home network, the difference is often smaller than most people think. What matters more is how you manage your devices, passwords, software, and online habits.",

    "story": [
      "Skydweller CEO Robert Miller discusses his company's solar-powered drone that can fly for days on 'Fox News Live.'",
      "Shoplifting has long been a challenge for retailers, but a U.S. company now believes that flying drones could help combat the issue. Flock Safety, best known for its law enforcement camera systems, is promoting its new Flock Aerodome Drone as an Automated Security system to the private sector. The idea is simple: if a theft occurs, a drone launches, follows the suspect, and streams live video back to security teams or even police. With theft rates reportedly climbing 93% in 2024, the push for high-tech security has never been stronger.",

      "An example of a Flock Safety drone, ready to follow theft suspects within seconds (Flock Safety)",
      "How the drones would work",
      "Instead of dispatching a guard, Flock's drones could launch within seconds after motion is detected. Equipped with HD and thermal cameras, the drones can zoom in, track suspects, and relay real-time visuals.",
      "The company says the system:",

      "TEXAS COMPANY CREATES DRONES TO CONFRONT SCHOOL SHOOTERS IN SECONDS",
      "Why retailers may be interested",
      "Organized retail crime is a growing problem. Retailers have been reporting higher losses, tighter budgets, and fewer staff members available. Flock Safety argues its drone system can act as a deterrent simply by being visible, making criminals think twice before targeting a store. Beyond retail, the company is also pitching its drones to operators of hospitals, warehouse sites, and energy facilities that require large-scale surveillance.",
      "Due to the drones' helpful technologies, retailers may soon rely on them as a visible deterrent against organized theft. (Flock Safety)",
      "HEGSETH TEARS UP RED TAPE, ORDERS PENTAGON TO BEGIN DRONE SURGE AT TRUMP'S COMMAND",
      "What this means for you",
      "For shoppers, this could mean visiting stores where drones are part of the security landscape. You might notice them overhead at malls or parking lots, watching for unusual activity. While some may view this as an added safety measure, others may worry about increased surveillance and loss of privacy. For retailers, drones could help protect profits, staff, and customers without the rising costs of hiring additional guards. But whether customers welcome drones buzzing around remains to be seen.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Technology is quickly reshaping how companies approach security, and drones may soon play a bigger role in everyday shopping environments. With faster response times, broader coverage, and lower staffing costs, the idea has clear appeal for retailers. At the same time, questions about privacy and public acceptance will influence the extent to which this technology is adopted.",

      "Over the past few years, data breaches targeting schools, healthcare providers, and childcare services have been making headlines, exposing sensitive personal information and leaving families vulnerable. Now, a new breach has come to light that targets a nursery chain. Kido, which operates in the U.S., U.K., China and India, has reportedly had sensitive data stolen from thousands of children. Names, photos, addresses, birthdates, parental details and even safeguarding notes and medical records were allegedly accessed by a hacker group called Radiant.",

      "The incident highlights how stolen data threatens not just privacy but also long-term child safety. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about nursery breach",
      "According to reports, the hacker group Radiant claims to have stolen data related to around 8,000 children. To prove possession, they posted samples, including pictures and profiles of ten children, on a darknet website. They then issued a ransom demand, threatening to release more sensitive information unless Kido paid. In addition to targeting the nursery chain directly, Radiant reportedly called some of the children's parents, pressuring them to push Kido into paying the ransom.",
      "FBI WARNS ABOUT NEW EXTORTION SCAM TARGETING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "When questioned about their actions, the group defended their tactics as a form of \"penetration testing\" for which they supposedly deserved compensation. This defense is misleading, as such testing requires explicit permission from the organization being targeted or participation in an official bug bounty program. Without that consent, these actions are illegal and deeply unethical.",
      "Hackers exploited children\u2019s data in the Kido breach, exposing families to serious risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why is this attack so disturbing?",
      "The Kido breach is alarming for multiple reasons. First, it involves children's data, which is particularly sensitive and legally protected in most countries. Second, the attackers combined traditional data theft with intimidation tactics, reaching out to parents directly. History suggests that once criminals gain access to such information, the attacks can escalate.",
      "Breaches like this highlight how personal and digital security are intertwined. The potential misuse of data extends beyond simple identity theft. It can impact children's safety, family privacy and long-term well-being. With attackers leveraging both the stolen data and psychological pressure on parents, the threat is particularly potent and long-lasting.",

      "Log in to email, school portals and cloud storage accounts linked to your child. Look for unusual activity such as unrecognized logins, changes to passwords or new connected devices. Set up notifications for account activity whenever possible so you are alerted instantly if something suspicious happens.",
      "Adding\u00a02FA creates an extra layer of security. Even if a hacker has a password, they won't be able to access the account without the second verification step. Most email providers, school portals and messaging platforms support this, and it's a simple step that dramatically improves security.",

Still, she worries that turning Google Docs into chat rooms could open the door to bullying or cheating. Parents are also weighing in.

While some of these workarounds seem harmless, they also carry risks, from distractions that take focus away from learning to new opportunities for bullying or even cheating.

      "Kurt 'The CyberGuy' Knutsson shares practical ways to avoid falling victim to AI-generated phishing scams and discusses a report that North Korean agents are posing as I.T. workers to funnel money into the country's nuclear program.",
      "Cybercriminals are getting smarter every day, and one of their most convincing tricks is disguising phishing emails to look like they're coming from people you trust. Work emails are particularly dangerous because they lower your guard. After all, if the sender is your boss or IT department, why would you suspect anything? Unfortunately, scammers know this and use it to their advantage. I recently received an email from Krysti from Rockwall, Texas, who highlighted a similar issue.",
      "\"I received a spam email from my employer's email. It had a document attached to it. I tried to open it and could not. I contacted my employer and they told me they hadn't sent me anything. I changed my password and ran a virus scan. I also have been checking on the dark web for anything coming up on me. So far everything is okay. I did sign up for antivirus software based on your recommendation and we are signed up for identity theft protection. Is there anything else I should do?\"",
      "Incidents like this are more common than many realize, Krysti. And while it sounds like you took the right first steps by changing your password, scanning for malware and monitoring for identity misuse, there are a few additional precautions worth taking.

      "Phishing emails often look like they come from someone you know, making them harder to spot. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why work email scams are so dangerous",
      "Phishing attempts that impersonate coworkers or employers are particularly effective because they rely on trust and urgency. You're more likely to open an attachment or click a link if you believe it's tied to your job. Scammers often spoof legitimate email addresses or use addresses that look almost identical to the real ones, hoping you won't notice the subtle difference.",
      "Once you interact with these emails, the risks multiply. Opening a malicious attachment could install spyware or ransomware. Clicking a fake link might lead to a login page designed to harvest your credentials. Even if nothing obvious happens right away, attackers could still be collecting background information to use in a future attack.",
      "These scams are becoming harder to spot, too. Some are powered by artificial intelligence-generated text, making them free of the usual grammar mistakes that used to be obvious red flags. Others use stolen email threads to insert themselves into ongoing conversations. That's why even seasoned professionals fall for them.",

      "What to do immediately after a close call",
      "Changing your password or running a malware scan is often not enough to stop attackers. It's worth going a little further to make sure nothing slipped through. Start by checking your login history to see if there are any unauthorized sign-ins on your email or work accounts.",
      "Most platforms allow you to review recent activity, including device type and location, and if anything looks suspicious, sign out of all sessions immediately and change your password again. Next, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on your email and any other critical accounts. Even if attackers manage to steal your password, they won't be able to gain access without the second verification step.",
      "It's also important to alert your IT team, especially if the email appears to come from your employer's address. This could mean the company's email system has been compromised, and notifying them will allow them to investigate and secure other accounts if necessary. Finally, make sure all your software is up to date. Malware often exploits vulnerabilities in outdated systems, so regularly updating your operating system, antivirus and productivity tools adds another layer of protection against future attacks.",

      "7 ways to check if your device or data is compromised",
      "Some cyber threats don't reveal themselves immediately. Scammers often collect small bits of data over time or wait weeks before trying to use what they've stolen. The following steps are actions anyone can take to make sure their device and personal data remain secure, and to catch any signs of compromise before they turn into serious problems.",
      "1) Consider a personal data removal service",
      "The more personal information about you that's publicly available, the easier it is for scammers to target you. Data removal services can help by scanning hundreds of data broker websites and removing your details from them. Reducing this digital footprint not only makes it harder for attackers to build profiles on you but also limits how easily phishing attempts can be tailored to your life.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Your information could already be circulating in breach dumps and underground markets without you realizing it. Identity protection services monitor known dark-web sources, forums and leak sites for your email, phone, SSN and other sensitive details. If they find a match, they alert you so you can act quickly: change passwords, turn on two-factor authentication, and place fraud alerts or credit freezes with the credit bureaus.",
      "Your information might already be circulating in dark web marketplaces without you realizing it. Identity theft protection services can help by continuously scanning those underground sites for your email, passwords or other sensitive details. If your data does show up, these services notify you right away so you can reset credentials, freeze accounts or take other protective actions before the information is misused.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if you never shared payment details, attackers may attempt account takeovers or fraudulent transactions using any information they have. Review your bank, credit card and online account statements frequently for unusual activity. Pairing this habit with identity theft protection tools gives you an added safety net, as they often include financial monitoring and fraud alerts to catch problems quickly.",
      "Email accounts are often the central hub for many other services. If your inbox is compromised, attackers might try to break into linked accounts such as cloud storage, messaging apps or collaboration tools. Check each of these services for unfamiliar logins, permission changes or device activity, and secure them by changing passwords and enabling two-factor authentication.",
      "Weak or reused passwords are one of the easiest ways for attackers to break into accounts after a breach. A password manager solves this by generating and storing strong, unique passwords for every site you use. It also acts as a passive phishing detector. If the tool doesn't autofill a login form, that's a sign the page could be fake. Over time, this significantly reduces your risk of falling victim to credential-based attacks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Modern cyber threats go beyond viruses. A strong antivirus solution now acts as a full security layer, blocking phishing websites, detecting malicious scripts and stopping suspicious activity before it can compromise your device. If you've interacted with a suspicious attachment or link, a reputable antivirus tool can catch malware that might still be hiding in the background.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

    "summary": "The conservative-majority Supreme Court on Wednesday will consider whether to eviscerate a key provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act in a congressional redistricting case from Louisiana.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The conservative-majority Supreme Court on Wednesday considered whether to eviscerate a key provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act in a congressional redistricting case from Louisiana.",
      "The justices, who expanded the scope of the case over the summer, heard oral arguments on whether states can ever consider race in drawing new districts while seeking to comply with Section 2 of the 1965 law, which was enacted against a backdrop of historic racial discrimination to protect minority voters.",
      "The long-running dispute concerns the congressional map that Louisiana was required to redraw last year after being sued under the Voting Rights Act to ensure that there were two majority-Black districts. The original map only had one such district in a state where a third of the population is Black.",
      "The Supreme Court originally heard the case earlier this year on a narrower set of legal issues but, in a rare move, it asked in June for the parties to reargue it. The court then raised the stakes by asking the lawyers to focus on a larger constitutional issue.",
      "Now, the justices are deciding whether drawing a map to ensure there are majority-Black districts violates the Constitution\u2019s 14th and 15th amendments, which were both enacted after the Civil War to ensure equal rights for former slaves, including the right to vote.",
      "Conservatives argue that both constitutional amendments prohibit consideration of race at any time. The Supreme Court has previously embraced this \u201ccolorblind\u201d interpretation of the Constitution, most notably in its 2023 ruling that ended the consideration of race in college admissions.",
      "Louisiana, which initially defended its new map, has switched sides and joined a group of self-identified \"non-African-American\" voters who sued to block it on constitutional grounds. The Trump administration also backs the state's new position.",
      "The map is being defended by civil rights groups that challenged the original map.",
      "The Voting Rights Act has long been a target of conservative legal attacks, with the Supreme Court weakening it in two major rulings in 2013 and 2021.",
      "But two years ago, the court surprisingly reaffirmed the requirement that race be used to redraw districts when necessary to comply with the law in a different congressional redistricting case from Alabama.",
      "The ruling was 5-4, with two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, joining the court's three liberals in the majority. Kavanaugh, however, expressed reservations about the long-term future of Section 2.",
      "A broad ruling in Louisiana's favor would reduce the need for states to draw legislative districts composed largely of minority groups and would likely lead to a reduction in the number of minority lawmakers in Congress and state legislatures.",
      "A quick ruling could give Louisiana and other states time to draw new districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. With Black voters often voting Democratic, such a move could benefit Republicans."

    "published": "Wed, 15 Oct 2025 09:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has declined to provide members of Congress unedited video of military strikes against suspected drug running boats in the Caribbean.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Members of Congress are growing concerned over a lack of information from the Trump administration about the intelligence and strategy underlying its strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean, six sources told NBC News.",
      "Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have left briefings about the strikes frustrated with the lack of information, said these people: five congressional sources and an additional source with knowledge of the matter. Some have asked for unedited video of the strikes, reflecting the kind of basic information they seek, but the administration has so far refused to provide it.",
      "At a briefing a few weeks ago, Republican lawmakers were clearly upset with the answers they received, one of the congressional sources said.",
      "\u201cThe Republicans were mad that the briefers were unable to answer questions about the legal basis for the operations,\u201d the source said.",
      "Some members of Congress \u2014 including Republicans who broadly support the attacks and the administration generally \u2014 are also concerned about the level of precision of the intelligence used to determine targets and the possibility that an American citizen could be killed in the operations, several of the sources said. A Defense Department spokesperson said members are being fully informed, and last week most GOP senators voted to defeat a measure that would have required congressional approval before more attacks were launched.",
      "Lawmakers are also asking the administration to explain who was killed in the strikes, how they were positively identified as legitimate targets for lethal force, what intelligence indicated that they had possible links to drug trafficking gangs and what information showed that they were heading to the United States with drugs, the sources said.",
      "They have also asked whether the administration has weighed the potential response from trafficking groups, including the possibility of retaliation inside the United States.",
      "Since Sept. 2, President Donald Trump has ordered at least five military strikes in the Caribbean on boats his administration says were moving illicit drugs from Venezuela to the United States. Officials say 27 people have been killed in the attacks, the most recent of which Trump announced Tuesday.",
      "Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted short, grainy video clips of the strikes on social media. The clips include multiple edits, contributing to questions in Congress about whether the targets are definitely the drug smuggling boats the administration has said they are and about the circumstances and locations of the operations. Raw, unedited video could help reassure lawmakers about the origins of the vessels being targeted, as well as provide more context for them to better understand the circumstances under which the vessels are targeted or even where the strikes are occurring.",
      "After the first strike, Trump said the boat the United States destroyed was linked to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, but the White House has yet to provide evidence to back up that claim. Drugs were found in the water after one strike, an official from the Dominican Republic said at a news conference last month. The United States has not revealed evidence that drugs were on all the boats.",
      "Asked about the lawmakers\u2019 request for more information and video, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said administration officials have kept Congress fully informed about the strikes and the legal authorities involved with frequent briefings.",
      "\u201cThe Department of War has given numerous briefs and notifications to Congress that have extensive details of the policy, operations, tactical intelligence, and authorities invoked,\u201d Parnell said in an email.",
      "Parnell and the White House did not directly address why the administration so far has not provided lawmakers with access to unedited video of the attacks.",
      "A White House official told NBC News, \u201cThe Department of War is working through additional requests for information from the Hill.\u201d",
      "The administration has provided six classified briefings to relevant congressional committees and lawmakers over the past month, Pentagon and White House officials said.",
      "Although no one on the congressional side disputes that there have been briefings by Pentagon officials, members from both parties have come away from them dissatisfied and frustrated at the vague nature of the information that was shared, the sources said.",
      "NBC News has reported that the United States has been preparing options for strikes inside Venezuela\u2019s borders. Many lawmakers fear that extending the bombing to targets on land would pose a significant risk of civilian casualties, two of the congressional sources and the source with knowledge of the matter said. Targeting a vessel on the open seas is one thing, they believe, but striking a location on land brings more perils, including the possibility of inadvertent civilian deaths.",
      "Some members of Congress also believe the strikes are illegal; others have concerns about their legality. The administration provided a letter to Congress in which it said Trump has determined that the United States is now engaged in an \u201carmed conflict\u201d with drug trafficking organizations and that it views members of those groups as \u201carmed combatants,\u201d using the same legal rationale the government has previously used to go after Al Qaeda, the Islamic State and other terrorist groups.",
      "After the first classified briefing by Pentagon officials, which they felt was lacking, multiple lawmakers asked the administration to give access to unedited video of the strikes to members of Congress, who would view the video only behind closed doors, the sources said. Members believe the raw video could help answer some of their questions. So far, though, the administration has not agreed to the request, the sources said.",
      "During previous administrations, Pentagon and intelligence officials in some cases provided lawmakers with classified, nonpublic video or photos of specific counterterrorism operations.",
      "Although Republicans have privately voiced concerns about the lack of information and clarity about the strikes, last week all but two GOP senators joined in voting down a resolution that would have required the Trump administration to seek congressional approval before it launched more attacks.",
      "The resolution went down to defeat in a 51-48 vote. Two Republicans, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, joined almost all Democrats in voting in favor. (John Fetterman of Pennsylvania crossed the aisle and joined the rest of the Republicans in voting no.)",
      "Paul said that he believes the strikes have no legal foundation and that the administration needs to provide evidence to justify the lethal bombing raids.",
      "\u201cIs it too much to ask to know the names of those we kill before we kill them, to know what evidence exists of their guilt?\u201d Paul said in a speech on the Senate floor.",
      "Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., voted against the resolution but said afterward that he was still \u201chighly concerned about the legality\u201d of the strikes, as well as the deployment of U.S. warships and other resources to the Caribbean that could be needed to counter China in the Pacific.",
      "\u201cThe administration should adhere to the Constitution and keep the people\u2019s representatives informed on this critical national security issue,\u201d Young said in a statement.",
      "\u2018Secret list\u2019",
      "More than 20 Democrats in Congress wrote a letter to the administration last month posing a list of questions about the recent strikes and asking for a copy of all legal assessments of the attacks by federal agencies. The administration has yet to respond to the letter, according to a spokesperson for Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.",
      "Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., last week accused the administration of failing to inform Congress and the American people about all the groups being targeted and all the groups Trump has designated as terrorist organizations.",
      "At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, Slotkin asked Charles Young, the principal deputy general counsel for the Defense Department, to identify the drug cartels that are viewed as adversaries in the campaign.",
      "\u201cHow many new terrorist organizations are we currently in armed conflict with, and could you name them?\u201d Slotkin asked.",
      "Young, who has been nominated to be the Army\u2019s next general counsel, told Slotkin: \u201cSenator, it may be more appropriate to discuss that with you in a closed session.\u201d",
      "Slotkin replied that \u201cwe couldn\u2019t get it in a closed session\u201d held with the Defense Department\u2019s new general counsel.",
      "\u201cI was a CIA officer and helped with targeting. I have no problem with going after these cartels,\u201d she added. \u201cI have no problem designating terrorist organizations in general. But we\u2019ve never had an instance where there\u2019s a secret list of what I understand to be dozens of new terrorist organizations that the American public and certainly the oversight committees don\u2019t get to know.\u201d",
      "In justifying labeling cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, officials often cite the high death toll from fentanyl use in the United States. But Venezuela is not considered a source for the illegal fentanyl in the United States, which is mainly smuggled over land routes in small, easily concealed amounts across the Mexico-U.S. border, not by boat through the Caribbean, experts say.",
      "A claim by Colombian President Gustavo Petro last week appeared to reflect the concern U.S. lawmakers have about the precision of the strikes and the intelligence behind them. Petro wrote on social media last week that a boat struck on Oct. 3, which the United States portrayed as Venezuelan, was actually from his country and carried Colombian citizens, and he also criticized what he said was a broader political campaign against Venezuela.",
      "In a statement, a White House spokesperson dismissed what Petro said, but it was unclear whether the spokesperson was rejecting his central claim, that the boat was Colombian with Colombian citizens on it, not Venezuelan. The spokesperson did not respond to an attempt to clarify the administration\u2019s position.",
      "\u201cThe United States looks forward to President Petro publicly retracting his baseless and reprehensible statement so that we can return to a productive dialogue on building a strong, prosperous future for the people of the United States and Colombia,\u201d the statement read."

      "Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent spoke to reporters at the Treasury Department in Washington, D.C., where Bessent said Beijing\u2019s actions amounted to a provocation.",
      "The remarks were the latest sign that the U.S.-China trade relationship continues to deteriorate after Beijing\u2019s surprise announcement Thursday of new limits on rare earth minerals and related technologies.",
      "In response, President Donald Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on China as well as export controls on \u201cany and all critical software.\u201d",
      "The only way China can avoid those new tariffs, Greer told NBC News, is to drop the proposed export controls.",
      "Both Bessent and Greer were cautiously optimistic that Beijing would back down and return to the negotiating table",
      "\u201cOur expectation is that they won\u2019t implement [the controls] and that we\u2019ll be able to be back to where we were a week ago,\u201d said Greer, \u201cwhere we had the tariff levels we\u2019ve agreed to and we have the flow of rare earth magnets we agreed to.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, Bessent said Washington was conferring with its allied trade partners about a unified response to the restrictions. \u201cThis is China vs. the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe and our allies will neither be commanded, nor controlled.\u201d",
      "Rare earth minerals are critical to the manufacture of a wide range of products such as batteries, electric vehicles, household goods, TVs and smartphones and solar panels.",
      "After three rounds of what the officials called successful trade talks, China also has yet to officially approve the sale of TikTok U.S. and has not bought any soybeans from American farmers since May.",
      "Nonetheless, Greer and Bessent said the current 90-day tariff pause in place with China \u2014 renewed at least three times so far \u2014 could be re-upped again for a longer interval if China lifts the rare earths restrictions."

If there\u2019s a time where it\u2019s just really super unhealthy, I will say, 'Hey, let\u2019s do it here at my house, or let\u2019s figure out a different time.' But actually when he is like that, he doesn\u2019t really want to see the kids a lot.\"",
      "Kardashian said Ye has lived in Saudi Arabia, Italy and Japan, and she has \"never once denied\" her children going to visit him.",
      "\"I don't keep the kids, and I think that all that narrative really sucks for me,\" she said. \"And if I spoke out about it and rebutted it, I\u2019m just not that girl online that\u2019s going to, like, fight back and be like, 'Wait a minute, your assistant and you said you wanted a whole different birthday party, and you said your party\u2019s at 4 (o'clock), so we did ours at noon, and now you\u2019re going online saying (something else).' It\u2019s just a totally different narrative than what the reality is, and that just really sucks.\"",
      "Ye has previously said derogatory things about Kardashian on social media, but she does not respond.",
      "\"There has been so many times where I\u2019ve written a draft and been like, 'I\u2019m going to go,'\" she said. \"And then I\u2019m just like, 'What\u2019s the point? What is the point? Am I going to go back and forth? My kids are going to see this.' They\u2019ll figure it all out when when they want to make those decisions. And I used to be so protective and so 'hide everything,' and then sometimes you just can\u2019t hide it all.\"",
      "\"I never say anything negative about my kid\u2019s dad just because it\u2019s out there,\" she continued. \"Like, the last thing my kids need is for them to hear it from me. And I never saw my parents talk bad about each other no matter what was going on. I do think that that\u2019s just who I am. I just don\u2019t want to go there with, like, fighting back, saying negative things, you know?\"",
      "That's not to say she hasn't thought about it.",
      "\"I wish I did last time,\" she said. \"I had a good post ready to go.\"",
      "She added that it's hard for her to stay restrained when Ye has said negative things online about her mother.",
      "\"That\u2019s what\u2019s really hard for me, because she loves him, and to this day still does and is super emotional about it and sad about it. It was a big part of our lives,\" Kardashian said. \"My kids, I say such positive things about their dad that, like, North had to say to me, 'Mom, I think you go upstairs and, like, cry at night. Like, it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s time to move on. You need to have a boyfriend now.' And I\u2019m like, 'Wait, what? What? I cry? No, I'm getting a massage upstairs. What do you think is happening?'\"",
      "Kardashian also shared why she split with Ye, between him saying negative things about her mother and sisters and airing out \"personal stuff.\"",
      "\"Just not feeling safe, not even physically, just, like, maybe emotionally or even financially,\" she said, adding, \"We had, like, five Lamborghinis, and I\u2019d come home and they\u2019d all be gone if he was in an episode. And I\u2019d be like, 'Oh, wait, where\u2019s all our cars? My new car.' And it would be like, 'Oh, he gave them away to all of his friends.'\"",
      "\"I didn\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get when you wake up,\" she continued. \"And that\u2019s, like, a really unsettling feeling. Lack of stability was a big thing.\""

I had been so infantilized that I was losing pieces of what made me feel like myself,\u201d Spears wrote. \u201cThe conservatorship stripped me of my womanhood, made me into a child.

      "\u201cI absolutely loved the pumpkin pie croissant, but everything was a little on the sweet and rich side, which some people love,\u201d she added. \u201cPersonally, I like my sweets a little less sweet, so I\u2019d rather get treated like s--- and go to Paris again.\u201d",
      "Griffo ended her review with this missive: \u201cWith all of that being said, I think if you stay away from the expensive ingredients, like deez nuts, you can definitely enjoy delicious, rich pastry here.\u201d",
      "The Bakery\u2019s Response Goes Viral",
      "Though the review itself didn\u2019t initially go viral, it caught the attention of the bakery, which is owned by Jenna Leurquin. On Oct. 9, she responded in a now-viral video, disputing most of Griffo\u2019s claims, without naming her directly.",
      "\u201cSo, we recently had an influencer reach out to us and asked to do a collaboration, and we respectfully declined, because it was not in our budget right now,\u201d Leurquin said. \u201cThen, she essentially tried to blackmail us by saying if we offered the food for free, she would then write a good review about us.\u201d",
      "Along with the claim, Leurquin posted a screenshot of a direct message from Griffo in which she said the \u201cmeal will need to be comped including the gratuity\u201d for a collaboration, but that if the bakery accepts, her \u201chonest review\u201d would \u201chighlight/focus on what l enjoyed and be softer/quicker on my words with what I may not like as much.\u201d",
      "Leurquin said she would consider it, but before she\u2019d made up her mind, Griffo came in the next day. The staff recognized her when she came in and were \u201cvery accommodating\u201d and \u201ctotally respected that review,\u201d said Leurquin.",
      "\u201cBut what we don\u2019t like is lying and bullying,\u201d Leurquin said.",
      "For the remainder of the video, she pushes back on the accusation that the bakery\u2019s ingredients are fake: They use PreGel pistachio paste, which is \u201cmade from the finest pistachios,\u201d Panettone flour from Italy, and other imported ingredients. \u201cNot bad for a \u2018close to the airport bakery,\u201d Leurquin said.",
      "Aafter showing some of the bakery\u2019s preparation processes and noting everything is made from scratch, Leurquin ends the video with a message to all influencers.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about me. This specific influencer has gone to many different local restaurants and bullied them,\u201d Leurquin said. \u201cThe problem is if the next generation is influenced by her to believe it\u2019s OK to bully and disrespect the food industry.\u201d",
      "Griffo did not immediately respond to TODAY.com\u2019s request for comment.",
      "Leurquin\u2019s response garnered a staggering 60 million views and nearly 50,000 comments.",
      "\u201cI am loving this new trend of restaurants getting publicity for outing these influencers, blackmailing businesses for a pastry,\u201d commented one TikTok user.",
      "Referring to Griffo\u2019s review, someone else said, \u201cThat was straight bullying just because she couldn\u2019t get free food.\u201d",
      "Even mega-popular food reviewer Keith Lee weighed in on the drama.",
      "\u201cWhat you do with a little is what you do with a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you say you\u2019re gonna be honest now, and you not honest, you ain\u2019t gonna be honest when you get 100 million followers, that\u2019s the way I feel.\u201d",
      "Glamorama Responds, Then Apologizes",
      "Griffo posted a response to Leurquin, saying it was a \u201cbit of a stretch\u201d that she was bullying the bakery, since it has more followers than she does, but later deleted the video.",
      "\u201cGoddamn, someone finally stood up to me. You know, I gotta say f---ing kudos for real,\u201d Griffo said. \u201cI never said that I would leave a good review for a free meal.\u201d",
      "That video didn\u2019t go over well, either: After even more backlash, Griffo deleted all of her videos, changed her username and posted an apology.",
      "\u201cMy review was not revenge for being turned down for a collaboration I had already planned to visit and review the bakery regardless, paid or not,\u201d Griffo wrote in the text-based TikTok. \u201cBut I understand with how things unfolded, it might have looked like I did it out of spite. That\u2019s not who l am, and that was never my intention.\u201d",
      "Griffo said she gives honest reviews and the folks who have followed her \u201cfor a while\u201d know that, but understands now that \u201chonesty without compassion can come across the wrong way.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo the bakery, I\u2019m sincerely sorry for any harm my words may have caused. I respect the time, effort, and heart that goes into running a small business, and I genuinely wish you nothing but success moving forward,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re all human. Sometimes we mess up publicly and all we can do is take accountability, learn, and grow from it.\u201d"

    "summary": "Who was Adeline Watkins and what happened to her? This is the true story of Ed Gein's girlfriend and how it compares to what's shown in the series.",
    "story": [
      "The newest season of Netflix's \"Monster\" not only depicts killer Ed Gein and his macabre crimes, it also shows him with a female companion whose role in his life has been disputed.",
      "Charlie Hunnam plays the man who became known as The Butcher of Plainfield for the grisly crimes uncovered at his Wisconsin farm in 1957. Gein admitted to killing two local women and robbing graves at a local cemetery to make ghoulish items like bowls, lampshades and upholstered chairs out of human skin and bone.",
      "In \"Monster: The Ed Gein Story,\" actor Suzanna Son plays a woman named Adeline Watkins, who appears to be Gein\u2019s girlfriend and a woman who shares some of his interest in gruesome murders.",
      "Was she a real person? Here's what to know.",
      "Who Was Adeline Watkins?",
      "Following Gein's arrest in 1957, a local woman from Gein's hometown of Plainfield named Adeline Watkins gave an interview with the Minneapolis Tribune, which was reprinted in the Wisconsin State Journal on Nov. 21, 1957, saying Gein once proposed to her.",
      "Watkins, who was 50 years old at the time, described Gein as \"good and kind and sweet\" in the article.",
      "She claimed the two had a 20-year romance and that Gein \"was so nice about doing things I wanted to do that sometimes I felt I was taking advantage of him.\"",
      "\"I loved him and I still do,\" she added.",
      "She was described by the reporter as \"a plain woman with graying bangs and horn-rimmed glasses.\"",
      "Watkins said her last date with Gein was on Feb. 6, 1955, about two years before he was arrested. She claimed that Gein didn't explicitly propose to her that night, but she \"knew what he meant.\"",
      "\"I turned him down, but not because there was anything wrong with him,\" she continued. \"It was something wrong with me. I guess I was afraid I wouldn't be able to live up to what he expected of me.\"",
      "Watkins' mother was also quoted saying Gein was a \"sweet, polite man\" who always had her daughter home by 10 p.m. from a date.",
      "Watkins added that she and Gein often talked about books, including his favorites about lions, tigers, Africa and India. She said they also loved true crime.",
      "\"I guess we discussed every murder we ever heard about,\" she said. \"Eddie told how the murdered did wrong, what mistakes he had made. I thought it was interesting.\"",
      "What Did Ed Gein Say About His Relationship with Adeline Watkins?",
      "Gein never publicly made any mention of Watkins.",
      "In the book \"Unhinged\" by Robert Keller, Gein was described as a \"lonely old bachelor\" whom local farmers' wives took pity on and delivered meals and cookies to him at his farm.",
      "Watkins said in the Minneapolis Tribune that she and Gein went on dates to the movies or a local tavern. She said she had to \"drag\" Gein into a tavern because he did not drink.",
      "However, one of the women Gein admitted to murdering was a tavern owner, Mary Hogan. He frequently visited her establishment and looked at her as a \"mirror image of his sainted mother,\" according to \"Unhinged.\" It's unclear whether Watkins and Gein ever visited Hogan's tavern or if they were ever truly a couple.",
      "Following his arrest, Gein lived in state psychiatric facilities until his death in 1984.",
      "While growing up under their mother's domineering presence, Gein and his brother were warned constantly by their mother about the immorality of women and told to avoid them. Neither of them ever married, and Ed Gein remained obsessed with his mother until her death and beyond.",
      "Adeline Watkins Retracted Her Statements",
      "Watkins' interview with the Minnesota paper was picked up by The Associated Press and made national headlines for her alleged love affair with a ghoulish murderer and grave robber.",
      "She then spoke to the local Stevens Point Journal in Wisconsin for a story that ran on Dec. 3, 1957, and denied some of her previous statements.",
      "Watkins said there was no 20-year romance between the two, only that she had known him for 20 years. She said she had only spent time with him during a seven-month period in 1954 and went to a few shows at a local theater and spent time with him at her home. She said she never visited his home.",
      "She denied that she or her mother had referred to Gein as \"sweet\" in the interview. She also denied saying she had to \"practically drag\" Gein into a local tavern.",
      "Outside of the two newspaper stories, Watkins did not speak publicly about Gein again. She died at 85 in 1992 and was buried in the Plainfield Cemetery in Wisconsin. It's one of the cemeteries where Gein admitted to digging up corpses in the 1940s and '50s.",
      "How is Adeline Watkins Portrayed in 'Monster'?",
      "Son portrays Watkins as Gein's girlfriend in the Netflix series. It also shows her as complicit in his crimes. There is no evidence of that ever happening.",
      "Son's character shows him photos of Holocaust victims and notorious Nazi war criminal Ilse Koch, and then Gein shows her the hair-raising items he made out of human body parts. She is shown a bowl made of a skull, a belt made out of women's nipples and a chair upholstered with human skin, all of which were real items found by authorities at Gein's home in Plainfield, Wisconsin.",
      "He also introduces Son's character to his \"mother,\" which is really a corpse of his late mother sitting in a chair with her back to Watkins like a scene straight out of \"Psycho,\" which was inspired by Gein's crimes. Adeline then promptly leaves.",
      "Gein denied digging up the body of his mother, Augusta Gein, who died of a stroke in 1945.",
      "In a later episode, the two are seen at a graveyard, where Watkins accepts a wedding proposal from Gein. She is then shown wanting to have sex with him, but he stops her because he's been taught by his mother that sex is only for procreation.",
      "The two are then shown moving in together, and Watkins is depicted as having a morbid fascination when she finds the corpse of one of Gein's victims. Yet another disturbing scene shows Watkins photographing corpses mutilated by Gein and encouraging necrophilia.",
      "None of these events appear to have happened, according to police reports, interviews with Gein and the interviews with Watkins.",
      "In perhaps a nod to the Minneapolis Tribune interview by Watkins, Son's character is later shown seeking media attention to grab the spotlight after Gein's crimes have been made public. In the final episode, she meets with Gein in his psychiatric hospital and confesses to disturbing urges.",
      "Neither Gein nor Watkins ever spoke of any meeting between them while Gein was in the hospital."

      "Viewers had to wait until the end of the Season 8 premiere to learn what happened to Isobel. Per TV Insider, Jubal contacted Isobel\u2019s husband Philip (Tom Cavanagh) to tell him that she had to undergo an emergency craniotomy due to a brain bleed. Luckily, Isobel made it through.",
      "The episode also put two other characters \u2014 Maggie (Missy Peregrym) and OA (Zeeko Zaki) \u2014 at risk when they traveled to an island while working on a case. When the two were held hostage, Scola (John Boyd) and Dani (Emily Alabi) went to save them.",

He\u2019s a character who finds ways to grow and honor everyone he\u2019s lost in his daily life as an agent. It\u2019s what makes him an extraordinary asset to the team,\u201d Weiss said."

    "story": [
      "Jennifer Aniston has revealed why she never adopted kids, despite long-standing public preoccupation with her fertility.",
      "\u201cWhen people say, \u2018But you can adopt,\u2019 I don\u2019t want to adopt,\u201d Aniston said during a Wondery+ Early Access episode of the Armchair Expert podcast, according to People. \u201cI want my own DNA in a little person. That\u2019s the only way, selfish or not,  whatever that is, I\u2019ve wanted it.\u201d",
      "During the podcast, scheduled to air on October 20, Aniston explained that she\u2019s met certain men who \u201cwould have made some good kids,\u201d though she said she hasn\u2019t dwelled on it, instead allowing the observation to \u201cpass within three seconds.\u201d",
      "Aniston later added that having children \u201cjust wasn\u2019t in the plan, whatever the plan was.\u201d",
      "For decades, the \u201cMorning Show\u201d star was the target of media speculation over whether she would be a mother. Aniston was married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005 and then to Justin Theroux from 2015 until they announced their separation in 2018.",
      "In 2016, Aniston addressed the obsession in an op-ed for Huffington Post.",
      "\u201cFor the record, I am not pregnant. What I am is fed up,\u201d Aniston wrote. \u201cI\u2019m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body shaming that occurs daily under the guise of \u2018journalism,\u2019 the \u2018First Amendment\u2019 and \u2018celebrity news.\u2019\u201d",
      "Aniston continued: \u201cWe don\u2019t need to be married or mothers to be complete. We get to determine our own \u2018happily ever after\u2019 for ourselves.\u201d",
      "Explaining that she was tired of the exploitation, Jennifer wrote, \u201cYes, I may become a mother someday, and since I\u2019m laying it all out there, if I ever do, I will be the first to let you know. But I\u2019m not in pursuit of motherhood because I feel incomplete in some way, as our celebrity news culture would lead us all to believe.\u201d",
      "In 2022, Aniston told Allure that in earlier years, she did IVF to have a baby.",
      "\u201cI was trying to get pregnant. It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,\u201d Aniston told the outlet.",
      "Aniston added: \u201cAll the years and years and years of speculation ... It was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would\u2019ve given anything if someone had said to me, \u2018Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.\u2019 You just don\u2019t think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\u201d",
      "In an October 2025 interview with Harper\u2019s Bazaar, Aniston circled back to her Huffington Post essay.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t know my story, or what I\u2019d been going through over the past 20 years to try to pursue a family, because I don\u2019t go out there and tell them my medical woes,\u201d Aniston told Harper\u2019s Bazaar.",
      "Aniston continued, \u201cThat\u2019s not anybody\u2019s business. But there comes a point when you can\u2019t not hear it \u2014 the narrative about how I won\u2019t have a baby, won\u2019t have a family, because I\u2019m selfish, a workaholic. It does affect me \u2014 I\u2019m just a human being. We\u2019re all human beings. That\u2019s why I thought, \u2018What the hell?\u2019\u201d"

      "\u201cConform\u201d began as an off-handed comment debut author Ariel Sullivan made to her husband during a \u201cdark point\u201d in her life, she tells TODAY.com. Sullivan was struggling with postpartum depression and the isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "While contact tracing with her husband, she had a vision of a surveillance state future: \u201cSooner or later, we\u2019ll all have these chips in our hand, and we\u2019ll just be able to scan and it\u2019ll know if we\u2019re sick or if we have problems. Then they\u2019ll be able to tell us where we can and can\u2019t go based on it,\u201d she remembers imagining.",
      "She also recalls waking up that morning at 2:30 a.m. to feed her son. By then, Sullivan says the idea had \u201cexploded in her subconscious.\u201d",
      "Instead of going back to sleep, she spent all night outlining \u201cConform,\u201d her debut novel and the first book from Jenna Bush Hager\u2019s Thousand Voices imprint, a joint venture with Random House. Jenna said in a previous interview with TODAY.com that the book is \u201cMargaret Atwood meets Sarah J. Maas.\u201d",
      "\u201cConform\u201d is set in a futuristic authoritarian state where people are sharply divided based on genetic anomalies. Emeline is given the chance to ascend to a higher rank when she\u2019s chosen as a mating partner of one of the society\u2019s elites, but finds a romantic connection with a rebel. (On the topic of the love triangle, Sullivan says she\u2019s firmly Team Emeline.)",
      "Within weeks, Sullivan\u2019s first idea turned into the outline of a trilogy, and then three trilogies, all outlining how this society came to be and where it\u2019s going. Sullivan\u2019s next book is the first of the prequel trilogy, and she predicts debates over the order to read the books in.",
      "Sullivan isn\u2019t quite surprised that she had the capacity to write and outline these books. She says she was always a daydreamer and wrote previously, including some Dramione fanfic.",
      "\u201cThe fact that I wasn\u2019t intimidated by it, and was like, \u2018No, I\u2019m going to do it.\u2019 That\u2019s probably what shocked me most,\u201d she says.",
      "She says writing helped her out of the rut she was in when the idea first arrived.",
      "\u201cBy the time I had finished \u2018Conform,\u2019 I was in such a better place emotionally and mentally,\u201d she says, adding she also went to therapy.",
      "Now, she says she\u2019s receiving messages that \u201cConform\u201d has helped readers escape their own lives and sparked joy.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted to do,\u201d she says.",
      "Below, read an excerpt from \u201cConform,\u201d which is on sale Oct. 14.",
      "Read an Excerpt From 'Conform'",
      "\u201cThis way, Ms. Emeline. He is waiting.\u201d",
      "My heart began an erratic dance. Not trusting myself to speak, I nodded. As we approached the curtains, they pulled back automati\u00adcally.",
      "A magnificent secret garden unlike anything I had ever seen sprawled before me, stealing my breath. Flowers of all kinds ex\u00adploded everywhere\u2014large white hydrangeas, amethyst wisteria, honeysuckle, buttercups, and orange lilies\u2014spilling onto the tile, climbing the walls, and hanging from the ceiling. Small glowing orbs swayed from the ceiling among the wisteria, almost like stars. In the very center of the room stood a beautiful willow. A tree in the sky. It was art. Did the Elite see it? They destroyed ancient art, yet created their own. Why?",
      "Hesitantly, I followed the attendant into the hidden paradise. I didn\u2019t know where to look first, every step revealing more beauty. Alone, I might have run my hands along the flowers and stopped to smell each one.",
      "Life below, my life, was primitive and barren in comparison. I had been living a bleak existence, waiting in perpetual solitude. We all just accepted it.",
      "Lo didn\u2019t. I understood her constant nagging and dedication to improving her social standing. But the sweet perfume of the flowers turned sour at the truth that Minors were given the bare minimum while the Elite surrounded themselves with luxuries. Maybe a part of me wanted to be beguiled by the beauty surrounding me. Another part\u2014the part that didn\u2019t fit\u2014couldn\u2019t stand the divide.",
      "Bright colors and sparkling jewels adorned the Elites sitting at every table we passed. The glittering observers whispered behind heavily ringed hands or elaborate embroidered fans. My breath be\u00adcame too quick as more leaned in like a swarm of bees, lined eyes watching my every step.",
      "The rules from the Grooming slithered into my mind.",
      "Rule One: Remember your place. Although you are in the clouds, your MIND has deemed you defective. You are until your last breath a Minor Defect.",
      "I looked straight ahead, unable to meet anyone\u2019s eyes, even with the lens. My golden dress was a stark, unsettling difference in a rain\u00adbow sea of colorful flowers and gowns. I was the antithesis of the delicate blooms. It was as if I were the sun shining brightly, and all the flowers and people revolved around my presence. Never had I felt so seen. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure it was a good thing.",
      "The attendant finally stopped at a small table below the willow, its branches swaying gently. The man blocked the person waiting for me at the table. A chair scraped against the ground, and my stomach twisted viciously, heartbeats turned violent, slamming into my chest like it might bolt, and I fought the urge to follow it all the way back to the surface forever below.",
      "\u201cYour guest, sir.\u201d The man in gray stepped to the side, gesturing to me before disappearing in the throng of flowers and people.",
      "My heart stopped. The buzzing of conversation, the blooms, and even the tree fell away. Silence found me as the most beautiful man I had ever seen waited \u2014 for me.",
      "\u201cHello, Emeline.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe slogan \u2018Because you\u2019re worth it\u2019 has always been more than makeup, lipstick and hair care. It really is about being a mantra for women to understand their value in life, their jobs, their relationships and their families,\u201d Longoria says. \u201cFor the L\u2019Oreal family to extend that to everyday people and to put the spotlight on women doing amazing things in their community, it just felt so on brand, so perfect.\u201d",

      "Now what?",
      "A ceasefire in Gaza came into effect Friday at 12 p.m. local time (5 a.m. ET) and troops have pulled back to agreed lines, the Israeli military said, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government approved the first phase of the deal intended to bring the war to an end.",
      "A 72-hour window is now open in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages. The White House has said it expected hostages to be released Monday. Forty-eight hostages remain to be returned, of whom Israel says it believes 20 are alive.",
      "An Israeli official briefed on the matter told NBC News that all living hostages would be released at one time.",
      "In exchange, Israel is to release 250 prisoners serving life sentences and 1,700 Palestinians detained after Oct. 7, 2023. A final list of prisoners has not yet been made public, but an Israeli government spokeswoman said Thursday it would not include the prominent Palestinian political leader Marwan Barghouti, seen by many as a potential unifying figure.",

      "The agreement comes just more than two years to the day after the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Israel that killed 1,200 people and around 250 kidnapped.

    "summary": "President Donald Trump had to maintain the trust of Israel and a series of Arab- and Muslim-majority nations. His ability to walk that tightrope was tested repeatedly.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s personal touch \u2014 both as a heavy hand and a gentle guide \u2014 played a pivotal role at key moments in the development of a Middle East peace deal that promises to bring an end to Israel\u2019s two-year war in Gaza, current and former officials in the United States and other nations told NBC News.",
      "Trump announced on Wednesday that the \u201cfirst phase\u201d of the plan to end the conflict in Gaza had been agreed to, with a pause in fighting and the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Trump called it \u201ca great deal\u201d in a brief interview with NBC News on Thursday morning. \u201cEverybody is happy,\u201d he said.",
      "The deal accelerated over several crucial moments \u2014 Israel\u2019s strike on Qatar, discussions on the sidelines of the recent United Nations General Assembly in New York City and Jared Kushner\u2019s conversations with his father-in-law, these sources said.",
      "Also helpful, though, was an old-fashioned deadline. In recent weeks, Trump told advisers he wanted to announce a deal by Oct. 7, the second anniversary of the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel that precipitated the war, according to two people familiar with his instructions.",
      "The president, one of the people said, was fixated on the date both for its symbolic significance and because he saw it as a way to herald a new step forward in Israel\u2019s relationship with Saudi Arabia when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits Washington next month.",
      "This account of the Trump administration\u2019s role in the ceasefire deal is based on interviews with a dozen sources in three countries.",
      "As the war in Gaza ground on \u2014 with more than 67,000 dead, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, declarations of famine and images of wounded children across social media \u2014 it threatened Trump\u2019s vision for a more interconnected Middle East that he began to implement in his first term with the Abraham Accords, which established relationships between Israel and several Arab nations.",
      "The war\u2019s intensity also presented an opportunity for Trump to coalesce regional powers around a peace plan to disarm Hamas, preclude Israel from seizing the West Bank and provide for the redevelopment of Gaza.",
      "Israel and Hamas agreed Wednesday to the first phase of that proposal \u2014 a ceasefire and an Israeli military pullback to a \u201cyellow line\u201d within Gaza that leaves more of the strip under the control of Palestinians. That is to be followed by Hamas\u2019 returning as many as 20 Israeli hostages and the remains of as many as 28 hostages and Israel\u2019s releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and the remains of 15 dead Gazans.",
      "Trump was able to announce the pact just one day after his target.",
      "To do that, Trump had to maintain the trust of Israel and of a series of Arab- and Muslim-majority nations that could influence Hamas and Palestinian civilians. At the same time, he had to apply pressure. His ability to walk that tightrope was tested repeatedly.",
      "And, at times, the darkest hours yielded the biggest breakthroughs.",
      "Qatar strikes",
      "After months of negotiations with no result, a turning point came in September in the form of a surprise attack.",
      "Israeli forces launched airstrikes on the Qatari capital, Doha, in an attempt to kill the leaders of Hamas. Six people were killed, including a member of Qatar\u2019s internal security force.",
      "Over the course of the war, Israel has struck in Iran, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, in addition to Gaza.",
      "But this was different. Qatar is a U.S. ally that hosts a strategic air base with 10,000 American troops. Trump and his team had come to view the Persian Gulf nation as a trusted partner in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The parents of an Israeli hostage had been in Doha that very morning, meeting Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani.",
      "The bombing blindsided and angered the White House, as well as the Arab world.",
      "Asked about the strikes at the time, Trump told reporters: \u201cI was very unhappy about it. Very unhappy about every aspect.\u201d",
      "But instead of killing the prospect of a deal, the Israeli attack prompted Trump and his team to ratchet up pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring the war to an end.",
      "\u201cIt was the moment that Trump said, \u2018Enough,\u2019\u201d said a former Israeli official, adding: \u201cThis deal, almost identical, has been on the table for over a year now. Netanyahu didn\u2019t want to do it, but Trump left him no choice.\u201d",
      "\u201cBoth Netanyahu and Hamas tried to say \u2018yes, but\u2019 to stall, but Trump decided to hear only \u2018yes\u2019 and pushed them into the corner,\u201d the former official said.",
      "Shortly after the strikes, Trump issued a warning to Israel: He would not support the annexation of the West Bank, as some far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet had proposed.",
      "The Americans, the Qataris and other Arab governments saw the surprise strikes as an opportunity to exert leverage, according to an Arab official and former Israeli officials with knowledge of the diplomatic talks.",
      "\u201cIt was a catalyst to bring pressure on the Israeli government, which had been the main obstacle to a deal,\u201d the Arab official said.",
      "U.N. General Assembly sidelines",
      "Weeks after the strikes on Doha, the U.N. General Assembly met along the bank of the East River in New York City.",
      "It was on the sidelines \u2014 where, historically, deals are often solidified with face-to-face interactions and handshakes \u2014 that the discussions \u201creally took a turn,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.",
      "Trump convened a meeting at the General Assembly with Arab- and Muslim-majority nations to sell his 20-point peace plan. Rubio said that is where Trump \u201ccreated this coalition\u201d before he presented the proposal to Netanyahu at the White House at the end of last month.",
      "Crucially, during that visit, Trump persuaded Netanyahu to call Al-Thani, the Qatari prime minister, to apologize for the Israeli strikes in Qatar. That allowed Qatar to remain engaged as a key intermediary in peace talks.",
      "\u201cIt is my understanding that the Qatari government viewed the apology as a way to move forward, and it saw its role, that it had invested in for quite a long time, as still vital to achieving a ceasefire and hopefully peace in the future,\u201d Nawaf Al-Thani, a former Qatari defense attach\u00e9 to the United States, told NBC News.",
      "Trump\u2019s handling of that episode was reminiscent for many observers of the way he reacted to Israel\u2019s and Iran\u2019s striking each other during a ceasefire agreement following American bombing raids on Iranian nuclear facilities in June.",
      "\u201cWe basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don\u2019t know what the f--- they\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump, clearly frustrated, said at the time. His rebuke of Israel, along with Iran, reassured Arab countries with ties to Shia-majority Iran. In that way, a former senior White House official said, Trump\u2019s messages to Israel after its strikes in Iran and in Qatar were similar.",
      "\u201cBoth showed the president\u2019s commitment to Israel, but also his commitment to the Arab countries,\u201d the former official said.",
      "Seeing the United States pushing Israel over the strike in Doha helped persuade Qatar, Turkey and other Arab governments to press Hamas, making it clear that the time for delays and foot-dragging was over, the officials said.",
      "As the negotiations advanced, both the U.S. and Arab negotiators chose to convey a united and optimistic front, placing Netanyahu at risk of potentially insulting Trump if he questioned the 20-point proposal Trump put on the table, the former Israeli official said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump people and Arab world just briefed total confidence and optimism before anything was finalized to make it seem like a done deal, which made saying \u2018no\u2019 a public affront to Trump, and Netanyahu can\u2019t do that,\u201d the former official said. \u201cIt was a show of very effective statecraft and use of leverage.\u201d",
      "Kushner\u2019s role",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, became his chief envoy to the Middle East. There he was delivering a speech at the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. There he was building relationships with Arab leaders, focusing on economic relations.",
      "Years later, Kushner became deeply involved in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. He emerged, former Israeli officials said, because he carries important influence with regional governments and the president.",
      "\u201cKushner was the architect,\u201d a former Israeli official said.",
      "Kushner was able to convey to Trump that the conflict in Gaza threatened the future of his biggest diplomatic success the last time he was in office \u2014 the Abraham Accords.",
      "That deal produced peace agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. Trump has aimed to extend it to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.",
      "\u201cThe entire legacy was in jeopardy,\u201d the former Israeli official said.",
      "Kushner and Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, traveled to Egypt on Tuesday to hammer out details of the deal, according to senior U.S. officials.",
      "They went over various aspects of the proposal, including how Israeli military forces would be redeployed and the order of hostage and prisoner releases, the officials said, with one adding that an important feature of their work was the decision to \u201cseparate the peace deal into two clear phases.\u201d That allowed for an agreement on the exchange of people, while the deal\u2019s other points are negotiated in a second phase.",
      "The U.S. negotiators called Trump on Wednesday evening to get his final guidance before he announced that a deal was in place, the officials said. Israel\u2019s government approved the exchange Thursday evening.",
      "\u201cIt came together quick in a good way,\u201d Witkoff told NBC News in a brief telephone interview Thursday morning as he waited to board a flight to Israel.",
      "Kushner and Witkoff had about \u201cfive hours of sleep in the last three days,\u201d senior U.S. officials said.",
      "American negotiators expect the next phase to be \u201calmost a permanent ceasefire until all the other issues we have to deal with are negotiated and considered,\u201d one of the officials said, pointing to outstanding topics as thorny as how Gaza will be governed.",
      "U.S. officials cautioned Thursday that there is still a lot of work to do to ensure the ceasefire holds and the rest of the plans can be finalized and implemented.",
      "\u201cThis is a very delicate time,\u201d one of them said.",
      "Trump said he plans to travel to Egypt to put his signature on the Middle East agreement in the coming days.",
      "And the U.S. military is preparing options to deploy as many as 200 U.S. troops to Israel to support the International Stabilization Force for the long-term internal security solution for Gaza and to support the flow of humanitarian aid and security assistance into Gaza, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "\u201cThey will not be in Gaza. No U.S. boots on the ground in Gaza,\u201d one of the officials said.",
      "The effort will be called the Civil-Military Coordination Cell, and U.S. troops could begin arriving in Israel immediately, the officials said.",
      "In addition to supporting moving aid and assistance into Gaza, they are expected to support the deconfliction mechanism between the two sides \u2014 basically making sure that both sides are upholding their part of the security agreements.",
      "\u201cI think right now,\u201d a senior U.S. official said, \u201cwe\u2019re just focused on making sure any gaps are patched up in the agreement.\u201d",
      "Trump allies say the agreement between Israel and Hamas, forged under immense pressure on both sides \u2014 including Trump\u2019s broad support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, the limits he placed on Netanyahu and a threat to let Israel destroy Hamas if it did not agree to the pact \u2014 is a testament to the validity of his peace-through-strength approach to foreign policy.",
      "\u201cHe understands that sometimes you have to use force to set the structure for peace,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who is close to Trump, said in an interview last week."

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth promised Wednesday that \"firepower\" was coming for Ukraine amid speculation that Washington could hand Kyiv long-range Tomahawk missiles to pressure Russia to end the war.",
      "Speaking ahead of a NATO defense ministers' meeting in Brussels, Hegseth said members of the alliance have stepped up their commitments to Ukraine and those commitments \u201cwill soon translate into capabilities,\u201d partly through an initiative by which NATO countries buy U.S. weapons and supply them to Kyiv.",
      "President Donald Trump has been considering giving Ukraine the American-made Tomahawk missiles, which could be used to strike deep into Russia \u2014 something the Kremlin said would signal a \u201cqualitatively new stage of escalation.\u201d",
      "It was not clear if Tomahawks were part of the \u201cfirepower\u201d promised by Hegseth on Wednesday.",
      "The Kremlin has warned that Western weapons raise the risk of widening the war.",
      "It has cast the eastward expansion of NATO, a military alliance founded after World War II to counter the then-Soviet Union, as one of the reasons for what it calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cpeace through strength\u201d strategy to settle conflicts was working, Hegseth said, alluding to the president's brokering of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.",
      "He said peace comes \"not when you use strong words or wag your finger,\" but \"when you have strong and real capabilities that adversaries respect.\u201d",
      "Trump will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, where the Tomahawk missiles are likely to be discussed.",
      "In line with the Kremlin\u2019s rhetoric, Trump said earlier this week that providing the long-range missiles to Kyiv could be \u201ca new step of aggression.\u201d But he also said he might tell Russia \u201cif this war is not going to get settled, I\u2019m going to send [Ukraine] Tomahawks.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, the president said he wanted to know what Ukraine planned to do with the missiles before agreeing to supply them.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has not approved or proposed any new major arms packages for Ukraine and has yet to follow through on threats to impose new sanctions on Russia.",
      "While running for president, Trump promised to solve the war within 24 hours, but has since conceded it has proved to be a much more difficult task, turning his attention to other conflicts after monthslong negotiations with Putin yielded little in the way of progress.",
      "After initially laying blame on Ukraine for the war and suggesting Kyiv would have to cede territory, he has since shifted his position and said Ukraine could win back all of its occupied land from Russia. In more than 3\u00bd years of fighting, Kyiv, backed by its Western allies, has managed to reclaim chunks of its land through successful counteroffensive campaigns, but Russia still occupies about one-fifth of Ukraine's territory.",
      "Buoyed by his Middle East breakthroughs this week, Trump now appears to have his sights set firmly on resolving the war in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s focus on Russia first,\u201d Trump said, addressing other conflicts his special envoy Steve Witkoff could tackle next during a triumphant address to the Israeli parliament on Monday. Witkoff has previously traveled to Moscow for talks with Putin."

      "In Gaza, relief at Israeli forces' withdrawal to pre-approved boundaries mingled with despair. Families returned to destroyed homes, searched in the debris of bombed buildings for the remains of loved ones and despaired over where their next meal would come from.",
      "Nimrod Goren, the president of the Mitvim Institute, an Israeli think tank, said that while the realization of the first stage of Trump\u2019s plan \u201cis a huge achievement,\u201d the big questions about the future of Palestinians and Israelis are still unanswered.",
      "Gaza's immediate needs",
      "Palestinians welcomed the relative silence that fell over the enclave after a ceasefire was declared Friday, bringing a halt to the constant hum of drones and exploding bombs.",
      "Israel's war has killed close to 70,000 people, according to Palestinian health officials, and most of the buildings in the enclave have been damaged or destroyed. Most of the population is still living without adequate access to food, shelter, care and other vital needs."

    "summary": "New dietary guidelines from the British Dietetic Association say that kiwis \u2014 along with rye bread and certain supplements \u2014 can help improve constipation symptoms.",
    "story": [
      "When it comes to the best foods for easing chronic constipation, are kiwis on your grocery list?",
      "New dietary guidelines from the British Dietetic Association, published Monday, say that kiwis \u2014 along with rye bread and certain supplements \u2014 can help improve constipation symptoms.",
      "The guidelines, the authors say, are the first evidence-based recommendations for treating constipation with diet, not medications.",
      "Chronic constipation affects around 16% of adults worldwide, and constipation is the reason for almost 2.5 million doctors visits in the U.S. per year, according to the American College of Gastroenterology.",
      "Eirini Dimidi, a lead author of the guidelines, said the existing guidance for managing chronic constipation is largely focused on pharmaceuticals.",
      "The few dietary recommendations out there \u2014 eat more fiber, drink more water \u2014 are ambiguous and often lack research to back them up.",
      "\u201cI remember looking at the guidelines and realizing that they are just really limited in the number of dietary recommendations they make,\u201d said Dimidi, a registered dietician and associate professor in the department of nutritional sciences at King\u2019s College in London.",
      "To come up with the new guidelines, the authors analyzed clinical trials and evaluated each method\u2019s effectiveness for managing constipation. The recommendations were jointly published in the Journal of Human Nutrition & Dietetics and Neurogastroenterology & Motility.",
      "What is chronic constipation?",
      "Constipation \u2014 defined by fewer than three bowel movements a week \u2014 is considered chronic if it lasts for more than three months.",
      "Symptoms can vary from person to person, but common ones are hard or lumpy stool, stomachache and nausea. More serious symptoms of constipation include blood in stool, fever and vomiting.",
      "Constipation can be caused by diet, lifestyle, certain illnesses and injuries, and some medications. It\u2019s extremely common, affecting people of all ages, gender and race.",
      "\u201cI see chronic constipation across the spectrum,\u201d said Sue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. \u201cI see it in toddlers, I see it in school-age children, I see it in adults. So it\u2019s a common thing,\u201d she said.",
      "Chronic constipation can severely impact people\u2019s lives and limit their physical abilities, worsening their quality of life and work productivity.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re chronically constipated, you may not be able to even participate in physical activity, because you feel bloated, you\u2019re in pain, you\u2019re achy, it may affect your mood,\u201d said Anderson-Haynes, who also owns 360 Girls and Women, a nutrition and health practice based in Boston.",
      "How is chronic constipation treated?",
      "Dr. William Chey, professor of gastroenterology at the University of Michigan and incoming president of the American College of Gastroenterology, said most studies on treating chronic constipation have focused on fiber supplements, like psyllium, and medications, like bisacodyl, senna and amitiza.",
      "He added American guidelines \u201cfocus pretty heavily on medical therapies for chronic constipation.\u201d",
      "Traditional constipation treatments include increasing fiber intake through foods like prunes and other fruits and vegetables, drinking more water, and using different kinds of laxatives.",
      "While the new guidelines include certain fiber-rich foods and fiber supplements, there\u2019s no guidance on a \u201chigh-fiber diet\u201d overall.",
      "\u201cWhen we were building these guidelines, and looking at the literature, we were expecting a lot more evidence on a high-fiber diet, and there simply isn\u2019t enough in constipation,\u201d Dimidi said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence that a high-fiber diet is very beneficial for our overall health and also for elements of gut health, such as reducing the risk of colorectal cancer,\u201d she added. \u201cBut when it comes to constipation, specifically, we just don\u2019t have enough evidence to say that it improves constipation.\u201d",
      "What are the new recommendations?",
      "Chey, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new guidelines, said the recommendations \u201cprovide a valuable road map to things that [people] can try as they\u2019re waiting to see their primary care physician.\u201d",
      "He added that people with more severe cases of constipation may need to see a gastroenterologist.",
      "The recommendations include:",
      "Fiber supplements: More than 10 grams of fiber supplements, such as psyllium, per day can improve stool frequency and consistency and aid in reducing straining. Fiber supplements should be slowly introduced and dosage gradually increased.Probiotics: Certain strains of probiotics, including, B. lactis and Bacillus coagulans Unique IS2, may help some people with symptoms. If taking one, patients should take a supplement of their choice and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for at least four weeks.Magnesium oxide supplements: 0.5-1.5 grams daily can help with stool frequency and consistency, reduce symptoms such as bloating and abdominal pain and improve overall quality of life. Dosage should start at 0.5 grams per day and be gradually increased weekly.Kiwis: Three daily, with or without the skin, can help improve stool frequency but not consistency.Rye bread: Six to eight slices of rye bread per day can also aid stool frequency, but not consistency. The authors noted that this amount may not be realistic for some people.High mineral-content water: In combination with other treatments, 0.5-1.5 liters per day of high mineral-content water may also help. One of the key minerals in high mineral-content water, magnesium, is a known laxative.",

      "Still, overall, he said, \u201cI think these kinds of recommendations are going to be very helpful.\u201d",
      "Dimidi said she hopes the release of the guidelines can \u201cempower\u201d those with chronic constipation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping [the guidance] means that clinicians are very well-informed and can provide personalized advice to their patients that is very effective,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also that people themselves with constipation can access now evidence-based information, feel empowered to take control of the symptoms and improve a condition that has a tremendous impact on quality of life.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A jubilant Donald Trump celebrated a hard-won ceasefire Monday in the conflict between Israel and Hamas militants, while inviting Middle East leaders to create a lasting peace that unlocks the region\u2019s potential for dramatic economic growth.",
      "As all 20 living hostages rejoined their families in Israel, Trump spoke to the nation's parliament in Jerusalem and marked a momentous breakthrough in a war that began just over two years ago.",
      "The U.S. president who wrung a peace deal from bitter combatants told the Knesset that \u201cthe long and painful nightmare is finally over.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not only the end of a war,\u201d said Trump, who had arrived in Israel in the morning. \u201cThis is the end of an age of terror and death and the beginning of the age of faith and hope and of God.",
      "\"It\u2019s the start of a grand concord and lasting harmony for Israel and all the nations of what will soon be a truly magnificent region.\u201d",
      "Making it so won\u2019t be easy. Old antagonisms could resurface at any point, jeopardizing the truce that Trump and his advisers brokered over the past few months.",
      "An accusation of bad faith came right away. Family members said Monday that Hamas had released the remains of only four of 28 deceased hostages, breaking a commitment. They called for an \u201cimmediate suspension\u201d of the ceasefire agreement until all the bodies are returned.",
      "Dueling statements from Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also suggested they differed over something as fundamental as whether the fighting was truly over.",
      "Netanyahu, speaking on television Sunday, said, \u201cThe campaign is not over\u201d and that \u201csome of our enemies are trying to recover in order to attack us again.\u201d",
      "Asked about that on Air Force One en route to Israel, Trump told reporters: \u201cThe war is over. The war is over. The war is over, OK? You understand that?\u201d Lest there be any doubt, Trump reinforced the point during his remarks to the Knesset while Netanyahu sat and listened.",
      "\u201cNow you can be a little nicer, Bibi, because you\u2019re not at war anymore, Bibi,\u201d he said, using Netanyahu\u2019s nickname.",
      "After finishing his speech, Trump flew to Egypt to take part in a peace conference with the leaders of 20 nations, posing for pictures in front of a sign proclaiming, \u201cPeace in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "Notably missing from the signing ceremony were the two parties who\u2019d been at war: Hamas and Israel. Trump had invited Netanyahu to the ceremony in Sharm el-Sheikh, but the Israeli leader chose not to attend. His office cited the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah as the reason. Without Netanyahu and a representative from Hamas, the day lacked what often turns out to be an iconic picture at such Middle East peace ceremonies: the U.S. president and the combatants linking arms.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary moment and demonstration of will by an American president: a bid to end the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza,\u201d Aaron David Miller, a former State Department Middle East analyst and negotiator in Republican and Democratic administrations, said in an interview. \u201cBut to do that you need to climb several very high mountains.\u201d",
      "Richard Goldberg, who served on the White House National Security Council in Trump\u2019s first term, wrote on X: \u201cToday is a celebration. Trump and Netanyahu delivered the opportunity for peace through strength.\u201d",
      "\u201cTomorrow is harder,\u201d he added. \u201cWords like demilitarizing, disarming and de-radicalizing are just words without action. Every step will be filled with pitfalls. Every step will be contested by forces that do not support the Trump vision for peace. By Iran. By the Muslim Brotherhood. By the U.N. By others.\u201d",
      "As for the future, the Trump administration appears to have less of a blueprint than an aspiration. Last month, Trump released a 20-point peace plan that starts with ending the war in Gaza and ends with forging a broader peace between Israel and the Palestinians.",
      "The first part is specific; the latter, vague. The 19th point says that certain conditions that include reconstruction of Gaza and political reform must be met and then, once that happens, \u201cthe conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\u201d The authors set no hard deadlines or timetables for deciding the Palestinians\u2019 fate.",
      "At home, Trump is enmeshed in a government shutdown with no end in sight. But presidents enjoy far more latitude when it comes to foreign policy, and Trump appears to be savoring his achievement overseas.",
      "A senior administration official traveling with Trump on the quick trip to Israel and Egypt said of the president\u2019s mood: \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen him so proud.\u201d",
      "Another official, back in Washington, said: \u201cEveryone is taking great pride in it and wants to be part of it. And it\u2019s an acute reminder that we can do the hard things.\u201d",
      "Trump tapped two confidants to negotiate the deal: his son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House envoy Steve Witkoff, a billionaire real estate developer. Both watched in the Knesset as Trump delivered an hour-long speech, relishing the moment and riffing in ways that made members laugh and applaud in surprise.",
      "\u201cTrump! Trump! Trump,\u201d lawmakers chanted. Some wore his signature piece of campaign memorabilia, a red hat with a twist that read: \u201cTrump, the Peace President.\u201d",
      "Seizing on the good will, Trump made a personal plea to help a friend. Netanyahu is facing trial on corruption charges. Trump went off script to beseech Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon the prime minister.",
      "\u201cThis man is a good man right here. I have an idea. Mr. President, why don\u2019t you give him a pardon?\u201d Trump said.",
      "Now that the fighting has stopped and the hostages have been returned, Trump's interest could potentially wane. As the leader with the most leverage in the region, Trump needs to stay involved to make progress on his vision of a transformed Middle East, foreign policy analysts said.",
      "For Trump, there is at least one clear incentive to stay engaged.",
      "He lost out on the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize last week, and his supporters are already lobbying for him to get the award next year.",
      "\"You have to wonder whether he stays with this,\" Miller, the former negotiator, said. \"That will depend primarily on whether there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow: the elusive Nobel, which he believes he deserves.\""

      "As Israeli hostages are freed and Palestinian prisoners and detainees released \u2014 and after President Donald Trump's lengthy address to Israel\u2019s parliament on Monday \u2014 focus is shifting to what comes next.",
      "Some of the longest applause for Trump's speech came when he said that virtually the whole region had endorsed a plan for Gaza to be demilitarized and Hamas to disarm \u2014 key elements of his 20-point plan that have yet to actually be agreed upon.",
      "Now that phase one of his plan is being executed, negotiators and neighboring countries will watch whether key points of Trump\u2019s proposal will be accepted by both Israel and Hamas in talks on the next phases.",
      "Last few days",
      "A ceasefire came into effect in Gaza on Friday at noon local time, (5 a.m. ET), after the first phase of Trump's plan was agreed by Israel and Hamas, bringing relative calm to the enclave for the first time in months since the last truce collapsed in March.",
      "Under the first phase of Trump's plan, 20 living hostages were  handed over to Israel on Monday.  The remains of a further 28 hostages held by Hamas were expected to be released within 72 hours, although only four were initially, much to the disappointment of families.",
      "Israel also pledged to release 250 convicted prisoners and 1,700 Palestinians detained since Oct. 7.  Over 150 of the freed prisoners were deported to Egypt.",
      "More aid has begun to flow into the enclave in recent days, although it falls far short of what aid workers say is necessary.",
      "Now what?",
      "Hamas has long asserted that it would not release the last of the hostages until Israeli groups leave Gaza entirely, but having agreed to the first phase of Trump's plan, the militant group is relying on guarantees from Trump that a full withdrawal will eventually happen.",
      "When and if Israel withdraws fully remains unclear.",
      "Meanwhile, it is also unclear whether Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, will agree to a key stipulation of Trump's overall plan, as well as a crucial demand from Israel \u2014 that it disarm.",
      "Hamas has long refused calls to lay down arms, saying it has a right to armed resistance until Israel ends its occupation of Palestinian territories \u2014 and that has been a key sticking point in talks to negotiate an end to Israel's offensive in Gaza.",
      "In an interview with Al Jazeera on Oct. 9, senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said that no Palestinian would accept surrendering weapons and that the people of Gaza were in greater need than ever of resistance.",
      "The militant group has agreed to step down from leadership over the territory and relinquish governance to a transitional body of Palestinian technocrats, which would be overseen by an international body, dubbed the \"Board of Peace.\" This body is expected to be headed by Trump, with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair also named as a possible member of the oversight body.",
      "Noting the plan aboard the Air Force One on Monday en route to Israel, Trump said he first wanted to find out whether \"Tony would be popular with all.\"",
      "\"I like Tony, I\u2019ve always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he\u2019s an acceptable choice to everybody,\" he added.",
      "The idea of Blair joining the board has already drawn early criticism, with his reputation in the region shadowed by his decision to back the U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq \u2014 and claims by the U.S. and Britain of Iraq having weapons of mass destruction found to be false.",
      "Trump optimistic",
      "Speaking aboard Air Force One on his way to Israel on Monday, Trump said he believed \"everybody is happy\" with his 20-point peace plan.",
      "Noting that much of Gaza now resembles a \"demolition site\" after more than two years of Israel's offensive in the enclave, Trump said cleanup efforts would begin \"pretty much immediately.\"",
      "During his address to the Knesset, Trump also said Israel has won all it can by force.",
      "\u201cNow, it is time to translate these victories against terrorists on the battlefield into the ultimate prize of peace and prosperity for the entire Middle East,\u201d he said.",
      "In Gaza, Palestinians across the enclave balanced their hopes for peace against fears that the ceasefire won't hold, as many return to the areas where their homes once stood.",
      "\"Everything is gone; no necessities of life remain,\" one man told NBC News.",
      "\"So, why do you live for? Our money, our homes that we worked hard for years \u2014 it\u2019s all gone,\" he said. \"Nothing is left.\""

      "The public push to make Donald Trump the winner of the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize began within hours of the committee\u2019s announcement Friday that the honoree this year is Maria Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader.",
      "Snubbed by the Nobel selection committee, Trump should be the clear front-runner for the prize next year, given the breakthrough he reached toward ending the war in Gaza, his supporters said.",
      "Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., said Friday he would introduce a resolution in Congress saying Trump deserves the honor.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll be a strong candidate next year, and he should have been a slam dunk this year, but unfortunately, the committee got it wrong,\u201d Carter said in an interview. \u201cBut they made their decision. So, next year they\u2019ll have an opportunity to make up for it.\u201d",
      "Jason Miller, a former senior Trump campaign official, told NBC News: \u201cThe legacy of the Nobel Peace Prize will be irreparably damaged if it isn\u2019t awarded to President Trump in 2026. The voices calling for President Trump to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2026 are only going to get louder.\u201d",
      "Few voices were louder than Trump\u2019s in making the case that he\u2019d earned the award this year. The president mounted a rare public campaign to win it based on seven peace deals he says he reached in global hotspots.",
      "He is inching closer to an eighth. A whirlwind bout of U.S.-led diplomacy has culminated in a ceasefire in Gaza. Hamas militants may release the remaining hostages early next week. And Trump plans to fly to the region this weekend to sign the accord and deliver a speech to the Israeli parliament.",
      "Trump has long said he didn\u2019t expect the five-member Norwegian selection committee to give him the award. The betting markets saw it the same way. Early this week, Polymarket, a prediction betting site, had put his odds of winning at 2%.",
      "The deadline for nominating people for the Nobel Prize was Jan. 31 \u2014 11 days into Trump\u2019s new term. Still, the committee was free to consider accomplishments that came later in the year as it winnowed down the candidates, said Nina Graeger, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, who handicaps the top candidates for the prize.",
      "\u201cWill you get the Nobel Prize? Absolutely not,\u201d Trump told an audience of generals and admirals last week. \u201cThey\u2019ll give it to some guy that didn\u2019t do a damn thing.\u201d",
      "But he believed it would be advantageous to strike the Middle East peace deal before the committee revealed the winner, a person who has been in meetings with him said. That way, Trump could make the argument that the committee process was \u201crigged\u201d; a president who ended so many conflicts rightly should have gotten the award that celebrates peace, this person said.",
      "Shortly after the winner was announced, Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, posted on social media that \u201cThe Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace.\u201d",
      "Much can happen in a year\u2019s time. If the peace deal in Gaza doesn\u2019t hold \u2014 if the fighting resumes and more Gazans die in the crossfire \u2014 Trump isn\u2019t likely to get credit for raising false hopes that peace was at hand, foreign policy analysts say.",
      "The committee will want to see if the peace deal that Trump describes as an historic triumph is real or ephemeral.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the peace plan will be sustainable and lasting,\u201d Graeger said. \u201cHe definitely should get credit for his efforts to end the war and really engaging with this process. But there are a lot of hurdles in the implementation of the plan.\u201d",
      "A second issue is whether the \u201cAmerica First\u201d president chooses to work more collaboratively with other nations over the coming year. In creating the prize, Swedish inventor and entrepreneur Alfred Nobel held that the winner should be someone who has \u201cdone the most or the best work for fraternity between nations,\u201d among other criteria.",
      "It doesn\u2019t help Trump\u2019s chances that he threatened to acquire Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal, analysts said.

      "The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded Friday to Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, who lives in hiding after attempting to run for the presidency last year against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Machado, 58, was recognized for keeping \"the flame of democracy burning amidst a growing darkness\" and \"ever-expanding authoritarianism in Venezuela.\"",
      "Despite speculation that President Donald Trump might win the prize for his role helping broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, among other things, Machado emerged as a late favorite in online betting platforms hours before the decision came.",
      "Reacting to the award Friday, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung accused the Nobel Committee of placing \"politics over peace.\"",
      "The winner, Machado, is currently in hiding and faces \"serious threats against her life\" having been blocked from running for president and expelled from office, J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, told a news conference in Oslo.",
      "\u201cOh, my God! I have no words,\u201d she kept repeating when given the news over the telephone by Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, who could be seen in a video of the call becoming visibly emotional as he spoke.",
      "\"I hope you understand that this is a movement; this is the achievement of a whole society. I'm just one person. I certainly do not deserve this,\" she said, learning of her accolade just minutes before it was made public. \"I'm honored, humbled and very grateful and behalf of the Venezuelan people. We're not there yet. We are working very hard to achieve it and I'm certain we will prevail.\"",
      "With nicknames such as \"the Lady of Steel\" and \"the Iron Lady,\" she has been among the most high profile victims of Maduro's intensifying crackdown against opposition figures, journalists and civil society during his increasingly repressive rule."

      "LONDON \u2014 Prince William has fought back tears during an emotional conversation with a woman who lost her husband to suicide, in a video released by Kensington Palace Friday.",
      "William, 43, was speaking to campaigner Rhian Mannings at her home in south Wales. Mannings lost her one-year-old son, George suddenly in 2012 to an undiagnosed illness. Five days later, her husband Paul died by suicide. Mannings said Paul blamed himself for their son's death.",
      "Mannings has since used her experience to launch a charity aimed at supporting parents who suffer the loss of a child or young adult.",
      "The video was released on World Mental Health Day to highlight suicide prevention efforts. The Prince and Princess of Wales\u2019 Royal Foundation is launching a new National Suicide Prevention Network, aiming to bring charities together to transform suicide prevention in the U.K. Manning\u2019s charity 2Wish will be part of the network. According to statistics cited in the video, someone in the U.K. dies by suicide every 90 minutes.",
      "\u201cI will forever go over those last few days with him wondering what I missed,\" Mannings says about her Paul's suicide. \"We were just so happy and I think this just shows it really can happen to anyone.\u201d",
      "William, the heir to the throne, asked Mannings what she would say to her late husband if she could.",
      "\u201cI would just like to sit him down like this and just say, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you come to me?\u2019 Because he\u2019s missed out on just so much joy, and we would have been OK. And I think that\u2019s what the hardest thing is, we would have been OK,\u201d Mannings tells William, who then becomes visibly emotional.",
      "\"Are you OK?\" Mannings asks the prince, who takes time to gather himself before continuing. \"It's hard to ask these questions,\" William says.",
      "\u201cThe best way to prevent suicide is to talk about it. Talk about it early, talk about it with your loved ones, those you trust, your friends,\u201d William says."

    "story": [
      "The Israeli government approved the first part of the peace plan to end the conflict in Gaza, after a brutal two-year war that has ravaged the Palestinian enclave and sparked a global outcry, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said early on Friday local time.",
      "\u201cThe government has just now approved the framework for the release of all of the hostages \u2014 the living and the deceased,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office said in a statement posted on X.",
      "Under the terms of the deal, the ceasefire should take effect within 24 hours.",
      "President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he plans to travel to Egypt for an official signing of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas and that hostages will be released \u201con Monday or Tuesday.\u201d",
      "Trump's announcement on Wednesday that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire deal was widely welcomed Thursday by world leaders, the families of hostages and Palestinians who have endured more than two years of war.",
      "But huge questions remain about whether Trump's 20-point plan can successfully resolve the long-term future of the Gaza Strip, with uncertainty over its directive for Hamas to disband, as well as the governance of the shattered enclave.",
      "A spokesperson for Netanyahu's office said Thursday that a ceasefire would take effect 24 hours after the Cabinet had agreed on the deal and hostages would be released after 72 hours.",
      "Separately, the United States military is preparing options to deploy as many as 200 U.S. troops to Israel to support stabilization in Gaza and the flow of humanitarian aid and security assistance into the enclave, two U.S. officials familiar with the planning said.",
      "The U.S. troops will stay in Israel, where they will support logistics, transportation, engineering and planning, the officials said.",
      "\u201cThey will not be in Gaza. No U.S. boots on the ground in Gaza,\u201d one of the officials said.",
      "While the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appeared imminent, explosions were seen and heard in southern Gaza on Thursday morning.",
      "Trump said Wednesday on social media that the sides had taken the \"first steps toward a strong, durable, and everlasting peace,\" calling it \"a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding nations, and the United States of America.\"",
      "Among those to welcome the announcement was United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who urged \"all concerned to abide fully by the terms of the agreement\" and described it as a \"momentous opportunity\" to recognize \"the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas \"praised the great efforts made by President Trump and all mediators to reach this agreement.\"",
      "Netanyahu said he had \"a very moving and warm conversation\" with Trump in which they \"congratulated each other on the historic achievement of signing the agreement to release all the hostages,\" his office said in a statement.",
      "\"If indeed this deal can hold, it'll bring in an era of peace that we haven't seen now in the Middle East for several years, ever since that terrible attack on Oct. 7,\" Col. Steve Warren, former principal deputy chief of public affairs at the Pentagon, told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "The plan could come with a political cost for Netanyahu inside Israel. Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel\u2019s far-right national security minister, said Thursday on X that his party will \u201cbring down the government\u201d unless Hamas is \u201cdismantled.\u201d",
      "Celebrations and cautious optimism",
      "The announcement came after indirect talks involving Israel, Hamas and Steve Witkoff, U.S. ambassador at large, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.",
      "Trump announced the breakthrough one day after the second  anniversary of the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which 1,200 were killed and another 250 were kidnapped, and the start of Israel's war on Gaza in which more than 67,000 people \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 have been killed, according to local health officials.",
      "While many governments defended Israel's initial right to respond to the attack, the scale of civilian death and suffering wrought by its war have drawn increasing international condemnation and isolation for the Jewish state. Last month, the United Kingdom became the latest Western nation to recognize Palestine as a state, joining a majority of countries that now do so worldwide.",
      "Much of Gaza is now a rubble-strewn wasteland, with most of its buildings damaged or destroyed, according to the U.N. And the world's leading body on hunger, Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, has declared that a famine is now playing out inside the cramped territory.",
      "Israel's military operation has been deemed a genocide by a U.N. commission of inquiry, the world-leading International Association of Genocide Scholars, and human rights groups such as Amnesty International. Israel denies the charge, saying it is only attempting to destroy Hamas, which it blames for putting Palestinians in harm's way.",
      "After news arrived that the first ceasefire phase had been agreed to, some Palestinians on the ground inside Gaza were celebrating \u2014 cheering, dancing and singing, video showed.",
      "The first phase of Trump's deal would see the return of the remaining 48 hostages, around 20 of whom are believed to be alive, while the Israeli military said it was poised to withdraw from Gaza to an agreed-upon line.",
      "Trump told reporters that while the administration knows where most of the hostages believed to be alive are, finding the bodies of deceased hostages could be a \u201cbigger problem.\u201d",
      "An international force tasked with finding missing hostages in the Gaza Strip will be established as part of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, Israeli broadcaster i24 reported, citing Israeli officials.",
      "There were celebrations in \"Hostages Square\" in Tel Aviv early Thursday, the culmination of two years in which families and friends of the remaining captives have angrily campaigned for their government to prioritize their loved ones over the continuation of the conflict.",
      "They could be heard in video chanting \"Nobel prize to Trump\" \u2014 a reference to Trump's long-standing ambition to win the Nobel Peace Prize, which is being announced Friday.",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of Israeli hostages, said its members were feeling \"a mix of excitement, anticipation, and concern\" at the news. It expressed its \"profound gratitude to President Trump and his team for the leadership and determination that led to this historic breakthrough: an end to the war and a comprehensive agreement to return all the hostages.\"",
      "Ruby Chen, father of hostage Itay Chen, a U.S.-Israeli dual citizen, said on \"Stay Tuned NOW\" that while he shared this cautious hope, the captors had not \u201cprovided any sign of life\" for his son.",
      "Lasting agreement unclear",
      "While Hamas has agreed to participate in the hostage and prisoner exchange, it has not said it will disarm and disband \u2014 a key stipulation of Trump's proposal.",
      "A senior Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Thursday that no Palestinians would surrender their weapons, though he did not explain whether that was the group\u2019s official position.",
      "Prominent Palestinian prisoner Marwan Barghouti, whose supporters dub the \u201cPalestinian Nelson Mandela,\u201d will not be released as part of a ceasefire agreement, Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian told reporters Thursday.",
      "The first phase also does not address Gaza's medium and long-term future. Trump's plan says the enclave should be temporarily governed by a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\" overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" led by Trump and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. That is until the Palestinian Authority, the chief political organ in the region, can be \"reformed.\"",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said it was moving to \"adjusted deployment lines soon\" but warned that parts of Gaza were \"still considered a dangerous combat zone\" and that its troops were \"deployed and operating anywhere in the Strip.\"",
      "Israel shattered the previous ceasefire \u2014 which lasted from Jan. 19 to March 18 \u2014 by launching a barrage of deadly airstrikes that killed hundreds of Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, ending two months of relative calm and plunging Gaza into a renewed humanitarian crisis.",
      "Israel blamed Hamas for the resumption of hostilities, citing the militant group\u2019s refusal to meet Israel\u2019s demand to release more hostages."
