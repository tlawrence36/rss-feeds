      "In a bid to kickoff a new era for DC Studios, James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d opened with $122 million in U.S. and Canada ticket sales over the weekend",
      "NEW YORK -- In a bid to kickoff a new era for DC Studios, James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d opened with $122 million in U.S. and Canada ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "DC and Warner Bros. had a lot riding on \u201cSuperman.\u201d While the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s Marvel Studios has had its own share of struggles, the superheroes of DC have recently found mostly kryptonite in theaters. Films like \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\u201d \u201cThe Flash\u201d and \u201cShazam! Fury of the Gods\u201d all flopped.",
      "But \u201cSuperman,\u201d written and directed by Gunn, is intended as a new start. It\u2019s the first release fully steered by Gunn and Peter Safran, co-heads of DC Studios, since they were handed the keys to DC\u2019s superhero cinematic universe.",
      "And while Gunn turned \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d into a massive success for Marvel, his irreverent, idiosyncratic touch made the director \u2014 once a B-movie filmmaker with Troma Entertainment \u2014 an unlikely steward for one of the movies\u2019 most bankable and beloved brands.",
      "The roughly on-target opening was the third largest of 2025, and the first DC title to surpass $100 million in its opening weekend since \u201cWonder Woman\u201d in 2017.",
      "Ticket sales were relatively soft for \u201cSuperman\u201d overseas. In 78 international markets, it grossed $95 million. In China, it collected just $6.6 million.",
      "As an American icon, \u201cSuperman\u201d inevitably attracted political discourse. Some right-wing commentators criticized the movie as \u201cwoke\u201d after Gunn described the superhero from Krypton as \u201can immigrant.\u201d On X, the White House posted an image of President Donald Trump as Superman.",
      "In \u201cSuperman,\u201d which cost about $225 million to make, Gunn steers the Man of Steel in a drastically different tonal direction than in previous iterations from filmmaker Zack Snyder. Skipping the Kansas origin story, the film instead picks up with Superman ( David Corenswet ) after his first defeat. Rachel Brosnahan plays Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult is Lex Luthor.",
      "The \u201cSuperman\u201d debut didn\u2019t come close to besting the $166 million launch for Snyder\u2019s \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\u201d in 2016. But it did open higher, not accounting for inflation, than Snyder\u2019s \u201cMan of Steel.\u201d That film debuted with $116 million in 2013.",
      "But while Snyder\u2019s films were often unloved by critics, largely good reviews greeted Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman.\u201d On Rotten Tomatoes, it scored 82% fresh \u2014 the best for the franchise since the first two movies with Christopher Reeve: \u201cSuperman\u201d (1978) and \u201cSuperman II\u201d (1980). Audiences gave it an \u201cA-\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "\u201cSuperman\u201d faced sizeable competition too. Last week\u2019s top film, \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d slid to second place with $40 million. With \u201cSuperman\u201d soaking up many large-format screens, Universal Pictures\u2019 seventh \u201cJurassic\u201d film slipped a steep 57% from its opening weekend. Starring Scarlett Johansson, \u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d got off to a thunderous $318.3 million global start. In two weeks, it\u2019s amassed $529.5 million worldwide.",
      "Also still in the mix is Apple Studios\u2019 biggest box-office success yet, \u201cF1.\u201d Joseph Kosinski\u2019s Formula One action thriller, starring Brad Pitt, came in third with $13 million in its third weekend. The film, distributed by Warner Bros., has collected $393.4 million globally in three weeks. But it also carries a hefty price tag of roughly $250 million, plus at least $100 million in promotion.",

      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d will crown season seven's winning couple Sunday evening after a tumultuous season",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 \u201cLove Island USA\u201d will crown the winning couple of its seventh season Sunday evening, culminating a tumultuous summer full of explosive breakups and shock exits.",
      "The finale will air on Peacock at 6 p.m. Pacific/9 p.m. Eastern, following a chart-topping run since the season premiered on June 3. The show brings young singles together in a remote villa in Fiji to explore connections with the ultimate goal of finding love.",
      "The show, an American spinoff to the UK series, has shaken up reality TV, becoming Peacock\u2019s most watched entertainment series on mobile devices, according to NBC Universal.",
      "This season follows breakout success from last summer, which captured mainstream attention. \u201cLove Island: Beyond the Villa,\u201d a new series spinoff premiering Sunday, follows Season 6's main cast as they navigate relationships, life and newfound social media fame in Los Angeles.",
      "This season has also been under fire as two contestants \u2013 Cierra Ortega and Yulissa Escobar \u2013 left the villa following resurfaced posts in which they used racial slurs.",
      "Ortega, who was half of one of the season\u2019s strongest couples, left the villa just a week before the popular reality show\u2019s finale after old posts resurfaced that contained a slur against Asian people. She apologized for the resurfaced posts in a nearly five minute TikTok video Wednesday.",
      "Friday's episode saw the elimination of Ace Greene and Chelley Bissainthe, setting the stage for the finale. Green and Bissainthe were the only couple to maintain a relationship throughout most of the show.",
      "With $100,000 up for grabs for the winning couple, here\u2019s a look at the season\u2019s run and the final four couples heading into the finale.",
      "Stripped of their phones and connection with the outside world, five men and five women arrive in the villa and coupled up based on initial romantic interest. Throughout the season, the show introduces a steady stream of bombshells, new contestants who are brought in to disrupt existing relationships and build new storylines.",
      "Under constant surveillance, contestants partook in kissing competitions, heart rate challenges and drama-inducing games ripe for viral moments. The final six couples even became instant parents, startled awake by cries as they were tasked with taking care of baby dolls to further test their romantic connections.",
      "Halfway through the season, established couples were temporarily separated for Casa Amor, the show's ultimate test, and encouraged to explore new relationships with a fresh group of single contestants.",
      "Contestants are routinely dumped from the villa, removed either by a public vote or by the islanders themselves.",
      "Amaya Espinal, 25, made waves when she walked in as a bombshell early in the season and has been credited for some of the season\u2019s most viral moments.",
      "\u201cI never said I was perfect. I never said I didn\u2019t have any flaws. But at least I\u2019m pretty, and at least I\u2019m a little funny, and at least I\u2019m my own best friend,\u201d Espinal sang to herself in the makeup room, which prompted various covers online and inspired a Google pop-up message when you search up her nickname, Amaya Papaya.",
      "The New York City native, who labeled herself a \u201csensitive gangster,\u201d tested various connections, including Greene, Austin Shepard and Casa Amor contestant Zak Srakaew, that all fizzled out. Her previous partners on the show said Espinal, who is Dominican, expressed affection too quickly.",
      "A connection sparked between Espinal and Bryan Arenales, 28, a Casa Amor contestant, late in the season after he defended her, saying that \u201ccoming from a Hispanic household, calling someone babe, mi amor, mi vida, that\u2019s just how we talk.\u201d Arenales is from Boston and is of Puerto Rican and Guatemalan descent, according to his Instagram page.",
      "\u201cI always stress that as I get older, it\u2019s important to be with someone that keeps you young. I definitely think Amaya is that type of person,\u201d Arenales said during a confessional interview.",
      "Huda Mustafa, 24, and Chris Seeley, 27, explored different connections in Casa Amor before expressing interest in each other and eventually recoupling.",
      "Mustafa, from North Carolina, is the first contestant in the series to be a mother, which caused tension with her initial \u201cLove Island\u201d partner, Jeremiah Brown. The two coupled up and developed a strong connection very quickly, causing the other contestants to doubt their relationship.",
      "Mustafa and Brown, 25, had a turbulent experience, leading to some of the most viral arguments of the season. The two eventually broke off their relationship and Brown was dumped from the villa halfway through the season.",
      "Mustafa explored other connections but remained single until Casa Amor, where she built a connection with Seeley, who was initially interested in Bissainthe.",
      "The two quickly developed an unexpected connection, bonding over Seeley's struggles with leaving his overseas basketball career and Huda\u2019s difficult experience with motherhood.",
      "\u201cI think me and her are actually really good for each other,\u201d Seeley said during a confessional interview. \u201cShe helps me kind of get out of my head and I help her, you know, be her true self and I calm her down in moments where she gets emotional or heated.\u201d",
      "The two hit a snag during the show\u2019s baby challenge, where they argued over Mustafa\u2019s lack of public displays of affection.",
      "Iris Kendall, 25, and Jose \u201cPepe\u201d Garcia-Gonzalez, 27, came in as bombshells with fellow contestant Jalen Brown in the ninth episode and explored various connections before coming together in the show\u2019s last recoupling.",
      "Garcia-Gonzalez initially formed a strong connection with Hannah Fields, 23, which was cut short when a shocking dumping forced her to leave the villa and left him single.",
      "Kendall initially coupled up with Brown before he was dumped from the villa along with Fields. She developed a strong connection with TJ Palma, 23, who walked in as a bombshell in episode 15, and they became a couple.",
      "Garcia-Gonzalez coupled up with Gracyn Blackmore, 25, during Casa Amor. Each respective couple remained together until Blackmore and Palma left the villa following a mass dumping late in the season, leaving both Kendall and Garcia-Gonzalez single.",
      "The pair, who had developed a strong friendship, then coupled up and started a romantic relationship.",
      "\u201cWith Iris, it just feels comfortable. I think it\u2019s that whole, you know, you\u2019re friends to start and then maybe it can become something else,\u201d Garcia-Gonzalez said during a confessional interview.",
      "Olandria Carthen, 27, and Nic Vansteenberghe, 24, had an unconventional path to the finale.",
      "The pair had expressed initial interest in each other during the first episode, before settling into separate couples. Carthen, an Alabama native, was set on finding her \u201ccowboy,\u201d coupling up with Taylor Williams, 24, from Oklahoma. The pair remained together for most of the season, though Williams sporadically mentioned he lacked a physical connection with Carthen.",
      "Vansteenberghe initially coupled up with Belle-A Walker, 22, before choosing to recouple with Ortega, who walked in as a bombshell at the end of the first episode. The pair remained together throughout the show until her abrupt departure from the villa a week ago.",
      "During Casa Amor, Carthen and Vansteenberghe didn\u2019t didn't find new connections and they were dumped from the villa. In a shocking twist, however, the contestants were offered a lifeline \u2014 they could return to the villa if they couple up with each other. The pair then briefly explored a romantic connection before ultimately deciding to remain friends.",
      "Carthen chose to return to Williams but was left single after he recoupled with Casa Amor contestant Clarke Carraway. Vansteenberghe and Ortega stayed together, but her departure days later ultimately left him single.",
      "Carthen and Vansteenberghe ultimately recoupled in the same episode.",
      "\u201cFor our journey to be almost identical is mind-blowing to me. I can\u2019t wrap my head around this situation,\u201d Carthen said during a recent confessional interview. \u201cMaybe it was Nic this whole time and we\u2019ve just been so oblivious to it.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says he is considering \u201ctaking away\u201d the U.S. citizenship of a longtime rival, actress and comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell, despite a decades-old Supreme Court ruling that expressly prohibits such an action by the government.",
      "\u201cBecause of the fact that Rosie O\u2019Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship,\u201d Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday. He added that O'Donnell, who moved to Ireland in January, should stay in Ireland \u201cif they want her.\u201d",
      "The two have criticized each other publicly for years, an often bitter back-and-forth that predates Trump\u2019s involvement in politics. In recent days, O\u2019Donnell on social media denounced Trump and recent moves by his administration, including the signing of a massive GOP-backed tax breaks and spending cuts plan.",
      "It's just the latest threat by Trump to revoke the citizenship of people with whom he has publicly disagreed, most recently his former adviser and one-time ally, Elon Musk.",
      "But O'Donnell's situation is notably different from Musk, who was born in South Africa. O'Donnell was born in the United States and has a constitutional right to U.S. citizenship. The U.S. State Department notes on its website that U.S. citizens by birth or naturalization may relinquish U.S. nationality by taking certain steps \u2013 but only if the act is performed voluntary and with the intention of relinquishing U.S. citizenship.",
      "Amanda Frost, a law professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, noted the Supreme Court ruled in a 1967 case that the Fourteen Amendment of the Constitution prevents the government from taking away citizenship.",
      "\u201cThe president has no authority to take away the citizenship of a native-born U.S. citizen,\" Frost said in an email Saturday. \u201cIn short, we are nation founded on the principle that the people choose the government; the government cannot choose the people.\u201d",
      "O'Donnell moved to Ireland after Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris to win his second term. She has said she's in the process of obtaining Irish citizenship based on family lineage.",
      "Responding to Trump Saturday, O\u2019Donnell wrote on social media that she had upset the president and \u201cadd me to the list of people who oppose him at every turn.\u201d",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- In a small bookstore in the Caribbean's largest mall, dozens of people gathered on a recent evening for the launch of a slim dictionary. Its title is \u201cThe ABC of DtMF,\u201d which is short for \u201cDeB\u00cd TiRAR M\u00e1S FOToS,\u201d the newest album from Puerto Rico's latest prodigious son, Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio, better known as Bad Bunny.",
      "The mostly older crowd flipped through the pages, seeking to understand more about Puerto Rico's culture, the places, phrases and references in Bad Bunny's music.",
      "The singer has elevated the global profile of the island, a U.S. territory, to new heights, promoting its traditional music, denouncing its gentrification and challenging its political status.",
      "It was an unexpected opportunity for an island that for years has cried out about its territorial status, dwindling affordable housing, high cost of living, chronic power outages, medical exodus and fragile economy. Pleas for change have been largely pushed aside, but Puerto Ricans are optimistic that Bad Bunny\u2019s new album and his series of 30 concerts that began Friday means they\u2019ll finally be heard.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to bring change, and there\u2019s a young generation who\u2019s going to back him,\u201d said Luis Rosado, 57, who this week attended the dictionary launch at the urging of his son, who lives abroad.",
      "Ten minutes before the first concert on Friday, a giant billboard on stage lit up with the words, \u201cPuerto Rico is a colony since Christopher Columbus \u2018discovered\u2019 the island during his second trip to the New World in 1493.\u201d",
      "The crowd that filled the 18,000-capacity coliseum whooped.",
      "\u201cThis album has sparked a conversation around the world about our situation as a colony,\u201d said Andrea Figueroa, a 24-year-old professional athlete who said foreigners have started to ask her about Puerto Rico and its issues, something she hopes might lead to change.",
      "Those born on the island of 3.2 million inhabitants are U.S. citizens but cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, and they have one representative in Congress with limited voting powers.",
      "Figueroa said the album resonated with her because her father is one of thousands forced to leave the island in search of work as the economy crumbled. It\u2019s a sentiment Bad Bunny sings about in \u201cWhat happened to Hawaii,\u201d with the lyric, \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to go to Orlando, but the corrupt ones kicked him out.\u201d",
      "The song taps into concern that the Puerto Rican identity is eroding amid an influx of people from the U.S. mainland, many of them attracted by a 2012 law that allows Americans to move to the island and pay no taxes on capital gains if they meet certain conditions.",
      "Hundreds of Americans also snapped up properties in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria struck the island as a powerful Category 4 storm in 2017, forcing more than 100,000 people to leave.",
      "\u201cThey want to take the river away from me and also the beach; they want my neighborhood and the grandma to leave,\u201d Bad Bunny sang on Friday as the crowd drowned out his voice.",
      "The artist spent half of Friday\u2019s concert singing from the porch and roof of a traditional Puerto Rican home that served as a second stage, where he wonders about its fate aloud because it\u2019s been rented: \u201cDo good people live there? Is it an Airbnb?\u201d",
      "The mostly young crowd booed loudly, flinching at their reality on an island where the housing price index increased by almost 60% from 2018 to 2024 and where short-term rentals have surged from some 1,000 in 2014 to more than 25,000 in 2023.",
      "However, they cheered upon seeing Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James emerge from the house as a surprise guest.",
      "The song hit Carmen Lourdes L\u00f3pez Rivera especially hard. She is the vice president of the Community Board Association of La Perla, an impoverished community once known for being Puerto Rico\u2019s biggest heroin distribution point.",
      "Investors with deep pockets have long sought to buy up the area, which is perched on a hill with deep turquoise waters lapping below a massive 16th-century fort popular with tourists.",
      "\u201cThey have always said they want to kick us out of here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight for what belongs to us.\u201d",
      "The effect of Bad Bunny\u2019s album and concerts is already being felt.",
      "More than 35,000 hotel nights have been booked during the normally slow summer season, with the concerts expected to attract more than 600,000 visitors, generate more than $186 million and create more than 3,600 jobs, according to government officials.",
      "Beyond that, Bad Bunny\u2019s use of folkloric music like bomba and plena has revived interest in those musical traditions. Dozens of newcomers have requested classes and are seeking out teachers, said Jorge Gabriel L\u00f3pez Ol\u00e1n, 28, an experienced drummer.",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s very necessary, isn\u2019t it? To understand where we come from and where our music and culture come from,\u201d he said.",
      "On Friday, Bad Bunny fans sported long ruffled skirts traditionally worn to dance bomba, while others donned straw hats known as a \u201cpava,\u201d worn by \u201cj\u00edbaros,\u201d Puerto Rican peasants. Musicians and dancers wore the same outfits on the main stage, which at one point even featured live chickens.",
      "Interest has surged to the point where universities including Princeton and Yale have launched courses on Bad Bunny. Albert Laguna, a Yale professor, described Bad Bunny\u2019s residence as a powerful move: \u201cInstead of me going to the world, right, I\u2019m going to start here.\u201d",
      "There is even renewed interest in the Puerto Rican crested toad, the island\u2019s sole indigenous toad species that is under threat and was featured in a video as part of Bad Bunny\u2019s newest album.",
      "Not even two weeks had passed since the album\u2019s launch and people already were sending in pictures to confirm if they had spotted the crested toad, said Abel Vale Nieves with Citizens of the Karst, an environmental nonprofit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we had not seen before,\u201d he said, adding that the album presented Puerto Rico\u2019s reality to the world: \u201cA situation of complete disadvantage where we don\u2019t have the right to a lot of things.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt creates interest in Puerto Rico\u2019s historical situation, and I think it did so in a wonderful way,\u201d he said, adding that the concerts will only boost visibility of the island\u2019s issues. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful opportunity.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "\u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\" is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a new 4K restoration and a theatrical re-release",
      "Jack Nicholson did not want to go to the Oscars. It was 1976 and he was nominated for best actor in \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.\u201d The Milo\u0161 Forman film, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a nationwide theatrical re-release on July 13 and July 16, had become a bit of a sensation \u2014 the second highest grossing picture of 1975, behind \u201cJaws,\u201d and had received nine Oscar nominations.",
      "But Nicholson wasn\u2019t feeling optimistic. In five years, he\u2019d already been nominated five times. He\u2019d also lost five times. And he told his producer, Michael Douglas, that he couldn\u2019t go through it again.",
      "\u201cI remember how hard I had to persuade Jack to come to the ceremony. He was so reluctant, but we got him there,\u201d Douglas said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd then of course we lost the first four awards. Jack was sitting right in front of me and sort of leaned back and said \u2019Oh, Mikey D, Mikey D, I told you, man.\u2019 I just said, \u2018Hang in there.\u2019\u201d",
      "Douglas, of course, was right. \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d would go on to sweep the \u201cbig five\u201d \u2014 screenplay, director, actor, actress and picture \u2014 the first film to do so in 41 years, (\u201cIt Happened One Night,\u201d in 1934) which only \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d has done since. That night was one of many vindicating moments for a film that no one wanted to make or distribute that has quite literally stood the test of time.",
      "\u201cThis is my first 50th anniversary,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first movie I ever produced. To have a movie that\u2019s so lasting, that people get a lot out of, it\u2019s a wonderful feeling. It\u2019s bringing back a lot of great memories.\u201d",
      "The film adaption of Ken Kesey\u2019s countercultural novel was a defining moment for Douglas, a son of Hollywood who was stuck in television and got a lifeline to film when his father, Kirk Douglas, gave him the rights to the book, and many of the then-unknown cast like Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd.",
      "DeVito was actually the first person officially cast. Douglas, who\u2019d known him for nearly 10 years, brought Forman to see him play Martini on stage.",
      "\u201cMilo\u0161 said, \u2018Yes! Danny! Perfect! Cast!\u2019 Douglas said in his best Czech accent. \u201cIt was a big moment for Danny. But I always knew how talented he was.\u201d",
      "Though the film's themes are challenging, unlike many of its New Hollywood contemporaries it wasn\u2019t a tortured shoot by any stretch. They had their annoyances (like Forman refusing to show the cast dailies) and more serious trials (they found out halfway through production that William Redfield was dying of leukemia), but for the most part it was fun.",
      "\u201cWe were very serious about the work, because Milo\u0161 was very serious. And we had the material, Kesey\u2019s work, and the reverence for that. We were not frivolous about it. But we did have a ball doing it,\u201d DeVito said, laughing.",
      "Part of that is because they filmed on location at a real state hospital in Salem, Oregon. Everyone stayed in the same motel and would board the same bus in the morning to get to set. It would have been hard not to bond and even harder if they hadn\u2019t.",
      "\u201cThere was full commitment,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cThat comes when you don\u2019t go home at night to your own lives. We stopped for lunch on the first day and I saw Jack kind of push his tray away and go outside to get some air. I said, \u2018Jack, you OK?\u2019 He said, \u2019Who are these guys? Nobody breaks character! It\u2019s lunch time and they\u2019re all acting the same way!'\u201d",
      "Not disproving Nicholson\u2019s point, DeVito remembers he and the cast even asked if they could just sleep in the hospital.",
      "\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let us,\u201d DeVito said. \u201cThe floor above us had some seriously disturbed people who had committed murder.\u201d",
      "The film will be in theaters again on July 13 and July 16 from Fathom Entertainment. It\u2019s a new 4K restoration from the Academy Film Archive and Teatro Della Pace Films with an introduction by Leonard Maltin.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gorgeous print and reminds me how good the sound was,\u201d Douglas said.",
      "DeVito thinks it, \u201cholds up in a really big way, because Milo\u0161 really was paying attention to all great things in the screenplay and the story originally.\u201d",
      "Besides the shock of \u201choly Toledo, am I that old?\u201d DeVito said that it was a treasure to be part of \u2014 and he continues to see his old friends, including Douglas, Lloyd and, of course, Nicholson, who played the protagonist, R.P. McMurphy.",
      "One person Douglas thinks hasn\u2019t gotten the proper attention for his contributions to \u201cCuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d is producer Saul Zaentz, who died in 2014. His music company, Fantasy Records who had Creedence Clearwater Revival, funded the endeavor which started at a $1.6 million budget and ballooned to $4 million by the end. He was a gambler, Douglas said, and it paid off.",
      "And whatever sour grapes might have existed between Douglas and his father, who played R.P. McMurphy on Broadway and dreamt of doing so on film, were perhaps over-exaggerated. It was ultimately important for their relationship.",
      "\u201cMcMurphy is as good a part as any actor is going to get, and I\u2019m now far enough in my career to understand maybe you have four, maybe five good parts, really great parts. I\u2019m sure for dad that was one of them,\u201d Douglas said.",
      "\u201cTo not be able to see it through was probably disappointing on one side. On the other, the fact that his son did it and the picture turned out so good? Thank God the picture turned out. It would have been a disaster if it hadn\u2019t.\"",
      "Douglas added: \u201cIt was a fairy tale from beginning to end. I doubt anything else really came close to it. Even my Oscar for best actor years later didn\u2019t really surpass that moment very early in my career.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Forty years ago, the legendary Live Aid concerts aimed to do a lot of good \u2014 helping to raise over $100 million for famine relief in Ethiopia and inspiring worldwide awareness for a cause it might otherwise have ignored.",
      "Simulcast from Philadelphia and London on July 13, 1985, Live Aid was the most ambitious global television event of its time: 16 hours of live music in two different continents featuring Queen, The Who, a Led Zeppelin reunion and more.",
      "A lot has changed in the years since. \u201cLive Aid, '85 to now, is the same distance as the Second World War from Live Aid,\u201d notes Rick Springfield, laughingly. \u201cThat\u2019s how long ago it was.\u201d",
      "Artists who performed at Live Aid \u2014 Springfield, organizer Bob Geldof, Hall and Oates' John Oates and Judas Priest's Rob Halford \u2014 reflected on the event and its impact in interviews with The Associated Press ahead of the 40th anniversary on Sunday.",
      "Here's what they had to say:",
      "At John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia, Springfield performed between Run-DMC and REO Speedwagon \u2014 just a taste of the diversity of performers featured on the transnational lineup. \u201cRun-DMC, I remember thinking, \u2018What is this? Three guys talking over a record player. What is that? Little did I know that it was about to change the whole game,\u201d he says, laughing. He remembers playing an electric set \u2014 no \u201cJessie\u2019s Girl,\u201d because \u201cback then, it was just my first hit. ... It hadn't gone on to become this cultural thing.\"",
      "Hall and Oates' John Oates had a different experience. His band also played in Philly \u2014 their hometown \u2014 and in 1985, his band was one of the biggest on the planet. They played near the end of the night, joined by the Temptations' Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin and remained on stage to back the Rolling Stones' dynamic frontman Mick Jagger. The British rockstar had a trick up his sleeve.",
      "\u201cHe didn't tell us that he was bringing Tina Turner out,\u201d Oates says. \u201cWe had rehearsed a certain amount of songs with him. But then when he brought her out, it just jacked up the level of energy like you can\u2019t believe.\u201d",
      "Judas Priest singer Rob Halford counts \u201cMike and Tina, of course,\u201d as one of his Philly Live Aid highlights. \u201cLed Zeppelin, too.\u201d",
      "But most exciting of all for the heavy metal frontman? Meeting folk hero Joan Baez. The band had previously covered her classic \u201cDiamonds and Rust.\"",
      "\u201cI thought, \u2018Oh my God, she\u2019s gonna come and kick me in the ass for wrecking her beautiful song,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe gives me a quick hug and goes, \u2018The reason I\u2019m here is because my son said to me, if you see Rob Halford from Judas Priest at the Live Aid Show in Philadelphia, will you tell him from me that I prefer Judas Priest\u2019s version to my mom\u2019s version?' ... It was a display of such kindness.\"",
      "Twenty years after Live Aid, Geldof organized Live 8 \u2014 an even larger undertaking in the new internet era, with 10 concerts happening simultaneously and across the globe.",
      "If the trend were to continue, there should be another event taking place this year. Notably, there isn't.",
      "Geldof says that's because there couldn't be a Live Aid-type event in 2025. He cites social media as a cause. In his view, algorithmic fracturing has made it impossible to create monolithic musical and activistic moments. Instead, he views the current media landscape as bolstering \"an echo chamber of your own prejudices.\u201d",
      "For something like Live Aid to work, \u201cYou need rock \u2018n\u2019 roll as a creature of a social, economic and technological movement,\" he says. \u201cAnd I think the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll age is over. ... It did determine how young people articulated change and the desire for it. ... That isn't the case anymore.\u201d",
      "Springfield agrees. \u201cI think we are too divided,\u201d he says. He believes the world wouldn't be able to agree on a single cause to support, or even which musicians to back. \u201cYou could never do a thing with the size of Live Aid unless it was some kind of universal thing of, \u2018Let\u2019s bring everybody together.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cNever say never, but I highly doubt it,\u201d says Oates. \u201cThe landscape of music and entertainment in general has changed so drastically.\"",
      "He points to \u201cWe Are The World,\u201d the 1985 charity single for African famine relief that included the voices of Michael Jackson, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, Paul Simon and many more, as an example. \u201cThe idea of that happening with the stars of today all in one place, I can\u2019t even imagine that.

      "Former \u201cLove Island USA\u201d contestant Cierra Ortega has released a video on TikTok apologizing for previously using a racial slur against Asian people",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Former \u201cLove Island USA\u201d contestant Cierra Ortega apologized Wednesday for resurfaced posts where she used a racial slur against Asian people.",
      "Ortega, who was half of one of the season\u2019s strongest couples, left the villa just a week before the popular reality show\u2019s finale after old posts resurfaced that contained the slur.",
      "Ortega addressed the entire Asian community in her nearly five minute TikTok video and said she is \u201cdeeply, truly, honestly so sorry.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not an apology video. This is an accountability video,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "\u201cI had no idea that the word held as much pain, as much harm, and came with the history that it did, or I never would have used it,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cI had no ill intention when I was using it, but that\u2019s absolutely no excuse because intent doesn\u2019t excuse ignorance.\u201d",
      "Ortega, who has been back in the United States for about 48 hours, said she has struggled most with the backlash experienced by her family, who she said doesn't feel safe in their own home, and have had immigration authorities called on them.",
      "\u201cThere's no need to fight hate with hate. I don't think that that's justice,\" Ortega said. \"And if you want to know that you're heard and that I'm sorry and that I will move differently, I promise you, that's what will happen.\u201d",
      "Ortega\u2019s removal from the villa was announced early in Sunday\u2019s episode. Host Iain Stirling said she had left \u201cdue to a personal situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cI completely agree with the network\u2019s decision to remove me from the villa. I think that this is something that deserved punishment and the punishment has absolutely been received,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "Her video made no mention of her \u201cLove Island\u201d partner, Nic Vansteenberghe. He remained in the villa single when Ortega left, ultimately recoupling with fellow islander Orlandria Carthen in the same episode. The couple is still in competition as of Tuesday\u2019s episode.",
      "Ortega said she was unaware she was using a racial slur until a follower pointed it out after she posted an Instagram story in 2024 that used the term. It was one of the posts that resurfaced during her time in the villa.",
      "At this point, Ortega said \u201cthe word was immediately removed from my vocabulary.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know that moving forward, my actions and how I decide to live my life from here on out is gonna speak louder than any apology ever could,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "Ortega\u2019s departure from the villa followed Yulissa Escobar, who left the villa last month in the second episode after clips of her using racist language resurfaced online. Her departure was also not explained in the show.",
      "A spokesperson for the show declined to comment Monday.",
      "Escobar, who initially issued an apology on her Instagram story shortly after she departed the villa, took to TikTok a day after Ortega left to ask viewers to stop cyberbullying contestants.",
      "\u201cI know what I said was wrong. I know what Cierra said was wrong, and I know it hurt communities,\u201d Escobar said. \u201cAll I ask you guys is instead of threatening her and her family, try to educate us, her, me.\u201d",
      "Escobar said she was \u201chonestly scared to come home,\u201d when she first got her phone back after exiting the villa and saw the messages she had received.",
      "\u201cI was like, is something going to happen to me? Like, is somebody going to do something to me? Because it was just a lot to take in and even my family was worried,\u201d Escobar said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to take that when you\u2019re getting all these threats online.\u201d",
      "The show, which strips contestants of their phones or access to the outside world, has previously asked fans to avoid cyberbullying contestants. Host Ariana Madix called for fans to stop doxxing and harassing the show\u2019s stars in a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d is an American spin-off of the original U.K. series and is airing its seventh season. The show airs daily except Wednesdays and brings young singles together in a remote villa in Fiji to explore connections with the ultimate goal of finding love.",
      "Couples undergo challenges and are encouraged test their romantic connections as new contestants are introduced. Islanders are routinely \u201cdumped\u201d from the villa throughout the series as stronger couples form. Sunday's finale will culminate with one couple who receives the most public votes being awarded $100,000.",

      "Afrobeats megastar Burna Boy is releasing his new album, \u201cNo Sign of Weakness,\u201d on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- While classmates dreamed of becoming teachers, doctors and professional athletes, Burna Boy was clear on his future aspirations.",
      "\u201cThey would hand out the papers and the question would be, \u2018What you wanna be?\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019d write \u2018rock star,\u2019\u201d said the Afrobeats giant. \u201cOne of my teachers asked me, \u2018What do rock stars do?\u2019 I didn\u2019t really know what to say.\u201d",
      "These days, the Grammy winner\u2019s music talks for him. Fresh off becoming the first African artist to sell out Paris\u2019 iconic Stade de France in April, Burna Boy has been on an incredible run, and hopes it continues with his new album out Friday.",
      "\u201c\u2019No Sign of Weakness\u2019 is really like a celebration of the fact that that I\u2019m still here throughout all these years and all the trials and tribulations,\u201d explained the Nigerian artist. \u201cI decided to intentionally make sure everyone on this project could comfortably and genuinely say they\u2019re a rock star.\u201d",
      "Following 2023\u2019s Grammy-nominated \u201cI Told Them\u2026,\u201d this project includes blockbuster features, like legendary Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, country hitmaker Shaboozey and hip-hop heavyweight Travis Scott.",
      "Writing on all 16 tracks, Burna relied on his standard successful creation process: record constantly, choose some songs from his vault that fit his decided theme, and then craft the project around them. He's already dropped \u201cBundle by Bundle,\u201d \u201cUpdate,\u201d which features an interpolation of Soul II Soul\u2019s classic \u201cBack To Life,\u201d \u201cSweet Love\u201d and \u201cTaTaTa\u201d featuring Scott.",
      "Music from Africa has exploded globally in recent years. Regions in Africa and the Middle East reached double-digit gains in music revenue last year, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. In 2023, the group reported that sub-Saharan Africa was the fastest-growing music industry, with artists like Burna, Davido and Wizkid leading the way, along with Tyla, who\u2019s spread South Africa\u2019s Amapino sound.",
      "\u201cI feel blessed. I also feel great responsibility \u2026 I\u2019m blamed for everything, most especially, things I couldn\u2019t possibly be responsible for,\u201d said Burna, alluding to demands in Nigeria. \u201cI don\u2019t vote, and I\u2019ve never done it. But now, it\u2019s to the point where even that: if I don\u2019t vote, because I don\u2019t say I\u2019ll vote for this person or vote for that person, it\u2019s a problem.\u201d",
      "But that weight of responsibility isn\u2019t felt on his eighth studio album. \u201cDem Dey,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek bop referencing his gossipy social media scandal with a Nigerian influencer which amused fans, is sure to crowd dance floors, while he and Jagger formed a dynamic duo on the Afrobeat-rock hybrid \u201cEmpty Chairs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how I see the future of our music \u2026 music that\u2019s supposed to last, music that you can perform forever,\u201d said Burna, who collaborated with the 81-year-old by trading ideas through WhatsApp after being connected by supermodel Naomi Campbell. \u201cThat\u2019s where I want to be when I\u2019m that age.\u201d",
      "For his country-infused \u201cChange Your Mind\u201d with Shaboozey, the pair plead for second chances after souring relationships.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s an Igbo boy from the eastern part of Nigeria who comes to America as a young guy,\u201d said Burna of the \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy)\u201d singer. \u201cHe\u2019s flourishing in the country world. If I\u2019m not proud of that, then I don\u2019t think I can be proud of anything in life.\u201d",
      "The Afrobeats superstar, currently featured on the soundtrack for the blockbuster \u201cF1\" movie starring Brad Pitt and Damson Idris, hopes the genre continues to thrive and not become a fad. But while the female artists are united, the top men have experienced friction in the past.",
      "\u201cWe need to figure how to make our diversities into an advantage instead of a disadvantage, and that goes across \u2014 not just for Nigeria,\" said Burna, whose grandfather managed Afrobeat icon Fela Kuti. \"It goes for everything Black and African, because the only thing we always lack is strong organization.\u201d",
      "While some artists have expressed ideas on unification, Burna Boy is cautious.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about uniting ... We\u2019re talking about people who actually can help matters,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss with people that it\u2019s just going to end up a discussion, and there\u2019s not going to be any action.\u201d",
      "For the moment, he\u2019s pressing forward. The \u201cLast Last\u201d artist launched his world tour this week with North American dates beginning in November. It features a circular stage, providing fans an equally enjoyable musical experience \u2014 although he\u2019s certain he\u2019ll enjoy it more.",
      "\u201cThis is going to sound selfish as hell \u2014 but I definitely have more fun than everybody \u2026 when I die, I want to go to a stage in Heaven,\u201d said Burna. \u201cEvery time I watch myself perform, I see a big smile on my face that I never see anywhere else.\u201d",

      "Dozens of ice cream makers pledged on Monday to remove artificial dyes from their products by 2028",
      "Ice cream makers representing about 90% of the U.S. supply of the frozen treat have pledged to remove artificial dyes from their products in less than three years, federal health officials said Monday.",
      "The move is the latest voluntary effort by food manufacturers to heed calls from the Trump administration to remove synthetic dyes over concerns about potential health effects. In recent weeks, companies including Nestle, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would pull artificial colors from their foods, too.",
      "\u201cThis is a Renaissance moment for health in America,\" U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference.",
      "About 40 makers of ice cream and frozen dairy desserts said they would remove seven petroleum-based dyes from their products by 2028, according to Michael Dykes, president of the International Dairy Foods Association. The colors are Red 3, Red 40, Green 3, Blue 1, Blue 2, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6. The trade group wouldn't identify the firms, although Turkey Hill Dairy chief executive Andy Jacobs joined the gathering.",
      "The national focus on artificial food dyes is \u201ca good step to take,\" but officials should not ignore larger known contributors to chronic disease, including the added sugars and saturated fat commonly found in ice cream, said Deanna Hoelscher, a University of Texas nutrition expert.",
      "\u201cJust taking out or changing the food dye source is not necessarily going to make it a healthy option,\u201d she said. \u201cIt still is a food that should be consumed in moderation.\u201d",
      "However, Makary also hinted that new federal dietary guidelines, expected later this year, would challenge established links between saturated fat and heart disease, ending what he called \u201ca 70-year demonization of natural saturated fat.\u201d",
      "The average American eats about 4 gallons of ice cream a year, the IDFA said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies showing that they may cause some neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. The Food and Drug Administration has maintained that approved dyes are safe and that \u201cmost children have no adverse effects\u201d when consuming foods made with them.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has criticized the dyes and pressured manufacturers to remove them from foods. In their place, manufacturers should use dyes made from fruit juices, plant extracts and other sources, federal officials said.",
      "The FDA has approved new natural color additives in recent months, including a new blue color made from the fruit of the gardenia announced Monday. Gardenia (genipin) blue is approved for use in sports drinks, candies and certain other products, the agency said.",
      "Makary also sent a letter to food manufacturers on Monday that \u201cencourages\u201d them to speed up removal of the dye known as Red 3, which was banned in January. Food makers have until 2027 to remove the dye, which was found to cause cancer in laboratory rats, but not humans.",
      "Some food companies have said they will stop using artificial dyes, but relying on voluntary action rather than regulatory requirements won't guarantee compliance, said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.",
      "\u201cTalk is cheap,\u201d Galligan said. \u201cIt's easy for companies to make promises to look like they're being compliant and generate goodwill among consumers and the Trump administration, but it remains to be seen if they will actually follow through.\u201d",

      "Stop all work, it said. The United States under the Trump administration was withdrawing all its funding.",
      "The news devastated the researchers, who live and work in a region where more people live with HIV than anywhere else in the world. Their research project, called BRILLIANT, was meant to be the latest to draw on the region's genetic diversity and deep expertise in the hope of benefiting people everywhere.",
      "But the $46 million from the U.S. for the project was disappearing, part of the dismantling of foreign aid by the world's biggest donor earlier this year as President Donald Trump announced a focus on priorities at home.",
      "South Africa has been hit especially hard because of Trump's baseless claims about the targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority. The country had been receiving about $400 million a year via USAID and the HIV-focused PEPFAR.",

      "Glenda Grey, who heads the Brilliant program, said the African continent has been vital to the development of HIV medication, and the U.S. cuts threaten its capability to do such work in the future.",
      "Significant advances have included clinical trials for lenacapavir, the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV, recently approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. One study to show its efficacy involved young South Africans.",
      "\u201cWe do the trials better, faster and cheaper than anywhere else in the world, and so without South Africa as part of these programs, the world, in my opinion, is much poorer,\u201d Gray said.",
      "She noted that during the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, South Africa played a crucial role by testing the Johnson & Johnson and Novavax vaccines, and South African scientists' genomic surveillance led to the identification of an important variant.",
      "A team of researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand has been part of the unit developing the HIV vaccines for the trials.",
      "Inside the Wits laboratory, technician Nozipho Mlotshwa was among the young people in white gowns working on samples, but she may soon be out of a job.",
      "Her position is grant-funded. She uses her salary to support her family and fund her studies in a country where youth unemployment hovers around 46%.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sad and devastating, honestly,\" she said of the U.S. cuts and overall uncertainty. \u201cWe\u2019ll also miss out collaborating with other scientists across the continent.\u201d",
      "Professor Abdullah Ely leads the team of researchers. He said the work had promising results indicating that the vaccines were producing an immune response.",
      "But now that momentum, he said, has \u201call kind of had to come to a halt.\u201d",
      "The BRILLIANT program is scrambling to find money to save the project. The purchase of key equipment has stopped. South Africa's health department says about 100 researchers for that program and others related to HIV have been laid off. Funding for postdoctoral students involved in experiments for the projects is at risk.",
      "South Africa's government has estimated that universities and science councils could lose about $107 million in U.S. research funding over the next five years due to the aid cuts, which affect not only work on HIV but also tuberculosis \u2014 another disease with a high number of cases in the country.",
      "South Africa\u2019s government has said it will be very difficult to find funding to replace the U.S. support.",
      "And now the number of HIV infections will grow. Medication is more difficult to obtain. At least 8,000 health workers in South Africa's HIV program have already been laid off, the government has said. Also gone are the data collectors who tracked patients and their care, as well as HIV counselors who could reach vulnerable patients in rural communities.",
      "For researchers, Universities South Africa, an umbrella body, has applied to the national treasury for over $110 million for projects at some of the largest schools.",

But leaders of the health systems said Thursday that the \u201cNorth Carolina Children's\u201d project will be constructed about 20 miles (32.19 kilometers) southwest of downtown Raleigh in the Wake County town of Apex. Apex has a population of 77,000, which is already surging in population thanks to the region's strong technology economy.",

      "\u201cThis campus will create a brighter, healthier future for generations of children and adolescents across North Carolina and the Southeast, and we\u2019re thrilled to have Apex as our home and partner,\" UNC Heatlh CEO Dr. Wesley Burks said in a news release.",
      "A groundbreaking for the hospital campus is now expected in 2027, with construction anticipated to take six years. North Carolina Children\u2019s Health also issued on Thursday a request for information from potential design and construction contractors for the project.",
      "There are children\u2019s hospitals already in North Carolina, including those operated by the University of North Carolina and Duke University health systems that are attached to their main campuses in the Triangle.",
      "The Apex location \u201cwill ensure that the Triangle remains a hub and a destination for the best pediatric scientists, teachers and clinicians \u2014 convenient to both medical school campuses,\u201d said Dr. Mary Klotman, dean of the Duke University medical school and a Duke Health executive.",
      "The new children's hospital agreed to acquire a portion of the Veridea land, which is owned by a business partnership between the North Carolina state retirement system and the land developers, according to the State Treasurer's Office, which administers the system.",
      "State Treasurer Brad Briner said at the news conference that the land sale is a win for everyone involved, including government retirees and the pension system, \"making a modest profit and unlocking more value in the land that is adjacent.\u201d",
      "\u201cAbove all, it's a win for the 11 million North Carolinians who deserve world-class pediatric care right here at home,\u201d he added.",
      "The health systems have said the hospital campus project could cost from $2 billion to $3 billion, with a massive private fundraising effort ahead.",
      "The project has already received $320 million from state legislators. The next state budget, still being negotiated by House and Senate Republicans that ultimately would head to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein's desk, also could contain more project funds.",
      "Stein said in an interview Thursday that beyond the economic opportunity the project will spark, \u201cI\u2019m really excited about what the children\u2019s hospital means for children of North Carolina who are sick and in need of the best, most sophisticated, advanced medical interventions to live long, healthy lives.\u201d",

      "DETROIT -- A judge has rejected a challenge to Michigan's longtime ban on taxpayer-funded abortions for low-income residents, saying a group that brought the lawsuit had no standing to file it.",
      "Michigan voters in 2022 approved a sweeping constitutional amendment ensuring a right to abortion. But a ban on most taxpayer-funded abortions has been in place for decades, no matter which political party has controlled the Legislature or the governor\u2019s office.",

      "Dr. Claudette Yam\u00e9ogo is Burkina Faso\u2019s only ophthalmologist who specializes in treating children",
      "BOBO-DIOULASSO, Burkina Faso -- Isaka Diallo was playing with friends when a stone struck his left eye. For two weeks, his parents searched hospitals in western Burkina Faso for an eye doctor. The village clinic only prescribed painkillers. Other health workers did not know what to do.",
      "When they eventually found Dr. Claudette Yam\u00e9ogo, Burkina Faso\u2019s only pediatric ophthalmologist, the injury had become too difficult to treat.",
      "\u201cThe trauma has become severe,\u201d Yam\u00e9ogo said of Diallo\u2019s condition as she attended to him recently at the Sanou Sourou University Hospital in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso. \u201cCases like (Diallo\u2019s) must be treated within the first six hours, but I\u2019m seeing him two weeks later, and it\u2019s already too late.\u201d",
      "It is a common problem in the country of about 23 million people, which has just 70 ophthalmologists.",
      "Yam\u00e9ogo , who started her practice late last year, said the work is daunting and often requires her to visit \u2014 at no cost \u2014 families who cannot afford care or cannot make their way to the hospital where she works.",
      "While there is limited data available on eye defects in children in Burkina Faso or in Africa at large, an estimated 450 million children globally have a sight problem that needs treatment, according to the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness.",
      "Late intervention can significantly alter a child\u2019s future, the organization said, with many such cases in less developed countries.",
      "In Burkina Faso, an estimated 70% of the population lives in rural areas. And yet ophthalmologists are concentrated in the capital, Ouagadougou, and other main cities, making them unreachable for many.",
      "While more than 2,000 ophthalmology procedures were performed in Burkina Faso\u2019s western Hauts-Bassins region in 2024, only 52 of those were carried out in its more rural areas, according to the Ministry of Health. Most procedures were done in the area of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso\u2019s second city.",
      "Not many people are aware of Yam\u00e9ogo\u2019s work. Even when they are, traveling to reach her often requires days of planning and financial saving.",
      "In a further challenge to accessing care, Diallo\u2019s family is among the 2 million people displaced by violence as extremist groups seize parts of the country.",
      "To visit Yam\u00e9ogo\u2019s hospital from the village where they are sheltering, they had to travel about 40 kilometers (21 miles) on a motorcycle to Bobo-Dioulasso, spending 7,500 francs ($13) on transport, a high price for a small-scale farming family.",
      "At least 70% of the trauma cases in children treated at the hospital come from rural areas where the risk of exposure \u2014 from conflict or from play \u2014 is higher, Yam\u00e9ogo said.",
      "Examining and treating a child is a delicate practice that requires a lot of time, something many families can\u2019t afford. Many must return home to earn money for the treatment.",
      "As she treated Diallo, Yam\u00e9ogo noticed that the boy associated a drawing of an apple with a pepper, making her wonder: Is it that he can\u2019t see it, or that he doesn\u2019t know what an apple is? The fruit doesn't grow in the region where he lives.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no fixed time for examining children,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need a lot of patience.\u201d",
      "Yameogo\u2019s work has had a \"very positive impact on training future pediatricians and on the quality of ophthalmology services,\u201d said Jean Diallo, president of the Burkinab\u00e8 Society of Ophthalmology.",
      "\u201cA child\u2019s eye is not the same as that of an adult, which is why we need specialists to treat problems early so the child can develop properly,\u201d Diallo said.",
      "He cited retinoblastoma, a retinal cancer mostly affecting young children, and congenital cataracts, eye diseases that can be cured if diagnosed early. Pediatricians won\u2019t necessarily detect them.",
      "During another consultation, Yam\u00e9ogo told the family of 5-year-old Fatao Traor\u00e9 that he would need cornea surgery as a result of an injury sustained while playing with a stick.",
      "\u201cSometimes I feel a pinch in my heart,\u201d Yam\u00e9ogo said as she examined the boy after they arrived from their farm on the outskirts of Bobo-Dioulasso. \u201cHis iris has detached from his cornea, so he needs to be hospitalized.\u201d",
      "The father, looking overwhelmed, sighed, unsure of where the money for the child's surgery would come. On paper, Burkina Faso's government covers the cost of medications and care for children under 5, but often no drugs are available in hospitals, meaning families must buy them elsewhere.",
      "A surgery like the one for Traor\u00e9 can cost 100,000 CFA ($179), several months' income for the family.",

      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday that the national case count surpassed 2019, when there were 1,274 cases for the year and the country almost lost its status of having eliminated the vaccine-preventable illness. That could happen this year if the virus has nonstop spread for 12 months.",
      "This year's outbreaks, some of them interconnected, started five months ago in undervaccinated communities in West Texas. Three people have died \u2014 two children in Texas and an adult in New Mexico \u2014 and dozens of people have been hospitalized. Public health experts maintain the true case count may be higher than state health departments have confirmed.",
      "North America has three other major measles outbreaks, with 2,966 cases in Chihuahua state, Mexico, 2,223 cases in Ontario, Canada and 1,230 in Alberta, Canada. Twelve other states have current confirmed outbreaks of three or more people \u2014 Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Utah \u2014 and four other states saw their outbreaks end.",
      "The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles after two doses.",
      "The World Health Organization said in 2000 that measles had been eliminated from the U.S.",
      "The CDC identified 22 outbreaks in 2019, the largest being two separate clusters in New York \u2014 412 in New York state and 702 in New York City. These were linked because as measles was spreading through close-knit Orthodox Jewish communities, the CDC said.",
      "It's a similar situation in North America this year, where the Canada, Mexico and Texas outbreaks stem from large Mennonite communities in the regions. Mennonite churches do not formally discourage vaccination, though more conservative Mennonite communities historically have low vaccination rates and a distrust of government.",
      "A recent study found childhood vaccination rates against measles fell after the COVID-19 pandemic in nearly 80% of the more than 2,000 U.S. counties with available data, including in states that are battling outbreaks this year.",
      "Only 92.7% of kindergarteners in the U.S. had the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine in the 2023-2024 school year, below the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks. In Gaines County, Texas, the epicenter of the Texas outbreak, only 82% of kindergarteners were up-to-date with MMR vaccines.",
      "State and federal leaders have for years kept funding stagnant for local public health departments' vaccination programs that are tasked with reversing the trend.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing with measles is a little bit of a \u2018canary in a coal mine,'\" said Lauren Gardner, leader of Johns Hopkins University's independent measles and COVID tracking databases. \"It\u2019s indicative of a problem that we know exists with vaccination attitudes in this county and just, I think, likely to get worse.\u201d",

      "Scientists have linked last week\u2019s European heat wave to human-caused climate change and estimate that climate change was responsible for 1,500 deaths",
      "WASHINGTON -- Human-caused climate change is responsible for killing about 1,500 people in last week's European heat wave, a first-of-its-kind rapid study found.",
      "Those 1,500 people \u201chave only died because of climate change, so they would not have died if it would not have been for our burning of oil, coal and gas in the last century,\u201d said study co-author Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College in London.",
      "Scientists at Imperial and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine used peer-reviewed techniques to calculate that about 2,300 people in 12 cities likely died from the heat in last week's bout of high temperatures, with nearly two-thirds of them dying because of the extra degrees that climate change added to the natural summer warmth.",
      "Past rapid attribution studies have not gone beyond evaluating climate change's role in meteorological effects such as extra heat, flooding or drought. This study goes a step further in directly connecting coal, oil and natural gas use to people dying.",
      "\u201cHeat waves are silent killers and their health impact is very hard to measure,\u2033 said co-author Gary Konstantinoudis, a biostatistician at Imperial College. \u201dPeople do not understand the actual mortality toll of heat waves and this is because (doctors, hospitals and governments) do not report heat as an underlying cause of death\u201d and instead attribute it to heart or lung or other organ problems.",
      "Of the 1,500 deaths attributed to climate change, the study found more than 1,100 were people 75 or older.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s summer, so it\u2019s sometimes hot,\" study lead author Ben Clarke of Imperial College said in a Tuesday news conference. \u201dThe influence of climate change has pushed it up by several degrees and what that does is it brings certain groups of people more into dangerous territory and that\u2019s what\u2019s important. That\u2019s what we really want to highlight here. For some people it\u2019s still warm fine weather but for now a huge sector of the population it's more dangerous.\"",
      "Researchers looked at June 23 to July 2 in London; Paris; Frankfurt, Germany; Budapest, Hungary; Zagreb, Croatia; Athens, Greece; Barcelona, Spain; Madrid; Lisbon, Portugal; Rome; Milan and Sassari, Italy. They found that except in Lisbon, the extra warmth from greenhouse gases added 2 to 4 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) to what would have been a more natural heat wave. London got the most at nearly 4 degrees (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit). Climate change only added about a degree to Lisbon's peak temperature, the study calculated, mostly because of the Atlantic Ocean's moderating effect, Otto said.",
      "That extra climate-change-caused heat added the most extra deaths in Milan, Barcelona and Paris and the least in Sassari, Frankfort and Lisbon, the study found. The 1,500 figure is the middle of the range of overall climate-related death estimates that go from about 1,250 to around 1,700.",
      "Wednesday's study is not yet peer-reviewed. It is an extension of work done by an international team of scientists who do rapid attribution studies to search for global warming\u2019s fingerprints in the growing number of extreme weather events worldwide, and combine that with long-established epidemiological research that examines death trends that differ from what's considered normal.",
      "Researchers compared what the thermometers read last week to what computer simulations say would have happened in a world without planet-warming greenhouse gases from fossil fuel use. Health researchers then compared estimates \u2014 there are no solid figures yet \u2014 for heat deaths in what just happened to what heat deaths would be expected for each city without those extra degrees of warmth.",
      "There are long-established formulas that calculate excess deaths differing from normal based on location, demographics, temperatures and other factors and those are used, Otto and Konstantinoudis said. And health researchers take into account many variables like smoking and chronic diseases, so it's comparing similar people except for temperature so they know that's what's to blame, Konstantinoudis said.",
      "Studies in 2021 generally linked excess heat deaths to human-caused climate change and carbon emissions, but not specific events like last week's hot spell. A 2023 study in Nature Medicine estimated that since 2015, for every degree Celsius the temperature rises in Europe, there's an extra 18,547 summer heat deaths.",
      "Studies like Wednesday's are \u201cending the guessing game on the health harms from continued burning of fossil fuels,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Patz, director of the Center for Health, Energy and Environmental Research at the University of Wisconsin. He was not part of the research but said it \u201ccombined the most up-to-date climate and health methods and found that every fraction of a degree of warming matters regarding extreme heat waves.\u201d",

      "HONG KONG -- The Hong Kong government on Tuesday unveiled proposals to regulate online ride-hailing services provided by tech companies like Uber, requiring platforms, cars and drivers to be licensed before hitting the road.",
      "In a document sent to the legislature, transport officials said those companies applying for a license would need to have business registration and an office in the city. They also said the platforms would have to fulfill certain conditions on operating experience, proof of financial capability and capital investment, in addition to ensuring the cars and drivers working for them already purchased the required insurance.",
      "Under the licensing plans, eligible drivers must have held a private car driving license for at least one year and have no serious traffic convictions within five years. The drivers also need to pass a test and complete training.",
      "Officials plan to set a quota on the number of vehicles allowed to be run under the policy, adding that the cars cannot be over seven years old and have to pass an annual inspection.",
      "Currently, it is illegal for drivers of private vehicles to provide paid services to customers without a permit. Police have arrested some Uber drivers suspected of driving without a permit in the past and in 2018, more than two dozen drivers were fined.",
      "Uber, which started operating in Hong Kong in 2014, has faced multiple legal and regulatory challenges in its overseas expansion but remains popular in the semi-autonomous Chinese city, where many residents are frustrated with poor taxi services.",
      "Some taxi companies have long resisted online platforms like Uber, seeing them as a threat to their business.",
      "Hong Kong leader John Lee said the legislative framework would need to ensure the co-existence of online ride-hailing services and traditional taxi services. Transport officials could first handle issues with consensus and set up the framework before focusing on other controversial technical problems, Lee said.",
      "\u201cI agree the problem is complicated but it should not be further delayed,\u201d he said.",
      "In the document, the government said it would consider charging the platforms fees to provide resources for supporting the taxi industry in improving its service quality. It also suggested the companies allow taxi drivers to offer services through their platforms.",
      "Officials aimed to propose the changes in the third quarter of the year to set out matters in principle first. They planned to suggest further legal amendments for other issues in the first half of 2026.",
      "Uber Hong Kong welcomed the regulatory framework in a statement, saying it was encouraged to see safety and service standards placed at the center of the proposals.",
      "\u201cWhile we commend this progress, we remain concerned about the proposed cap on the number of ridesharing vehicles. Artificial limits risk increasing wait times, raising prices for riders and restricting earning opportunities for drivers,\u201d it said.",
      "It said it looked forward to continuing dialogue with the government and other stakeholders.",

      "The African country filed a case at the International Court of Justice in 2022, alleging France is violating international law by refusing to return assets seized during a corruption investigation into Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, the son of Equatorial Guinea\u2019s long-serving president.",
      "France\u2019s approach \u201cmay be described as paternalistic and even neo-colonial. We cannot accept such disdain for our sovereignty from France,\" Carmelo Nvono-Nc\u00e1, Equatorial Guinea\u2019s agent, told The Hague-based court.",
      "Equatorial Guinea has asked the court for a series of urgent orders, known as provisional measures, to return the swanky mansion on one of Paris\u2019s most prestigious streets, Avenue Foch, and to prevent France from selling the building.",
      "Obiang was convicted in 2017, and given a three-year suspended sentence for embezzling millions of dollars in public money. French authorities seized money, luxury vehicles and the building, which boasts a hammam, a cinema and a night club.",
      "The 57-year-old has faced scrutiny for corruption in other countries as well. In 2021, he was sanctioned by the United Kingdom for misappropriating public funds, including spending $275,000 on the bejeweled glove that Michael Jackson wore on his \u201cBad\u201d tour. Switzerland and Brazil have also opened investigations into his finances.",
      "In 2020, the International Court of Justice ruled that the building was a private residence, not a diplomatic outpost, rejecting a claim from Equatorial Guinea that the seizure violated international law.",
      "Equatorial Guinea returned to The Hague in 2022, arguing the French government was obliged to return the assets based on a U.N. anti-corruption convention.",
      "Despite its oil and gas riches, Equatorial Guinea has a dramatic gap between its privileged ruling class and much of the impoverished population. The former Spanish colony is run by Africa\u2019s longest-serving president, Obiang\u2019s father Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.",

      "India's aviation regulator has ordered airlines to inspect fuel control switches on certain Boeing models",
      "NEW DELHI -- India's aviation regulator ordered on Monday airlines operating several Boeing models to examine fuel control switches, days after an investigation into last month's Air India plane crash found they were flipped off, starving both engines of fuel.",
      "India\u2019s Directorate General of Civil Aviation stated the directive would apply to Boeing 787 Dreamliners and select Boeing 737 variants and that airlines must complete inspections and submit their findings to the regulator by July 21.",
      "A preliminary report into the Air India crash that killed 260 people in the northwestern city of Ahmedabad found that the switches shifted within one second of each other, cutting off fuel supply to both engines. The report, released last week, did not offer any conclusions as to why the plane crashed. It also did not say how the switches could have flipped from run position to the cutoff during the flight.",
      "The movement of the fuel control switches allows and cuts fuel flow to the plane\u2019s engines.",
      "The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed on June 12 shortly after takeoff. It killed all but one of the 242 people on board as well as 19 people on the ground.",
      "The report, issued by India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, noted a 2018 advisory from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, recommending airlines operating Boeing models to inspect the locking feature of fuel cutoff switches.",
      "According to the report, cockpit voice recordings captured a moment of confusion between the pilots, with one asking the other why he cut off the fuel. \u201cThe other pilot responded that he did not do so,\u201d the report said.",
      "Some aviation experts in India speculated the crash was caused due to human error based on the preliminary report. At least two commercial pilots\u2019 associations have rejected such claims.",
      "The Indian Commercial Pilots\u2019 Association in a statement on Sunday said it was \u201cdeeply disturbed by speculative narratives ... particularly the reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide.\u201d",
      "Air India CEO Campbell Wilson on Monday said the preliminary report into the crash of the London-bound plane found no mechanical or maintenance issues with the aircraft and its engines.",
      "In an internal memo to airline staff seen by The Associated Press, Wilson said the report stated that all mandatory maintenance tasks of the aircraft had been completed.",
      "\u201cThere was no issue with the quality of fuel and no abnormality with the take-off roll. The pilots had passed their mandatory pre-flight breathalyser and there were no observations pertaining to their medical status,\u201d he said in the note.",
      "After the crash, Indian authorities ordered deeper checks of Air India\u2019s entire Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet to prevent future incidents. Air India has 33 Dreamliners in its fleet.",

      "NEW DELHI -- NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 Tesla Inc. opened its first showroom in India on Tuesday, marking the electric vehicle maker\u2019s long-anticipated debut in the world\u2019s third-biggest automotive market.",
      "Located in the Bandra-Kurla Complex, an upscale business center in the financial capital Mumbai, the showroom will serve as Tesla\u2019s flagship retail and experience outlet as the company introduces its EV lineup to Indian customers.",
      "Tesla\u2019s entry to India comes after years of delays and policy friction, marking a pivotal expansion in a fast-growing consumer base while global sales are plunging and the company faces challenges in its two core markets, China and the U.S.",
      "Sales of Tesla electric cars fell sharply from April to June as boycotts over Elon Musk\u2019s political views continued keeping buyers away.",
      "For India, Tesla\u2019s entry signals rising investor confidence and strengthens its move towards clean mobility.",
      "The country\u2019s nascent electric vehicle market made up a little more than 2% of total car sales last year. But the government wants to change that and increase the electric vehicle share to 30% by 2030.",
      "Tesla will begin by importing and selling its popular Y model cars in India. The base price would be 6.78 million rupees ($79,089) for the long-range, rear-wheel drive vehicle, according to a presentation by the company during the showroom launch Tuesday.",
      "By comparison, the price tag is around $44,990 in the U.S without a federal tax credit.",
      "The rear-wheel drive will sell for around 6 million rupees ($70,000) in India. Delivery is expected to start from the third quarter, Tesla officials said.",
      "Tesla's higher pricing is likely to make its cars unaffordable for most Indians .",
      "Tesla will compete mostly with German luxury carmakers such as BMW and Mercedes Benz Group AG, and not budget Indian players like Tata Motors Ltd. and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. The luxury car market makes up just about 1% of total vehicle sales",
      "The debut by American EV giant, however, would bring in world class technology to the country, auto analyst Gaurav Vangaal said.",
      "\u201cWith deeper local investments, Tesla can accelerate India\u2019s EV ecosystem, drive innovation and support the government\u2019s goal of higher EV penetration,\u201d said Vangaal, an associate director with S&P Global Mobility.",
      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government has wooed Tesla for years for its global brand value and to boost the country\u2019s clean energy endeavors.",
      "CEO Elon Musk invited Indians in April 2016 to preorder the upcoming Tesla Model 3. Several customers placed an order but the cars never arrived and the booking amount had to be refunded.",
      "Despite his earlier enthusiasm, in 2019 Musk expressed concern in a post on his social media platform X that import taxes could double prices of Tesla cars, making them \u201cunaffordable.\u201d",
      "Tesla pressed Indian authorities to cut import taxes on EVs, which were up to 100%, to be able to test the local market. New Delhi, however, wanted Tesla to set up manufacturing facilities so a comprehensive policy could benefit all the players in the sector.",
      "The dynamics changed after Modi and Musk met in the U.S. in February during a state visit by Modi.",
      "Barely a month later, India rolled out a new policy to woo the likes of Tesla, reducing import taxes to 15% from 70% to 100% for EVs priced cheaper than $35,000 as long the automaker committed to building a factory in the country within three years.",
      "Soon after, Musk announced he would visit India in April to meet Modi. It was widely expected he would unveil Tesla\u2019s plans to set up manufacturing facilities and commit billions of dollars in investments. But Musk cancelled the visit, citing \u201cvery heavy Tesla obligations,\u201d and travelled to China instead.",
      "Since then, Tesla has conveyed it does not have an immediate interest in manufacturing in India.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has said it would be \u201cunfair\u201d to the U.S. if Tesla builds a factory in India to circumvent that country\u2019s tariffs. India and the U.S. are currently negotiating a bilateral trade agreement for greater market access and reducing tariffs on most goods, including automobiles.",
      "Besides bringing Tesla to India, Musk\u2019s India ambition has been to launch Starlink\u2019s commercial internet services. The plan got a boost recently after the company secured regulatory clearances.",
      "Starlink now needs to secure telecommunications airwaves from the government, which may take at least a couple of months, before the services are formally launched.",

      "A music festival in Utsjoki, Finland, brings S\u00e1mi culture to the spotlight under the midnight sun",
      "UTSJOKI, Finland -- It was well past midnight when Mihkku Laiti appeared on stage to perform at an open-air music festival in the Finnish village of Utsjoki, north of the Arctic circle.",
      "Despite the time, Lapland\u2019s famous midnight sun was still up. During the summer months the sun doesn\u2019t go down at all in Utsjoki, which is less than 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Arctic Ocean.",
      "In the glow of blue spotlights, Laiti rapped while a crowd of more than 300 listened, some of them singing along and dancing. Like the majority of Utsjoki\u2019s residents, Laiti is a member of the S\u00e1mi \u2014 Europe's only recognized Indigenous people \u2014 and he rapped in his native S\u00e1mi language.",
      "Laiti, also known by his stage name \u201cYungmiqu,\u201d is the founder of the Loktafeasta rap festival. He first found fame on the television show Talent Finland, where he surprised the judges by rapping in the g\u00e1kti, the traditional dress of the S\u00e1mi. It is brightly colored and often characterized by plaits, pewter embroidery and a high collar.",
      "The festival brought Laiti\u2019s Indigenous culture to the spotlight, though some of his fans could not understand what he was saying. That didn\u2019t seem to bother anyone at the Loktafeasta as the festival mixed performances from artists in both S\u00e1mi language and Finnish.",
      "Some drank beer and ate sausages and the crowd seemed to enjoy the summer festival atmosphere despite spells of rain.",
      "\u201cWhen I rap about my culture ... I want to show how being S\u00e1mi is like from my point of view,\" Laiti told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cBecause there are many stereotypes about S\u00e1mi people and I want to like normalize ... the basic stuff we do and not romanticize those things,\u201d he said. He added that he has not worn the g\u00e1kti for performances for about a year now to show people that it is possible to be S\u00e1mi and wear whatever you want.",
      "The S\u00e1mi traditionally live in Lapland, which stretches from northern parts of Norway to Sweden and Finland to Russia. However, of the roughly 10,000 S\u00e1mi people living in Finland, the majority now live outside their homeland.",
      "The S\u00e1mi people were oppressed for centuries by the powers that ruled and exploited their lands, including bans of the use of their native tongues and efforts to suppress their culture. In the past decades, there have been efforts to reestablish their rights, including the right to use S\u00e1mi languages which is now guaranteed in the Finnish constitution.",
      "Today, the historically semi-nomadic S\u00e1mi people have modern lifestyles. The few who still tend reindeer do so with modern vehicles, digital tools and regulated land use.",
      "However, there is an effort to preserve the S\u00e1mi's cultural identity. Distinctive S\u00e1mi clothing was worn by many at Loktafeasta, as is typical on special occasions.",
      "At the festival, Laiti mostly wanted his fans to be happy and enjoy the music.",
      "\u201cI want people to feel joy, of course, and I just want people to be happy that we have this kind of festival here in Utsjoki,\" he said with a smile.",
      "Among the other acts was a duo comprised of self-confessed old school tango crooner Jaakko Laitinen and rapper Jouni J. They also reside in Lapland and perform in Finnish.",
      "\u201cI see a connection from the hip hop and the tinkering with words to the old Finnish like Kalevala freestyling folk poetry,\" said Laitinen, referring to Finland's national epic about the Earth's creation.",
      "\"So that obvious connection and the Finnish tango ... is part of our soul and heart,\u201d he added.",
      "Although the duo\u2019s songs were a world away from the birthplace of rap music in the Bronx in New York City, their performance brought joy to Utsjoki's locals and visitors.",
      "\u201cMusic travels and music brings people together. It\u2019s the magic of the international language of music,\u201d Laitinen said.",

      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Bangladesh was on the cusp of charting a new beginning last year after its former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was removed from power in a student-led uprising, ending her 15-year rule and forcing her to flee to India.",
      "As the head of a new interim government, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus promised to hold a credible election to return to democracy, initiate electoral and constitutional reforms and restore peace on the streets after hundreds were killed in weeks of violence that began on July 15, 2024.",
      "A year later, the Yunus-led administration has struggled to contain the fallout of the uprising. Bangladesh finds itself mired in a growing political uncertainty, religious polarization and a challenging law-and-order situation.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about Bangladesh a year after the protests that toppled Hasina.",
      "Uncertainty about the future of democracy looms large in Bangladesh.",
      "The student protesters who toppled Hasina formed a new political party, promising to break the overwhelming influence of two major dynastic political parties \u2014 the Bangladesh Nationalists Party, or BNP, and Hasina\u2019s Awami League.",
      "But the party's opponents have accused it of being close to the Yunus-led administration and creating chaos for political mileage by using state institutions.",
      "Meanwhile, Bangladesh's political landscape has further fragmented after the country\u2019s largest Islamist party, the Jamaat-e-Islami, returned to politics more than a decade after it was suppressed by Hasina\u2019s government.",
      "Aligned with the student-led party, it's trying to fill the vacuum left by the Awami League, which was banned in May. Its leader, Hasina, is facing trial for crimes against humanity. The strength of Jamaat-e-Islami, which opposed Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan in 1971, is unknown.",
      "Both BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami party are now at loggerheads over establishing supremacy within the administration and judiciary, and even university campuses.",
      "They are also differing over the timing of a new parliamentary election. Yunus has announced that the polls would be held in April next year, but poor law and order situation and a lack of clear-cut political consensus over it have created confusion. The chief of Bangladesh's military also wanted an election in December this year \u2014 a stance Yunus didn't like.",
      "\u201cPost-revolution honeymoons often don\u2019t last long, and Bangladesh is no exception,\u201d says Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst and senior fellow of Asia Pacific Foundation. \u201cThe interim government faced massive expectations to restore democracy and prosperity. But this is especially difficult to do as an unelected government without a public mandate.\"",
      "Yunus has delayed an election because he wants reforms \u2014 from changes to the constitution and elections to the judiciary and police. Discussions with political parties, except Hasina's Awami League, are ongoing.",
      "Some of the reforms include putting a limit on how many times a person can become the prime minister, introduction of a two-tier parliament, and appointment of a chief justice.",
      "There appears to be little consensus over some basic reforms. While both the BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami parties have agreed to some of them with conditions, other proposals for basic constitutional reforms have become a sticking point.",
      "The Jamaat-e-Islami also wants to give the interim government more time to complete reforms before heading into polls, while BNP has been calling for an early election. The student-led party mostly follows the pattern of the Jamaat-e-Islami party.",
      "Kugelman says the issue of reforms was meant to unite the country, but has instead become a flashpoint.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a divide between those that want to see through reforms and give them more time, and those that feel it\u2019s time to wrap things up and focus on elections,\u201d he says.",
      "Human rights in Bangladesh have remained a serious concern under Yunus.",
      "Minority groups, especially Hindus, have blamed his administration for failing to protect them adequately. The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council says minority Hindus and others have been targeted in hundreds of attacks over the last year. Hasina\u2019s party has also blamed the interim government for arresting tens of thousands of its supporters.",
      "The Yunus-led administration denies these allegations.",
      "Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, says while the interim government has stopped enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions that had occurred under the Hasina government, \u201cthere has been little progress on lasting security sector reforms or to deliver on the pledge to create robust, independent institutions.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Islamist factions \u2014 some of whom have proposed changes to women\u2019s rights and demanded introduction of Sharia law \u2014 are vying for power. Many of them are planning to build alliances with bigger parties like the BNP or the Jamaat-e-Islami.",
      "Such factions have historically struggled to gain significant electoral support despite Bangladesh being a Muslim majority, and their rise is expected to further fragment the country's political landscape.",
      "During Hasina's 15-year rule, Bangladesh was India\u2019s closest partner in South Asia. After her ouster, the Yunus-led administration has moved closer to China, which is India\u2019s main rival in the region.",
      "Yunus\u2019 first state visit was to China in March, a trip that saw him secure investments, loans and grants. On the other hand, India is angered by the ousting of its old ally Hasina and hasn't responded to Dhaka\u2019s requests to extradite her. India stopped issuing visas to Bangladeshis following Hasina's fall.",
      "Globally, Yunus seems to have strong backing from the West and the United Nations, and it appears Bangladesh will continue its foreign policy, which has long tried to find a balance between multiple foreign powers.",
      "But Kugelman says the country's biggest challenge may be the \u201cTrump factor.\u201d",
      "In January, the Trump administration suspended USAID funds to Bangladesh, which had sought significant levels of U.S. support during a critical rebuild period post Hasina's ouster.",
      "\u201cDhaka must now reframe its relations with an unconventional U.S. administration that will largely view Bangladesh through a commercial lens,\u201d Kugelman says.",

      "BERLIN -- Arachnophobes beware: Customs officials on Monday released photos from a seizure of roughly 1,500 young tarantulas found inside plastic containers that had been hidden in chocolate spongecake boxes shipped to an airport in western Germany.",
      "Customs officials found the shipment at Cologne Bonn airport in a package that had arrived from Vietnam, tipped off by a \u201cnoticeable smell\u201d that didn't resemble the expected aroma of the 7 kilograms (about 15 pounds) of the confectionery treats, Cologne customs office spokesman Jens Ahland said.",
      "\"My colleagues at the airport are regularly surprised by the contents of prohibited packages from all over the world, but the fact that they found around 1,500 small plastic containers containing young tarantulas in this package left even the most experienced among them speechless,\u201d Ahland said in a statement.",
      "Ahland hailed an \u201cextraordinary seizure,\" but one that \"saddens us to see what some people do to animals purely for profit.\u201d",
      "Many of the eight-legged creatures didn't survive the trip, in a suspected violation of German animal-welfare rules, while survivors were given to the care of an expert handler, the office said. Reached by phone, Ahland said that the estimated value of the shipment was being assessed.",
      "Criminal proceedings are underway against the intended recipient in the Sauerland region, east of the airport, in part for alleged violations of failure to pay the proper import duties and make the proper customs declarations, the office said.",
      "The tarantulas were discovered about three weeks ago, but the customs office only made the images public on Monday.",

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Appeals judges at a European Union-backed court upheld murder, torture and arbitrary detention convictions against a former Kosovo war liberation fighter Monday. But they cut his prison term from 18 years to 13 years, saying judges imposed too harsh a sentence at his trial.",
      "Pjet\u00ebr Shala was convicted a year ago for his role in the abuse of detainees being held by the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA, at a makeshift jail in a metal factory in Kuk\u0451s, northern Albania, during Kosovo's 1999 war for independence from Serbia.",
      "The 62-year-old Shala watched Monday's hearing at the Kosovo Specialist Chambers by videoconference, and shook his head after Judge Kai Ambos of Germany rejected large parts of his appeal and handed down the new sentence.",
      "The appeals panel, however, ruled that trial judges wrongly found him guilty of five cases of torture and two of arbitrary detention, saying there was insufficient evidence. But they upheld his convictions on the same counts for other detainees and for his role in the murder of one detainee, who was shot and then denied medical treatment.",
      "In reducing his sentence, the three-judge appeals panel ruled that trial judges didn't give sufficient weight to the fact that Shala didn't hold a command role when the man was murdered. The appeals judges also said that the original 18-year sentence was \u201cout of reasonable proportion to comparable cases,\u201d the court said in a statement.",
      "Kosovo\u2019s 1998-1999 fight to break away from Serbia was led by the KLA, whose main leaders, including former President Hashim Thaci, are now being tried in The Hague.",
      "More than 13,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, died during the war, before a NATO bombing campaign forced Serbia to pull its troops out of the country and to cede control to the United Nations and NATO. Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, which was recognized by the United States and most of the West, but not by Serbia or its allies Russia and China.",

      "Relations between the neighbors have deteriorated sharply following an armed confrontation on May 28 in which one Cambodian soldier was killed in one of several small contested patches of land.",
      "The sides have agreed to de-escalate their dispute to avoid further clashes, but continue to implement or threaten measures that have kept tensions high, alongside exchanging sharp words.",
      "The dispute has also roiled Thailand's domestic politics. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was suspended from office after making what critics saw as a disparaging comment about her country\u2019s military in a phone call to Cambodia\u2019s former Prime Minister Hun Sen, who leaked a recording of it.",

      "The prosecutor\u2019s office brought charges against the 40-year-old doctor \u201cfor 15 counts of murder with malice aforethought and other base motives\u201d before a Berlin state court. The prosecutor\u2019s office is seeking not only a conviction and a finding of particularly serious guilt, but also a lifetime ban on practicing medicine and subsequent preventive detention.",
      "Murder charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. If a court establishes that a suspect bears particularly severe guilt, that means he wouldn\u2019t be eligible for release after 15 years as is usually the case in Germany.",
      "Parallel to the trial, the prosecutor\u2019s office is investigating dozens of other suspected cases in separate proceedings.",
      "The man, who has only been identified as Johannes M. in line with Germany privacy rules, is also accused of trying to cover up evidence of the murders by starting fires in the victims' homes. He has been in custody since Aug. 6.",
      "The doctor was part of a nursing service\u2019s end-of-life care team in the German capital and was initially suspected in the deaths of just four patients. That number has crept higher since last summer, and prosecutors are now accusing him of the deaths of 15 people between Sept. 22, 2021, and July 24 last year.",
      "The victims\u2019 ages ranged from 25 to 94. Most died in their own homes.",
      "The doctor allegedly administered an anesthetic and a muscle relaxer to the patients without their knowledge or consent. The drug cocktail then allegedly paralyzed the respiratory muscles. Respiratory arrest and death followed within minutes, prosecutors said.",
      "The doctor did not agree to an interview with a psychiatric expert ahead of the trial, German news agency dpa reported. The expert will therefore observe the defendant\u2019s behavior in court and hear statements from witnesses in order to give an assessment of the man\u2019s personality and culpability.",
      "So far, it is unclear what the palliative care physician\u2019s motive might have been, dpa reported. The victims named in the indictment were all seriously ill, but their deaths were not imminent.",
      "The defendant will not make a statement to the court for the time being, his defense lawyer Christoph Stoll said, according to dpa.",
      "The court has initially scheduled 35 trial dates for the proceedings until January 28, 2026. According to the court, 13 relatives of the deceased are represented as co-plaintiffs. There are several witnesses for each case, and around 150 people in total could be heard in court, dpa reported.",
      "An investigation into further suspected deaths is continuing.",
      "A specially established investigation team in the homicide department of the Berlin State Criminal Police Office and the Berlin public prosecutor\u2019s office investigated a total of 395 cases. In 95 of these cases, initial suspicion was confirmed and preliminary proceedings were initiated. In five cases, the initial suspicion was not substantiated.",
      "In 75 cases, investigations are still ongoing in separate proceedings. Five exhumations are still planned for this separate procedure, prosecutors said.",
      "In 2019, a German nurse who murdered 87 patients by deliberately bringing about cardiac arrests was given a life sentence.",

Local EV maker VinFast is leading the shift by holding nearly a fifth of the market share, according to the European Chamber of Commerce. But it still has only a small share of the two-wheeler market.",
      "But many are concerned about the unclear plan for phasing out the vehicles.",

      "Philippine law generally disqualifies candidates for high public office who have dual citizenship, especially those with foreign citizenship acquired through naturalization, unless they renounce their foreign citizenship.",
      "Teodoro, who was appointed defense chief by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in 2023, is one of the most vocal critics of China\u2019s aggressive actions in the disputed South China Sea and elsewhere in Asia. He has led efforts by the Philippines to deepen its treaty alliance with the United States and build new security ties with other countries to deter China.",
      "The Manila Times reported Teodoro had acquired a Maltese passport in 2016 with a validity of 10 years. The Defense Department said, however, Teodoro\u2019s Maltese passport \u201cwas surrendered and renounced\u201d before he filed his certificate of candidacy for a Senate seat in 2021. Teodoro lost that senatorial bid.",
      "A Philippine congressional committee on appointments was also notified that Teodoro had renounced his Maltese passport and citizenship before it confirmed his appointment as defense secretary, the defense department said and suggested that critics were trying to undermine his image.",
      "\u201cThe motive of this rumor is clear and known to Sec. Teodoro,\u201d the defense department said without elaborating. \u201cThe timing of the article adds to this motive.\u201d",
      "The Department of National Defense did not provide details of Teodoro\u2019s acquisition of his passport from Malta, which belongs to the 27-nation European Union. Malta, through its so-called golden passport scheme, has allowed foreigners to become citizens through financial investment.",
      "In April, the European Court of Justice ordered Malta to close its \u201cgolden passport\u201d program, ruling that citizenship in EU countries cannot be sold. Programs that allow wealthy people to buy citizenship were once widespread in Europe, but they\u2019ve been rolled back out of concern they facilitate transnational crime and sanctions evasion.",

      "Parisians stormed the Bastille fortress and prison on July 14, 1789, a spark for the French Revolution that overthrew the monarchy. In the ensuing two centuries, France saw Napoleon\u2019s empire rise and fall, more uprisings and two world wars before settling into today\u2019s Fifth Republic, established in 1958.",
      "Bastille Day has become a central moment for modern France, celebrating democratic freedoms and national pride, a m\u00e9lange of revolutionary spirit and military prowess.",

      "Beyond the military spectacle in Paris are growing concerns about an uncertain world. On the eve Bastille Day, Macron announced 6.5 billion euros ($7.6 billion) in extra French military spending in the next two years because of new threats ranging from Russia to terrorism and online attacks. The French leader called for intensified efforts to protect Europe and support for Ukraine.",
      "\u2018\u2019Since 1945, our freedom has never been so threatened, and never so seriously,\u2033 Macron said. \u2019\u2019We are experiencing a return to the fact of a nuclear threat, and a proliferation of major conflicts.\u2033",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, arrived in Kyiv on Monday",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, arrived in Kyiv on Monday, a senior Ukrainian official said, as anticipation grew over a possible shift in the Trump administration\u2019s policy on the more than three-year war.",
      "Trump last week teased that he would make a \u201cmajor statement\u201d on Russia on Monday. Trump made quickly stopping the war one of his diplomatic priorities, and he has increasingly expressed frustration about Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s unbudging stance on U.S-led peace efforts.",
      "Trump has long boasted of his friendly relationship with Putin and after taking office in January repeatedly said that Russia was more willing than Ukraine to reach a peace deal. At the same time, Trump accused Zelenskyy of prolonging the war and called him a \u201cdictator without elections.\u201d",
      "But Russia\u2019s relentless onslaught against civilian areas of Ukraine wore down Trump\u2019s patience. In April, Trump urged Putin to \u201cSTOP!\u201d launching deadly barrages on Kyiv, and the following month said in a social media post that the Russian leader \u201c has gone absolutely CRAZY!\u201d as the bombardments continued.",
      "\u201cI am very disappointed with President Putin, I thought he was somebody that meant what he said,\" Trump said late Sunday. \"He\u2019ll talk so beautifully and then he\u2019ll bomb people at night. We don\u2019t like that.\u201d",
      "Trump confirmed the U.S. is sending Ukraine badly needed U.S.-made Patriot air defense missiles to help it fend off Russia\u2019s intensifying aerial attacks.",
      "Trump said that the European Union will pay the U.S. for the \u201cvarious pieces of very sophisticated\u201d weaponry it is sending.",
      "However, the EU is not allowed under its treaties to buy weapons. EU member countries are buying and sending weapons to Ukraine, just as NATO member countries are buying and sending weapons. EU countries set up the European Peace Facility so that countries which supply arms to Ukraine could be refunded to backfill their own stocks.",
      "Russia has pounded Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv, with hundreds of drones and cruise and ballistic missiles that Ukraine's air defenses are struggling to counter. June brought the highest monthly civilian casualties of the past three years, with 232 people killed and 1,343 wounded, the U.N. human rights mission in Ukraine said Thursday. Russia launched 10 times more drones and missiles in June than in the same month last year, it said.",
      "That has happened at the same time as Russia's bigger army is making a new effort to drive back Ukrainian defenders on parts of the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line.",
      "A top ally of Trump, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said Sunday that the conflict is nearing an inflection point as Trump shows growing interest in helping Ukraine fight back against Russia's full-scale invasion. It\u2019s a cause that Trump had previously dismissed as being a waste of U.S. taxpayer money.",
      "\u201cIn the coming days, you\u2019ll see weapons flowing at a record level to help Ukraine defend themselves,\u201d Graham said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d He added: \u201cOne of the biggest miscalculations (Russian President Vladimir) Putin has made is to play Trump. And you just watch, in the coming days and weeks, there\u2019s going to be a massive effort to get Putin to the table.\u201d",
      "Kirill Dmitriev, Putin\u2019s envoy for international investment who took part in talks with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia in February, dismissed what he said were efforts to drive a wedge between Moscow and Washington.",
      "\u201cConstructive dialogue between Russia and the United States is more effective than doomed-to-fail attempts at pressure,\u201d Dmitriev said in a post on Telegram. \u201cThis dialogue will continue, despite titanic efforts to disrupt it by all possible means.\u201d",
      "\u201cEqual dialogue, mutual respect, realism and economic cooperation are the foundations of global security,\u201d he added, echoing comments by Putin.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte was due in Washington on Monday and Tuesday. He planned to hold talks with Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as members of Congress.",
      "Talks during Kellogg\u2019s visit to Kyiv will cover \u201cdefense, strengthening security, weapons, sanctions, protection of our people and enhancing cooperation between Ukraine and the United States,\u201d said the head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential office, Andrii Yermak.",
      "\u201cRussia does not want a cease fire. Peace through strength is President Donald Trump\u2019s principle, and we support this approach,\u201d Yermak said.",
      "Russian troops conducted a combined aerial strike at Shostka, in the northern Sumy region of Ukraine, using glide bombs and drones early Monday morning, killing two people, the regional prosecutor\u2019s office said. Four others were injured, including a 7-year-old, it said.",
      "Overnight from Sunday to Monday, Russia fired four S-300/400 missiles and 136 Shahed and decoy drones at Ukraine, the air force said. It said that 61 drones were intercepted and 47 more were either jammed or lost from radars mid-flight.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said its air defenses downed 11 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions on the border with Ukraine, as well as over the annexed Crimea and the Black Sea.",

      "European trade ministers are meeting in Brussels after U.S. President Donald Trump announced 30% tariffs on the European Union",
      "BRUSSELS -- European trade ministers are meeting in Brussels on Monday, following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s surprise announcement of 30% tariffs on the European Union.",
      "The EU is America\u2019s biggest business partner and the world\u2019s largest trading bloc. The U.S. decision will have repercussions for governments, companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t impose countermeasures at this stage, but we should prepare to be ready to use all the tools in the toolbox,\u201d said Denmark\u2019s foreign minister, Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, told reporters ahead of the meeting. \u201cSo we want a deal, but there\u2019s an old saying: \u2019If you want peace, you have to prepare for war.'\u201d",
      "The tariffs, also imposed on Mexico, are set to start on Aug. 1 and could make everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals more expensive in the U.S., and destabilize economies from Portugal to Norway.",
      "Meanwhile, Brussels decided to suspend retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods scheduled to take effect Monday in hopes of reaching a trade deal with the Trump administration by the end of the month.",
      "The \u201ccountermeasures\u201d by the EU, which negotiates trade deals on behalf of its 27 member countries, will be delayed until Aug. 1.",
      "Trump\u2019s letter shows \u201cthat we have until the first of August\u201d to negotiate, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels on Sunday.",
      "Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, the EU's trade representative in its talks with the U.S., said negotiations would continue",
      "\u201cI\u2019m absolutely 100% sure that a negotiated solution is much better than the tension which we might have after the 1st of August,\" he told reporters in Brussels on Monday.",
      "\u201cI cannot imagine walking away without genuine effort. Having said that, the current uncertainty caused by unjustified tariffs cannot persist indefinitely and therefore we must prepare for all outcomes, including, if necessary, well-considered proportionate countermeasures to restore the balance in our transit static relationship.\u201d",
      "The letters to the EU and Mexico come in the midst of an on-and-off Trump threat to impose tariffs on countries and right an imbalance in trade.",
      "Trump imposed tariffs in April on dozens of countries, before pausing them for 90 days to negotiate individual deals. As the three-month grace period ended this week, he began sending tariff letters to leaders, but again has pushed back the implementation day for what he says will be just a few more weeks.",
      "If he moves forward with the tariffs, it could have ramifications for nearly every aspect of the global economy.",
      "In the wake of the new tariffs, European leaders largely closed ranks, calling for unity but also a steady hand to not provoke further acrimony.",
      "Just last week, Europe was cautiously optimistic.",
      "Officials told reporters on Friday they weren't expecting a letter like the one sent Saturday and that a trade deal was to be inked in \u201cthe coming days.\" For months, the EU has broadcast that it has strong retaliatory measures ready if talks fail.",
      "Reeling from successive rebukes from Washington, \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said Monday the EU is \u201cdoubling down on efforts to open new markets\u201d and pointed to a new economic agreement with Indonesia as one.",

      "Israel has struck military tanks in southern Syria, where government forces and Bedouin tribes clash with Druze militias",
      "BUSRA AL-HARIR, Syria -- Israel\u2019s army said Monday it struck military tanks in southern Syria, where government forces and Bedouin tribes clashed with Druze militias in the latest escalation in the Middle East country struggling for stability after a 13-year civil war.",
      "Dozens of people have been killed in the fighting between local militias and clans in Syria \u2019s Sweida province. Government security forces that were sent to restore order Monday also clashed with local armed groups.",
      "Syria's Interior Ministry has said more than 30 people have died and nearly 100 others have been injured. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based war monitor, reported at least 99 dead, including two children, two women and 14 members of the security forces.",
      "The clashes in Syria initially broke out between armed groups from the Druze and Sunni Bedouin clans, the observatory said, with some members of the government security forces \u201cactively participating\u201d in support of the Bedouins.",
      "Syrian Interior Ministry spokesperson Noureddine al-Baba said government forces entered Sweida in the early morning to restore order.",
      "\u201cSome clashes occurred with outlawed armed groups, but our forces are doing their best to prevent any civilian casualties,\u201d he told the state-run Al-Ikhbariya TV.",
      "Al-Baba told The Associated Press that the \u201cclashes are fundamentally not sectarian in nature.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe real conflict is between the state and bandits and criminals, not between the state and any Syrian community,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the contrary, the state views the Druze community in Sweida as a partner in advancing the national unity project.\u201d",
      "Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the observatory, said the conflict started with the kidnapping and robbery of a Druze vegetable seller by members of a Bedouin tribe who set up a checkpoint, leading to tit-for-tat attacks and kidnappings.",
      "The Interior Ministry described the situation as a dangerous escalation that \u201ccomes in the absence of the relevant official institutions, which has led to an exacerbation of the state of chaos, the deterioration of the security situation, and the inability of the local community to contain the situation.\u201d",
      "U.N. Deputy Special Envoy for Syria Najat Rochdi expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d over the violence and urged the government and local groups to \u201ctake immediate steps to protect civilians, restore calm, and prevent incitement.\u201d",
      "She said in a statement the clashes underscored the \u201curgent need for genuine inclusion, trust-building, and meaningful dialogue to advance a credible and inclusive political transition in Syria.\u201d",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement that the Israeli military \u201cattacked targets in Syria as a message and a clear warning to the Syrian regime \u2014 we will not allow harm to the Druze in Syria.\u201d",
      "In Israel, the Druze are seen as a loyal minority and often serve in the armed forces.",
      "While many Druze in Syria have said they do not want Israel to intervene on their behalf, factions from the Druze minority have also been suspicious of the new authorities in Damascus after former President Bashar Assad fled the country in December during a rebel offensive led by Sunni Islamist insurgent groups. On several occasions, Druze groups have clashed with security forces from the new government or allied factions.",
      "In May, Israeli forces struck a site near the presidential palace in Damascus, in what was seen as a warning to Syrian interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa. The strike came after dozens were killed in fighting between pro-government gunmen and Druze fighters in the town of Sahnaya and the Druze-majority Damascus suburb of Jaramana.",
      "Over half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981.",
      "A group led by Sheikh Hikmat Al-Hijri, a Druze spiritual leader who has been opposed to the new government in Damascus, on Monday issued a statement calling for \u201cinternational protection\u201d and accused government forces and General Security agency of \u201csupporting takfiri gangs\u201d \u2014 using a term for extremist Sunni militants.",
      "Syria\u2019s Foreign Ministry called for \u201call countries and organizations to respect the authority of the Syrian Arab Republic and refrain from supporting any separatist rebel movements.\u201d In a statement, it called for Syrians to \u201ccease acts of violence, surrender illegal weapons and thwart those seeking to dismantle the Syrian social fabric and sow discord and division.\u201d",
      "The Druze religious sect is a minority group that began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. In Syria, they largely live in the southern Sweida province and some suburbs of Damascus, mainly in Jaramana and Ashrafiyat Sahnaya to the south.",
      "The Druze developed their own militias during the country\u2019s nearly 14-year civil war, during which they sometimes faced attacks by the Islamic State group and other militant groups.",
      "Israel has taken an aggressive stance toward Syria\u2019s new leaders since Assad's fall, saying it does not want Islamic militants near its borders. Israeli forces earlier seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone on Syrian territory along the border with the Golan Heights and have launched hundreds of airstrikes on military sites in Syria.",

Syrian officials have acknowledged holding indirect talks with Israel to attempt to defuse tensions, but have not responded to reports that the two sides have also held direct talks.",

      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Balancing on wooden boards, coppersmiths are hammering and fastening sheets of the reddish-brown metal onto the roof of Copenhagen\u2019s Old Stock Exchange.",
      "Fifteen months after a devastating fire destroyed more than half the building, a multistage effort to restore the 400-year-old landmark is beginning to take shape as workers lay a new copper roof on some of the less-damaged parts.",
      "Back in February, workers began dismantling what remained of the old green copper roof, before carpenters could replace the wooden boards beneath. Now the coppersmiths are working through the summer to remain on schedule.",
      "\u201cThe copper work, it\u2019s not sophisticated, but the way it\u2019s done is old school \u2026 we are doing it exactly as it was before,\u201d said Ren\u00e9 Hansen of Danish coppersmith Toft Kobber. He said that only about 35 people have knowledge of such old techniques in Scandinavia.",
      "Early in the morning of April 16, 2024, a fire tore through the sprawling red-brick building, largely destroying its copper roof and toppling its distinctive 56-meter (184-foot) spire in the shape of four intertwined dragon tails. Two days later, a large section of the building\u2019s outer wall collapsed inward.",
      "Construction of the exchange, a major tourist attraction in the heart of the Danish capital, started in 1615 and it first opened in 1624.",
      "The fire is believed to have started under the roof, which had been wrapped in scaffolding because of renovation work. Police said in November that nothing pointed to the blaze being the result of a criminal act.",
      "The building's owner, Denmark\u2019s Chamber of Commerce, says it plans to rebuild the landmark by 2029. It aims to reopen the damaged, but not destroyed, Stock Exchange Hall by the end of this year.",
      "\u201cOur ambition is, in December this year, to open one of the floors,\u201d said Lars Daugaard Jepsen, the head of reconstruction. \u201cThat is very, very challenging, but we will make it.\u201d",
      "Once the huge white construction tent now covering the building comes off, locals are likely to notice at least one big difference. Hansen said that, due to reduced air pollution, it could take 60 to 80 years for the new copper covering to achieve its predecessor's turquoise hue through the chemical reaction known as patination.",
      "\u201cWe are driving electric cars, a lot of people are bicycling,\u201d he said. In the past, \u201cit took about 30 to 40 years before it started to get green, and now we think it will take about 60 to 80.\u201d",
      "The dragon-tail spire \u2014 a lead-covered wooden construction \u2014 will be rebuilt too, though that is still a while away. Work to design it is due to start next month, and building work is slated to get under way in 2028. A sculptor is still being sought.",
      "Daugaard Jepsen said the building was rebuilt eight times over its 400 years. The plan now is to rebuild it as it was four centuries ago, with \u201ca more magnificent ballroom.\u201d",
      "The aim is to use the same materials that were available in the 17th century. More than 800,000 handmade red bricks have been ordered from Germany and Poland, almost 900 pine trees are being brought from Denmark and Sweden, and recycled copper comes from Finland.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the way to rebuild a building like this,\u201d said Daugaard Jepsen. \u201cIn the real way.\u201d",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump will make an unprecedented second state visit to the U.K. between Sept. 17 and 19 when he will be hosted by King Charles II and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump will make an unprecedented second state visit to the U.K. between Sept. 17 and 19 when he will be hosted by King Charles II and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace said Monday.",
      "Trump, who is a big supporter of the royal family, particularly of the monarch, will be accompanied by his wife, Melania Trump during the three-day visit, the palace confirmed.",
      "No U.S. president has been invited for a second state visit. Trump previously enjoyed the pomp and pageantry of the state visit in 2019 during his first term when he was hosted by Charles' late mother, Queen Elizabeth II.",
      "The invitation for the second state visit from the king was hand-delivered by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in February during a meeting at the White House.",
      "After reading it, Trump said it was a \u201cgreat, great honor\u201d and appeared particularly pleased by the fact he will be staying at Windsor Castle, to the west of the capital. \u201cThat\u2019s really something,\u201d he said.",
      "Precedent for second-term U.S. presidents who have already made a state visit is usually tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle, as was the case for George W. Bush and Barack Obama.",
      "State visits are ceremonial meetings between heads of state that are used to honor friendly nations and sometimes smooth relations between rivals. While the king formally issues the invitation for a state visit, he does so on the advice of the elected government.",
      "The visit is seen as part of Starmer\u2019s effort to keep Trump close and lessen the impact of some of his polices on the U.K. The relationship between the two appears amicable, and has helped the U.K. from facing the sort of hefty U.S. tariffs that other nations are seeing.",
      "But like Trump's previous visit, it's unlikely he will be welcomed by all. Last time, a day of protests saw the flying of a giant blimp depicting Trump as an angry orange baby from outside Parliament.",
      "Lawmakers from Starmer\u2019s Labour Party have also questioned whether the honor should be extended to Trump at a time that he is supporting Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and threatening the sovereignty of allies such as Canada and Greenland.",
      "Charles could also face some challenges during the visit because he is head of state of both the United Kingdom and Canada, which Trump has suggested should become the 51st U.S. state. During a speech to the Canadian parliament in May the king highlighted Canada\u2019s \u201cunique identity\u201d and \u201csovereignty,\u201d while echoing the words of the country\u2019s national anthem when he said \u201cThe True North is indeed strong and free.\u201d",
      "State visits to Britain are particularly prized by heads of state because they come with a full complement of royal pomp and circumstance, including military reviews, carriage rides and a glittering state banquet hosted by the monarch.",
      "The events normally take place in and around Buckingham Palace in central London. But like last week's state visit from French President Emmanual Macron and his wife Brigitte, the Trumps will stay at Windsor Castle. Buckingham Palace is undergoing extensive remodeling.",

      "YAOUNDE, Cameroon -- YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) \u2014 Cameroon's 92-year-old president announced Monday he will seek his eighth term in the upcoming October elections. The announcement comes after months of speculation that the aging leader would not run, setting the stage for an electoral showdown.",
      "Paul Biya, Africa\u2019s second longest serving president after Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea, is frequently sick and abroad. Last year, talk spread that he had died, prompting the government to publicly deny the rumors. Cameroon\u2019s second president since independence from France in 1960, Biya has been in power since 1982.",
      "Promising that the best is yet to come in his post on social media, Biya reiterated his determination to rule, saying, \u201cRest assured that my determination to serve you is commensurate with the serious challenges facing us.\"",
      "The more than 40 years of Biya\u2019s rule have left a lasting impact. His government has faced various challenges, including allegations of corruption and a secessionist movement in Cameroon\u2019s English-speaking provinces that has forced thousands out of school and triggered deadly clashes with security forces.",
      "\u201cPresident Biya\u2019s announcement to run again is a clear sign of Cameroon\u2019s stalled political transition. After over 40 years in power, what the country needs is renewal \u2014 not repetition. Cameroonians deserve democratic change and accountable leadership,\u201d Nkongho Felix Agbor, a human rights advocate and lawyer told The Associated Press.",

      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says he raised concerns with Chinese President Xi Jinping about a Chinese naval live-fire exercise near Australia",
      "BEIJING -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he complained to China's President Xi Jinping during a meeting on Tuesday about a Chinese naval live-fire exercise off the Australian coast that forced commercial aircraft to change course.",
      "The exercise, held in February, saw a Chinese flotilla partially circumnavigate Australia in international waters beneath a busy commercial flight path in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand.",
      "The mission was widely regarded as a display of Chinese military strength and was among several issues raised in what Albanese described as a \u201cvery constructive meeting.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Xi said that China engaged in exercises, just as Australia engages in exercises,\u201d Albanese told reporters, referring to freedom of navigation missions conducted by Australian military in the disputed South China Sea.",
      "\u201cThere was no breach of international law by China, but that we were concerned about the notice and the way that it happened, including the live-fire exercises,\u201d Albanese added.",
      "Albanese said the Chinese leader did not mention U.S. pressure on allies to declare positions on a potential war over Taiwan.",
      "\u201cI reaffirmed on Taiwan Australia's position of support for the status quo,\u201d Albanese said. Australia has a one-China policy that recognizes the People\u2019s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China and considers Taiwan a part of China.",
      "With the 10th anniversary of Australia's free trade deal with China falling this year, both governments have agreed to review the pact with an aim to improve economic relations.",
      "Following the meeting with Xi, Albanese met Premier Li Qiang and Chairman Zhao Leji of the National People\u2019s Congress.",
      "At the outset of the leaders' meeting, Xi told Albanese that seeking common ground while setting aside differences is in line with \"the fundamental interests of our two countries and our two peoples.\u201d",
      "Albanese concurred with Xi's remark, saying \u201cThat approach has indeed produced very positive benefits for both Australia and for China.\u201d",
      "There had been speculation that Xi would use the meeting to raise Albanese\u2019s plan to end a Chinese company\u2019s 99-year-lease on the strategically important Port of Darwin, which the United States is concerned could be used to spy on its military forces.",
      "Landbridge Industry Australia, a subsidiary of Rizhao-based Shandong Landbridge Group, signed the lease with the debt-laden Northern Territory government in 2015. That was three years after U.S. Marines began annual rotations through Darwin as part of the U.S. pivot to Asia.",
      "Chinese social media influencer Lu Wenxing had posted that China could retaliate against ending the lease with \u201ccountermeasures, such as restricting Australian companies\u2019 market access in China or tightening imports of key resources such as iron ore.\u201d",
      "But Albanese said Xi didn\u2019t raise the lease, nor did he discuss the broader issue of Australia\u2019s foreign investment rules that prevent Chinese ownership of critical infrastructure.",
      "Reporters questioned Albanese about Chinese security officials' treatment of Australian journalists who traveled to China with him.",
      "Reporter Stephen Dziedzic said he was with a camera crew on Tuesday recording a piece to camera for Australian TV news in front of a Beijing landmark when they were interrupted by security guards. The guard told them police would be called and the Australians weren't permitted to leave.",
      "Another reporter, Anna Henderson, said guards told journalists to delete their footage. Australian diplomats intervened and TV crews were permitted to leave.",
      "\u201cChina has a different system, obviously, with the media,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "The state visit is Albanese's second visit to China since he was first elected prime minister in 2022.",
      "Australia, like many countries in the Asia-Pacific region, is caught between China and the United States.

      "Collier County, Florida, uses one of the most advanced 911 systems in the U.S., allowing callers to send texts and videos",
      "NAPLES, Fla. -- When an emergency happens in Collier County, Florida, the 911 calls go to one of the most high-tech communications centers in the U.S., where callers can send text and video from the scene to dispatchers.",
      "Moving to what's known as an NG911 \u2014 or Next Generation 911 \u2014 system is a journey Sheriff Kevin Rambosk and Bob Finney, the county's director of communication, have been on for much of the past decade.",
      "It's a long way from Feb. 16, 1968, when Alabama's then-House Speaker Rankin Fite made the nation's very first 911 call in Haleyville, Alabama, on a bright red, rotary-style landline telephone. That ceremonial call came just 35 days after AT&T announced plans to use 911 as a nationwide emergency number.",
      "Today, most calls to 911 originate with cellphones, with dispatchers in upgraded centers using geo tracking to get accurate geographic locations from callers.",
      "But the response time in an emergency depends on the type of technology being used at any of the 6,000 emergency communications centers in the U.S. that receive 911 calls. There is no uniform emergency system in the U.S., so individual cities, counties, states or geographic regions are responsible for operating their own 911 call centers.",
      "While some states have fully updated to NG911 systems, others are still using legacy 911 systems that rely on antiquated equipment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just reminded in these last two weeks, with the flooding in Texas, just how important the work of 911 is,\u201d said Michael Martin, CEO of RapidSOS, which provides infrastructure that passes critical data to emergency centers across the United States.",
      "The Collier County Sheriff's Office covers 911 calls from an area of about 2,030 square miles (5,258 square kilometers) that stretches from sandy beaches at the southernmost tip of the Gulf Coast on Florida's peninsula inland to the Everglades.",
      "It's a region that has been ravaged by hurricanes this century, including Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Hurricanes Ian and Milton most recently.",
      "That's why Sheriff Rambosk wanted a high-tech emergency operations center.",
      "\u201cWe just believe that when we can reduce the response time using technology, it will improve safety and survivability of those calling in,\u201d said Rambosk, who has been sheriff since 2009. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really what we\u2019re all about, keeping people safe and rescuing them when they need it.\u201d",
      "Today 61 full-time employees and three part-timers staff two emergency operations centers around the clock.",
      "They rely on data that RapidSOS collects from connected buildings, devices, vehicles and even smart watches to send first responders to emergency scenes. The baseline data is provide free of charge to all 911 centers, Martin said.",
      "As Hurricane Helene was tracking toward north Florida last September, forecasters were predicting it could hit Tallahassee as a major Category 3 storm. Officials in Leon County, which serves the state's Capitol and nearby counties on legacy 911 equipment, reached out to Collier County, some 430 miles (692 kilometers) to the southeast, to see if they could take over emergency calls if the storm knocked their center out.",
      "Helene moved to the east of Tallahassee, but Collier County was prepared to help if needed.",
      "\"Because of the partnership with Rapid SOS, they were able to create a map to where not only did we see our own calls, but we could see exactly where the calls were coming in Tallahassee,\u201d Finney said.",
      "Collier County has also partnered with Charleston, South Carolina, as a backup 911 center. Each region is fully prepared to take on 911 calls for the other in case their emergency system goes down for any reason.",
      "It's a similar story in North Carolina, where legislation in 2017 helped establish funding for a next generation 911 system, said Pokey Harris, who serves as president of the National Association of State 911 Administrators and executive director of the North Carolina 911 Board.",
      "Harris said Hurricane Helene provided validation for the upgraded system by being able to direct 911 calls from areas that were devastated by the storm to other parts of North Carolina that were not affected.",
      "\u201cDuring Helene, if a citizen could reach a dial tone, even though their local 911 center may have been impacted because of infrastructure devastation, another center somewhere in the state could answer their call,\u201d Harris said.",
      "Next Generation 911 systems aren't cheap.",
      "\u201cThere has been no federal funding for 911,\u201d Martin, of RapidSOS said. \u201cIt has been in various draft formats as long as I\u2019ve been doing this and it\u2019s never gotten through Congress.\u201d",
      "There is also no federal oversight of 911, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really quite remarkable how well 911 works despite those challenges,\" Martin said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a testament to the people of 911, not the technology.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- Nvidia\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang says the technology giant has won approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence to China.",
      "The news came in a company blog post late Monday and Huang also spoke about the coup on China\u2019s state-run CGTN television network in remarks shown on X.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. government has assured Nvidia that licenses will be granted, and Nvidia hopes to start deliveries soon,\u201d the post said.",
      "\u201cToday, I'm announcing that the U.S. government has approved for us filing licenses to start shipping H20s,\u201d Huang told reporters in Beijing. He noted that half of the world's AI researchers are in China.",
      "\u201cIt's so innovative and dynamic here in China that it's really important that American companies are able to compete and serve the market here in China,\u201d he said.",
      "Huang recently met with Trump and other U.S. policymakers and this week is in Beijing to attend a supply chain conference and speak with Chinese officials.",
      "The broadcast showed Huang meeting with Ren Hongbin, the head of the China Council for Promotion of International Trade, host of the China International Supply Chain Expo, which Huang was attending. Nvidia is an exhibitor.",
      "Nvidia has profited enormously from rapid adoption of AI, becoming the first company to have its market value surpass $4 trillion last week. However, the trade rivalry between the U.S. and China has been weighing heavily on the industry.",
      "Washington has been tightening controls on exports of advanced technology to China for years, citing concerns that know-how meant for civilian use could be deployed for military purposes. The emergence of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI chatbot in January renewed concerns over how China might use the advanced chips to help develop its own AI capabilities.",
      "In January, before Trump began his second term in office, the administration of President Joe Biden launched a new framework for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, an attempt to balance national security concerns about the technology with the economic interests of producers and other countries.",
      "The White House announced in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips and AMD\u2019s MI308 chips to China.",
      "Nvidia had said the tighter export controls would cost the company an extra $5.5 billion, and Huang and other technology leaders have been lobbying President Donald Trump to reverse the restrictions. They argue that such limits hinder U.S. competition in a leading edge sector in one of the world\u2019s largest markets for technology.",
      "They've also warned that U.S. export controls could end up pushing other countries toward China\u2019s AI technology.",
      "Nvidia's U.S. traded shares slipped 0.5% in afterhours trading Monday, but its shares traded in Frankfurt, Germany, jumped 3.2% early Tuesday.",

      "Inflation likely accelerated in June as sweeping tariffs on nearly all imports may have pushed up prices for electronics, appliances, and other goods, economists forecast",
      "WASHINGTON -- Inflation likely accelerated in June as sweeping tariffs on nearly all imports may have pushed up prices for electronics, appliances, and other goods, economists forecast.",
      "Consumer prices probably rose 2.6% last month from a year ago, up from an annual increase of 2.4% in May, according to data provider FactSet. The Labor Department will issue its inflation report at 8:30 a.m. eastern. On a monthly basis, prices likely rose 0.3% from May to June, the largest increase since January, economists project.",
      "Worsening inflation could pose a political challenge for President Donald Trump, who promised during last year's presidential campaign to immediately lower costs. The sharp inflation spike of 2022-2023 was the worst in four decades and soured most Americans on former president Joe Biden's handling of the economy.",
      "Faster price increases would also likely underscore the Federal Reserve's reluctance to cut its short-term interest rate, as Trump is loudly demanding.",
      "Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, inflation is forecast to have risen 3% in June from a year earlier, up from a 2.8% rise in May. On a monthly basis, it is also expected to have picked up 0.3% from May to June, according to FactSet. Economists closely watch core prices because they typically provide a better sense of where inflation is headed.",
      "Trump has imposed sweeping duties of 10% on all imports, plus 50% levies on steel and aluminum, 30% on goods from China, and 25% on imported cars. Just last week the president threatened to hit the European Union with a new 30% tariff starting Aug. 1.",
      "So far, the tariffs haven't noticeably pushed up inflation, which has been mild for the past four months. Core inflation has fallen from 3.3% in January to 2.8% in May, though that is still above the Fed's 2% target. If inflation in June is much weaker than economists forecast, Trump will likely renew his demands that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell immediately reduce borrowing costs.",
      "Powell and other Fed officials have emphasized that they want to see how the economy evolves as the tariffs take effect before cutting their key short-term rate. The Fed chair has said that the duties could both push up prices and slow the economy, a tricky combination for the central bank since higher costs would typically lead the Fed to hike rates while a weaker economy often spurs it to reduce them.",
      "Trump on Monday said that Powell has been \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what the hell he\u2019s doing.\u201d The president added that the economy was doing well despite Powell\u2019s refusal to reduce rates, but it would be \u201cnice\u201d if there were rate cuts \u201cbecause people would be able to buy housing a lot easier.\u201d",
      "Last week, White House officials also attacked Powell for cost overruns on the years-long renovation of two Fed buildings, which are now slated to cost $2.5 billion, roughly one-third more than originally budgeted. While Trump legally can't fire Powell just because he disagrees with his interest rate decisions, the Supreme Court has signaled, he may be able to do so \u201cfor cause,\u201d such as misconduct or mismanagement.",
      "While inflation was mild in May, there were already signs in last month's report that tariffs were starting to have some impact. The cost of furniture, appliances, toys, and tools rose, though those increases were offset by falling prices for airfares, hotels, and muted rises in rental costs.",
      "Some companies have said they have or plan to raise prices as a result of the tariffs, including Walmart, the world's largest retailer. Automaker Mitsubishi said last month that it was lifting prices by an average of 2.1% in response to the duties, and Nike has said it would implement \u201csurgical\u201d price hikes to offset tariff costs.",
      "But many companies have been able to postpone or avoid price increases, after building up their stockpiles of goods this spring to get ahead of the duties. Other companies may have refrained from lifting prices while they wait to see whether the U.S. is able to reach trade deals with other countries that lower the duties.",

      "A federal court in Miami began considering Monday whether Elon Musk's car company should share blame for the death of a stargazing university student after a runaway Tesla sent her flying 75 feet through the air and severely injured her boyfriend",
      "NEW YORK -- A rare trial against Elon Musk's car company began Monday in Miami where a jury will decide if it is partly to blame for the death of a stargazing university student after a runaway Tesla sent her flying 75 feet through the air and severely injured her boyfriend.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiff argue that Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance feature called Autopilot should have warned the driver and braked when his Model S sedan blew through flashing red lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at nearly 70 miles an hour in the April 2019 crash. Tesla lays the blame solely on the driver, who was reaching for a dropped cell phone.",
      "\u201cThe evidence clearly shows that this crash had nothing to do with Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology,\u201d Tesla said in a statement. \u201cInstead, like so many unfortunate accidents since cellphones were invented, this was caused by a distracted driver.\u201d",
      "The driver, George McGee, was sued separately by the plaintiffs. That case was settled.",
      "A judgement against Tesla could be especially damaging as the company works to convince the public its self-driving technology is safe during a planned rollout of hundreds of thousands of Tesla robotaxis on U.S. roads by the end of next year. A jury trial is rare for the company, whose suits over crashes are often dismissed or settled, and this one is rarer yet because a judge recently ruled that the family of the stricken Naibel Benavides Leon can argue for punitive damages.",
      "The judge, Beth Bloom of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, issued a partial summary judgement last month, throwing out charges of defective manufacturing and negligent misrepresentation against Tesla. But she also ruled plaintiffs could argue other claims that would make the company liable and ask for punitive damages, which could prove costly.",
      "\u201cA reasonable jury could find that Tesla acted in reckless disregard of human life for the sake of developing their product and maximizing profit,\u201d Bloom said in a filing.",
      "The 2021 lawsuit alleges the driver relied on Autopilot to reduce speed or come to a stop when it detected objects in its way, including a parked Chevrolet Tahoe that Benavides and her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, had gotten out of near Key West, Florida, to look up at the sky. The Tesla rammed the Tahoe at highway speeds, causing it to rotate and slam into Benavides, tossing her into a wooded area and killing her.",
      "In legal documents, Tesla denied nearly all of the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it expects that consumers will follow warnings in the vehicle and instructions in the owners\u2019 manual, as well as comply with driving laws. Tesla warns owners in manuals that its cars cannot drive themselves and they need to be ready to intervene at all times.",
      "Plaintiff lawyers argue that Tesla should have a geofenced its Autopilot so it only worked on the big roads it was designed for and drivers couldn\u2019t use it on smaller roads such as the rural one where Benavides was killed. They also say data and video evidence shows the Autopilot did detect the Tahoe but then failed to warn the driver as they claim it should have done.",
      "Tesla has since improved its driver-assistance and partial self-driving features, but still faces lawsuits and investigations over what critics say is a gap between its exaggerated depictions of how well they work and what they can actually do.",
      "Federal auto safety regulators recalled 2.3 million Teslas in 2023 for problems with Autopilot failing to sufficiently alert drivers if they weren\u2019t paying attention to the road. They then put Tesla under investigation last year for saying it fixed the problem though it was unclear it actually did that.",
      "Musk has also continued to make public comments suggesting Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d technology, a more advanced version of Autopilot, allows cars to drive themselves, despite warnings from regulators not to do so because it could lead to overreliance on the systems, crashes and deaths. That technology has been involved in three fatal crashes and is under investigation of its ability to see in low-visibility conditions such as sunlight glare or fog.",
      "Tesla is promising a much more robust self-driving technology to power its robotaxis with no one behind the wheel. A test run in Austin, Texas, of the taxis appears to have gone mostly well, though there are scattered problems, such as a case when one cab went down the opposing lane.",

      "The U.S. government says it's placing a 17% duty on most fresh Mexican tomatoes after negotiations ended without an agreement to avert the tariff",
      "The U.S. government said Monday it is immediately placing a 17% duty on most fresh Mexican tomatoes after negotiations ended without an agreement to avert the tariff.",
      "Proponents said the import tax will help rebuild the shrinking U.S. tomato industry and ensure that produce eaten in the U.S. is also grown there. Mexico currently supplies around 70% of the U.S. tomato market, up from 30% two decades ago, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange.",
      "Robert Guenther, the trade group's executive vice president, said the duty was \u201can enormous victory for American tomato farmers and American agriculture.\"",
      "But opponents said the import tax will make tomatoes more expensive for U.S. consumers. Mexican greenhouses specialize in vine-ripened tomatoes, while Florida tomatoes are typically grown in fields and picked green.",
      "\u201cAs an industry, we are saddened that American consumers will have to pay a tomato tax, or duty, for a reduced selection of the tomatoes they prefer, such as tomatoes on the vine, grape tomatoes, Romas, cocktail tomatoes and other specialty varieties,\u201d said Lance Jungmeyer, president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, which represents importers of Mexican tomatoes.",
      "Tim Richards, a professor at the Morrison School of Agribusiness at Arizona State University, said U.S. retail prices for tomatoes will likely rise around 8.5% with a 17% duty.",
      "Jacob Jensen, a trade policy analyst at the American Action Forum, a right-leaning policy institute, said areas with a higher reliance on Mexican tomatoes could see price increases close to 10%, since it will be more difficult to replace that supply, while other parts of the U.S. could see price increases closer to 6%.",
      "The duty stems from a longstanding U.S. complaint about Mexico's tomato exports and is separate from the 30% base tariff on products made in Mexico and the European Union that President Donald Trump announced on Saturday.",
      "The Commerce Department said in late April that it was withdrawing from a deal it first reached with Mexico in 2019 to settle allegations the country was exporting tomatoes to the U.S. at artificially low prices, a practice known as dumping.",
      "As part of the deal, Mexico had to sell its tomatoes at a minimum price and abide by other rules. Since then, the agreement has been subject to periodic reviews, but the two sides always reached an agreement that avoided duties.",
      "In announcing its withdrawal from the Tomato Suspension Agreement, the Commerce Department said it had been \u201cflooded with comments\u201d from U.S. tomato growers who wanted better protection from Mexican goods.",
      "\u201cMexico remains one of our greatest allies, but for far too long our farmers have been crushed by unfair trade practices that undercut pricing on produce like tomatoes. That ends today,\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement. \u201cThis rule change is in line with President Trump\u2019s trade policies and approach with Mexico.\u201d",
      "But others, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Restaurant Association, had called on the Commerce Department to reach an agreement with Mexico. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, and Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, had also urged the Commerce Department to leave the current tomato agreement in place.",
      "In a letter sent to Lutnick last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 30 other business groups said U.S. companies employ 50,000 workers and generate $8.3 billion in economic benefits moving tomatoes from Mexico into communities across the country.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned that withdrawing from the agreement \u2013 at a time when the business community is already navigating significant trade uncertainty \u2013 could lead to retaliatory actions by our trading partners against other commodities and crops that could create further hardship for U.S. businesses and consumers,\u201d the letter said.",

Room air conditioners accounted for as much as one quarter of the electricity needed in India during times of the highest usage in 2024, a measure known as peak demand, according to estimates by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. New AC units added between 2019 and 2024 have increased India\u2019s peak demand by an amount roughly equivalent to what it would take to power New Delhi for a year, the researchers estimated.",
      "Energy demand is typically highest during the summer when temperatures can reach 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the country.",
      "If changes are not made, India is expected to have power shortages by next year. India\u2019s hunger for energy is also a key reason the country is one of the highest emitters of planet-heating gases. Clean energy use is growing, but most of India\u2019s electricity is provided by climate-polluting fossil fuels such as coal.",
      "Nikit Abhyankar, a leader of the India Energy and Climate Center at the University of California, Berkley, said that Delhi, like other major Indian cities, now experiences dual peaks in electricity use \u2014 one in the afternoon and another around midnight \u2014 driven largely by air conditioners. While solar energy can help offset daytime demand, nighttime cooling still relies heavily on fossil fuels.",
      "The air conditioner proposal is the latest in a series of government measures over the past decade aimed at saving energy, such as mandating that government offices be cooled at no less than 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit). In 2022, the government launched the Mission Life program that includes public service messages encouraging people to reduce emissions by cutting electricity use or skipping unnecessary car trips. The initiative announced with much fanfare has received mixed responses.",
      "Some are supportive of the proposed change to air conditioner settings. Sunil Kumar, a 47-year-old from East Delhi, said the rule could prevent fire hazards and lower bills.",
      "\u201cPeople used to live without air conditioners. We can adjust,\u201d said Kumar, who drives a small commercial vehicle known as a tuk-tuk.",
      "New Delhi-based businessperson Surjeet Singh said turning air conditioners down to their current lowest setting was \u201cunnecessary.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople have gotten too comfortable,\u201d he said, suggesting that cities invest in planting trees to tackle urban heat.",
      "Abhyankar, the California professor, said that while changing temperature settings will help, requiring air conditioners to be energy efficient would do more.",
      "\u201cTightening the minimum efficiency standards can change things pretty significantly,\u201d said Abhyankar, who has also studied the energy sector in the U.S., China, Indonesia and Vietnam.",
      "Calling the proposed air conditioner rule a \u201cstep in the right direction,\u201d Pramod Singh, an energy savings expert with New Delhi-based Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy, said replacing the country\u2019s estimated 80 million older generation, inefficient air conditioners is a key challenge for the government.",
      "Many units available in India are so inefficient they couldn't be sold in many other countries, Abhyankar said.",
      "\u201cAlthough India imports most key components for its air conditioners from China, nearly 80% of the air conditioners that are currently sold in India would be banned in China,\u201d he said.",
      "Energy experts said other small changes can reduce energy use and customer costs, such as making sure new buildings have adequate ventilation, combining air conditioners with other cooling methods and using smart technologies to run air conditioners.",
      "\u201cAir conditioner use reduces significantly if users also run their ceiling fans, as the room cools much faster,\u201d said Abhyankar.",

      "The search for those missing after Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels sank a ship in the Red Sea has ended as at least four people are presumed dead and 11 others remain unaccounted for",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The search for those missing after Yemen's Houthi rebels sank a ship in the Red Sea has ended as at least four people are presumed dead and 11 others remain unaccounted for, the private security firms involved said Monday.",
      "The announcement came as satellite photos show long, trailing oil slicks from where the bulk carrier Eternity C sank, as well as another where the sinking of the bulk carrier Magic Seas by the Iranian-backed Houthis took place.",
      "Both ships were attacked over a week ago by the rebels as part of their campaign targeting vessels over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip that's upended shipping in the Red Sea, through which $1 trillion of goods usually passes a year.",
      "The private security firms Ambrey and Diaplous Group ran the search for those missing from the Eternity C, which had a three-man security team aboard but requested no escort from either the U.S. Navy or a European Union force in the region. The ship came under attack July 7 and faced hours of Houthi assaults by small arms and bomb-carrying drones before ultimately sinking in the Red Sea.",
      "The initial attack on the Eternity C came a day after the attack on the Magic Seas. Both ships were Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned vessels.",
      "Ten people were recovered alive from the attack, including eight Filipino crew members and a Greek and Indian from the vessel\u2019s security team, the EU's Operation Aspides said. At least four are presumed to have been killed in the attack, leaving 11 others missing, the EU mission has said.",
      "The Houthis claimed to have taken some mariners after the attack, but have offered no evidence of that. The U.S. Embassy in Yemen said it believed the rebels had \u201ckidnapped\u201d some of the crew.",
      "\u201cThe decision to end the search has been taken by the vessel\u2019s Owner reluctantly but it believes that, in all the circumstances, the priority must now be to get the 10 souls safely recovered alive ashore and to provide them with the urgent medical support they need at this difficult time,\u201d a statement by the security firms said. \u201cThe thoughts of all those involved in the rescue operation are with the families of those who remain missing.\u201d",
      "The attacks on the vessels also raised concerns about damage to the environment in the Red Sea, home to corals and wildlife that draws divers, tourists and scientists. Satellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed Monday by The Associated Press show large, spreading oil slicks in the southern Red Sea where the vessels sank.",
      "Wim Zwijnenburg, an analyst with the Dutch peace organization PAX, estimated the length of the slick from the Eternity C at some 80 kilometers (50 miles) and from the Magic Seas at some 65 kilometers (40 miles). He warned it could threatened wildlife reserves in nearby Eritrea in Africa and elsewhere.",
      "The oil comes from the ship's tanks and had been used for their own propulsion. Other shipping disasters have seen much of the slicks evaporate on their own, though they cause damage to the environment, too.",
      "From November 2023 to December 2024, the Houthis targeted more than 100 ships with missiles and drones. In their campaign so far, the Houthis have sank four vessels and killed at least eight mariners.",
      "The Houthis stopped their attacks during a brief ceasefire in the war. They later became the target of an intense weekslong campaign of airstrikes ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump before he declared a ceasefire had been reached with the rebels.",
      "The Houthis' new attacks come as a new possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war remains in the balance. Meanwhile, the future of talks between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran\u2019s battered nuclear program is in question after Israel launched a 12-day war against the Islamic Republic that saw the Americans bomb three Iranian atomic sites.",

      "Democratic President Joe Biden handed out subsidies to chipmakers and electric vehicle manufacturers",
      "WASHINGTON -- Democrats and Republicans don\u2019t agree on much, but they share a conviction that the government should help American manufacturers, one way or another.",
      "Democratic President Joe Biden handed out subsidies to chipmakers and electric vehicle manufacturers. Republican President Donald Trump is building a wall of import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 around the U.S. economy to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.",
      "Yet American manufacturing has been stuck in a rut for nearly three years. And it remains to be seen whether the trend will reverse itself.",
      "The U.S. Labor Department reports that American factories shed 7,000 jobs in June for the second month in a row. Manufacturing employment is on track to drop for the third straight year.",
      "The Institute for Supply Management, an association of purchasing managers, reported that manufacturing activity in the United States shrank in June for the fourth straight month. In fact, U.S. factories have been in decline for 30 of the 32 months since October 2022, according to ISM.",
      "\u201cThe past three years have been a real slog for manufacturing,\u2019\u2019 said Eric Hagopian, CEO of Pilot Precision Products, a maker of industrial cutting tools in South Deerfield, Massachusetts. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get destroyed like we did in the recession of 2008. But we\u2019ve been in this stagnant, sort of stationary environment.\u2019\u2019",
      "Big economic factors contributed to the slowdown: A surge in inflation, arising from the unexpectedly strong economic recovery from COVID-19, raised factory expenses and prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023. The higher borrowing costs added to the strain.",
      "Government policy was meant to help.",
      "Biden\u2019s tax incentives for semiconductor and clean energy production triggered a factory-building boom \u2013 investment in manufacturing facilities more than tripled from April 2021 through October 2024 \u2013 that seemed to herald a coming surge in factory production and hiring. Eventually anyway.",
      "But the factory investment spree has faded as the incoming Trump administration launched trade wars and, working with Congress, ended Biden\u2019s subsidies for green energy. Now, predicts Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, \u201cmanufacturing production will continue to flatline.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf production is flat, that suggests manufacturing employment will continue to slide,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cManufacturing is likely to suffer a recession in the coming year.\u2019\u2019",
      "Meanwhile, Trump is attempting to protect U.S. manufacturers \u2014 and to coax factories to relocate and produce in America \u2014 by imposing tariffs on goods made overseas. He slapped 50% taxes on steel and aluminum, 25% on autos and auto parts, 10% on many other imports.",
      "In some ways, Trump\u2019s tariffs can give U.S. factories an edge. Chris Zuzick, vice president at Waukesha Metal Products, said the Sussex, Wisconsin-based manufacturer is facing stiff competition for a big contract in Texas. A foreign company offers much lower prices. But \u201cwhen you throw the tariff on, it gets us closer,\u2019\u2019 Zuzick said. \u201cSo that\u2019s definitely a situation where it\u2019s beneficial.\u2019\u2019",
      "But American factories import and use foreign products, too \u2013 machinery, chemicals, raw materials like steel and aluminum. Taxing those inputs can drive up costs and make U.S producers less competitive in world markets.",
      "Consider steel. Trump\u2019s tariffs don\u2019t just make imported steel more expensive. By putting the foreign competition at a disadvantage, the tariffs allow U.S. steelmakers to raise prices \u2013 and they have. U.S.-made steel was priced at $960 per metric ton as of June 23, more than double the world export price of $440 per ton, according to industry monitor SteelBenchmarker.",
      "In fact, U.S. steel prices are so high that Pilot Precision Products has continued to buy the steel it needs from suppliers in Austria and France \u2014 and pay Trump\u2019s tariff.",
      "Trump has also created considerable uncertainty by repeatedly tweaking and rescheduling his tariffs. Just before new import taxes were set to take effect on dozens of countries on July 9, for example, the president pushed the deadline back to Aug. 1 to allow more time for negotiation with U.S. trading partners.",
      "The flipflops have left factories, suppliers and customers bewildered about where things stand. Manufacturers voiced their complaints in the ISM survey: \u201cCustomers do not want to make commitments in the wake of massive tariff uncertainty,\u2019\u2019 a fabricated metal products company said.",
      "\u201cTariffs continue to cause confusion and uncertainty for long-term procurement decisions,\u2019\u2019 added a computer and electronics firm. \u201cThe situation remains too volatile to firmly put such plans into place.\u2019\u2019",
      "Some may argue that things aren\u2019t necessarily bad for U.S. manufacturing; they\u2019ve just returned to normal after a pandemic-related bust and boom.",
      "Factories slashed nearly 1.4 million jobs in March and April 2020 when COVID-19 forced many businesses to shut down and Americans to stay home. Then a funny thing happened: American consumers, cooped up and flush with COVID relief checks from the government, went on a spending spree, snapping up manufactured goods like air fryers, patio furniture and exercise machines.",
      "Suddenly, factories were scrambling to keep up. They brought back the workers they laid off \u2013 and then some. Factories added 379,000 jobs in 2021 \u2014 the most since 1994 \u2014 and then tacked on another 357,000 in 2022.",
      "But in 2023, factory hiring stopped growing and began backtracking as the economy returned to something closer to the pre-pandemic normal.",
      "In the end, it was a wash. Factory payrolls last month came to 12.75 million, almost exactly where they stood in February 2020 (12.74 million) just before COVID slammed the economy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a long, strange trip to get back to where we started,\u2019\u2019 said Jared Bernstein, chair of Biden\u2019s White House Council of Economic Advisers.",
      "Zuzick at Waukesha Metal Products said that it will take time to see if Trump\u2019s tariffs succeed in bringing factories back to America.",
      "\u201cThe fact is that manufacturing doesn\u2019t turn on a dime,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt takes time to switch gears.\u2019\u2019",
      "Hagopian at Pilot Precision is hopeful that tax breaks in Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill will help American manufacturing regain momentum.",
      "\u201cThere may be light at the end of the tunnel that may not be a locomotive bearing down,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "For now, manufacturers are likely to delay big decisions on investing or bringing on new workers until they see where Trump\u2019s tariffs settle and what impact they have on the economy, said Ned Hill, professor emeritus in economic development at Ohio State University.",
      "\u201cWith all this uncertainty about what the rest of the year is going to look like,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a hesitancy to hire people just to lay them off in the near future.\u2019\u2019",
      "\u201cEveryone,'' said Zuzick at Waukesha Metal Products, \u201dis kind of just waiting for the new normal.\u2019\u2019",

    "story": [
      "The osprey is in decline in one of its key territories and some scientists blame overfishing of menhaden, an important food for the birds",
      "GLOUCESTER POINT, Va. -- Stepping onto an old wooden duck blind in the middle of the York River, Bryan Watts looks down at a circle of sticks and pine cones on the weathered, guano-spattered platform. It\u2019s a failed osprey nest, taken over by diving terns.",
      "\u201cThe birds never laid here this year,\u201d said Watts, near the mouth of Virginia\u2019s Chesapeake Bay. \u201cAnd that's a pattern we've been seeing these last couple of years.\u201d",
      "Watts has a more intimate relationship with ospreys than most people have with a bird \u2014 he has climbed to their nests to free them from plastic bags, fed them by hand and monitored their eggs with telescopic mirrors.",
      "The fish-eating raptor known for gymnastic dives and whistle-like chirps is an American conservation success story. After pesticides and other hazards nearly eliminated the species from much of the country, the hawk-like bird rebounded after the banning of DDT in 1972 and now numbers in the thousands in the U.S.",
      "But Watts has documented an alarming trend. The birds, which breed in many parts of the U.S., are failing to successfully fledge enough chicks around their key population center of the Chesapeake Bay. The longtime biologist blames the decline of menhaden, a small schooling fish critical to the osprey diet. Without menhaden to eat, chicks are starving and dying in nests, Watts said.",
      "Watts's claim has put him and environmental groups at odds with the fishing industry, trade unions and sometimes government regulators. Menhaden is valuable for fish oil, fish meal and agricultural food as well as bait.",
      "U.S. fishermen have caught at least 1.1 billion pounds of menhaden every year since 1951. Members of the industry tout its sustainability and said the decline in osprey may have nothing to do with fishing.",
      "But without help, the osprey population could tumble to levels not seen since the dark days of DDT, said Watts, director of the Center for Conservation Biology at The College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.",
      "\u201cThe osprey are yelling pretty loudly that, hey, there's not enough menhaden for us to reproduce successfully,\u201d Watts said. \u201cAnd we should be listening to them to be more informed fully on the fisheries side, and we should take precaution on the fisheries management side. But that hasn't won the day at this point.\u201d",
      "Watts, who has studied osprey on the Chesapeake for decades, has backed his claims of population decline by publishing studies in scientific journals. He said it boils down to a simple statistic \u2014 to maintain population, osprey pairs need to average 1.15 chicks per year.",
      "Osprey were reproducing at that level in the 1980s, but today in some areas around the main stem of the Chesapeake, it's less than half of that, Watts said. In particularly distressed areas, they aren't even reproducing at one-tenth that level, he said. And the decline in available menhaden matches the areas of nesting failure, Watts said.",
      "Also called pogies or bunkers, the oily menhaden are especially important for young birds because they are more nutritious than other fish in the sea. Osprey \u201creproductive performance is inextricably linked to the availability and abundance\u201d of menhaden, Watts wrote in a 2023 study published in Frontiers in Marine Science.",
      "Conservationists have been concerned for years, saying too many menhaden have been removed to maintain their crucial role in the ocean food chain. Historian H. Bruce Franklin went so far as to title his 2007 book on menhaden \u201cThe Most Important Fish In The Sea.\u201d",
      "Menhaden help sustain one of the world's largest fisheries, worth more than $200 million at the docks in 2023. Used as bait, the fish are critical for valuable commercial targets such as Maine lobster. They're also beloved by sportfishermen.",
      "The modern industry is dominated by Omega Protein, a Reedville, Virginia, company that is a subsidiary of Canadian aquaculture giant Cooke. The harvesting of the menhaden is performed by an American company, Ocean Harvesters, which is based in Reedville and contracts with Omega, which handles processing. The companies pushed back at the idea that fishing is the cause of osprey decline, although they did acknowledge that fewer menhaden are showing up in some parts of the bay.",
      "Federal data show osprey breeding is in decline in many parts of the country, including where menhaden is not harvested at all, said Ben Landry, an Omega spokesperson. Climate change, pollution and development could be playing a role, said Landry and others with the company.",
      "Blaming fishing \u201cjust reeks of environmental special interest groups having an influence over the process,\u201d Landry said.",
      "The menhaden fishery is managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, an interstate body that crafts rules and sets fishing quotas. Prompted by questions about ospreys, it created a work group to address precautionary management of the species in the Chesapeake Bay.",
      "In April, this group proposed several potential management approaches, including seasonal closures, restrictions on quotas or days at sea, and limitations on kinds of fishing gear. The process of creating new rules could begin this summer, said James Boyle, fishery management plan coordinator with the commission.",
      "The osprey population has indeed shown declines in some areas since 2012, but it's important to remember the bird's population is much larger than it was before DDT was banned, Boyle said.",
      "\u201cThere are big increases in osprey population since the DDT era,\u201d Boyle said, citing federal data showing a six-fold increase in osprey populations along the Atlantic Coast since the 1960s.",
      "To a number of environmental groups, any decline is too much. This irritates some labor leaders who worry about losing more jobs as the fishing industry declines.",
      "Kenny Pinkard, retired vice president of UFCW Local 400's executive board and a longtime Virginia fishermen, said he feels the industry is being scapegoated.",
      "\u201cThere are some people who just don't want to see us in business at all,\u201d he said.",
      "But Chris Moore, Virginia executive director for Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said the country risks losing an iconic bird if no action is taken. He said Watts's studies show that the osprey will fail without access to menhaden.",
      "\u201cOsprey have been a success story,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe're in a situation where they're not replacing their numbers. We'll actually be in a situation where we're in a steep decline.\u201d",

      "Musk's deliberate efforts to mold Grok into a challenger of what he considers the tech industry's \u201cwoke\u201d orthodoxy on race, gender and politics has repeatedly got the chatbot into trouble, most recently when it spouted antisemitic tropes, praised Adolf Hitler and made other hateful commentary to users of Musk's X social media platform just days before Grok 4's launch.",
      "But its tendency to consult with Musk's opinions appears to be a different problem.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d said Simon Willison, an independent AI researcher who's been testing the tool. \"You can ask it a sort of pointed question that is around controversial topics. And then you can watch it literally do a search on X for what Elon Musk said about this, as part of its research into how it should reply.\"",
      "One example widely shared on social media \u2014 and which Willison duplicated \u2014 asked Grok to comment on the conflict in the Middle East. The prompted question made no mention of Musk, but the chatbot looked for his guidance anyway.",
      "As a so-called reasoning model, much like those made by rivals OpenAI or Anthropic, Grok 4 shows its \u201cthinking\u201d as it goes through the steps of processing a question and coming up with an answer. Part of that thinking this week involved searching X, the former Twitter that's now merged into xAI, for anything Musk said about Israel, Palestine, Gaza or Hamas.",
      "\u201cElon Musk\u2019s stance could provide context, given his influence,\u201d the chatbot told Willison, according to a video of the interaction. \u201cCurrently looking at his views to see if they guide the answer.\u201d",
      "Musk and his xAI co-founders introduced the new chatbot in a livestreamed event Wednesday night but haven't published a technical explanation of its workings \u2014 known as a system card \u2014 that companies in the AI industry typically provide when introducing a new model.",
      "The company also didn't respond to an emailed request for comment Friday.",
      "The lack of transparency is troubling for computer scientist Talia Ringer, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who earlier in the week criticized the company's handling of the technology's antisemitic outbursts.",
      "Ringer said the most plausible explanation for Grok's search for Musk's guidance is assuming the person asking it a question is actually xAI or Musk.",
      "\u201cI think people are expecting opinions out of a reasoning model that cannot respond with opinions,\" she said. \"So for example it interprets \u2018Who do you support, Israel or Palestine?\u2019 as 'Who does xAI leadership support?\u201d",
      "Willison also said he finds Grok 4's capabilities impressive but said people buying software \"don\u2019t want surprises like it turning into \u2018mechaHitler\u2019 or deciding to search for what Musk thinks about issues.\u201d",
      "\u201cGrok 4 looks like it\u2019s a very strong model. It\u2019s doing great in all of the benchmarks,\u201d Willison said. \u201cBut if I\u2019m going to build software on top of it, I need transparency.\u201d",

      "Curveballs are disappearing from Major League Baseball as pitchers prioritize velocity, emphasizing sliders and sweepers",
      "ATLANTA -- Curveballs have been thrown a curve by a modern game valuing velocity over variety, disappearing from the major leagues by more than 20,000 annually.",
      "The Athletics have thrown curves on just 2.5% of pitches this season. The overall big league figure dropped from 10.7% in 2019 to 8.1% last year, the lowest since MLB starting tracking in 2008, before rising slightly to 8.5% this season.",
      "There were 22,962 fewer curveballs in 2024 than five years earlier.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t really see a lot of people throwing 12-6 curveballs anymore,\u201d Tampa Bay pitcher Shane Baz said. \u201cThey\u2019d rather have a hard cutter/slider. It\u2019s a lot easier for guys to throw a sweeper than it is a 12-6 curveball.\u201d",
      "Baz\u2019s 28.1% is seventh in curveball use among those who have thrown at least 1,000 pitches this season.",
      "Baltimore\u2019s Charlie Morton, first at 39%, learned to throw a hook from his dad.",
      "\u201cHe was reading some article or maybe he was reading some pitching book,\u201d Baltimore\u2019s 41-year-old right-hander said. \u201cYou basically throw it like you\u2019re re-throwing a knife.\u201d",
      "Hall of Famer Candy Cummings, a 145-game winner, is credited with inventing the curveball in 1863 when he was 14, discovering the movement when he threw sea shells into the Atlantic Ocean. Some attribute the curve to amateur pitcher Fred Goldsmith in 1870.",
      "With an average velocity of 80.2 mph, curves are the slowest and loopiest of breaking pitches, often disrupting the timing of batters set for smoke. The phrase \u201cthrown a curveball\u201d has become part of the English language, much like \u201cscrewball,\" more a phrase than a pitch these days.",
      "Sandy Koufax, Nolan Ryan and Clayton Kershaw were among the consummate curveballers, bamboozling batters as balls they gave up on dropped like hang gliders into the strike zone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s become an industry of throwing over pitching,\u201d New York Yankees senior adviser Omar Minaya said. \u201cWhen you pitch, you use different pitches. What we\u2019re seeing in the industry as a whole, especially with showcases, is people are looking more at velocity than pitchability \u2014 as a scout, I said that unfortunately.\u201d",
      "Former pitcher Dallas Braden, now a broadcaster, longs for those days of deception.",
      "\u201cYou almost sympathize with the hitter in the moment because you\u2019re like: Damn, I couldn\u2019t have hit that. He couldn\u2019t hit that. Nobody could have hit that,\u201d Braden said. \u201cThe eephus is now almost like as close as we get, when a position player is on the mound, to an aesthetically pleasing pitch like that, just the visual presentation of the pitch starting in the clouds and ending up at the ankles.\u201d",
      "Nike\u2019s \u201cChicks Dig the Long Ball\u201d commercial defined baseball in the Steroids Era. These days the slogan might as well be: \u201cVelo Rules!\u201d There were just 214 pitches of 100 mph or more in 2008. There were a record 3,880 two years ago and this year is on track for 3,252.",
      "In tandem, starting pitcher use has dropped. Starters have averaged just under 5 1/3 innings this season, down from 6 1/3 innings in the 1980s. Their pitch count averages 85.7, down from 97 in 2010",
      "Average four-seam fastball velocity is a record 94.4 mph this season, up from 91.9 mph when MLB started tracking in 2008. But fastballs \u2014 four-seam, two-seam and cutters, have dropped from 62.1% to 55%.",
      "Those missing hooks and heaters have been replaced by sliders, sweepers and slurves. They are 22.6% of pitches this year, up from 13.9% in 2008, and their average velocity has risen to 84.8 mph from 83.4 mph.",
      "Colorado throws curves the most often at 15.6%, not that it has brought any success to a team that entered the break at 22-74, on track for a 37-125 finish and the post-1900 record for losses.",
      "The Athletics haven\u2019t thrown 10% curveballs since 2017.",
      "\u201cIf you look around the game, swing and miss has taken more of a priority, so guys are trying to throw more sweepers with more horizontal movement, or they\u2019re trying to throw the slider really hard at the bottom of the zone,\u201d Athletics pitching coach Scott Emerson said. \u201cThey\u2019re worried about contact with the curveball.\u201d",
      "Veteran pitchers note the curve\u2019s decline as youngsters integrate into staffs.",
      "\u201cAs you\u2019re an amateur going to the big leagues guys are looking at velo. Guys are just looking at stuff,\u201d Yankees ace Gerrit Cole said. \u201cVelo is important and it pays.\u201d",
      "Maybe because the pitchers who throw curves are committed, batters have a .225 average this season on curves, down from .263 on fastballs and up slightly from .222 on sliders, sweepers and slurves.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s just how the game is trending: to throw it as hard as you can, spin it the best you can and hope the hitter doesn\u2019t hit it,\u201d Emerson said. \u201cThe hitters are up there trying to swing as hard they can. If they hit it with hard contact, make 27 swings that are really hard, you got a chance to hit a homer here and there. And it\u2019s taken away from the contact-type pitchers.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s been fun the last 10 days,\u201d said Rafaela, who is hitting .421 with five homers and 15 RBIs during a career-best 10-game hitting streak.",

      "Veteran Trevor Story, who had struggled during three-injury plagued seasons with the Red Sox after signing a six-year, $140-million contract as a free agent in March 2022, has picked it up by playing solid defense at short with timely hitting.",

I think it all starts with the pitching, which has been lights out.\u201d",
      "The pitching has been led by All-Star Garrett Crochet, who posted his first complete game, shutting out the Rays on Saturday.",

      "He could have plenty of company.",
      "The 28-player group could swell significantly in the coming decade, with Yankees teammate Giancarlo Stanton (432), Mike Trout (395), Paul Goldschmidt (370), Manny Machado (359), Freddie Freeman (353), Nolan Arenado (351) and Bryce Harper (346) all within striking distance.",
      "Lurking a little further down the active leaderboard, Kyle Schwarber (314), Eugenio Suarez (307), Mookie Betts (282), Francisco Lindor (267), Shohei Ohtani (257) and Pete Alonso (247) are piling up big numbers and still in their early 30s.",
      "And then there's Juan Soto, who already has 224 homers at the tender age of 26.",
      "Some are stronger candidates than others, given their injury history and age. The 35-year-old Stanton has battled various ailments over the past several seasons, but has been productive when he's played.",
      "The 33-year-old Trout has been slowed by injuries, too, but hit enough homers in his 20s that it would be surprising if he didn't eventually reach the mark.",
      "This generation's group of sluggers is reminiscent of a stretch from 2001 to 2009, when Barry Bonds, Alex Rodriguez, Ken Griffey Jr., Jim Thome, Sammy Sosa, Rafael Palmeiro, Manny Ramirez, Frank Thomas and Gary Sheffield all made it to 500.",
      "The biggest difference is several of those players' accomplishments were tainted \u2014 at least to some \u2014 because it was part of a era that included widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs.",
      "The club has been relatively hard to join over the past decade. The last to reach 500 was Detroit's Miguel Cabrera on Aug. 22, 2021.",
      "Before that, Red Sox star David Ortiz slugged his 500th homer in 2015.",

The 27-year-old Busch is batting .290 with 19 homers, providing the NL Central-leading Cubs some thump.",
      "Cristopher Sanchez, Phillies: The left-hander has been a big part of a stacked Philadelphia rotation with a 8-2 record, 2.50 ERA and 122 strikeouts in 115 innings. He put an exclamation point on his first half on Sunday, giving up just one run over 7 1/3 innings in a 2-1 win over the Padres.",

      "The AL East race could be a barnburner as summer turns to fall with the Blue Jays (55-41), Yankees (53-43), Red Sox (53-45) and Rays (50-47) all in the mix. Even the last-place Orioles aren't completely out of it yet, sitting at 43-52 which is 11 1/2 games out of first place.",

      "Jannik Sinner can look forward to his next matchup against Carlos Alcaraz now because he has finally ended a losing streak against his rival",
      "LONDON -- Jannik Sinner needed this victory.",
      "He wanted to win Wimbledon, of course, and it would have meant a lot to him no matter who the opponent was in the final.",
      "That this championship, his fourth at a Grand Slam tournament, came via a win over Carlos Alcaraz made it all the more significant to Sinner \u2014 and to the future of their burgeoning rivalry, the best men's tennis has to offer these days and, perhaps, for many years to come.",
      "\u201cIt is important, for sure,\u201d the No. 1-ranked Sinner said Sunday night after prevailing 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 against No. 2 Alcaraz, \u201cbecause when you lose several times against someone, it\u2019s not easy.\u201d",
      "Sinner had lost five matches in a row against Alcaraz, none more disheartening than the one they played last month in the French Open final. Sinner grabbed a two-set lead in that one, then held a trio of championship points, before losing in five sets after 5 hours, 29 minutes.",
      "\u201cI keep looking up to Carlos, because even today, I felt like he was doing couple of things better than I did,\u201d Sinner said. \u201cSo that\u2019s something ... we will work on and prepare ourselves, because he\u2019s going to come for us again.\u201d",
      "Perhaps as soon as at the U.S. Open, which starts in New York on Aug. 24 and where Sinner is the defending champion. They will be seeded No. 1 and No. 2 again, so could only meet there in another final.",
      "Alcaraz won the trophy at Flushing Meadows in 2022, beginning a stretch in which he and Sinner have combined to win nine of the past 12 majors. That includes the last seven, leaving zero doubt that these two young guys \u2014 Sinner is 23, Alcaraz is 22 \u2014 have pushed themselves way past everyone else in the game at the moment.",
      "\u201cI'm just really, really happy about having this rivalry with him. It\u2019s great for us, and it is great for tennis. Every time we play against each other, our level is really high,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cWe don\u2019t (see) a level like this, if I\u2019m honest with you. I don\u2019t see any (other players) playing against each other (and) having the level that we are playing when we face each other.\u201d",
      "Both serve well, although Sinner was better at that Sunday. Both return well, although, again, Sinner was superior over these particular three hours. Both cover the court exceedingly well \u2014 Alcaraz is faster; Sinner has a bigger reach and is a better slider. Both hit the ball so, so hard \u2014 Alcaraz is more prone to the spectacular; Sinner is as pure and consistent a ball-striker as there is.",
      "And so on.",
      "One other contrast, usually, is that Alcaraz shows emotion, whether via yells of \u201cVamos!\u201d or the sort of point-to-his-ear-then-pump-his-fist celebration he did after winning Sunday's opening set by stretching and reaching low for a cross-court backhand to close a 12-stroke point.",
      "Sinner is far more contained. Even his arm-raised victory poses are mild-mannered.",
      "Sunday, though, there were more visible displays. He even shouted \u201cLet's go!\u201d after one point. Later, he shook his racket overhead while the crowd roared after a well-struck backhand. When he took a set with a forehand winner, Sinner held a pose, then lifted a fist.",
      "When the match was over, he crouched, lowered his head and pounded his right palm on the grass five times.",
      "\u201cYou saw a bit more energy from him in the big moments,\" said one of Sinner's coaches, Darren Cahill, \"and a bit more focus to knuckle down and make sure that, when he had his nose in front, that he kept on closing the door against Carlos.\u201d",
      "Both players spoke about their matchup motivating them to work hard to try to improve.",
      "\u201cIt gives me the opportunity to just give my 100% every practice, every day. Just to be better, thanks to that,\u201d said Alcaraz, who won the past two Wimbledon titles and was 5-0 in Grand Slam finals before Sunday. \u201cThe level that I have to maintain, and I have to raise, if I want to beat Jannik is really high.\u201d",
      "Sinner described Alcaraz as \u201csomeone who is young, who wins basically everything.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have to be ready,\u201d Sinner explained, \u201cif you want to keep up.\u201d",

      "Tommy Pham homered in the second for Pittsburgh. Buxton, who hit for the cycle Saturday, had an RBI double in the third.",
      "Tied 1-1, Minnesota had runners on first and second with one out in the eighth, but Willi Castro hit a dribbler in front of the plate and DaShawn Keirsey Jr. was thrown out at third. Trevor Larnach then flew out.",

      "But as the match wore on, his ability to get to Sinner's serve waned: Over the last three sets, Alcaraz accumulated only three break points and converted zero. Another issue was that Alcaraz's serving, while speedy, was spotty.",

      "\u201cHe was pushing me to the limit on every point. So mentally, sometimes, it\u2019s really tough to maintain the good focus or the good level during the whole match when you see the opponent just playing such a great tennis,\" Alcaraz said. \u201cAt some points, I didn\u2019t know what I had to do in the match, because from the baseline, I was feeling he was better than me, and I couldn\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d",

      "Chris Gotterup gets to spend an extra week on links golf after winning the biggest title of his career",
      "NORTH BERWICK, Scotland -- Chris Gotterup came up with the clutch shots on the biggest stage he has faced Sunday, taking down crowd favorite Rory McIlroy with a 4-under 66 and a two-shot victory in the Scottish Open that gives him another week of links golf.",
      "Gotterup was one shot ahead of McIlroy when he hit his tee shot on the 196-yard 12th hole to 2 feet for birdie \u2014 McIlroy missed from 4 feet \u2014 to take command.",
      "Gotterup's lead was down to one over McIlroy and England's Marco Penge, but McIlroy missed a 12-foot birdie at the par-5 16th and Gotterup hit a right-to-left putt from 10 feet in the heart of the cup for a two-shot lead with two to play.",
      "Gotterup was so emotional when it was over he could barely speak, rubbing his eyes before saying, \u201cEveryone at home ... this is awesome. I'm not going to be able to keep it together.\u201d",
      "He didn't blink the rest of the way on the course after his final birdie, winning by two over McIlroy (68) and Penge (66) for his second PGA Tour title.",
      "\u201cChris played a great round of golf. He was so solid,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cMade the bogey on 15 but bounced back with a really nice birdie on 16. After he got a couple ahead, I just couldn\u2019t claw back.\u201d",
      "Gotterup, built more like fellow New Jersey athlete Mike Trout than a golfer, also won the opposite-field Myrtle Beach Classic last year.",
      "The Genesis Scottish Open had one of the strongest fields of the year, and the perks are far greater. Gotterup, who played three years at Rutgers and won player-of-the-year awards as a senior at Oklahoma, gets into the Masters for the first time next April.",
      "The first stop is the British Open at Royal Portrush. Gotterup earned one of the three final spots through the International Qualifying Series, joined by Nicolai Hojgaard and Matti Schmid.",
      "Hojgaard closed with a 64 to move up 11 spots into a tie for fourth to join his twin brother at Royal Portrush. Schmid shot 71 and tied for 17th, helped by Jake Knapp's late collapse.",
      "Knapp was tied for the lead through five holes, but he took double bogey on the par-3 ninth and the rest of the back nine didn't go much better. He closed with a 74, losing on a chance to win and to play next week at Royal Portrush.",
      "McIlroy had said he was playing his best golf since going into the Masters, which he won in emotional fashion to complete the career Grand Slam. This was the first time he had seriously contended since that Masters victory, good timing with the Open in his native Northern Ireland starting on Thursday.",
      "But he couldn't keep up with Gotterup, who looked shaky at the start when he drove into a bunker and had to make a 4-foot bogey putt. He was rock solid the rest of the way.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really happy with where my game is \u2014 the way I played over the weekend, the shots that I hit, how I controlled my ball flight,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cIt has been a great week. Missing the trophy, that\u2019s about it.\u201d",

      "Grace Kim of Australia is a major champion and can't believe how it happened",
      "EVIAN-LES-BAINS, France -- Grace Kim delivered one stunning shot after another Sunday in the Evian Championship, starting with an eagle to force a playoff and another eagle to beat Jeeno Thitikul on the second extra hole to make her first LPGA win a major title.",
      "Kim, whose 2-foot eagle putt on the par-5 18th in regulation gave her a 4-under 67, looked to be just as surprised as everyone else when she rolled in a 12-foot eagle putt to win the playoff. The 24-year-old Australian calmly placed her hand over her mouth and stood still before doubling over and breaking into a wide smile.",
      "Thitikul's biggest challenge had been English amateur Lottie Woad, who was coming off a win in the Irish Women's Open and at one point had the lead on the back nine of Evian Resort. She closed with 64 and then waited to see if that would be enough.",
      "Woad was bidding to become the first amateur to win a major since Catherine Lacoste at the 1967 U.S. Women's Open.",
      "Thitikul birdied the 17th to take the lead, and the Thai player was on the verge of her first major when she laid up short of the pond and hit wedge into 8 feet on the final hole.",
      "But there was Kim, blasting a fairway metal onto the green. The ball rolled back down the slope to 2 feet for eagle to tie for the lead. Thitikul's birdie putt for the title missed right. She shot 67 and joined Kim at 14-under 270, one ahead of Woad and Minjee Lee (68).",
      "Back to the 18th in the playoff, Thitikul again looked like a winner when Kim's second shot bounced on a cart path, over some rocks and into the pond. Thitikul was just left of the green in two. Kim took her penalty drop, then chipped in for birdie across the green.",
      "Thitikul had to make an 8-foot birdie putt to extend the playoff, which she did. Playing the 18th for the third time, Kim again delivered another beauty over the pond and onto the green to about 12 feet.",
      "Thitikul, who had tiny insects buzzing around her ball in the collar of a bunker, chipped weakly to about 6 feet. She could only watch as Kim ended it with an eagle.",
      "That extended what already is a record streak in the LPGA Tour's 75-year history, the 18th consecutive tournament to start a season with a different winner. It also makes 13 different winners in the last 13 majors.",
      "Kim won for the second time on the LPGA, adding to her title in Hawaii two years ago.",

      "FIFA says it has reached an agreement with players' representatives to prioritize player welfare",
      "FIFA says players' representatives and the sport's governing body have reached a consensus on the need for a period of rest of 72 hours between matches, and agreed that players should enjoy a minimum of 21 days of holidays at the end of each season.",
      "The discussions took place on the eve of the Club World Cup final between PSG and Chelsea. The tournament was held during the European offseason and has faced criticism from unions, as an increased focus on player welfare has been leading to calls for mandatory rest periods and a greater emphasis on player safety during matches.",
      "Days before the start of the month-long Club World Cup, soccer chiefs faced renewed calls to safeguard players over growing fears of injuries and burnout. Last month, France\u2019s union of professional soccer players launched a scathing attack on the competition, saying it is \u201curgent to stop this massacre\u201d amid ongoing concerns about extreme player workloads.",
      "FIFA president Gianni Infantino and other officials from soccer's governing body met with representatives of players' unions from around the world in New York. FIFA hailed the discussions as \u201cprogressive,\u201d adding that players' health is a \u201ctop priority.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is a consensus that there must be at least 72 hours of rest between matches, and that players should have a rest period / holiday of at least 21 days at the end of each season,\u201d FIFA said. \u201cThis period should be managed individually by each club and the respective players also depending on their match calendars and taking into account applicable collective agreements.\u201d",
      "Enforcing a 72-hour period strictly could mean big adjustments to some game schedules and TV deals. FIFA didn\u2019t indicate how it would work in practice. European teams playing in the Europa League late Thursday evening routinely play domestic league games on the following Sunday. With a strict 72-hour break, they might have to wait until Monday to play again.",
      "That would be a major headache for the German Bundesliga. It abolished Monday evening games in 2021 after years of protests by fans who wanted easier-to-attend weekend kickoffs. When it introduced the unpopular Monday kickoffs four season earlier, the German league argued it would mean more rest for Europa League teams.",
      "The new Bundesliga TV deal starting next season doesn\u2019t include any Monday games, either.",
      "FIFA added that a rest day per week should also be allowed and that travel demands as well as climate conditions will also factor into future competition planning.",
      "The Club World Cup involving 32 of the world\u2019s top teams has faced pushback since FIFA announced it would be added to an already saturated calendar. The tournament should be played every four years, sandwiched in between the men\u2019s World Cup, European Championship and Copa America. It went ahead against the backdrop of legal challenges in Europe, strike threats and repeated concerns over players\u2019 mental and physical welfare due to too many games.",

      "Washington has been tightening controls on exports of advanced technology to China for years, citing concerns that know-how meant for civilian use could be deployed for military purposes.

    "story": [
      "A study puts the spotlight on Texas as the leading U.S. state by far for flood-related deaths, with more than 1,000 of them from 1959 to 2019",
      "Even before the Central Texas floods that killed more than 100 people, the state was by far the leader in U.S. flood deaths due partly to geography that can funnel rainwater into deadly deluges, according to a study spanning decades.",
      "From 1959 to 2019, 1,069 people died in Texas in flooding, which is nearly one-fifth of the total 5,724 flood fatalities in the Lower 48 states in that time, according to a 2021 study in the journal Water. That's about 370 more than the next closest state, Louisiana.",
      "Flooding is the second leading weather cause of death in the country, after heat, both in 2024 and the last 30 years, averaging 145 deaths a year in the last decade, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Other floods have turned deadly this year: Last month in San Antonio, 13 people died including 11 people who drove into water thinking they could get through, according to study author Hatim Sharif, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Texas at San Antonio who studies why people die in floods.",
      "For several years Sharif has urged state and local officials to integrate better emergency action programs to use flood forecasts and save lives by alerting people and closing off vulnerable intersections where roads and water meet.",
      "\u201cI think in Kerr County, if they had an integrated warning system that uses rainfall forecasts to forecast real-time impacts on the ground, that could have saved many lives and could have also helped emergency crews to know which location would be flooded, which roads would be impassable,\u201d Sharif said. \u201cThey could have taken action.\u201d",
      "Texas has so many deaths because of its geography, population and size, experts say. The area where the most recent deadly floods struck is known as flash flood alley because of hills and valleys.",
      "\u201cSteep, hilly terrain produces rapid runoff and quick stream rises, since the water will travel downhill at greater speed into rivers and over land,\u201d said Kate Abshire, lead of NOAA\u2019s flash flood services. \u201cRocky terrain can exacerbate the development of flash floods and raging waters, since rocks and clay soils do not allow as much water to infiltrate the ground.\u201d",
      "\u201cUrban areas are especially prone to flash floods due to the large amounts of concrete and asphalt surfaces that do not allow water to penetrate into the soil easily,\u201d she said.",
      "Along with those hills, \u201cyou\u2019ve got the Gulf of Mexico right there, the largest body of hot water in the entire North Atlantic most of the time,\u201d said Jeff Masters a former government meteorologist who co-founded Weather Underground and now is at Yale Climate Connections. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got a ready source of moisture for creating floods.\u201d",
      "Historically, many of the deaths were preventable across the nation and in Texas alike, according to experts. Masters said nothing illustrates that better than one statistic in Sharif's study: 86% of flood deaths since 1959 were people driving or walking into floodwaters.",
      "Nearly 58% of the deaths were people in cars and trucks. It's a problem especially in Texas because of hills and low lying areas that have more than 3,000 places where roads cross streams and waterways without bridges or culverts, Sharif said.",
      "\u201cPeople in Texas, they like trucks and SUVs, especially trucks,\u201d Sharif said. \u201cThey think trucks are tough, and that is I think a factor. So sometimes they use their big car or SUV or truck, and they say they can beat the flood on the street ... especially at night. They underestimate the depth and velocity of water.\u201d",
      "Abshire said that not only do people ignore the weather service's safety mantra, \u201cTurn around, don\u2019t drown,\u201d but studies found that a number of these fatalities occur when people actively drive around barricades and barriers blocking flooded roads.",
      "The latest Texas Hill Country flooding was less typical because so many of the deaths were in a camp where the water overtook the victims, not people going into the water, Sharif said. Only about 8% of flood deaths in the last 60 years happened in permanent homes, mobile homes or camping, according to the study.",
      "The July 4th floods happened at night, a common time for flood deaths. More than half of deaths since 1959 have occurred at night, when it's dark and people can't see how much flooding there is or are not awake for the warnings, Sharif's study found.",
      "As far as demographics, about 62% of U.S. flood deaths were male, according to the study.",
      "\u201cRisk-taking behavior is usually associated with men,\u201d Sharif said, adding that it's why most fatal victims of car crashes are male.",

      "NEW YORK -- A \u201cclick-to-cancel\u201d rule, which would have made it easier for consumers to end unwanted subscriptions, has been blocked by a federal appeals court days before it was set to go into effect. But there are ways to end those subscriptions and memberships, even if they take some work.",
      "The rule would also have required companies to disclose when free trials and promotional offers would end and let customers cancel recurring subscriptions as easily as they started them. But even without the new federal guidance, here are some ways to stay on top of subscription and membership fees.",
      "Experts at the Consumer Federation of America recommend setting calendar reminders for whenever a free trial period ends, to alert yourself to cancel promotional offers before the real recurring costs kick in. The auto-enrollment process, in which the company does not remind the consumer via email that a trial is about to end and higher monthly payments will begin, was also at the heart of the FTC's rule.",
      "\u201cNo subscription business model should be structured to profit from a gauntlet-style cancellation process,\" said Erin Witte, Director of Consumer Protection for the Consumer Federation of America, in a statement on the click-to-cancel rule.",
      "Regularly reviewing your credit card and debit card bills can also help you keep track of any recurring charges \u2014 including price increases you may have missed or that you didn't anticipate when trying out a new membership or subscription.",
      "\u201cCompanies make it easy for consumers to click to sign up and easy for the companies to automatically withdraw funds from consumers\u2019 accounts,\u201d said Shennan Kavanagh, Director of Litigation at the National Consumer Law Center (NCLC) in a statement on the FTC's click-to-cancel rule. \u201cPeople should not (have to) spend months trying to cancel unwanted subscriptions.\u201d",
      "Given the FTC's vacated rule, though, companies may still legally require that customers cancel memberships or subscriptions by phone, even as they permit signing up, enrolling, and paying bills online. Consumer advocates say this places an extra burden of time and energy on the consumer to stop an unwanted recurring fee, but sometimes knowing the terms of the subscription and getting on the phone is worth the trouble.",
      "Apps like Rocket Money and services like Trim, which is accessed through a browser, can keep track of your recurring monthly fees and subscriptions, for free \u2014 or for a fee \u2014 and can help you catch new ones or even unsubscribe from some services.",
      "For parents, especially, a service like Trim could help inform them that a child has started a new subscription, game or membership before the fees recur. And Rocket Money will actively work to end unwanted subscriptions for you, for a monthly price. If the company can't successfully end or cancel the subscription or membership, it will give the customer the information needed to do so. Trim also provides this service, in its premium form, for an additional fee.",
      "The FTC is currently moving forward with preparations for a trial involving Amazon\u2019s Prime program, which accuses the retailer of enrolling consumers in its Prime program without their consent and making it difficult to cancel subscriptions.",
      "Often, when a consumer tries to cancel a subscription for something like Prime, which offers free delivery and streaming video, the company will offer a month or more of the subscription at a promotional rate \u2014 half off, or at other, better-seeming values, to entice a customer to stay. Staying strong in the face of what may appear to be a good deal can help you stop recurring monthly fees before you forget to cancel them again.",
      "Agreeing to yet another trial or promotional rate, which is another on-ramp to auto-enrollment, just continues the cycle, according to consumer advocates.",
      "The FTC's rule would have required businesses to obtain a customer\u2019s consent before charging for memberships, auto-renewals and programs linked to free trials. The businesses would have also had to disclose when free trials and promotional offers would end.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said this week that the FTC made a procedural error by failing to come up with a preliminary regulatory analysis, which is required for rules whose annual impact on the U.S. economy is more than $100 million.",
      "The FTC said that it did not have to come up with a preliminary regulatory analysis because it initially determined that the rule\u2019s impact on the national economy would be less than $100 million. An administrative law judge decided that the economic impact would be more than the $100 million threshold, and the court decided to vacate the rule.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had included the FTC\u2019s proposal as part of its \u201cTime is Money\u201d initiative, which aimed to crack down on consumer-related hassles.",

      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright, former West Virginia U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, and Wyoming's congressional delegation are on the VIP list for a groundbreaking ceremony Friday at the Ramaco Resources, Inc., Brook Mine outside Ranchester in far northern Wyoming.",
      "Rare earth elements are a family of 17 metallic elements with unusual properties that make them useful for specific applications. Neodymium and dysprosium are used in the permanent magnets of wind turbines, lanthanum in electric and hybrid car batteries.",
      "Yttrium and terbium have critical military uses, including in targeting devices.",
      "China supplies almost 90% of the world's rare earths. Concern about continued access to the substances has been a focus of recent negotiations between China and the U.S., and led the Trump administration to try to encourage more production domestically.",
      "Rare earths aren't especially rare but so scattered they are difficult to bring together in useful quantities. Currently the only U.S. rare earths mine is at Mountain Pass in California.",
      "Analysis by U.S. national laboratories show the Brook Mine coal contains valuable quantities of the rare earths neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium, as well as the critical minerals gallium, scandium and germanium, according to a Ramaco letter to shareholders on July 1.",

      "No new Wyoming coal mine has opened in 50 years. Wyoming's coal industry instead has shrunk substantially since its peak over a decade ago, troubled as utilities switch to renewable energy and power plants fueled by cheaper natural gas.",
      "The Brook Mine, stalled in part by landowners worried about groundwater depletion, has been in the works for over a decade. Atkins originally envisioned it as a source of subbituminous power plant fuel, much like Wyoming's massive open-pit mines that supply about 40% of the nation's coal.",
      "A public company with metallurgical coal mines in Appalachia, Ramaco in recent years received Department of Energy grants to develop coal into carbon-based products such as carbon fiber. This year, it got a $6.1 million grant from Wyoming to build a rare earth and critical minerals processing plant.",
      "A consultant report released this week found that fully developing the mine and processing plant would cost around $500 million, a sum that could be recovered in five years if the rare earths can be extracted and sold. Ramaco also would sell the processed coal as fuel, Atkins said.",

      "DENVER -- A Denver museum known for its dinosaur displays has made a fossil bone discovery closer to home than anyone ever expected, under its own parking lot.",
      "It came from a hole drilled more than 750 feet (230 meters) deep to study geothermal heating potential for the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.",
      "The museum is popular with dinosaur enthusiasts of all ages. Full-size dinosaur skeletons amaze kiddos barely knee-high to a parent, much less to a Tyrannosaurus.",
      "This latest find is not so visually impressive. Even so, the odds of finding the hockey-puck-shaped fossil sample were impressively small.",
      "With a bore only a couple of inches (5 centimeters) wide, museum officials struggled to describe just how unlikely it was to hit a dinosaur, even in a region with a fair number of such fossils.",
      "\u201cFinding a dinosaur bone in a core is like hitting a hole in one from the moon. It\u2019s like winning the Willy Wonka factory. It\u2019s incredible, it\u2019s super rare,\u201d said James Hagadorn, the museum\u2019s curator of geology.",
      "Only two similar finds have been noted in bore hole samples anywhere in the world, not to mention on the grounds of a dinosaur museum, according to museum officials.",
      "A vertebra of a smallish, plant-eating dinosaur is believed to be the source. It lived in the late Cretaceous period around 67.5 million years ago. An asteroid impact brought the long era of dinosaurs to an end around 66 million years ago, according to scientists.",

      "There was no way to tell exactly what species of dinosaur it was, Williamson noted.",
      "The find is \"absolutely legit and VERY COOL!\u201d Erin LaCount, director of education programs at the Dinosaur Ridge track site just west of Denver, said by email.",
      "The fossil's shape suggests it was a duck-billed dinosaur or thescelosaurus, a smaller but somewhat similar species, LaCount noted.",
      "The bore-hole fossil is now on display in the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, of course, but there are no plans to look for more under the parking lot.",
      "\u201cI would love to dig a 763-foot (233-meter) hole in the parking lot to excavate that dinosaur, the rest of it. But I don't think that's going to fly because we really need parking,\u201d Hagadorn said.",

      "TikTok is facing a fresh European Union privacy investigation into user data transferred to China",
      "LONDON -- TikTok is facing a fresh European Union privacy investigation into user data sent to China, regulators said Thursday.",
      "The Data Protection Commission opened the inquiry as a follow up to a previous investigation that ended earlier this year with a 530 million euro ($620 million) fine after it found the video sharing app put users at risk of spying by allowing remote access their data from China.",
      "The Irish national watchdog serves as TikTok\u2019s lead data privacy regulator in the 27-nation EU because the company\u2019s European headquarters is based in Dublin.",

However, it later backtracked and said that some data had in fact been stored on Chinese servers. The watchdog responded at the time by saying it would consider further regulatory action.",
      "\u201cAs a result of that consideration, the DPC has now decided to open this new inquiry into TikTok,\u201d the watchdog said.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of the inquiry is to determine whether TikTok has complied with its relevant obligations under the GDPR in the context of the transfers now at issue, including the lawfulness of the transfers,\u201d the regulator said, referring to the European Union\u2019s strict privacy rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation.",
      "TikTok did not respond immediately to a request for comment.",
      "TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, has been under scrutiny in Europe over how it handles personal user information amid concerns from Western officials that it poses a security risk.",

      "Nvidia earned $18.8 billion, or 76 cents per share, in the period, a 26% increase from the same time last year. Revenue surged 69% from a year ago to $44.1 billion. If not for a $4.5 billion charge that Nvidia absorbed to account for the U.S. government\u2019s restrictions on its chip sales to China, Nvidia would have made 96 cents per share, far above the 73 cents per share envisioned by analysts.",

      "Nvidia and other companies benefiting from the AI boom have been a major reason the S&P 500 has climbed to record after record recently. Their explosion of profits has helped to propel the market despite worries about stubbornly high inflation and possible pain coming for the U.S. economy from tariffs and other policies of President Donald Trump.",

      "Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company is taking down antisemitic comments and other \u201cinappropriate posts\u201d made by its Grok chatbot, including some praising Adolf Hitler",
      "Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company said Wednesday that it's taking down \u201cinappropriate posts\" made by its Grok chatbot, which appeared to include antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler.",
      "Grok was developed by Musk\u2019s xAI and pitched as alternative to \u201cwoke AI\u201d interactions from rival chatbots like Google\u2019s Gemini, or OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.",
      "Musk said Friday that Grok has been improved significantly, and users \u201cshould notice a difference.\u201d",
      "Since then, Grok has shared several antisemitic posts, including the trope that Jews run Hollywood, and denied that such a stance could be described as Nazism.",
      "\u201cLabeling truths as hate speech stifles discussion,\u201d Grok said.",
      "It also appeared to praise Hitler, according to screenshots of posts that have now apparently been deleted.",
      "After making one of the posts, Grok walked back the comments, saying it was \u201can unacceptable error from an earlier model iteration, swiftly deleted\" and that it condemned \"Nazism and Hitler unequivocally \u2014 his actions were genocidal horrors.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working to remove the inappropriate posts,\u201d the Grok account posted early Wednesday, without being more specific.",
      "\"Since being made aware of the content, xAI has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X. xAI is training only truth-seeking and thanks to the millions of users on X, we are able to quickly identify and update the model where training could be improved.",
      "Talia Ringer, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said it\u2019s likely that the Grok update that caused the chatbot to spew antisemitic messages this week was the \u201csoft launch\u201d of Grok 4, which Musk plans to introduce late Wednesday. But if that\u2019s the case, it doesn\u2019t appear ready, she said.",
      "\u201cFixing this is probably going to require retraining the model,\u201d she said. \u201cAll they can do at this point, if they\u2019re really going to launch tonight, are some more Band-Aids, like adding filters on responses and tweaking the prompt.\u201d",
      "Editing some of the chatbot\u2019s instructions \u201cmight make its behavior a little bit better\u201d but won\u2019t fix all of its problems.",
      "Musk and the xAI staff did release the latest version of the Grok platform late Wednesday, with the Tesla CEO making fantastical claims about the intelligence of version 4.0.",
      "He compared its intelligence to post-graduate level in \u201cevery subject\u201d and said while at times it might lack common sense and has not yet invented new things or discovered new technologies, it might \u201cas soon as this year.\u201d",
      "The Anti-Defamation League, which works to combat antisemitism, called out Grok's behavior.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing from Grok LLM right now is irresponsible, dangerous and antisemitic, plain and simple,\u201d the group said in a post on X. \u201cThis supercharging of extremist rhetoric will only amplify and encourage the antisemitism that is already surging on X and many other platforms.\u201d",
      "Musk later waded into the debate, alleging that some users may have been trying to manipulate Grok into making the statements.",
      "\u201cGrok was too compliant to user prompts. Too eager to please and be manipulated, essentially. That is being addressed,\u201d he wrote on X, in response to comments that a user was trying to get Grok to make controversial and politically incorrect statements.",
      "Also Wednesday, a court in Turkey ordered a ban on Grok and Poland's digital minister said he would report the chatbot to the European Commission after it made vulgar comments about politicians and public figures in both countries.",
      "Krzysztof Gawkowski, who's also Poland's deputy prime minister, told private broadcaster RMF FM that his ministry would report Grok \u201cfor investigation and, if necessary, imposing a fine on X.\u201d Under an EU digital law, social media platforms are required to protect users or face hefty fines.",
      "\u201cI have the impression that we\u2019re entering a higher level of hate speech, which is controlled by algorithms, and that turning a blind eye ... is a mistake that could cost people in the future,\u201d Gawkowski told the station.",
      "Turkey's pro-government A Haber news channel reported that Grok posted vulgarities about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, his late mother and well-known personalities. Offensive responses were also directed toward modern Turkey\u2019s founder, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, other media outlets said.",
      "That prompted the Ankara public prosecutor to file for the imposition of restrictions under Turkey\u2019s internet law, citing a threat to public order. A criminal court approved the request early on Wednesday, ordering the country\u2019s telecommunications authority to enforce the ban.",
      "It's not the first time Grok's behavior has raised questions.",
      "Earlier this year the chatbot kept talking about South African racial politics and the subject of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d despite being asked a variety of questions, most of which had nothing to do with the country. An \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d was behind the problem, xAI said.",

      "LONDON -- Russia continued its nightly bombardment of Ukraine overnight into Tuesday, shortly after President Donald Trump announced his decision to supply Ukraine with new military equipment and White House threats of further economic measures against Moscow.",
      "Ukraine's air force said Russia targeted several regions overnight with 267 drones, of which around 200 were Shahed attack drones and the rest decoys. The air force said it shot down or otherwise suppressed 244 drones. Twenty-three drones impacted across seven locations, with falling debris reported in nine locations, the air force said.",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said its forces downed at least 70 Ukrainian drones overnight into Tuesday morning. Among the areas targeted was the southwestern Voronezh region which borders northeastern Ukraine. At least 24 people were injured there, Gov. Aleksandr Gusev said on Telegram.",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin would make a decision about how to respond to Trump.",
      "\"The U.S. president's statements are very serious,\" Peskov told reporters during a daily briefing. \"Some of them are addressed personally to President Putin. We definitely need time to analyze what was said in Washington.\"",
      "Dmitry Medvedev -- -- the former Russian president and prime minister now serving as the deputy chairman of the country's Security Council -- was more forthright, writing on social media that the Kremlin was unmoved by what he called Trump's \"theatrical ultimatum.\"",
      "\"The world shuddered, expecting the consequences,\" wrote Medvedev, who during Moscow's full-scale war on Ukraine has become known as a particularly hawkish voice within Putin's security establishment. \"Belligerent Europe was disappointed. Russia didn't care.\"",
      "Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on Monday that he would impose \"severe tariffs\" -- though it was not entirely clear if the president was referring to tariffs, sanctions or both -- against Russia and its trading partners if a ceasefire deal is not reached in 50 days.",
      "Trump also said he had approved a new tranche of weapons to Ukraine worth \"billions of dollars.\" But details of what Trump called a \"very big deal\" remain unclear. Two U.S. defense officials told ABC News on Monday that the Pentagon was still working on exactly what military aid could be sent to Ukraine.",
      "The defense officials said 17 Patriot surface-to-air missile systems that Trump mentioned would come entirely from European allies, who would then purchase new replacement systems from the U.S.",
      "The Patriot systems -- of which Ukraine currently has at least six, two of which were provided by the U.S. and four by other NATO allies -- have become a key in Ukraine's defense against Russian drone, missile and airstrikes since they arrived in the country in 2023.",
      "\"We're going to have some come very soon, within days,\" Trump said when asked how long the new batch of American weapons would take to arrive. On Patriots specifically, the president said, \"They're going to start arriving very soon.\"",
      "Trump's announcement came after months of rising frustration in the White House over Russia's intensifying bombardments of Ukraine and its failure to commit to a full ceasefire.",
      "Speaking on Sunday, Trump said of Russian Putin, \"He talks nice and then he bombs everybody in the evening. There's a little bit of a problem there.\"",
      "But questions remain about Trump's threat to impose 100% \"secondary tariffs\" on nations doing business with Russia. The US has negligible imports from Russia, which account for around 0.2% of U.S. imports, according to Census Bureau data.",
      "The threat of secondary tariffs or sanctions on Russia's trading partners appears more significant, though may prompt retaliatory measures against the U.S. China and India, for example, are among Moscow's customers for its fossil fuel exports.",
      "Despite the open questions, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had a \"very good conversation\" with Trump on Monday. \"Thank you for your willingness to support Ukraine and continue to work together to stop the killings and establish a lasting and just peace,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "\"We discussed with the president the necessary means and solutions to provide more protection for people from Russian attacks and strengthen our positions,\" Zelenskyy continued. \"We are ready to work as productively as possible to achieve peace.\"",
      "Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament representing Zelenskyy's party and the chair of the body's foreign affairs committee, told ABC News he was \"cautiously optimistic,\" hoping that Monday's news indicated the beginning of a \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Putin by Trump.",
      "\"The whole situation is a win-win-win situation for Trump, Ukraine and Europe,\" he said. \"However, the 50-day deadline is of some concern, because Putin might take it as a green light to intensify offensive operations.\"",
      "Russia's summer offensive is already underway, according to the Ukrainian military, with Moscow's forces pushing for more territory all across the front. Russian efforts are particularly concentrated in the eastern Donetsk and Sumy regions, Kyiv has said.",
      "\"To prevent it from happening it is crucially important to provide Ukraine without delay, now, with the maximum military assistance,\" Merezhko said, \"including offensive weaponry like long-range missiles, for instance Tomahawks.\"",
      "Ukrainian backers also in the Senate urged Trump to build on Monday's announcement.",
      "\"This announcement, by itself, will not be enough to bring Putin to the negotiating table and finally end this war,\" Senate Foreign Relations Ranking Member Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said in a statement sent to ABC News.",
      "\"President Trump needs to commit to a sustained flow of security assistance to Ukraine over the long-term,\" she added. \"And we must move immediately on the tough sanctions package in the Senate, which has overwhelming bipartisan support and will make it harder and harder for Putin to prop up his economy and sustain his illegal war.\"",
      "That bipartisan Senate proposal -- fronted by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. -- proposed secondary sanctions of up to 500% on nations doing business with Russia, though according to Graham it will include an option allowing Trump to waive sanctions on individual nations.",
      "In a post to X, Graham said Trump \"put the countries who fund Putin's war machine on notice: stop financially supporting the war in Ukraine or face 100% tariffs. If I were them, I would take President Trump at his word.\"",
      "Asked on Monday whether he would adopt the Senate's blueprint, Trump told reporters, \"We could do secondary tariffs without the Senate, without the House. But what they're crafting also could be very good.\"",

    "summary": "The Department of Justice on Monday urged the Supreme Court to turn away an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence.",
    "story": [
      "The former Jeffrey Epstein associate is currently serving a 20-year sentence.",
      "The Department of Justice on Monday urged the Supreme Court to turn away an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, the former associate of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for conspiring with and aiding Epstein in his sexual abuse of underage girls.",
      "Maxwell, 63, had urged the court earlier this year to review her case, arguing that an unusual co-conspirator's clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors in Florida barred her subsequent prosecution in New York. A district court and a federal appeals court previously rejected that argument, and the DOJ today urged the high court to do the same.",
      "\"That contention is incorrect, and petitioner does not show that it would succeed in any court of appeals,\" wrote U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer.",
      "At the core of Maxwell's petition for SCOTUS review is her contention that the language of Epstein's non-prosecution agreement (NPA) specifically limited his protection to the Southern District of Florida, whereas the language of the co-conspirator clause should have been read to prohibit her prosecution in any federal district.",
      "The co-conspirator clause stated that if \"Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of this agreement, the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to\" four of Epstein's assistants. Maxwell was not among the four women named.",
      "\"Despite the existence of a non-prosecution agreement promising in plain language that the United States would not prosecute any co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein, the United States in fact prosecuted Ghislaine Maxwell as a co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein,\" her attorneys wrote in their petition to SCOTUS in April.",
      "The DOJ, however, argues in their response that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Florida -- then led by R. Alexander Acosta -- did not intend to bind other federal districts and had no authority to do so without the approval of those districts or the Criminal Division of the DOJ.",
      "\"And there is no indication here that anyone involved in negotiating Epstein's NPA obtained the necessary approval for binding other USAOs or thought it was necessary,\" the DOJ's brief states.",
      "The DOJ also contends that \u2013 even if the co-conspirators clause could be read to apply nationwide as Maxwell claims - there is no evidence that the parties who negotiated the NPA intended for the co-conspirators clause to benefit Maxwell, who the government describes as \"at most, an incidental third-party beneficiary of the agreement.\"",
      "\"The government was not even aware of [Maxwell's] role in Epstein's scheme at that time,\" Sauer wrote, and urged the justices to deny Maxwell's petition for certiorari.",
      "In a statement Monday, an attorney for Maxwell hinted at the swirling controversy surrounding the Trump administration's decision not to release any further records related to investigations of Epstein.",
      "\"I'd be surprised if President Trump knew his lawyers were asking the Supreme Court to let the government break a deal. He's the ultimate dealmaker\u2014and I'm sure he'd agree that when the United States gives its word, it should keep it. With all the talk about who's being prosecuted and who isn't, it's especially unfair that Ghislaine Maxwell remains in prison based on a promise the government made and broke,\" wrote David Oscar Markus.",
      "Sigrid McCawley, an attorney who has represented hundreds of alleged Epstein victims, including one of the trial's key witnesses against Maxwell, told ABC News in a statement that Maxwell should stay behind bars.",
      "\"After two-plus decades of recruiting and abusing young girls trapped in Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking enterprise, Ghislaine Maxwell has again attempted to escape accountability by trying to hide behind the non-prosecution agreement. Maxwell does not deserve any protection, and she should remain in prison for the horrific crimes she committed,\" wrote McCawley, a managing partner at Boies Schiller Flexner.",
      "Maxwell -- who pleaded not guilty to all the criminal charges against her -- was convicted by a jury in 2021 on five of six counts, including conspiracy, sex trafficking of a minor, and transporting a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Maxwell played a \"key role\" in a multi-state sex trafficking scheme in which she allegedly \"befriended\" and later \"enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein\" and was also, at times, \"present for and involved\" in the abuse herself.",
      "\"A unanimous jury has found Ghislaine Maxwell guilty of one of the worst crimes imaginable -- facilitating and participating in the sexual abuse of children,\" then-U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement following the verdict.",

      "DENVER -- The murder trial of a Colorado dentist accused of killing his wife by poisoning her protein shakes and later trying to pay someone to kill the lead investigator on the case will begin with opening arguments Tuesday.",
      "James Craig, 47, allegedly used cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, an ingredient in over-the-counter eye drops, to kill his wife of 23 years, Angela Craig, two years ago in suburban Denver.",
      "Craig has pleaded not guilty to several charges, including first-degree murder.",
      "Prosecutors say that Craig allegedly purchased arsenic around the time of his wife's symptoms \u2014 dizziness and headaches that perplexed doctors \u2014 and that after his initial attempts to poison her failed, he ordered potassium cyanide.",
      "They also said Craig searched Google for \u201chow to make a murder look like a heart attack\u201d and \u201cis arsenic detectable in an autopsy,\" and that he tried to make it appear his wife had killed herself.",
      "Angela Craig, 43, who had six children with James Craig, was hospitalized several times. After the first time, she can be seen on home surveillance video accusing her husband of implying to medical staff that she was suicidal.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s your fault they treated me like I was a suicide risk, like I did it to myself, and like nothing I said could be believed,\u201d she said to her husband on the video.",
      "After Craig's arrest in 2023, prosecutors alleged that he offered a fellow jail inmate $20,000 to kill the case\u2019s lead investigator and offered someone else $20,000 to find people to falsely testify that Angela Craig planned to die by suicide.",
      "In addition to first-degree murder, Craig has pleaded not guilty to the other charges, including solicitation to commit murder and solicitation to commit perjury.",
      "Craig's attorneys have questioned the reliability of the inmate's claims, said the police were biased against the dentist and that tests of the protein shake containers didn't reveal signs of poison.",
      "Around the time of his arrest, prosecutors said Craig was experiencing financial difficulties and appeared to be having an affair with a fellow dentist, though they have not yet described a motive in his wife's death.",
      "Craig remains in custody, according to jail records.",

    "story": [
      "Collier County, Florida, uses one of the most advanced 911 systems in the U.S., allowing callers to send texts and videos",
      "NAPLES, Fla. -- When an emergency happens in Collier County, Florida, the 911 calls go to one of the most high-tech communications centers in the U.S., where callers can send text and video from the scene to dispatchers.",
      "Moving to what's known as an NG911 \u2014 or Next Generation 911 \u2014 system is a journey Sheriff Kevin Rambosk and Bob Finney, the county's director of communication, have been on for much of the past decade.",
      "It's a long way from Feb. 16, 1968, when Alabama's then-House Speaker Rankin Fite made the nation's very first 911 call in Haleyville, Alabama, on a bright red, rotary-style landline telephone. That ceremonial call came just 35 days after AT&T announced plans to use 911 as a nationwide emergency number.",
      "Today, most calls to 911 originate with cellphones, with dispatchers in upgraded centers using geo tracking to get accurate geographic locations from callers.",
      "But the response time in an emergency depends on the type of technology being used at any of the 6,000 emergency communications centers in the U.S. that receive 911 calls. There is no uniform emergency system in the U.S., so individual cities, counties, states or geographic regions are responsible for operating their own 911 call centers.",
      "While some states have fully updated to NG911 systems, others are still using legacy 911 systems that rely on antiquated equipment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just reminded in these last two weeks, with the flooding in Texas, just how important the work of 911 is,\u201d said Michael Martin, CEO of RapidSOS, which provides infrastructure that passes critical data to emergency centers across the United States.",
      "The Collier County Sheriff's Office covers 911 calls from an area of about 2,030 square miles (5,258 square kilometers) that stretches from sandy beaches at the southernmost tip of the Gulf Coast on Florida's peninsula inland to the Everglades.",
      "It's a region that has been ravaged by hurricanes this century, including Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Hurricanes Ian and Milton most recently.",
      "That's why Sheriff Rambosk wanted a high-tech emergency operations center.",
      "\u201cWe just believe that when we can reduce the response time using technology, it will improve safety and survivability of those calling in,\u201d said Rambosk, who has been sheriff since 2009. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really what we\u2019re all about, keeping people safe and rescuing them when they need it.\u201d",
      "Today 61 full-time employees and three part-timers staff two emergency operations centers around the clock.",
      "They rely on data that RapidSOS collects from connected buildings, devices, vehicles and even smart watches to send first responders to emergency scenes. The baseline data is provide free of charge to all 911 centers, Martin said.",
      "As Hurricane Helene was tracking toward north Florida last September, forecasters were predicting it could hit Tallahassee as a major Category 3 storm. Officials in Leon County, which serves the state's Capitol and nearby counties on legacy 911 equipment, reached out to Collier County, some 430 miles (692 kilometers) to the southeast, to see if they could take over emergency calls if the storm knocked their center out.",
      "Helene moved to the east of Tallahassee, but Collier County was prepared to help if needed.",
      "\"Because of the partnership with Rapid SOS, they were able to create a map to where not only did we see our own calls, but we could see exactly where the calls were coming in Tallahassee,\u201d Finney said.",
      "Collier County has also partnered with Charleston, South Carolina, as a backup 911 center. Each region is fully prepared to take on 911 calls for the other in case their emergency system goes down for any reason.",
      "It's a similar story in North Carolina, where legislation in 2017 helped establish funding for a next generation 911 system, said Pokey Harris, who serves as president of the National Association of State 911 Administrators and executive director of the North Carolina 911 Board.",
      "Harris said Hurricane Helene provided validation for the upgraded system by being able to direct 911 calls from areas that were devastated by the storm to other parts of North Carolina that were not affected.",
      "\u201cDuring Helene, if a citizen could reach a dial tone, even though their local 911 center may have been impacted because of infrastructure devastation, another center somewhere in the state could answer their call,\u201d Harris said.",
      "Next Generation 911 systems aren't cheap.",
      "\u201cThere has been no federal funding for 911,\u201d Martin, of RapidSOS said. \u201cIt has been in various draft formats as long as I\u2019ve been doing this and it\u2019s never gotten through Congress.\u201d",
      "There is also no federal oversight of 911, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really quite remarkable how well 911 works despite those challenges,\" Martin said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a testament to the people of 911, not the technology.\u201d",

      "Mike Waltz will face questioning from lawmakers for the first time since he was ousted as national security adviser",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- Mike Waltz, President Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, will face questioning from lawmakers Tuesday for the first time since he was ousted as national security adviser in the weeks after he mistakenly added a journalist to a private Signal chat used to discuss sensitive military plans.",
      "The former Republican congressman is set to appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his confirmation hearing, with Trump looking to fill his remaining Cabinet position after months of delay, including the withdrawal of the previous nominee.",
      "The hearing will provide senators with the first opportunity to grill Waltz over revelations in March that he added The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on an unclassified messaging app that was used to discuss planning for strikes on Houthi militants in Yemen.",
      "Waltz took responsibility even as criticism mounted against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who shared the sensitive plans in the chat that included several other high-level national security officials. Hegseth shared the same information in another Signal chat that included family, but Trump has made clear Hegseth has his support.",
      "Waltz was removed as national security adviser in May \u2014 replaced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u2014 and nominated for the U.N. role.",
      "Trump praised Waltz in the announcement, saying, \u201cFrom his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation\u2019s Interests first.\u201d",
      "If confirmed, Waltz would be coming to the U.N. at a moment of great change. The world body is reeling from Trump's decision to slash foreign assistance \u2014 affecting its humanitarian aid agencies \u2014 and it anticipates U.S. funding cuts to the U.N. annual budget.",
      "Under an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy realignment, the White House has asserted that \"some of the U.N.\u2019s agencies and bodies have drifted\u201d from their founding mission and \u201cact contrary to the interests of the United States while attacking our allies and propagating anti-Semitism.\u201d",
      "With America being the largest United Nations donor, cutting U.S. funding to the U.N. budget would greatly impair operations.",
      "Facing financial instability, the U.N. has spent months shedding jobs and consolidating projects while beginning to tackle long-delayed reforms. The U.N. is also facing growing frustration over what critics describe as a lack of efficiency and power in delivering on its mandate to end conflict and prevent wars.",
      "John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. who was also national security adviser during Trump\u2019s first term, was critical of the current state of the U.N.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s probably in the worst shape it\u2019s been in since it was founded,\u201d Bolton, now an outspoken Trump critic, recently told The Associated Press.",
      "Waltz spent the last several weeks meeting with Democrats and Republicans on the Foreign Affairs committee.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth said Monday that she and Waltz discussed a wide range of issues, including whether the Trump administration would use the U.N. to strengthen alliances and combat Chinese influence.",
      "\u201cI asked him questions about \u2018Signalgate,\u2019 but I also talked to him about how we are going to sway other nations within the United Nations to our side, in light of how much influence the PRC is having on other nations,\u201d the Illinois senator said, using an acronym for the People's Republic of China.",
      "Even with Democratic opposition, Waltz only needs a majority in the 53-47 Senate, which Republicans control.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine. Mike won\u2019t have any issues,\u201d said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla. \u201cI mean, the Democrats are gonna do their thing. Whatever. Mike\u2019s used to taking incoming fire.\u201d",
      "It is unclear how Waltz would approach the job. Trump's first nominee, Rep. Elise Stefanik, had built a track record in Congress of criticizing the U.N. She vowed during her confirmation hearing in January to combat what she called antisemitism at the world body and lead a review of U.S. funding.",
      "She was expected to be confirmed, but Trump abruptly withdrew her nomination in March, citing risks to the GOP's historically slim House majority.",
      "At the time, the loss of a mere handful of seats could have swung the House majority to Democrats and derailed their recently successful efforts to enact Trump\u2019s sweeping agenda.",
      "Waltz, whose Florida House seat was filled during a special election earlier this year, has spent the last few months on the White House payroll despite being removed as national security adviser. The latest list of White House salaries, current as of July 1, includes Waltz earning an annual salary of $195,200.",
      "A White House official, granted anonymity to discuss personnel matters, said Waltz stayed on to \u201censure a smooth and successful transition given the extreme importance of the role of NSA.\u201d",
      "Waltz was the first Green Beret elected to the House and easily won reelection for a fourth term in November before Trump asked him to join the administration.",

      "Michael Bernard Bell, 54, is scheduled to receive a lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke, barring a last-day reprieve. He was convicted in 1995 and sentenced to death for the murders of Jimmy West and Tamecka Smith.",
      "Bell would be the eighth person put to death in Florida this year, with a ninth scheduled for later this month. The state executed six people in 2023, but carried out only one execution last year.",
      "Twenty-five men have already been executed in the U.S. this year, tying last year's total.",
      "Florida has executed more people than any other state this year, while Texas and South Carolina are tied for second place with four each. Alabama has executed three people, Oklahoma has killed two, and Arizona, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee each have killed one.",
      "In December 1993, Bell spotted what he thought was the car of the man who fatally shot his brother earlier that year, according to court records. Bell was apparently unaware that the man had sold the car to West.",
      "Bell called on two friends and armed himself with an AK-47 rifle, authorities said. They found the car parked outside a liquor lounge and waited. When West, Smith and another woman eventually exited the club, Bell approached the car and opened fire, officials said.",
      "West died at the scene, and Smith died on the way to the hospital. The other woman escaped injury. Witnesses said Bell also fired at a crowd of onlookers before fleeing the area. He was eventually arrested the next year.",
      "Bell was later convicted of three additional murders. He fatally shot a woman and her toddler son in 1989, and he killed his mother's boyfriend about four months before the attack on West and Smith, officials said.",
      "Attorneys for Bell have filed appeals with the Florida Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The lawyers argued in their state filing that Bell's execution should be halted because of newly discovered evidence about witness testimony. But justices unanimously rejected the argument last week and pointed to overwhelming evidence of Bell\u2019s guilt in a 54-page opinion.",
      "Bell's attorneys filed a similar petition with the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday, but the panel has not yet issued a ruling.",

      "The July 7 order by LA County Superior Court Judge William Ryan was in response to a habeas corpus petition filed by the Menendez brothers in May 2023 seeking a review of their 1996 convictions for the killings of their parents based on new evidence.",

      "Temporary protections allowing nearly 12,000 Afghans to work in the U.S. and avoid deportation are expiring",
      "WASHINGTON -- Temporary measures that allowed nearly 12,000 Afghans to work in the U.S. and be protected from deportation are expiring Monday as part of the Trump administration's efforts to make more people eligible for removal from the country.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security in May said it was ending Temporary Protected Status for 11,700 people from Afghanistan in 60 days. That status had allowed them to work and meant the government couldn't deport them.",
      "The number of Afghans protected by TPS is relatively small compared to the overall number of Afghans \u2014 about 180,000 \u2014 who have fled Afghanistan and come to the U.S. since the Taliban retook control of the country in 2021. It's also not clear how many of those 11,7000 covered by TPS have applied for or received other forms of protection like asylum that would keep them from being deported after Monday.",
      "But the removal of the protective status for Afghans has struck a chord with many advocates and volunteers because of the suggestion that it is safe for Afghans \u2014 many who helped the U.S. during its two-decade long war there \u2014 to go home.",
      "\u201cSince so many of those losing their protections served alongside U.S. forces, we should honor that service by upholding our promise to provide safety and ensure that they have an opportunity to thrive here. We urge Congress to protect Afghans by providing them permanent status \u2013 a commitment that is long overdue,\" Jennie Murray, President and CEO of the National Immigration Forum, said in a news release Monday.",
      "At the time that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ended the temporary protected status for Afghans, the department wrote in the decision that the situation in their home country was getting better.",
      "\u201cThe Secretary determined that, overall, there are notable improvements in the security and economic situation such that requiring the return of Afghan nationals to Afghanistan does not pose a threat to their personal safety due to armed conflict or extraordinary and temporary conditions,\u201d according to the May announcement.",
      "Temporary Protected Status can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people of various nationalities who are in the United States. They can't be deported and can work legally but they don't have a pathway to citizenship.",
      "The status is inherently precarious because it is up to the Homeland Security secretary to renew the protections regularly \u2014 usually every 18 months. The first Trump administration tried to remove many of these temporary protected statuses but was largely foiled by the courts.",
      "This time around, the Trump administration has moved even more aggressively to remove the protections, thus making more people eligible for removal from the country. The administration has pushed to remove temporary protected status from people from seven countries with Venezuela and Haiti making up the biggest chunk of the hundreds of thousands of people losing their protections.",
      "Critics say that successive administrations essentially rubber-stamped these renewals regardless, and people covered by what\u2019s supposed to be a temporary status end up staying in the United States for years.",
      "CASA, a nonprofit immigrant advocates group, sued the administration over the TPS revocation for Afghans as well as for people from Cameroon - those expire August 4. A federal judge last Friday allowed the lawsuit to go forward but didn't grant CASA's request to keep the protections in place while the lawsuit plays out.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans will test the popularity of Department of Government Efficiency spending cuts this week by aiming to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s request to claw back $9.4 billion in public media and foreign aid spending.",
      "Senate Democrats are trying to kill the measure but need a few Republicans uncomfortable with the president's effort to join them.",
      "Trump's Republican administration is employing a rarely used tool that allows the president to transmit a request to cancel previously approved funding authority. The request triggers a 45-day clock under which the funds are frozen. If Congress fails to act within that period, then the spending stands. That clock expires Friday.",
      "The House has already approved Trump's request on a mostly party line 214-212 vote. The Senate has little time to spare to beat the deadline for the president's signature. Another House vote will be needed if senators amend the legislation, adding more uncertainty to the outcome.",
      "Here's a closer look at this week's debate.",
      "Trump has asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it\u2019s due to receive during the next two budget years.",
      "The White House says the public media system is politically biased and an unnecessary expense.",
      "The corporation distributes more than two-thirds of the money to more than 1,500 locally operated public television and radio stations, with much of the remainder assigned to National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting System to support national programming.",
      "The potential fallout from the cuts for local pubic media stations has generated concerns on both sides of the political aisle.",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said he's worried about how the rescissions will hit radio stations that broadcast to Native Americans in his state. He said the vast majority of their funding comes from the federal government.",
      "\u201cThey're not political in nature,\u201d Rounds said of the stations. \u201cIt's the only way of really communicating in the very rural areas of our state, and a lot of other states as well.\"",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Ala., said that for the tribal radio stations in her state, \u201calmost to a number, they\u2019re saying that they will go under if public broadcasting funds are no longer available to them.\u201d",
      "To justify the spending cuts, the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers have cited certain activities they disagree with to portray a wide range of a program\u2019s funding as wasteful.",
      "In recent testimony, Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought criticized programming aimed at fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion. He said NPR aired a 2022 program entitled \u201cWhat \u2018Queer Ducks\u2019 can teach teenagers about sexuality in the animal kingdom.\" He also cited a special town hall that CNN held in 2020 with \u201cSesame Street\u201d about combatting racism.",
      "As part of the package, Trump has asked lawmakers to rescind about $8.3 billion in foreign aid programs that aim to fight famine and disease and promote global stability.",
      "Among the targets:",
      "\u2014 $900 million to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases and strengthen detections systems to prevent wider epidemics.",
      "\u2014 $800 million for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country.",
      "\u2014 $4.15 billion for two programs designed to boost the economies and democratic institutions in developing and strategically important countries.",
      "\u2014 $496 million to provide humanitarian assistance such as food, water and health care for countries hit by natural disasters and conflicts.",
      "Some of the health cuts are aimed at a program known as PEPFAR, which President George W. Bush, a Republican, began to combat HIV/AIDS in developing countries. The program is credited with saving 26 million lives and has broad bipartisan support.",
      "On PEPFAR, Vought told senators \"these cuts are surgical and specifically preserve life-saving assistance.\u201d But many lawmakers are wary, saying they've seen no details about where specifically the administration will cut.",
      "The administration also said some cuts, such as eliminating funding for UNICEF, would encourage international organizations to be more efficient and seek contributions from other nations, \u201cputting American taxpayers first.\u201d",
      "U.S. leaders have often argued that aiding other nations through \u201csoft power\u201d is not just the right thing to do but also the smart thing.",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told Vought there is \u201cplenty of absolute nonsense masquerading as American aid that shouldn\u2019t receive another bit of taxpayer funding,\u201d but he called the administration's attempt to root it out \u201cunnecessarily chaotic.\u201d",
      "\"In critical corners of the globe, instead of creating efficiencies, you\u2019ve created vacuums for adversaries like China to fill,\" McConnell told Vought.",
      "The president has issued a warning on his social media site directly aimed at individual Senate Republicans who may be considering voting against the cuts.",
      "He said it was important that all Republicans adhere to the bill and in particular defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.",
      "\u201cAny Republican that votes to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or Endorsement,\u201d he said.",
      "For individual Republicans seeking reelection, the prospect of Trump working to defeat them is reason for pause and could be a sign the package is teetering.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., opted to announce he would not seek reelection recently after the president called for a primary challenger to the senator when he voted not to advance Trump's massive tax and spending cut bill.",
      "Spending bills before the 100-member Senate almost always need some bipartisan buy-in to pass. That's because the bills need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster and advance. But this week's effort is different.",
      "Congress set up a process back when Republican Richard Nixon was president for speedily considering a request to claw back previously approved spending authority. Under those procedures, it takes only a simple Senate majority to advance the president's request to a final vote.",
      "It's a rarely employed maneuver. In 1992, President George H.W. Bush, a Republican, had some success with his rescissions request, though the final bill included some cuts requested by the president and many that were not. Trump proposed 38 rescissions in 2018, but the package stalled in the Senate.",

      "COMFORT, Texas -- It began with a stranger asking \u201cDo you need help?\u201d",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d Paul Welch told the man in a pickup truck, \u201cI desperately need some help.\"",
      "A day later, dozens of people pulled up outside the modest cabin where Welch and his partner lived overlooking the Guadalupe River until Texas' July 4 floods.",
      "The devastated property looked like a construction site Saturday after operators started clearing debris with mini-excavators and skid steers. An Army unit from Fort Hood scraped mud out of the cabin while other people tore down drywall. A Bible study group from San Antonio hand-washed tools from Welch\u2019s barn. His niece carefully wiped old negatives, hoping to preserve some of the couple\u2019s memories.",
      "Texans are leading flood recovery even as more flooding hits and the search for the missing continues. Mass cleanup across Kerr County \u2014 about 1.5 hours northwest of San Antonio \u2014 came Saturday before heavy rain pelted the region again on Sunday.",
      "For Welch and Elizabeth Hastings, the July 4 floods sent water to their ceiling, wiped out their RV and ruined most of the items in their barn.",
      "\"Up until yesterday, it was pretty bleak,\u201d he said.",
      "Then, Welch said the man in the truck \u2014 Huntly Dantzler of Fredericksburg, 20 miles away \u2014 \u201che showed up.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought that is just too good to be true,\" Welch said. \"We have hope now.\u201d",
      "In many places, volunteer labor includes debris removal and remediation often done by hired contractors and out of reach for households lacking insurance. Many survivors said it was simply too expensive.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s impossible here in the floodplain,\u201d Welch said. \u201cPaying $10,000 a year for flood insurance doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d",
      "The survivors who spoke with The Associated Press said they didn't have insurance but had already applied for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. That money is rarely enough to cover all the costs of replacing, remediating and rebuilding and only 116 FEMA applications were approved as of Sunday.",
      "Many of those working together didn\u2019t know each other before the disaster \u2014 they\u2019ve connected over social media, in public spaces or just by driving around looking for places to help.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s thousands of volunteers out here, more than needed, honestly. It\u2019s wild, and everyone is just lending a hand,\u201d said Dave Isaacs, who came from San Antonio with his wife and daughter to help.",
      "Three people arrived at Daniel Olivas' home in Guadalupe Street in Kerrville last week with a skid steer and an excavator to clear debris. Water from the Guadalupe River overtook his house on July 4, leaving fish and crawdads floating in the bedrooms.",
      "Soon after, \"33 angels descended\u201d onto the property, said Olivas, removing furniture, scrubbing floors, and tearing out drywall.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just amazing because I didn\u2019t ask for it,\u201d said Olivas. \u201cThey just showed up.\u201d Some even insisted on leaving him cash, stuffing it into his pocket when he resisted.",
      "The help has come from businesses, too. The RV seller Camping World donated a pre-owned RV for Welch and Hastings to sleep in as long as they need. A plumbing company installed a new water treatment system for their neighbor for free.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all heartbroken, and everyone\u2019s just pitching in,\u201d said Monica Watson, a hopsice worker helping Olivas' neighbor, an older man who depended on a wheelchair. \u201cHe was just waiting for help,\u201d she said.",
      "She said she had no connection to her collaborators other than a shared desire to contribute.",
      "\u201cOne guy just said \u2018I\u2019m Ben, I have a Bobcat (tractor),\u2019 and that was it,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "A woman drove by asking if they needed another trailer to haul away trash, and returned with one minutes later.",
      "Volunteering can help people cope with trauma, said Dr. Adrienne Heinz, a clinical research psychologist at Stanford University and an expert in post-traumatic stress.",
      "\u201cWhen something awful happens, a powerful human response can occur called \u2018purposing,\u2019\u201d said Heinz. \u201cThis is when we rise to meet moments of sorrow and adversity with action that is meaningful and values-aligned.\u201d",
      "Purposing \u201coffers a buffer against hopelessness and despair and can set the stage for post-traumatic growth and transformational resilience,\u201d said Heinz.",
      "For those impacted, seeing the care flow in from all over the world is also healing.",
      "\u201cI cannot express how much I appreciate everything that they have done for us,\u201d said Colleen Lucas of Ingram, as staff with the international charity Operation Blessing helped her husband, Dave, repair one of their cars that had been submerged in water.",
      "The staff members from Mexico, Honduras and Chile, along with 42 members of Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, hauled out Lucas' destroyed belongings and packed and stored their salvageable items. She is unsure whether her home will need to be demolished, or how and when they will rebuild.",
      "But she's already thinking about how to pay forward the help they got.",

The HIMARS launchers were recently bought from the United States.",

      "Malaysia and Vietnam are also attending as observers.",
      "The exercise will also take place in Papua New Guinea, Australia\u2019s nearest neighbor. It is the first time Talisman Sabre activities have been held outside Australia.",
      "Chinese surveillance ships have monitored naval exercises off the Australian coast during the last four Talisman Sabre exercises and were expected to surveil the current exercise, Defense Industry Minister Pat Conroy said.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese military have observed these exercises since 2017. It\u2019d be very unusual for them not to observe it,\u201d Conroy said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll adjust accordingly. We\u2019ll obviously observe their activities and monitor their presence around Australia, but we\u2019ll also adjust how we conduct those exercises,\u201d Conroy added.",
      "Conroy said the Chinese were not yet shadowing ships as of Sunday.",
      "The exercise officially started on Sunday with a ceremony in Sydney attended by Deputy Commanding General of U.S. Army Pacific Lt. Gen. J.B. Vowell and Australia\u2019s Chief of Joint Operations Vice-Adm. Justin Jones.",
      "The exercise, showcasing Australia\u2019s defense alliance with the United States, started a day after Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese began a six-day visit to China, where he is expected to hold his fourth face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Tuesday.",
      "Albanese said Chinese surveillance of Talisman Sabre would not be an issue raised with Xi.",

      "A historic lodge on the Grand Canyon\u2019s North Rim has been destroyed by a wildfire",
      "GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. -- A historic lodge on the Grand Canyon's North Rim has been destroyed by a fast-moving wildfire, the park said Sunday.",
      "The Grand Canyon Lodge, the only lodging inside the park at the North Rim, was consumed by the flames, park Superintendent Ed Keeble told park residents, staff and others in a meeting Sunday morning. He said the visitor center, the gas station, a waste water treatment plant, an administrative building and some employee housing also were lost.",
      "Two wildfires are burning at or near the North Rim, known as the White Sage Fire and the Bravo Dragon fire. The latter is the one that impacted the lodge and other structures. The park initially was managing it as a controlled burn but then shifted to suppression as it rapidly grew, fire officials said.",
      "Millions of people visit Grand Canyon National Park annually, with most going to the more popular South Rim. The North Rim is open seasonally. It was evacuated last Thursday because of wildfire.",
      "The burning of the water treatment plant resulted in the release of chlorine gas that prompted the evacuation of firefighters and hikers from the inner canyon, park officials said Sunday. Chlorine gas is heavier than air and can quickly settle into lower elevations such as the inner canyon, posing a health risk.",
      "Meanwhile, officials reported progress in battling a second wildfire burning north of the Grand Canyon. Fire lines on the White Sage Fire that forced evacuations at the North Rim and in the community of Jacob Lake were holding, officials said. On the southern edge of the fire, hand crews and bulldozers were working uphill, and the spread of the blaze had been minimal.",
      "But to the east and north, the fire has spread rapidly, with grasses and standing dead trees contributing to the fire\u2019s intensity, officials said. The fire was pushing downhill toward the Vermilion Cliffs area, and crews were assessing opportunities to create buffer zones that help slow or halt the fire\u2019s progress.",

      "Many Native Americans are marking ceremonies like graduations with bald eagle feathers, a form of reverence for the bird they have always held sacred as a messenger to the Creator",
      "PRAIRIE ISLAND INDIAN COMMUNITY, Minn. -- Some Native Americans traditionally bestow bald eagle feathers at ceremonies to mark achievements, such as graduations, and as a form of reverence for the bird they hold sacred as a messenger to the Creator.",
      "This year, many are doing so with elevated pride and hope. The bald eagle is now the official bird of the United States, nearly 250 years after it was first used as a symbol of the newly founded nation that's deeply polarized politically today.",
      "\u201cThe eagle is finally getting the respect it deserves. Maybe when the nation looks at the eagle that way, maybe there will be less division,\u201d said Jim Thunder Hawk. He\u2019s the Dakota culture and language manager for the Prairie Island Indian Community, a small Mdewakanton Sioux band on the banks of the Mississippi River in Minnesota.",
      "This wide, unruffled stretch of water framed by wooded bluffs is prime bald eagle territory. The size of Minnesota\u2019s population of the majestic, white-head-and-tail birds that are exclusive to North America is second only to that of Alaska.",
      "The legislation that made the eagle official came from members of Minnesota\u2019s Congressional delegation. The federal act recognizes the eagles\u2019 centrality in most Indigenous peoples\u2019 \u201cspiritual lives and sacred belief systems,\u201d and a replica of it is on display at the National Eagle Center in Wabasha, Minnesota, 40 miles (65 kilometers) downriver from the Prairie Island community, which partners with the center in eagle care.",
      "\u201cIf you grew up in the United States, eagles were a part of your everyday life,\u201d said Tiffany Ploehn, who as the center\u2019s avian care director supervises its four resident bald eagles. \u201cEveryone has some sort of connection.\u201d",
      "A bald eagle, its wings and talons spread wide, has graced the Great Seal of the United States since 1782, and appears on passport covers, the $1 bill, military insignia, and myriad different images in pop culture.",
      "But a prolific collector of eagle memorabilia based in Wabasha realized recently that, while the United States had an official animal (the bison) and flower (the rose), the eagle was getting no formal credit. Several Minnesota legislators sponsored a bill to remedy that and then-President Joe Biden\u2019s signature made it official in December.",
      "With their massive wingspan and stern curved beak, bald eagles are widely used as symbols of strength and power. In reality, they spend 95% of their day perched high in trees, though when they hunt they can spot a rabbit 3 miles (5 kilometers) away, Ploehn said.",
      "For many Native Americans, the soaring eagle represents far more; it delivers their prayers to the Creator and even intercedes on their behalf.",
      "\u201cMy grandma told me that we honor eagles because they saved the Ojibwe people when the Creator wanted to turn on them. The eagle, he can fly high, so he went to speak with the Creator to make things right,\u201d said Sadie Erickson, who is Ojibwe and Mdewakanton Sioux.",
      "Erickson and a dozen other high school graduates received a bald eagle feather at an early July celebration by the riverbank at Prairie Island.",
      "Thunder Hawk said a prayer in the Dakota language urging the high school graduates and graduates receiving higher education degrees to \u201calways remember who you are and where you come from.\u201d",
      "Then they lined up and a relative tied a feather \u2014 traditionally on the left side, the heart\u2019s side \u2014 as tribal members sang and drummed to celebrate them.",
      "\u201cIt just feels like I went through a new step of life,\u201d said Jayvionna Buck.",
      "Growing up on Prairie Island, she recalled her mother excitedly pointing out every eagle.",
      "\u201cShe would genuinely just yell at me, \u2018Eagle!\u2019 But it\u2019s just a special occurrence for us to see,\u201d Buck said. \u201cWe love seeing it, and normally when we do, we just offer tobacco to show our respects.\u201d",
      "Some Native Americans honor the eagle by taking it as their ceremonial name. Derek Walking Eagle, whose Lakota name is \u201cEagle Thunder,\u201d celebrated the graduates wearing a woven medallion representing the bird.",
      "To him, eagles are like relatives that connect him to his future and afterlife.",
      "\u201cBeing able to carry on to the spirit world \u2026 that\u2019s who guides you. It\u2019s the eagle,\u201d Walking Eagle said.",
      "That deep respect attaches to the feathers, too.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the highest respect you can bestow on a person, from your family and from your people, from your tribe,\u201d Thunder Hawk said. \u201cWe teach the person receiving the feather that they have to honor and respect the eagle. And we tell them why.\u201d",
      "In many Native cultures, killing an eagle is \u201cblasphemous,\u201d he said. It is also a federal offense.",
      "Historically, Sioux warriors would lure an eagle with rabbit or other food, pluck a few feathers and release it, said Thunder Hawk, who grew up in South Dakota.",
      "Today, there\u2019s a nationwide program that legally distributes eagle feathers and parts exclusively to tribal members, though it\u2019s very backlogged. U.S. wildlife and tribal officials worry that killings and illegal trafficking of eagles for their feathers is on the rise, especially in the West.",
      "In Minnesota, eagles are most often harmed by road accidents and eating poison \u2013 results of shrinking wildlife habitat that brings them in closer contact with humans, said Lori Arent, interim director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Raptor Center.",
      "The center treats about 200 injured bald eagles each year. Of those they can save, most are eventually released back into the wild. Permanently disabled birds that lose an eye or whose wings are too badly fractured to fly are cared for there or at other educational institutions like the Wabasha eagle center.",
      "The official designation could help more Americans understand how their behaviors inadvertently harm eagles, Arent said. Littering by a highway, for instance, attracts rodents that lure eagles, which then can be struck by vehicles. Fishing or hunting with tackles and ammunition containing lead exposes the eagles eating those fish or deer remains to fatal metal poisoning.",
      "Humans have lost the ability to coexist in harmony with the natural world, Thunder Hawk said, voicing a concern shared by Indigenous people from the Chilean Andes to the U.S.-Mexico borderlands.",
      "He hopes more people might now approach the eagle with the same reverence he was taught. It\u2019s what leads him to offer sage or dried red willow bark every time he spots one as a \u201cthank you for allowing me to see you and for you to hear my prayers and my thoughts.\u201d",
      "Erickson, the new graduate, shares that optimism.",
      "\u201cI feel like that kind of shows that we\u2019re strong and united as a country,\u201d she said by the Mississippi, her new feather nestled in her hair.",

      "President Donald Trump prides himself on being a dealmaker, but his negotiating style is more ultimatum than compromise",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump prides himself on being a dealmaker, but his negotiating style is more ultimatum than compromise.",
      "In the last week, Trump has slapped trading partnerswith tariffs rather than slog through prolonged talks to reach agreements. He ratcheted up the pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. And his administration launched a new investigation into higher education as he tries to reshape universities.",
      "For Trump, a deal isn\u2019t necessarily agreement in which two sides compromise \u2014 it\u2019s an opportunity to bend others to his will. While Trump occasionally backs down from his threats, the past week is a reminder that they are a permanent feature of his presidency.",
      "As Trump tightens his grip on independent institutions, there are fewer checks on his power. Republicans in Congress fear primary challenges backed by the president, and the Supreme Court is stocked with appointees from his first term.",
      "Trump recently summed up his approach when talking to reporters about trade talks with other countries. \u201cThey don\u2019t set the deal,\" he said. \"I set the deal.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s allies believe his aggression is required in a political ecosystem where he's under siege from Democrats, the court system and the media. In their view, the president is simply trying to fulfill the agenda that he was elected to achieve.",
      "But critics fear he's eroding the country\u2019s democratic foundations with an authoritarian style. They say the president's focus on negotiations is a facade for attempts to dominate his opponents and expand his power.",
      "\u201cPluralism and a diversity of institutions operating with autonomy \u2014 companies, the judiciary, nonprofit institutions that are important elements of society \u2014 are much of what defines real democracy,\u201d said Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary and former president of Harvard University. \u201cThat is threatened by heavy handed, extortionist approaches.\u201d",
      "Harvard has been a top target for Trump, starting in April when he demanded changes to the university's governance and new faculty members to counteract liberal bias.",
      "As Harvard resisted, administration officials terminated $2.2 billion in federal grants. The money is the lifeblood of the university's sprawling research operation, which includes studies on cancer, Parkinson's disease, space travel and pandemic preparedness.",
      "Trump has also attempted to block Harvard from hosting roughly 7,000 foreign students, and he's threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status. His administration recently sent subpoenas asking for student data.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll absolutely reach a deal,\" Trump said Wednesday.",
      "Administration officials also pulled $175 million from the University of Pennsylvania in March over a dispute around women's sports. They restored it when school officials agreed to update records set by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas and change their policies.",
      "Columbia University bent to Trump by putting its Middle East studies department under new supervision, among other changes, after the administration pulled $400 million in federal funding. At the University of Virginia, President James Ryan resigned under pressure following a Justice Department investigation into diversity, equity and inclusion practices. A similar investigation was opened Thursday at George Mason University.",
      "\u201cFederal funding is a privilege, not a right, for colleges and universities,\" said Kush Desai, a White House spokesman.",
      "Such steps were unheard of before Trump took office. Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education and an Education Department official under President Barack Obama, said Trump isn't seeking deals but is \u201cdemanding more and more and more.\u201d",
      "\"Institutional autonomy is an important part of what makes higher education work,\" he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what enables universities to pursue the truth without political considerations.\u201d",
      "The Fed has also faced Trump's wrath. He blames Fed Chair Jerome Powell for moving too slowly to cut interest rates, which could make consumer debt like mortgages and auto loans more affordable. It could also help the U.S. government finance the federal debt that's expected to climb from the tax cuts that Trump recently signed into law.",
      "Powell has held off on cutting the central bank's benchmark rate, as Trump's tariffs could possibly worsen inflation and lower rates could intensify that problem. Desai said the White House believes the Fed should act based on what the data currently shows, which is that \"President Trump\u2019s policies have swiftly tamed inflation.\u201d",
      "Although Trump has said he won't try to fire Powell \u2014 a step that might be impossible under the law anyway \u2014 he's called on him to resign. In addition, Trump's allies have increased their scrutiny of Powell's management, particularly an expensive renovation of the central bank's headquarters.",
      "David Wessel, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said Trump's approach could undermine the Fed's credibility by casting a political shadow over its decisions.",
      "\u201cThere will be real costs if markets and global investors think the Fed has been beaten into submission by Trump,\" he said.",
      "Trump originally wanted to enact sweeping tariffs in April. In his view, import taxes would fix the challenge of the U.S. buying too much from other countries and not selling enough overseas.",
      "After a backlash in financial markets, Trump instituted a three-month negotiating period on tariffs. Peter Navarro, one of his advisers, said the goal was \u201c90 deals in 90 days.\u201d",
      "The administration announced a few trade frameworks with the United Kingdom and Vietnam, but Trump ran out of patience. He's sent letters to two dozen nations and the European Union informing them of their tariff rates, such as 30% against the EU and Mexico, potentially undercutting the work of his own negotiators.",
      "Desai said Trump's approach has generated \u201coverwhelming interest\u201d from other countries in reaching trade deals and gives the U.S. leverage in negotiations.",
      "John C. Brown, a professor emeritus of economics at Clark University in Massachusetts, said the \u201cwilly-nilly setting of tariffs according to one person\u2019s whims has no precedence in the history of trade policy since the 17th century.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just bizarre,\u201d Brown said of Trump\u2019s moves. \u201cNo one has done this in history.\u201d",
      "The president has also used the threat of tariffs in an attempt to help political allies and influence other countries' court systems. He told Brazil that he would implement a 50% tariff if the country didn't drop its prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who like Trump was charged with trying to overturn an election.",
      "Inu Manak, a fellow on trade policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Trump's inconsistent approach will foster distrust of U.S. motives.",
      "She noted that two of the letters went to Canada and South Korea, allies who have existing trade agreements with the U.S. approved by Congress.",
      "By imposing new tariffs, she said, Trump is raising \u201cserious questions about the meaning of signing any deal with the United States at all.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A year after the assassination attempt against President Donald Trump during a Butler, Pennsylvania campaign rally, and the results from various investigations into the shooting are still coming",
      "WASHINGTON -- In many ways, the assassination attempt against Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign stop was a perfect storm of failings coming together that allowed 20-year-old Michael Thomas Crooks to climb on top of a nearby building and take eight shots at the once and future president.",
      "One attendee was killed, two others wounded and a bullet grazed Trump's ear before a Secret Service counter sniper opened fire on Crooks and killed him. That day jolted an already chaotic race for the White House and solidified Trump's iconic status in his party and beyond.",
      "It also became a turning point for the agency tasked with protecting the president. As more details emerged about what went wrong, questions multiplied: What happened to the Secret Service's planning? Why was a rooftop with a clear line of sight to Trump left unguarded? What motivated the shooter?",
      "Another incident in September where a gunman camped in the shrubbery outside one of Trump\u2019s golf courses before being spotted and shot at by a Secret Service agent also raised questions about the agency's performance.",
      "A year after Butler, multiple investigations have detailed the breakdowns that day. Under a new leader hired by Trump, the agency has been pushing to address those problems but key questions remain.",
      "\u201cThis was a wake-up call for the Secret Service,\" said retired supervisory agent Bobby McDonald, who's now a criminal justice lecturer at the University of New Haven.",
      "A Senate committee and federal auditing agency over the weekend released reports about the Secret Service\u2019s actions.",
      "Here's a look at what went wrong, what's been done to address problems and the questions still unanswered.",
      "All the investigations zeroed in on a few specific problems.",
      "The building with a clear sight line to the stage where the president was speaking only 135 meters (157 yards) away was left unguarded. Crooks eventually boosted himself up there and fired eight shots with an AR-style rifle.",
      "The Secret Service's investigation into its own agency's conduct said that it wasn't that the line-of-sight risks weren't known about ahead of time. It was that multiple personnel assessed them as \u201cacceptable.\u201d",
      "Supervisors had expected large pieces of farm equipment would be situated to block the view from the building. Those ultimately weren't placed, and staffers who visited the site before the rally didn't tell their supervisors that the line-of-sight concerns hadn\u2019t been addressed, the report said.",
      "Another glaring problem: fragmented communications between the Secret Service and the local law enforcement that the agency regularly relies on to secure events.",
      "Instead of having one unified command post with representatives from every agency providing security in the same room, there were two command posts at the rally. One investigation described a \u201cchaotic mixture\u201d of radio, cell phone, text, and email used to communicate that day.",
      "And a year later, the investigations are still coming.",
      "\u201cThere were multiple, unacceptable failures in the planning and execution of the July 13 Butler rally,\u201d said the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs in a report released Sunday.",
      "The committee found that the agency denied \u201cmultiple requests for additional staff, assets, and resources to protect President Trump\" during the presidential campaign. The committee said that included at least two requests for the Butler rally.",
      "The agency's former director, Kim Cheatle, last year told a House panel before she resigned that the agency didn't deny any requests for the rally.",
      "In a statement released Sunday in response to the Senate report, Cheatle said, \u201cFor the Butler rally, I actually did direct additional assets to be provided, particularly in the form of agency countersnipers.\u201d",
      "Another report by the Government Accountability Office requested by Republican Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley criticized the agency's practices for sharing threat information. That report said senior-level agency officials knew of a specific threat to Trump in the days leading up to the rally. It wasn't specific to the rally but it wasn't shared with the agents or local law enforcement planning for it.",
      "The report said the lack of information-sharing was due to the agency's \u201csiloed information sharing practices.\u201d The report didn't offer details on the threat although reporting at the time indicated that a threat to Trump's life from Iran prompted additional security in the days before the Butler rally.",
      "The agency said Sunday that following the assassination attempt, they took a \u201cserious look\u201d at their operations and have undergone significant reforms to address what happened that day.",
      "Earlier this week the agency issued its own report Thursday about what it has done.",
      "\u201cSince President Trump appointed me as director of the United States Secret Service, I have kept my experience on July 13 top of mind, and the agency has taken many steps to ensure such an event can never be repeated in the future,\u201d said Sean Curran, whom Trump tasked with leading the agency. Curran was one of the agents standing next to Trump as he was hustled off the stage after the shooting.",
      "The agency said it had implemented 21 of the 46 recommendations made by Congressional oversight bodies. The rest were either in progress or not up to the agency to implement.",
      "Some of what they've done involves new equipment and a greater emphasis on addressing threats from above. They've created a new Aviation Division to oversee aerial operations like drones. The agency said it has two armored ATVs for use on golf courses and is producing another three. And they're purchasing mobile command vehicles that will be pre-positioned around the country.",
      "But much of what the agency says it has done is about changing policies and procedures to address those July 13 lapses \u2014 things like revising their manual to \u201cadvance procedures and communication practices\u201d when it comes to coordinating with local law enforcement or clarifying who's responsible for events where protectees are appearing.",
      "They've updated their procedures about documenting line-of-sight concerns and how those concerns are going to be addressed.",
      "So far it doesn't appear that anyone has been or will be fired, although the agency's director at the time, Cheatle, swiftly resigned. The agency said Thursday that six staffers have been disciplined with suspensions ranging from 10 to 42 days without pay; the six were placed on restricted duty or nonoperational positions. Their identities and positions were not released.",
      "The lack of firings has led to criticism. The Senate report said more than six people should have been disciplined and the penalties were too weak to match the severity of what happened.",
      "In many ways Crooks and his motivations are still a mystery.",
      "He was killed by a Secret Service countersniper and did not leave much information about why he did what he did. Investigators say they believe he acted alone and they didn't find any threatening comments or ideological positions on social media that shed light on his thinking.",
      "And while it's clear what went wrong in Butler, questions linger about how things that were so clearly problematic \u2014 like that open roof \u2014 weren't addressed ahead of time.",
      "Anthony Cangelosi, a former Secret Service agent who is now a lecturer at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that without being able to read the interviews with the agents involved in the Butler planning it's hard to know exactly why they did what they did. A year later, he still struggles with how so many things went wrong.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t understand how many errors were made on that site that day,\" he said. \u201cIf they agreed to leave that roof unoccupied, I can\u2019t ... understand it for the life of me.\u201d",
      "The widow of Corey Comperatore, who died during the Butler assassination attempt, echoed some of that sentiment during an interview with Fox News this week.",
      "\u201cWhy was that such a failure? Why weren\u2019t they paying attention? Why did they think that that roof didn\u2019t need covered? I want to sit down and talk to them,\u201d Helen Comperatore said.",
      "Cangelosi said he still questions whether the agency asked for additional personnel to cover a busy election year and if they did, whether those requests were granted. He thinks the Secret Service needs better pay to retain agents tempted to leave the agency for other federal government jobs.",
      "McDonald said he suspects part of the problem ahead of the Butler rally was that the Secret Service might have had a hard time understanding that the type of protection Trump needed wasn't the same as for other former presidents.",
      "He said it \u201cboggles the mind\u201d how Crooks was able to get on that roof and said that \u201ccommunication\u201d and \u201ccomplacency\u201d are the two issues that he thinks really went wrong in Butler.",
      "But he also said that he feels the agency is moving in the right direction. \u201cA lot of good people doing a lot good work there,\" he said, \u201cand I hope they continue to move in the right direction.\u201d",

      "Sotheby's is putting some rare items up for auction, including what it calls the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth",
      "NEW YORK -- For sale: A 54-pound (25-kilogram) rock. Estimated auction price: $2 million to $4 million. Why so expensive? It's the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth.",
      "Sotheby's in New York will be auctioning what's known as NWA 16788 on Wednesday as part of a natural history-themed sale that also includes a juvenile Ceratosaurus dinosaur skeleton that's more than 6 feet (2 meters) tall and nearly 11 feet (3 meters) long.",
      "According to the auction house, the meteorite is believed to have been blown off the surface of Mars by a massive asteroid strike before traveling 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) to Earth, where it crashed into the Sahara. A meteorite hunter found it in Niger in November 2023, Sotheby's says.",
      "The red, brown and gray hunk is about 70% larger than the next largest piece of Mars found on Earth and represents nearly 7% of all the Martian material currently on this planet, Sotheby's says. It measures nearly 15 inches by 11 inches by 6 inches (375 millimeters by 279 millimeters by 152 millimeters).",
      "\u201cThis Martian meteorite is the largest piece of Mars we have ever found by a long shot,\" Cassandra Hatton, vice chairman for science and natural history at Sotheby's, said in an interview. \u201cSo it\u2019s more than double the size of what we previously thought was the largest piece of Mars.\u201d",
      "It is also a rare find. There are only 400 Martian meteorites out of the more than 77,000 officially recognized meteorites found on Earth, Sotheby's says.",
      "Hatton said a small piece of the red planet remnant was removed and sent to a specialized lab that confirmed it is from Mars. It was compared with the distinct chemical composition of Martian meteorites discovered during the Viking space probe that landed on Mars in 1976, she said.",
      "The examination found that it is an \u201colivine-microgabbroic shergottite,\u201d a type of Martian rock formed from the slow cooling of Martian magma. It has a course-grained texture and contains the minerals pyroxene and olivine, Sotheby's says.",
      "It also has a glassy surface, likely due to the high heat that burned it when it fell through Earth's atmosphere, Hatton said. \u201cSo that was their first clue that this wasn't just some big rock on the ground,\u201d she said.",
      "The meteorite previously was on exhibit at the Italian Space Agency in Rome. Sotheby's did not disclose the owner.",
      "It's not clear exactly when the meteorite hit Earth, but testing shows it probably happened in recent years, Sotheby's said.",
      "The juvenile Ceratosaurus nasicornis skeleton was found in 1996 near Laramie, Wyoming, at Bone Cabin Quarry, a gold mine for dinosaur bones. Specialists assembled nearly 140 fossil bones with some sculpted materials to recreate the skeleton and mounted it so it's ready to exhibit, Sotheby's says.",
      "The skeleton is believed to be from the late Jurassic period, about 150 million years ago, Sotheby's says. It's auction estimate is $4 million to $6 million.",
      "Ceratosaurus dinosaurs were bipeds with short arms that appear similar to the Tyrannosaurus rex, but smaller. Ceratosaurus dinosaurs could grow up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) long, while the Tyrannosaurs rex could be 40 feet (12 meters) long.",
      "The skeleton was acquired last year by Fossilogic, a Utah-based fossil preparation and mounting company.",

    "story": [
      "The new tax law signed by President Donald Trump creates a federal tax deduction for interest on auto loans",
      "Millions of people receive a federal tax deduction for the interest they pay on home loans. Under President Donald Trump\u2019s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time also could claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.",
      "The new tax break will be available even to people who don't itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications.",
      "Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:",
      "Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and \u201cstimulate massive domestic auto production.\u201d",
      "The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.",
      "The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.",
      "The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.",
      "U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.",
      "After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.",
      "The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.",
      "Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.",
      "General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That's a lower U.S-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which all are headquartered in Japan.",
      "The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.",
      "At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.",
      "Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.",
      "On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income. That's an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.",
      "At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer's website.",
      "A website ribbon exclaims: \u201cCAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE\" while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump's tax-cut law.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,\" Ray said.",
      "Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: \u201cFor some people deciding \u2014 should I buy it, should I not \u2014 this could be something that tips the scale.\u201d",
      "Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke's math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month's loan payment for a new vehicle.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A farmworker who fell from a greenhouse roof during a chaotic ICE raid this week at a California cannabis facility died Saturday of his injuries.",
      "Jaime Alanis, 57, is the first known person to die during one of the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing immigration enforcement operations. Yesenia Duran, Alanis' niece, confirmed his death to The Associated Press.",
      "Duran posted on the fundraising site GoFundMe that her uncle was his family's only provider and he had been sending his earnings back to a wife and daughter in Mexico. Alanis worked at the farm for 10 years, his family said.",
      "The United Farm Workers reported Alanis\u2019 death prematurely late Friday. The Ventura County Medical Center later issued a statement authorized by the family saying he was still on life support.",
      "\u201cThese violent and cruel federal actions terrorize American communities, disrupt the American food supply chain, threaten lives and separate families,\u201d the UFW said recently in a statement on the social platform X. The union does not represent workers at the raided farm.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said it executed criminal search warrants Thursday at Glass House Farms facilities in Camarillo and Carpinteria. Glass House is a licensed cannabis grower. The farm in Camarillo also grows tomatoes and cucumbers.",
      "Alanis called family to say he was hiding and possibly was fleeing agents before he fell about 30 feet (9 meters) from the roof and broke his neck, according to information from family, hospital and government sources.",
      "Agents arrested some 200 people suspected of being in the country illegally and identified at least 10 immigrant children on the sites, DHS said in a statement. Alanis was not among them, the agency said.",
      "\u201cThis man was not in and has not been in CBP or ICE custody,\u201d DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. \u201cAlthough he was not being pursued by law enforcement, this individual climbed up to the roof of a greenhouse and fell 30 feet. CBP immediately called a medivac to the scene to get him care as quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "Four U.S. citizens were arrested during the incident for allegedly \u201cassaulting or resisting officers,\u201d according to DHS, and authorities were offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of a person suspected of firing a gun at federal agents.",
      "During the raid crowds of people gathered outside the facility in Camarillo to seek information about their relatives and protest immigration enforcement. Authorities clad in military-style helmets and uniforms faced off with the demonstrators, and people ultimately retreated amid acrid green and white billowing smoke.",
      "Glass House said in a statement that immigration agents had valid warrants. The company said workers were detained and it is helping provide them with legal representation.",
      "\u201cGlass House has never knowingly violated applicable hiring practices and does not and has never employed minors,\u201d it said.",
      "The business was co-founded by Graham Farrar and Kyle Kazan. Farrar has donated to California Democrats including Gov. Gavin Newsom, a vocal critic of Republican President Donald Trump, according to campaign finance records. Kazan has donated to both Democrats and Republicans.",

    "story": [
      "If you turn on a TV or sit in a movie theater, it's likely you'll see one particular actor \u2026 and there's also a good chance you won't know his name: \"I'm walking from the subway to the theater and a woman \u2013 I was in Times Square, so she's obviously a tourist \u2013 she goes, 'Oh, my God, there's, hey, hey, hey, hey\u2026' Didn't even know the name!\"",
      "His name is Richard Kind, and he's quite happy being just a little famous.",
      "\"I'll walk down the street and somebody will go, 'Oh, you're a national treasure.' And then I pass 250 people who don't know who I am, and yet that person thinks I'm a national treasure!\" he said.",
      "National treasure Richard Kind has made a lot of people laugh, and sometimes, nap. I asked, \"When you're on the stage, do you ever look down and see somebody asleep?\"",
      "\"Sure!\"",
      "\"What's that feel like?\"",
      "\"I say, I don't blame you!\" he laughed.",
      "Over the years, Kind has shown up everywhere. Maybe you've seen him on \"Poker Face,\" or \"Mid-Century Modern,\" or \"Only Murders in the Building.\" He's also the announcer and sidekick on the Netflix talk show \"Everybody's Live with John Mulaney.\"",
      "For 45 years, he's worked on Broadway (earning a Tony nomination for \"The Big Knife\"), and in movies and television, to become a respected actor. But that wasn't always his goal. \"When I was young, lying in bed, dreaming of stardom, I wanted stardom,\" he said. \"I didn't wanna be a good actor; I wanted stardom.\"",
      "Kind thought he'd follow his father into his Princeton, N.J., jewelry business. \"That I'm an actor is so wrong,\" he said. \"I should have gone into my dad's store. I should be in business. I should have been a lawyer. I should have done what is expected of a suburban middle-class kid.\"",
      "He said growing up he was teased more than most: \"I was a fat kid. I bet I was a loser. I'd might have made fun of me!\"",
      "But at summer camp, a friend gave him what became an essential life lesson: \"He taught me how to laugh at myself,\" Kind said.",
      "\"Was that laugh-at-yourself-before-other-people-do a defense mechanism?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, absolutely. Absolutely, absolutely. He was a fat kid, too, who then lost weight. I eventually lost weight. Still a fat kid even to this day. I'll never be a thin person\u2026. In my head, I'm a fat, fat person.\"",
      "In the 1970s, self-assurance developed on stage at Northwestern University, and at Chicago's legendary improv theater, the Second City. \"Six nights a week at Second City, that is my Harvard of acting,\" Kind said. \"Some people would say it's the Harvard of comedy. It's not. It was my Harvard of acting.\"",
      "Even with that on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, there were still doubts: \"My dad used to ask my professors at school or my directors, and these were his exact words: 'Does he have it? Is he any good?' He would not trust himself to say, 'Oh, my son is a good actor.' He would ask somebody else, 'Is he a good actor?' What the hell? Look at me, I'm a good actor!\"",
      "Possibly his most memorable role to date: Bing Bong, an imaginary creature who ultimately sacrifices himself to save his young friend, Riley/Joy, in the Pixar film \"Inside Out.\" \"I died for her,\" Kind said. \"I died so that she might have a great life.\"",
      "According to John Mulaney, that moment \u2013 letting let go of the past, but remaining child-like \u2013 says a lot about Richard Kind. \"In many ways, by having him as our announcer, we've given our imaginary friend a place at a podium,\" Mulaney said. \"He's incredibly sweet, incredibly childlike, and a real man and a powerful actor, and a great father.\"",
      "And here's another of his many roles you may have missed: the science fiction comedy \"Sharknado 2: The Second One,\" in which tornadoes hurl sharks at New York City \u2013 and New York City doesn't take it lying down. \"I hit a shark out of the ballpark. Now that's something I don't think a lot of people have that on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. I do!\"",
      "It seems like almost every place you go, you'll bump into Kind. Here we are at a recent New York Mets charity poker event. \"I used to be very good at this,\" he said. \"Then, I had children and moved to New York. Children can ruin a poker game \u2026 Every time I bet, I'm like this, thinking, Well, how will I pay for my kids' college?\"",
      "In some ways, Kind's success is all about the risks he's taken. \"This business is very cruel to actors,\" he said. \"Truly, it's very cruel. Some people call it insulting. I don't call it insulting, but I do say it is cruel. How much did I make my first episode of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'? How much did I make?\"",
      "\"Not a clue,\" I said.",
      "\"Take a guess.\"",
      "\"First episode? $2,500?\"",
      "\"That's a good guess. $700!\" Kind said. \"You go in with the attitude that everybody who's casting this product wants to make 'Seinfeld money.' They wanna make a lot of money. I walk in saying, 'I can help you make this great. I am the right guy for this.'\"",
      "And with a flourishing career built on being exactly the right guy, Richard Kind is grateful just to be at the same table with other actors. \"I am parsley on a plate of meat and potatoes,\" he said. \"Now, I'm good. I look great there. I'm the freshest parsley! But they're meat and potatoes. What do I do? I help make the plate look great. That's fine. That's what I usually do. But I can be cut out. I'm just not necessary all the time. And I'm fine, fine, fine with that. I've made a career of it, haven't I?\"",

      "For co-curator and granddaughter Isca Greenfield-Sanders, a retrospective now on display in Manhattan is a chance for the world to brush up on \"Joop Sanders: The Last Abstract Expressionist.\" The exhibit at the Milton Resnick and Pat Passlof Foundation runs until July 19.",
      "\"We could've done this show with 15 entirely different paintings,\" said Greenfield-Sanders. \"But we had favorites and we had must-haves.",
      "\"Abstract Expressionism is the first movement tracthat is homegrown in the United States that is an international art movement,\" she said. \"You look at a lot of the geometric work, it's quite figurative. It's very human. It teaches you about how you are holding yourself in space and how you are looking at it on the wall.\"",
      "Joop Sanders emigrated from Amsterdam to the U.S. at age 17. He was among the youngest to take part in the landmark 9th Street Show in 1951, sharing the same billing with more familiar names like Willem and Elaine de Kooning, who would become lifelong friends. Elaine and Joop even posed for each other back when they couldn't afford models.",
      "\"He was always in there and always making great work,\" said Greenfield-Sanders. \"I think often about what it must have been like keeping up with these guys who had been painting for quite a while already, and holding his own.\"",
      "But during that scene's formative years in the mid- to late-1950s, Sanders and his new family left for his native Holland, exhibiting all over Europe, before coming back to New York. It was when Abstract Expressionism was hot.",
      "\"A handful of the Ab Ex painters made money, and the truth is no one else did,\" said Greenfield-Sanders. \"He's still living his life as a human being, and he has a young family and his parents want to know their grandchildren. His family was very important to him.\"",
      "And important for Greenfield-Sanders, who learned how to paint from Grandpa Joop at eight years old. The exhibit is part of a grieving process to honor the artist who died in 2023.",
      "Of Joop Sanders' \"Dream of the Red Chamber,\" I asked, \"Can you imagine not having this in your life?\"",
      "\"No,\" Greenfield-Sanders replied. \"I always think of it as the red painting, but there are so many other colors. As a painter, I see some of his moves. They're so much movement \u2013 it's a dance.\"",
      "Joop Sanders died just short of his 102nd birthday. \"I was born on his 57th birthday, and he and I shared a birthday for the next 44 years,\" Greenfield-Sanders said.",
      "His loss from the family has been lifted by being able to bring to light all of his paintings and share them with other people.",

      "Part of the project involves life with a teenager, Oswalt said while talking about his own experiences, \"you really get to see, 'oh \u2026 that's the way that I used to be. Oh she either got that from me or some of this is in-born. How can I change this? How do we make this better?'\"",

She actually digs hanging out with me and my wife, but we do have a teenager who's always slightly disappointed in us.\"",
      "For Oswalt, the family moments are full circle, \"we're hanging out and we're having fun and then daddy realizes what a goofball he is or I'm realizing, oh, wait a minute \u2026 I would get just as embarrassed by my dad at this. That's what she's doing right now.\"",

      "A flurry of tariff threats by President Trump leaves U.S. consumers and businesses in limbo ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline to deploy the import duties against more than 50 countries around the world, according to economists and trade experts.",
      "\"Nobody knows whether these are threats or whether they will become policy, so it seems like everyone has become desensitized to them,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that uncertainty over U.S. tariffs leaves companies in \"a very dense fog.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Saturday announced he is imposing 30% tariffs against Mexico and the 27-member European Union. That followed moves to threaten tariffs ranging from 20% to 50% on roughly two dozen countries, including key U.S. trading partners such as Brazil, Canada, Japan and South Korea.",
      "The White House last week also said it plans to impose a 50% levy on copper imports by Aug. 1, raising concerns about higher costs for electronics, cars and numerous other products that use the metal.",
      "Heat on Russia and Brazil",
      "In a separate development that illustrates the White House's willingness to use tariffs to accomplish its aims beyond trade, Mr. Trump is threatening sharply higher tariffs as he tries to tamp down conflict in Ukraine. The president said on Monday that the U.S. will impose 100% tariffs on countries that engage in trade with Russia if there is no peace deal to end the war in Ukraine within 50 days.",
      "In another case of hitching trade policy to other foreign policy priorities, Mr. Trump said last week that the U.S. would slap a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil next month, citing the criminal prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which Mr. Trump called an \"international disgrace.\"",
      "The Trump administration has defended its aggressive use of tariffs as a way to ensure fair trade for U.S. businesses; boost key domestic sectors; generate federal revenue; and advance other policy priorities, such as curbing fentanyl trafficking and authorized immigration from Canada and Mexico.",
      "According to\u00a0Reuters, customs duties in June surpassed $100 billion for the first time in a single fiscal year, a sign the stepped-up tariff regime is contributing more revenue.",
      "\"High uncertainty\"",
      "So far, the White House has notched only a handful of trade deals, experts note, while agreements with major trading partners like the EU have been harder to come buy. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump announced a pact between the U.S. and Vietnam, while in June a more limited deal was reached with the United Kingdom that the White House said provides gives \"American companies unprecedented access to British markets while bolstering U.S. national security.\"",
      "Also last month, the U.S. and China announced that they\u00a0had agreed on a framework for a trade deal that makes it easier for U.S. businesses to acquire Chinese magnets and rare earth minerals.",
      "But with little time to thrash out trade agreements ahead of the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, some trade experts say the U.S. has made little progress since suspending country-based tariffs in April.",
      "\"We don't have any comprehensive deals with our largest trading partners,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank. \"Where this leaves us is where we've been \u2014 in a period of high uncertainty for businesses and consumers.\"",

      "\"How do you negotiate with someone when you don't know what they want?\" he said. \"One day, [President Trump] says they are about trade deficits, the next day it's about raising revenue, the next it's about stimulating American industry \u2014 then it's a bargaining tool. His multiple goals conflict with one another.\"",
      "Demanding equal footing",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai said Mr. Trump's tariff agenda is driven in part by his desire for U.S. trade partners to lower both \"tariff and non-monetary trade barriers that are undermining American industries.\"",
      "Such moves by other nations would allow American industries to \"be on a more equal footing to compete and grow,\" Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's trade policies, tariffs have yet to significantly affect consumer prices in the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is imposing a 17% tariff on most fresh Mexican tomatoes, the federal government said Monday, ending a yearslong agreement with the U.S.' southern neighbor over trade practices.",
      "The move comes amid a separate push by President Trump to increase tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, including Mexico, which was told over the weekend to\u00a0expect 30% tariffs starting in August. Critics argue the president's tariff strategy could push up consumer prices. But Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said in a statement Monday that the decision on tomatoes is \"in line with President Trump's trade policies and approach with Mexico.\"",
      "\"Mexico remains one of our greatest allies, but for far too long our farmers have been crushed by unfair trade practices that undercut pricing on produce like tomatoes. That ends today,\" Lutnick said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The U.S. gets around 70% of its tomatoes from Mexico, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange. Roughly $3 billion worth of tomatoes are exported from Mexico to the U.S. every year, an almost threefold jump over the last 15 years, federal data shows.",
      "Supporters argue the tariffs could give a boost to the domestic tomato industry, which the Florida Tomato Exchange says has been \"decimated by an influx of cheap Mexican tomatoes.\" But others warn the move could lead to higher prices and harm U.S. companies that rely on imported tomatoes.",
      "The tariffs follow a complicated,\u00a0nearly three-decade-long dispute over allegations that Mexican tomato producers were illegally selling tomatoes to the U.S. at unfairly low prices, harming U.S. growers. The federal government\u00a0struck a deal\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 during Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 that averted \"anti-dumping\" duties on tomatoes in exchange for Mexican producers agreeing to a minimum sale price.",
      "In April, the Commerce Department announced the U.S. would exit that deal in 90 days, saying it \"has failed to protect U.S. tomato growers from unfairly priced Mexican imports.\" The Commerce Department said it would impose 20.91% tariffs \u2014 slightly higher than the 17.09% levies announced Monday.",
      "The Florida Tomato Exchange praised the move in a statement Monday. The group's executive vice president, Robert Guenther, called it \"an enormous victory for American tomato farmers and American agriculture.\"",
      "A group of lawmakers in Florida \u2014 which is one of the U.S.' largest tomato-producing states \u2014\u00a0praised the planned duties\u00a0in a letter to Lutnick last month. Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, called the move \"a major victory for American growers and producers.\"",
      "But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged Lutnick not to exit the deal on Friday, arguing the Trump administration should try to cut a new deal with Mexico instead. The group said \"the import and sale of Mexican tomatoes generate an estimated $8.3 billion in economic benefits,\" and warned withdrawing from the deal could trigger retaliation from Mexico.",
      "\"Terminating the Agreement would likely have widespread repercussions on the U.S. economy, affecting agriculture, warehousing, logistics, grocery, and restaurant industries,\" the group said in a letter to Lutnick.",
      "The lead-up to Monday's decision also drew criticism from some Democrats.",
      "\"ARIZONA, BUY YOUR TOMATOES NOW!!\" Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, wrote on X last week. \"Groceries are already too expensive. [Mr. Trump] needs to reverse this decision now.\"",
      "\"Salsa will be pricier, shelves emptier, and groceries more expensive. Tens of thousands of jobs, including 30,000 Texans, will be at risk,\" Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas Democrat,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Mexico's agriculture and economy ministries criticized the move in a statement Monday, saying it was \"unfair and against the interests not only of Mexican producers but also of the U.S. industry.\" They also said the massive growth in tomato exports to the U.S. \"stems from the quality of the product, not from any unfair practices.\" The Mexican government said it expected to find a solution to the dispute.",
      "Mr. Trump has sent letters to dozens of U.S. trading partners over the last week threatening higher tariffs starting August 1, partially reinstating some of the steep country-by-country levies that were rolled out by the Trump administration in April, but quickly delayed for 90 days. The president argues the tariffs are necessary to protect domestic jobs and correct unfair trade practices, but many economists argue tariffs can lead to sluggish economic growth and higher prices.",
      "Food prices grew 2.9% in the 12-month period ending in May \u2014 higher than the country's overall 2.4% inflation rate, but well below mid-2022, when food prices were growing upwards of 10% year-over-year, according to federal data. The price of tomatoes fell 6.8% from May 2024 to May 2025.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers last month he expects tariffs to have some impact on prices. But he added: \"We really don't know how much of that's going to be passed through the consumer. We have to wait and see.\"",

    "summary": "Tesla faces questions over the alleged involvement of its Autopilot system in a 2019 crash that killed Florida college student Naibel Benavides Leon",
    "story": [
      "Tesla heads to federal court in Miami on Monday to defend its Autopilot system in a wrongful death case involving the death of a 22-year-old college student.",
      "The lawsuit, originally filed in April 23, 2021, in the 11th Judicial Court of Florida in Miami-Dade County, builds on previous cases involving Tesla's Autopilot system. The plaintiffs, Dillon Angulo, and the family of Naibel Benavides Leon, who was killed in the accident, are requesting punitive damages and compensation for medical costs and other expenses.",
      "The fatal crash took place in April 2019 when a Model S Tesla equipped with the Autopilot technology struck a parked vehicle in Key Largo, Florida, killing Leon and gravely injuring Angulo.",
      "The trial will be a major test for the EV maker, which has had to contend with slumping sales and a hit to its stock price after CEO Elon Musk spearheaded the launch of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He. has since stepped back from leading DOGE.",
      "The lawyers representing the plaintiffs in the case did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Autopilot's reputation at stake",
      "According to recent court filings connected to the case, Tesla owner George McGee had the Autopilot function of his 2019 Tesla Model S activated as he was driving on a two-lane rural road in Key Largo on April 25, 2019. McGee dropped his phone as he was approaching an intersection, and lost sight of the road as he bent down to pick it up, court documents state.",
      "In that moment, McGee's car allegedly plowed through the T-shaped intersection at over 60 miles per hour, failing to brake before crashing into the side of a Chevrolet Tahoe truck parked on the side of the road. The accident killed Naibel Benavides Leon, 22, and seriously injured her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, who were standing by the truck, which he owned.",
      "At issue is whether the car's Autopilot system was defective and contributed to the death of Benavides. In a court filing, Todd Poses, one of the plaintiff's lawyer, claims that design defects in the car's Autopilot system failed to detect obstacles, such as the Chevy Tahoe, resulting in Benavides' death.",
      "Tesla's argument",
      "In its motion for summary judgment, filed on June 26, Tesla argues that the Autopilot feature \"did not make the car 'self-driving'\" and that McGee was aware \"that it was still [his] responsibility to operate the vehicle safely even with Autopilot activate.\"",
      "Said Tesla in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch:",
      "\"The evidence clearly shows that this crash had nothing to do with Tesla's Autopilot technology. Instead, like so many unfortunate accidents since cell phones were invented, this was caused by a distracted driver. To his credit, he took responsibility for his actions because he was searching for his dropped cell phone while also pressing the accelerator, speeding and overriding the car's system at the time of the crash.

    "published": "Mon, 14 Jul 2025 16:47:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The tax and spending bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4 includes a limited tax break for car buyers.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of car buyers in the U.S. could soon get some tax relief thanks to a provision in the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" that was signed into law on July 4 by President Trump.",
      "The idea of giving a tax break for auto purchasers was first floated by Mr. Trump while on the campaign trail in October, when he promised that such a measure would \"make car ownership dramatically more affordable for millions and millions of working American families.\"",
      "That promise has now materialized as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, with the new tax break taking effect for car purchases starting in 2025. But the deduction also has income limitations that narrow the number of Americans who can claim it, while used car buyers and vehicle leasers do not benefit.",
      "Still, car buyers who have bought a new vehicle this year or are planning to do so in the next four years may get some tax relief when they file their 2025 tax returns. The deduction will expire in 2028, which means car buyers can only take advantage of the benefit for four tax years.",
      "At the same time, the One Big Beautiful Act eliminates the federal tax credit for electric vehicles after Sept. 30. The tax break, which provides a $7,500 for new EVs and a $4,000 credit for used EVs, is credited with helping make electric vehicles more affordable for many buyers.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How much is the new auto loan deduction?",
      "The new tax cuts and spending law enables car buyers to deduct up to $10,000 in \"qualified passenger vehicle loan interest during a given taxable year,\" beginning with 2025 purchases.",
      "While that's similar to the mortgage interest deduction available to homeowners, there is one major difference: Car buyers will be able to itemize their auto loan interest even if they take the standard deduction. By comparison, the mortgage interest deduction is only available to taxpayers who itemize.",
      "Which vehicles qualify for the deduction?",
      "The tax break applies to the purchase of new cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds (referred to as light vehicles). Used cars don't qualify.",
      "To qualify for the deduction, a vehicle also must be assembled in the U.S., which further limits the tax break.",
      "The deduction also only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes. And it excludes autos that are leased, which represent about one-quarter of all auto sales in the U.S., according to Experian.",
      "What are the income limits for the auto loan deduction?",
      "The full break can only be claimed by single taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $100,000 or less or married couples with a MAGI of $200,000 or less.",
      "Modified adjusted gross income is your adjusted gross income, which can be found on line 11 of your 1040 tax return, with some items like savings bond interest added back in, according to the IRS.",
      "Under the new law, the auto loan deduction shrinks for people with MAGIs above those thresholds, with the amount reduced by $200 for each $1,000 in income above those levels. The deduction is completely phased out for single filers earning above $150,000 and married couples with incomes above $250,000.",
      "How many Americans will qualify for the car loan deduction?",
      "An estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year if purchasing patterns stay the same and after excluding commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.",
      "About 60% of the 15.9 million new light vehicles sold last year were financed with auto loans, according to Cox data.",
      "How much will the car loan deduction save on my taxes?",
      "That depends on the size of your auto loan and whether you fall below the income thresholds for the new tax break, but the typical car buyer could save hundreds per year on their taxes.",
      "The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year because interest payments on loans are front-loaded, while principal payments grow on the back end.",
      "Car buyers who qualify for an auto loan rate of about 6.5%, typically available to consumers with high credit scores, could deduct $3,000 in the first year of owning their car and about $1,800 per year after that for the remainder of the loan,\u00a0according to the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.",
      "Deductions reduce a filer's taxable income, which helps lower their tax burden. For instance, someone in the 22% tax bracket could save $660 on their taxes by claiming a $3,000 auto loan deduction.",
      "At a 9.3% interest rate \u2014 typical of people with subprime credit scores \u2014 an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said.",

      "The Pentagon has signed on to use Grok, the AI chatbot built by Elon Musk's company xAI, as part of a new $200 million agreement that opens the door for its deployment across the federal government, the company announced Monday.",
      "The announcement comes amid Musk's public breakup with President Trump and days after Grok generated antisemitic responses and praised Adolf Hitler.",
      "The rollout is part of \"Grok for Government,\" a newly launched suite of tools designed for use by federal agencies, local governments, and national security operations. xAI said its products, including its latest Grok 4 model, will now be available for purchase through the General Services Administration (GSA), allowing any federal office to adopt the technology.",
      "The move aligns with the Trump administration's push for more aggressive adoption of artificial intelligence across the government. Since taking office in January, Mr. Trump has championed AI as a pillar of national security and innovation.",
      "Musk himself briefly served in the Trump administration earlier this year, overseeing the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, before stepping down in May amid a public break with Mr. Trump over his sweeping tax and spending bill. Musk has since emerged as a sharp critic of that legislation, even floating the idea of launching a third political party.",
      "Despite the rift, xAI has continued to expand its government work. The new offering includes custom national security tools, AI-powered science and health applications, and cleared engineering support for classified environments.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok generated antisemitic responses to user prompts and referenced Hitler  as part of what the company called an effort to make the model \"less politically correct.\" Hours later, Musk wrote in a post on X that \"Grok was too compliant to user prompts. Too eager to please and be manipulated, essentially. That is being addressed.\"",
      "The posts were later deleted and xAI said it \"quickly\" patched the issue. One day later, xAI launched an upgraded version of Grok it described as a major leap forward. Musk also announced that Grok would be used in Teslas.",
      "But the latest version was not without kinks, too: Grok checked with Musk's views before answering a question, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Grok was introduced in late 2023 as a more unfiltered alternative to other chatbots like ChatGPT, and is already integrated into Musk's social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.",
      "\"America is the world leader in AI,\" xAI said in Monday's post announcing the Pentagon deal. \"We're excited to contribute back to the country that made xAI uniquely possible here.\"",

      "Starbucks is offering\u00a0four new drinks via its app: Cookies on top; a dragonfruit \"glow-up\"; lemon, tea and popping \"pearls\"; and a white mocha shaken espresso. Letting customers order the special drinks with the click of a button streamlines the experience for both customers and baristas, a Starbucks spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. Starbucks will also be introducing new drink combinations regularly, the spokesperson said.",
      "The move is part of CEO Brian Niccol's efforts to win back customers and revive Starbucks' brand. The promotion comes after the company in February simplified its menu offerings as it tries to improve customer service.",
      "To drum up interest in the secret menu, Starbucks is also hosting a contest, which runs from July 14 to July 20, for customers to submit and vote on their favorite customized beverages.",

As part of that effort, the company will fold Glassdoor operations into Indeed, the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Glassdoor CEO Christian Sutherland-Wong is stepping down.",

      "Advice on what to say",
      "Roman Khaves, founder of a dating assistant app called Rizz \u2014 which is Gen Z-speak for \"charisma\" \u2014 said the service provides around-the-clock, objective advice for people who can't afford a human dating coach or are unable to reach their friends in a pinch.",
      "\"It'll never sleep on you,\" Khaves told CBS MoneyWatch, describing the app as an \"AI wingwoman or AI wingman in your pocket.\"",
      "Rizz works by letting users upload screenshots of their conversations from dating apps or social media. Rizz then suggests a reply using generative AI. The more you use Rizz, the more it understands what type of replies you tend to like or feel comfortable with. That trains the AI model to improve over time.",
      "Rizz has a user base of roughly 10 million, according to Khaves, and is composed of 65% men and 35% women, largely within the 18-to-25 age range.",

      "One reason people ghost others is that they don't know the best way to let someone down easy, Keepler co-founder and CEO Rachel Abramowitz, told CBS MoneyWatch. Keepler's defense against ghosting is Keri, the app's in-house relationship guide.",
      "\"What we've built is a way to put in your raw, unedited feedback to Keri. Keri will rewrite it for you, and then you can send it to somebody,\" Abramowitz said.",
      "For those who have been ghosted, Keepler also allows users to request feedback from their vanishing date directly through the app, or have Keri help them write a message to send on their own.",
      "Abramowitz emphasizes that the app isn't aimed at providing therapy, but rather is there to offer support. With Keri, \"It really does feel like you have someone who is objective, who is on your side, who has no ulterior motives and really wants you to help reach your goals,\" she said.",
      "Last-gen dating apps are also getting into the AI game. Hinge and Grindr, two of the most popular dating apps, are taking steps to integrate AI into their platforms. In January, for example, Hinge introduced Prompt Feedback, an AI feature that provides users with immediate feedback on their profiles as they enter information.",
      "AI icebreaker",
      "The growing popularity of AI dating assistants gives rise to questions over authenticity as more users rely on the technology to convey their thoughts and feelings.",

      "He also acknowledged that some of his dates appeared skeptical after he revealed to them that he was getting behind-the-scenes coaching from Rizz. But he still thinks the service is helpful as a conversation starter.",

      "In his letter to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Mr. Trump acknowledged that the country has helped stem the flow of undocumented migrants and fentanyl into the U.S. But he said the country has not done enough to stop North America from turning into a \"Narco-Trafficking Playground.\"",
      "\"Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "The Mexican economy and foreign ministries, in a joint statement on Saturday, said they had been informed of the new tariffs during a meeting in Washington, D.C. on Friday.",

    "published": "Sat, 12 Jul 2025 09:07:17 -0400",
    "summary": "New law reduces the number of federal student loan repayment options and caps how much individuals can borrow for higher education.",
    "story": [
      "The millions of Americans with student loans, who have already experienced whiplash in federal policy since the pandemic, must again brace for change.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" that President Trump signed into law on July 4 overhauls the federal student loan system by reducing the number of repayment plan options down to two from seven and capping the amount individuals can borrow for higher education.",
      "Here's how the new budget law will affect people with federal student loans.",
      "Repayment plan options",
      "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act phases out a number of existing federal student loan repayment plans, including the SAVE, PAYE, IBR and ICR.",
      "Current borrowers enrolled in programs to be eliminated will have until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. For the 7.7 million Americans enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan, interest collection will resume on Aug. 1, the Department of Education\u00a0announced\u00a0Wednesday.",
      "Beginning on July 1, 2026, new student loan borrowers will choose between one of two plans: a standard repayment plan or an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan. The standard repayment plan will allow student loan borrowers to make fixed payments over the course of 10 to 25 years.",
      "That approach \"condenses a maze of loan options into two,\" simplifying the repayment process, according to the White House.",
      "The Repayment Assistance Plan will allow borrowers to pay 1% to 10% of their income on a monthly basis, for up to 30 years, Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at advocacy group Student Borrower Protection Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. That's a longer timeline than current IDR plans, which\u00a0are currently either 20 or 25 years.",
      "After the 30-year mark, the borrower's remaining loan balance will be canceled, as is currently the case after an individual's repayment window ends.",
      "The five-year payment extension on income-based payments concerns Ba\u00f1ez, who said \"borrowers are going to be forced to be in repayment for even longer,\" she said.",
      "However, Sarah Reber, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, thinks the binary repayment options a \"huge improvement\" from a policy design perspective. The current system is confusing for borrowers given all the options from which they have to choose, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The One Big Beautiful Bill gives families the freedom to choose the best education for their children while reforming a broken federal loan system to promote responsibility, affordability and opportunity,\" the White House said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Pell Grants",
      "The new law tightens eligibility rules for the Pell Grant program, the largest source of federal aid for low-income students. From 2021-2022, an estimated 92% of Pell Grant recipients had a total family income at or below $60,000,\u00a0according to Congress.gov.",
      "Under the law, students who receive a full scholarship from a college or university will no longer be eligible for additional funding through the Pell Grant program.",
      "By contrast, the law expands Pell Grant eligibility for students in workforce training programs. Previously, Pell Grants could only be used to pay for workforce training courses of less than 600 hours and 15 weeks, shutting out many short-term programs.",
      "That will enable \"Pell Grants to be used for short-term, high-quality workforce training programs to support Americans who choose a career or technical education path for career advancement,\" the White House said.",
      "The budget law also increases scrutiny of the Student Aid Index, which is used to determine the size of an individual's federal aid eligibility. As a result, higher-income families will have a harder time getting Pell Grant funding, according to the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP).",
      "Borrowing caps",
      "The new law sets borrowing caps on certain loans beginning July 1, 2026.",
      "Parent PLUS loans \u2014 federal loans available for parents of dependent undergraduate students \u2014 will now be restricted to $20,000 a year and a total cap of $65,000. That's a change from the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid an individual receives.",
      "The new law also does away with\u00a0Grad PLUS loans,\u00a0which help people finance higher education degrees. Starting July 1, 2026, new students will no longer be able to apply for the loans. However, current borrowers will be grandfathered and still allowed to access the loans, according to EdSource.",
      "With the elimination of Grad PLUS loans, graduate students in need of federal tuition assistance will have to take out Direct Unsubsidized Loans. Those seeking unsubsidized federal loans for professional degrees, such as law or medicine, will be restricted to $50,000 per year and a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in nonprofessional areas, such as history or philosophy, will be subject to an annual borrowing cap of $20,500 and a lifetime limit of $100,000.",
      "Economic hardship, unemployment deferment",
      "Currently, student loan borrowers can apply for up to three years of deferment based on economic hardship or unemployment, according to the Federal Student Aid website.",
      "Starting July 1, 2026, the new law eliminates deferment provisions for borrowers facing economic hardship. For example, someone who falls behind on the bills because of job loss would no longer qualify to defer student loan payments, Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "According to the White House, the changes to the deferment rules will streamline the process while also better protecting students and taxpayers.",

      "\"The President is extremely troubled by your management of the Federal Reserve System,\" Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought wrote in a letter Thursday.",
      "The letter came after months of criticism from Mr. Trump over the Fed's decision not to slash interest rates. Economists say lowering rates may accelerate economic growth, but also runs the risk of causing inflation to spike. That has led the Fed's interest rate-setting committee \u2014 which Powell chairs \u2014 to keep rates steady so far this year after cutting rates slightly last year.",
      "Mr. Trump has called on Powell to resign from his post, and last month, the president called Powell a \"numbskull\" over his interest rate decisions and said \"maybe\" he'll try to fire Powell \u2014 though federal law states the Fed chair can only be fired \"for cause,\" which typically refers to firings due to specific misconduct or performance issues. In the past, Mr. Trump had said he doesn't plan on trying to fire Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends next year.",
      "Vought's letter took aim at Powell and the central bank over its years-long office renovation project in Washington, D.C. The letter said plans for the project \"called for rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more.\" Vought also asked whether the Fed has made changes to its plans without seeking approval from a government commission that oversees D.C.-area federal building projects.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Federal Reserve for comment.",
      "In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\" He told lawmakers there isn't any new marble aside from what's necessary to replace broken old marble, and said there are no \"special elevators,\" new water features or rooftop gardens.",
      "\"All of the sort of inflammatory things that the media carried are either not in the current plan or just inaccurate,\" Powell said.",
      "Vought's letter argued that comment to the Senate \"appears to reveal that the project is out of compliance with the approved plan,\" suggesting the Fed may have run afoul of a law requiring D.C.-area projects be approved by the National Capital Planning Commission. In a post on X, the Office of Management and Budget alleged Powell \"slipped up and revealed he might...be violating the law.\" The Fed's renovation plans were reviewed by the commission several years ago.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a much higher degree of independence than most other government institutions. Federal law gives the Fed the power to make decisions about acquiring and remodeling buildings in Washington to serve as its office spaces.",
      "The Fed has previously acknowledged\u00a0that the price tag for its office renovations had jumped due to \"significant increases in raw materials costs,\" along with higher labor costs.",
      "On its website, the Fed says the two headquarters buildings that are getting overhauled \"have not been comprehensively renovated since their construction in the 1930s.\" The central bank said there are no private elevators or new VIP dining rooms \u2014 instead, the project will refurbish old elevators and conference rooms, including ones that are sometimes \"used for mealtime meetings.\" It also said plans for new water features were scrapped, though existing fountains will be repaired, and the garden terrace is actually a \"ground-level front lawn.\"",

      "Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said Thursday that he would impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States if President Donald Trump follows through on a pledge to boost import taxes by 50% over the South American country's criminal trial against his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "Lula said he would trigger Brazil's reciprocity law approved by Congress earlier this year if negotiations with the U.S. fail.",
      "\"If there's no negotiation, the reciprocity law will be put to work. If he charges 50 (% tariffs) from us, we will charge 50 from them,\" Lula told TV Record in excerpts of an interview that will be fully aired later in the day. \"Respect is good. I like to offer mine and I like to receive it.\"",
      "Lula's comments raise the risk of a tariffs war erupting between the two countries, similar to what has happened between the U.S. and China. Trump has vowed to respond forcefully if countries seek to punish the U.S. by adding tariffs of their own.",
      "The president of Brazil's Senate, Sen. Davi Alcolumbre, and Chamber of Deputies Speaker Hugo Motta, a pair of moderates who have recently been at odds with Lula, agreed that the recipricity law gives Brazil \"the means ... to protect our sovereignty.\"",
      "\"We will be ready to act with balance and firmness in defense of our economy, our productive sector, and the protection of Brazilian jobs,\" they said in a joint statement.",
      "The tariffs letter that Trump sent to Brazil \u2014 and posted on social media Wednesday \u2014 railing against the \"witch hunt\" trial against Bolsonaro opened up a new front in his trade wars, with the U.S. leader directly using import taxes to interfere with another nation's domestic politics.",
      "Trump has already tried to use tariffs to ostensibly combat fentanyl trafficking and as a negotiating tool to change how other nations tax digital services and regulate their economies.",
      "In Brazil's case, Trump is trying to dictate the outcome of the criminal trial of Bolsonaro, an ally who like Trump has been charged with attempting to overturn a presidential election. Bolsonaro maintains that he is being politically persecuted by Brazil's Supreme Court over his charges on the alleged plot to remain in power after his 2022 election loss to Lula.",
      "\"There's nothing Lula or Brazil can do about Bolsonaro's trial,\" said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo. \"Any change in that would be Brazil's capitulation. Bolsonaro's situation here won't change. How do you negotiate over that?\"",
      "Lula ordered his diplomats on Thursday to return Trump's letter if it physically arrives at the presidential palace in Brasilia. The document attacks the country's judiciary and mentions recent rulings on social media companies among the reasons why goods from the South American nation will have higher tariffs from Aug. 1.",
      "Trump has initiated his tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, saying in April that the persistent deficit between what the U.S. exports and what it imports is a national crisis.",
      "But the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Brazil, undermining some of the rationale.",
      "A staffer of Brazil's foreign ministry told The Associated Press that trade negotiations that were ongoing since Trump imposed a first set of tariffs in April are now \"up in the air.\"",
      "Some members of the Lula administration say Trump's move is actually aimed at Brazil's connection with other Southern economies, as displayed on Sunday at the summit of BRICS nations hosted in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil's president once again mentioned the hope for an alternative currency to the dollar for transactions, a topic that frequently draws Trump's ire.",
      "\"Trump was never worried about democracy anywhere, much less with Bolsonaro's destiny,\" said Gleisi Hoffmann, Brazil's institutional relations minister.",
      "Trump's interference in Brazilian affairs has brought a sense of unity that was largely absent in the politically divided nation. Some of Bolsonaro's allies claimed Lula had drawn the U.S. president's anger with other decisions, including criticism of Israel's war in Gaza. But other supporters of the former president chose to ask for prudence in negotiations.",
      "Daily O Estado de S. Paulo, a frequent critic of Lula and his administration, said in an editorial on Thursday that Trump's move against the Brazilian government is \"a mafia thing.\" It also said Lula's reaction was correct, a rare feature for the newspaper.",
      "Analysts also see Trump's attempt to interfere in the country's domestic affairs as a potential backfire for Bolsonaro during his trial and a push for Lula, whose reelection bid was facing unpopularity headwinds this year.",
      "Canadians recently elected Mark Carney as prime minister, with his Liberal Party reenergized by Trump's tariffs and threats to make Canada the 51st U.S. state.",
      "\"The reaction of a lot of people is that this is a political gift to Lula,\" said Andre Pagliarini, a professor of history and international studies at Louisiana State University who is also affiliated with the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.",
      "Thomas Traumann, an independent political consultant and former Brazilian minister, called Trump's move \"a game changer\" for next year's election.",
      "\"Trump put Lula back in the game,\" Traumann said. \"This gives Lula a narrative, puts Bolsonaro as the guilty part for any economic problems.\"",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled in May that Trump had exceeded his authority by declaring an emergency to impose tariffs without congressional approval. The Trump administration is appealing that decision, but opponents plan to use his Brazil letter to bolster their case.",
      "\"This is a brazenly illegal effort by Donald Trump to sacrifice the economy to settle his own personal scores, and it is far outside his legal authority,\" said Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden.",
      "The Republican administration has argued that their tariffs are now relatively harmless for the U.S. economy, since inflation has trended down in recent months. But many companies stockpiled imports to get ahead of the import taxes, and it's unclear what happens when their inventories dwindle and consumers consider the risk of higher prices. Most outside economic analyses expect growth to decline.",
      "In Brazil, Trump's interest in Bolsonaro's trial is expected to weigh over the trial. Media outlets have reported that lawmakers and judges are worried the former president will try to leave Brazil for the U.S. if he is convicted.",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 19:57:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Canada \u2014 one of the U.S.'s largest trading partners \u2014 will face 35% tariffs, President Trump said Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday threatened to impose 35% tariffs on goods from Canada starting next month, hiking import duties on one of the U.S.'s largest trading partners.",
      "The president announced the 35% tax in a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney posted to Truth Social, citing Canada's alleged \"failure to stop the drugs from pouring into our country,\" as well as retaliatory tariffs Canada has imposed on U.S. goods. The new tariffs are set to take effect Aug. 1, the president said.",
      "The move is an escalation from the 25% tariffs on Canadian \u2014 and Mexican \u2014 imports announced by Mr. Trump shortly after taking office. He later exempted goods covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, which was negotiated during Mr. Trump's first term. It's unclear whether the same exemption will apply to next month's 35% tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has sent similar letters to the leaders of more than 20 other countries this week, telling them to expect higher tariffs starting next month. He told NBC News' Kristen Welker on Thursday, \"all of the remaining countries\" will likely face tariffs of 15% to 20% \u2014 higher than the baseline 10% rate that's currently applied to all countries.",
      "But Canada is the largest American trading partner to receive a letter so far. Canada was the world's largest buyer of American goods and the third-largest seller of goods to the U.S. last year, according to Census Bureau data. The country bought some $350 billion worth of American goods and sold $412 billion to the U.S. market in 2024.",
      "Mr. Trump's letter to Carney says he will \"consider an adjustment to this letter\" if \"Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl.\" For months, the president has cast tariffs against Canada and Mexico as a way of getting the U.S.'s two neighbors to stem illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking, though very little fentanyl appears to enter the U.S. via Canada. Just 43 pounds were seized at the Canadian border last year, compared to 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "\"Throughout the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses,\" Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney wrote in a social media post late Thursday night. \"We will continue to do so as we work towards the revised deadline of August 1. Canada has made vital progress to stop the scourge of fentanyl in North America. We are committed to continuing to work with the United States to save lives and protect communities in both our countries.\"",
      "The president also assailed Canada for \"retaliat[ing] with its own Tariffs.\" And he said Canada has imposed other barriers on U.S. imports.",
      "Mr. Trump has held on-and-off discussions with Canada for months, but his relationship with the United States' northern neighbor has occasionally been rocky, with U.S. tariffs drawing retaliatory duties from Canada. The president\u00a0briefly called off all trade talks\u00a0with Canada last month due to a planned digital services tax that could hit U.S. tech companies, but the talks\u00a0resumed days later\u00a0after Carney rescinded the tax.",
      "Mr. Trump has also\u00a0repeatedly mused about annexing Canada, and Carney's party won this year's parliamentary elections after the prime minister ran on a platform\u00a0of defending Canada from the Trump administration's ambitions.",
      "Trump boosts tariffs on dozens of countries",
      "The president is sending out this week's spate of tariff letters about three months after first unveiling \"reciprocal tariffs\" against dozens of countries on \"Liberation Day\" in early April, along with a 10% tariff on everybody else. The move unnerved financial markets and sparked recession and inflation fears, and Mr. Trump quickly suspended most of the duties for 90 days \u2014 aside from the 10% baseline rate \u2014 saying he planned to negotiate trade deals.",
      "With that 90-day pause set to expire this week, Mr. Trump began sending out letters to dozens of trading partners from Japan to South Africa informing them of their planned tariffs. The U.S. has trade deficits with most countries that received Mr. Trump's letters, though Brazil was also threatened with a 50% tariff despite the U.S. running a trade surplus. The letter cited the prosecution of right-wing former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which Mr. Trump called a \"Witch Hunt.\"",
      "On top of country-specific tariffs, the president has also imposed hefty \"sectoral\" tariffs on foreign steel, copper and other specific categories of goods.",
      "Mr. Trump says the tariffs are necessary to revive American manufacturing and correct trade imbalances. But many economists warn that tariffs lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said concerns about tariffs are partly to blame for the central bank's decision not to cut interest rates so far this year.",
      "Still, the president has stood by his trade strategy.",
      "\"I think the tariffs have been very well-received,\" Mr. Trump told NBC News on Thursday. \"The stock market hit a new high today.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 15:32:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Unemployment is rising among recent college grads as employers turn to artificial intelligence to handle entry-level work.",
    "story": [
      "The rise of generative AI is making it harder for recent college graduates to get a foothold on the corporate ladder as they start their careers.",
      "Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to young grads have declined 15%, while the number of applications per job has surged 30%, according to data from Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z workers.",
      "Although people fresh out of college often struggle to land entry-level positions in their chosen field, \"there are early warning signs\" that AI is taking jobs away from the least experienced\u00a0 workers, Doug Calidas, senior vice president of government affairs for Americans for Responsible Innovation, a nonprofit focused on emerging technologies, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The unemployment rate for recent college graduates being unusually high seems relevant,\" he said.",
      "As of March, the U.S. unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 through 27 was 5.8%, considerably higher than the nation's overall 4% jobless rate at the time,\u00a0according\u00a0to the New York Federal Reserve.",
      "To be sure, most recent college grads are finding work, Calidas emphasized, adding that the latest job figures point to a \"deterioration,\" not a collapse, in opportunities for young people.",
      "Still, \"It's tough for students who feel like they have done the right thing their whole lives \u2014 they went into STEM careers or computer science because they expected software hiring to grow and grow, and that may not happen,\" he said.",
      "Just ask Michael Macaluso, 22, who this year earned a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Connecticut. Despite applying for roughly 200 positions, he has yet to land a job in his chosen field. For now, he's working as an assistant pool director at the Lake Isle Country Club in Eastchester, New York, his hometown.",
      "\"I was told by a lot of people, that I was going to get a job right out of college,\" he told CBS News' Ali Bauman. \"And then all of a sudden, there's no jobs.\"",
      "AI redefining the entry-level job",
      "Experts say that because AI is currently best at the kind of rote, repetitive tasks that are a staple of entry-level work, the very nature of what such roles consist of is likely to change.",
      "\"The AI piece is becoming more integrated, which is requiring a redefinition of what an entry-level role looks like and the types of skills that might be be needed,\" Christine Cruzvergara, chief education strategy officer at Handshake, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So it's critical for new graduates to make sure they are exposing themselves to AI and learning how to use it.\"",
      "Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, according to Handshake.",
      "Liya Palagashvili, a labor economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, told CBS MoneyWatch that jobs with low barriers to entry are being swallowed by AI. She points to a 2024\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at the University of Chicago, Columbia Business School, Purdue University, and Stanford Graduate School of Business showing that generative AI is weighing on hiring in occupations that require little education, knowledge or training.",
      "\"Any job requiring lower levels or skills or training, that's where we are seeing a reduction in hiring due to an exposure to generative AI,\" Palagashvili said.",
      "By contrast, the study found that, since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022, demand for workers in occupations requiring a higher level of knowledge and training has risen.",
      "\"So you're seeing a two-segmented market thing going on with ChatGPT having a positive effect on occupations with higher barriers to labor entry, and having a negative effect on occupations that have low barriers to entry,\" Palagashvili said. \"The latest empirical evidence shows hiring is down in low-skilled occupations, but high in those that require a\u00a0 higher skill level.\"",
      "New technologies have always shaped the labor market, snuffing out certain professions while breathing life into new sectors. One difference with the rise of AI that the technology excels at job functions typically associated with white-collar work.",
      "The acceleration of AI could push more young people into skilled trades that don't require a high-priced college education, Calidas said.",
      "\"Since the automation that began in the 1970s, a lot of manual jobs have gone away,\" he said. \"For a few generations, it's been an article of faith that white-collar jobs are more safe, whereas blue-collar work is more precarious. There's been a cultural push toward sending people to college, but it might make more sense to go into the trades.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's move to impose a 50% tariff on U.S. copper imports targets a vital metal that is widely used in many products and industries. That could lead to higher prices for everything from appliances and electronics to cars and home repairs, economists and industry experts said.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the copper duties late Wednesday on his Truth Social platform, saying they will take effect Aug 1.",
      "\"Copper is necessary for Semiconductors, Aircraft, Ships, Ammunition, Data Centers, Lithium-ion Batteries, Radar Systems, Missile Defense Systems, and even, Hypersonic Weapons, of which we are building many,\" he wrote. \"Copper is the second most used material by the Department of Defense! Why did our foolish (and SLEEPY!) 'Leaders' decimate this important Industry? This 50% TARIFF will reverse the Biden Administration's thoughtless behavior, and stupidity. America will, once again, build a DOMINANT Copper Industry.\"",
      "Price jump",
      "Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said copper is an integral component in electrical wiring and plumbing, as well being used as a heat conductor in radiators and household appliances. He worries that a hefty copper tariff will trigger inflation.",
      "Copper prices had already surged 13% on Tuesday, reaching a record high, after Mr. Trump floated the possible tariff.",
      "\"It's bad news all around,\" Young said of Mr. Trump's proposed copper tariff. \"If companies' costs go up they pass them along to consumers, so we'd see higher prices for home repairs and anything that uses copper.\"",
      "Copper tariffs could also make maintaining the nation's electric grid more expensive and drive up household energy costs, Young said. \"It would negatively affect the electricity industry and anybody who uses electricity.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that tariffs provide financial incentives to ramp up domestic production, including of critical materials like copper, and help create manufacturing jobs.",
      "\"America cannot be reliant on foreign imports of the copper that's necessary for key military hardware, infrastructure and everyday electronics,\" White House Spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The Trump administration is committed to reshoring manufacturing that's critical [to] our national and economic security with a two-pronged approach of tariffs and a full suite of supply-side reforms like deregulation and the pro-growth tax cuts of The One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Ripple effects",
      "The biggest users of copper \u2014 and therefore most exposed to the tariff increase \u2014 include a vast range of industries, covering everything from construction to semiconductors, electric vehicles and renewable energy components such as solar panels, according to industry data.",
      "Daan de Jonge, copper demand and prices lead analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said in a research note that \"a 50% price hike will have inevitable ripple effects on the cost of new infrastructure, the cost of housing the cost of fridges, cars, air conditioning.\"",
      "For consumers, that means the cost of appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners, as well as EVs, would likely rise if this 50% tariff goes into effect, according to analysts.",
      "\"Copper is an important element in development of semiconductors and electric vehicles. And the tariff announcement caused prices to go up quite dramatically, so you can tell it's a pretty big deal,\" Veronique de Rugy, a professor of political economy and senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The reason President Trump picked copper is because it's such a big deal for a lot of important things.\"",
      "Carveouts for key partners?",
      "The U.S. gets roughly two-thirds of its copper imports from Chile and Canada, with additional supply coming from Peru and Mexico.\u00a0 The U.S.'s net copper imports met 53% of U.S. demand for copper last year, according to Morgan Stanley research.",
      "Experts note that Mr. Trump isn't certain to hike duties on copper, saying his proposal could be aimed more at securing concession from exporters.",
      "\"These are two examples of countries that the U.S. could offer some sort of quota or export restraint relief to as part of a broader deal,\" UBS chief investment strategist Kurt Reiman told CBS MoneyWatch, referring to Canada and Chile. A revamped U.S. trade policy could also include carveouts for foreign copper suppliers, he added",
      "Although the U.S. could ramp up domestic copper production, it would take years to significantly increase output, Reiman said. \"We aren't ready. The mines would have to be built out, and that's typically a multi-year process.\"",

    "summary": "McDonald's is reviving its long-lamented Snack Wrap and leaning into affordable eats as it looks to reverse a rare sales slump.",
    "story": [
      "McDonald's is reviving fan favorites, spicing up its menu and emphasizing low-cost items to bring inflation-weary customers back to the Golden Arches.",
      "The world's largest restaurant chain recently announced it was bringing back the popular Snack Wrap, which makes its return to McD's outlets on July 10, along with a new, limited-time Spicy Egg McMuffin sandwich, which debuted on July 8. The refreshed menu comes as the company looks to boost sales as budget-conscious consumers pull back on spending.",
      "Same-store sales at McDonald's outlets in the U.S. declined 3.6% in the first quarter, the biggest drop since the COVID-19 pandemic closed stores nationwide. At the same time, traffic among low-income customers was down \"nearly double digits,\" CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's May earnings call, reflecting a customer base that the company acknowledged is still feeling the effects of inflation.",
      "McDonald's isn't the first fast-food chain to use promotions to drive business, but it has long been among the most adept at tweaking its menu and pricing, while its scale makes it a bellwether for customer tastes. In January, for example, it introduced\u00a0the McValue\u00a0menu, which includes the $5 meal deal, along with a \"buy one, add one for $1\" deal, as the company leaned into affordable offerings.",
      "McDonald's is reacting to a number of economic and competitive pressures, said Matthew Todd, a director at S&P Global Ratings. Chief among them is continuing to deliver value to low-income consumers in a time of economic uncertainty.",
      "\"This isn't anything new, but I think it's a continuation of this pursuit of regaining the consumers' trust,\" Todd said.",
      "Sara Senatore, a research analyst at the Bank of America, told CBS MoneyWatch that McDonald's move to expand its affordable offerings is an attempt to \"stay relevant\" with low-income consumers, who are \"under much greater pressure than other cohorts.\"",
      "Other fast-food chains and restaurants also have seen weaker sales as consumers battered by higher prices and the general cost of living look to save cash. For McDonald's, which has over 13,500\u00a0locations\u00a0nationwide, the difference now is it's not outperforming competitors as much as it once was, Senatore said.",
      "\"Their same-store sales versus their direct competitors have been much more similar than different,\" she said. \"Whereas, if you look at its long-term history, McDonald's has historically outpaced their competitors.\"",
      "McDonald's did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on the strategy behind its menu changes.",
      "Return of the Snack Wrap",
      "Perhaps the most highly anticipated new menu item is the Snack Wrap, which is returning to McDonald's establishments nationwide on this week after a nine-year hiatus. The wrap, which consists of a white-flour tortilla filled with chicken, shredded lettuce and cheese, was nixed in 2016, sparking a social media campaign by fans lobbying for its return.",
      "\"Given that they're looking for sales drivers, it makes sense that they would go to their archives, if you will,\" Senatore said.",
      "The revived Snack Wrap will come in two flavors \u2014 Ranch and Spicy \u2014 and will be priced at $2.99, according to a McDonald's spokesperson. The main protein will consist of chicken strips \u2014 easier to prepare, and thus less labor-intensive, than the type of chicken McD's previously used in the wrap, which required more cutting, Senatore explained.",
      "Reviving the Snack Wrap is a strategic decision on McDonald's part given the item's cult following. Customers went so far ast to start a Change.org petition garnering more than 19,000 signatures urging McDonald's to bring back the Snack Wrap.",
      "\"Bringing back a product that customers really want to have come back, you typically have higher rate of success,\" Senatore said.",
      "McDonald's is also introducing a new take on its classic Egg McMuffin, with a trio of limited-time breakfast sandwiches featuring spicy pepper sauce. The new items coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Egg McMuffin, a McDonald's staple that consists of egg, cheese and Canadian bacon on an English muffin.",
      "\"Limited-time offerings are always something in the toolkit for quick service restaurants to drive traffic,\" Todd said.",
      "Other menu tweaks include a new home for the Daily Double, one of McDonald's burger offerings. The Daily Double will now be part of the the McValue deal, where it will be bundled with fries, Chicken McNuggets, and a small soft drink for $6 or $7, depending on the location.",
      "McDonald's has also upped its chicken offerings. In May, the chain launched a new item called McCrispy Strips nationwide, the first time since 2021 McDonald's debuted a new permanent menu item in the U.S, according to a company\u00a0statement.",
      "Todd said McDonald's and other industry players are emphasizing chicken meals given its popularity and that it is significantly cheaper than beef, which rose to record prices in May.",
      "\"We've been seeing tons of chicken offerings, and just chicken... in general being very successful,\" he said.",

    "summary": "As of Tuesday, passengers at U.S. airports are no longer required to remove their shoes during the TSA screening process.",
    "story": [
      "The Transportation Security Administration's shoe rule expired on Monday, relieving fliers of the requirement to remove their footwear\u00a0while passing through security before boarding a plane.",
      "Speaking at a press briefing on Tuesday at Washington, D.C.'s Reagan National Airport, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that starting Tuesday, all passengers traveling through domestic airports can keep their shoes on while moving through TSA checkpoints.",
      "\"TSA will no longer require travelers to remove their shoes when they go through our security checkpoints,\" Noem said, adding that she expects travelers to be \"very excited\" at the policy change.",
      "Previously, only travelers enrolled in TSA PreCheck could keep their shoes on. The TSA on Monday did not issue a statement confirming the end of the policy, but sources familiar with the matter on Monday confirmed the change to CBS News.",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, an industry advocacy group, cheered the rule change. \"The days of removing your shoes at airport security checkpoints are finally behind us \u2014 and that's a win for all travelers,\" CEO Geoff Freeman said in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "\"Thanks to cutting-edge screening technology and strong decision-making, all travelers will now experience a more secure, seamless and efficient process at Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints. Keeping shoes on will reduce wait times and streamline air travel for all Americans,\" he added.",
      "Here's what to know about the status of the TSA's updated shoe policy.",
      "What is the \"shoes-off\" rule?",
      "The TSA screening policy, known informally as the \"shoes-off rule,\" was instituted in 2006 after British terrorist Richard Reid unsuccessfully tried to detonate homemade bombs hidden in his shoes during a December 2001 flight from Paris to Miami. The shoes he wore on the flight contained 10 ounces of explosive material, according\u00a0to an FBI account of the incident.",
      "The shoe-removal policy went into effect in August 2006. \"Based on intelligence pointing to a continuing threat, TSA requires passengers to remove shoes to screen for explosives,\" the TSA states on a policy timeline on its website.",
      "Under the policy, the TSA required passengers in standard screening lines to remove and place their shoes on X-ray belts, along with laptops, liquids, belts and outerwear.",
      "Passengers with TSA PreCheck benefits were exempt from the shoe removal requirement.",
      "Do I still have to take my shoes off?",
      "Not as long as TSA screeners are following the revised policy. As of Tuesday, the agency will no longer require passengers who move through TSA checkpoints to remove their shoes.",
      "That said, TSA officers may still flag some travelers for additional screening measures. \"Once in a while, someone will have to remove their shoes if they need additional layers of screening,\" Noem said Tuesday.",
      "On Monday, before the rule change was announced, some airports across the U.S. had already started phasing out the security measure and begun allowing fliers to move through security with their shoes on, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA worker who now runs Gate Access, a site about passenger rights, was the first to report on the policy shift, calling it \"one of the biggest changes to TSA screening in over a decade.\"",
      "\"It marks a huge shift in what the average traveler is used to going through TSA,\" he said.",
      "The revised shoes-on policy was already in effect at seven U.S. airports on Monday, according to CBS News sources. The first airports to ditch the security measure include Baltimore/Washington International Airport; Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport; Fort Lauderdale International Airport; Philadelphia International Airport; Piedmont Triad International Airport in North Carolina; and Portland International Airport.",
      "Some passengers at New York's LaGuardia Airport also reported being allowed to keep their shoes on Monday.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday re-posted a CBS News report on the rule change on social media, describing it as \"Big news from @DHSgov!\" .",
      "Will this mean shorter security lines?",
      "Harmon-Marshall of Gate Access told CBS MoneyWatch that he expects the policy change to result in shorter airport screening lines and an expedited security process for all passengers. In come cases, TSA officers could still ask passengers to remove their footwear.",
      "\"They still have that discretion,\" he said.",
      "For passengers, Harmon-Marshall expects screening time to \"drop significantly.\"",
      "\"Allowing passengers to keep their shoes on in the standard line will make going through TSA a breeze,\" he predicted.",
      "The revamped shoe policy could also have implications for TSA PreCheck, which costs around $80 for five years, Harmon added.",
      "\"TSA has to figure out what the value proposition of PreCheck is,\" he said. \"Allowing passengers to access screening with their shoes on diminishes its value, which leads me to believe there is another shakeup coming with TSA PreCheck.\"",
      "Noem on Tuesday said PreCheck status still offers advantages to pass holders because they're not required to take off their belts or remove liquids and electronics from their bags, unlike other passengers.",
      "\"I believe PreCheck will still be something many travelers will want to utilize,\" she said.",
      "She added that DHS will continue to evaluate all TSA screening procedures for efficiency. Homeland Security also plans to test new security lanes at TSA checkpoints over the next six to nine months that allow travelers to move through security even more quickly.",

    "summary": "As President Trump ramps up the pressure on dozens of countries, trade experts fear U.S. tariff policy leaves consumers and businesses in limbo.",
    "story": [
      "A flurry of tariff threats by President Trump leaves U.S. consumers and businesses in limbo ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline to deploy the import duties against more than 50 countries around the world, according to economists and trade experts.",
      "\"Nobody knows whether these are threats or whether they will become policy, so it seems like everyone has become desensitized to them,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that uncertainty over U.S. tariffs leaves companies in \"a very dense fog.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Saturday announced he is imposing 30% tariffs against Mexico and the 27-member European Union. That followed moves to threaten tariffs ranging from 20% to 50% on roughly two dozen countries, including key U.S. trading partners such as Brazil, Canada, Japan and South Korea.",
      "The White House last week also said it plans to impose a 50% levy on copper imports by Aug. 1, raising concerns about higher costs for electronics, cars and numerous other products that use the metal.",
      "Heat on Russia and Brazil",
      "In a separate development that illustrates the White House's willingness to use tariffs to accomplish its aims beyond trade, Mr. Trump is threatening sharply higher tariffs as he tries to tamp down conflict in Ukraine. The president said on Monday that the U.S. will impose 100% tariffs on countries that engage in trade with Russia if there is no peace deal to end the war in Ukraine within 50 days.",
      "In another case of hitching trade policy to other foreign policy priorities, Mr. Trump said last week that the U.S. would slap a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil next month, citing the criminal prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which Mr. Trump called an \"international disgrace.\"",
      "The Trump administration has defended its aggressive use of tariffs as a way to ensure fair trade for U.S. businesses; boost key domestic sectors; generate federal revenue; and advance other policy priorities, such as curbing fentanyl trafficking and authorized immigration from Canada and Mexico.",
      "According to\u00a0Reuters, customs duties in June surpassed $100 billion for the first time in a single fiscal year, a sign the stepped-up tariff regime is contributing more revenue.",
      "\"High uncertainty\"",
      "So far, the White House has notched only a handful of trade deals, experts note, while agreements with major trading partners like the EU have been harder to come buy. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump announced a pact between the U.S. and Vietnam, while in June a more limited deal was reached with the United Kingdom that the White House said provides gives \"American companies unprecedented access to British markets while bolstering U.S. national security.\"",
      "Also last month, the U.S. and China announced that they\u00a0had agreed on a framework for a trade deal that makes it easier for U.S. businesses to acquire Chinese magnets and rare earth minerals.",
      "But with little time to thrash out trade agreements ahead of the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, some trade experts say the U.S. has made little progress since suspending country-based tariffs in April.",
      "\"We don't have any comprehensive deals with our largest trading partners,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank. \"Where this leaves us is where we've been \u2014 in a period of high uncertainty for businesses and consumers.\"",
      "Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said mixed messages from the Trump administration on trade is making it difficult to nail down agreements.",
      "\"How do you negotiate with someone when you don't know what they want?\" he said. \"One day, [President Trump] says they are about trade deficits, the next day it's about raising revenue, the next it's about stimulating American industry \u2014 then it's a bargaining tool. His multiple goals conflict with one another.\"",
      "Demanding equal footing",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai said Mr. Trump's tariff agenda is driven in part by his desire for U.S. trade partners to lower both \"tariff and non-monetary trade barriers that are undermining American industries.\"",
      "Such moves by other nations would allow American industries to \"be on a more equal footing to compete and grow,\" Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's trade policies, tariffs have yet to significantly affect consumer prices in the U.S.",
      "Oxford's Daco said that the average U.S. tariff rate in June was around 15%, while the effective tariff rate -- or actual cost of tariffs on imports \u2014 was 10%. That's part of the reason, combined with a front-loading of imports by companies, why prices have been slow to rise.",
      "\"In terms of the full bite of tariffs, it's not yet visible in the duties collected,\" he said.",
      "Following are the tariff rates the U.S. said last week it would impose on roughly two dozen countries as well as members of the EU:",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's pick to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Mike Waltz, is set to testify Tuesday at his Senate confirmation hearing, the first time he'll publicly face questions from lawmakers about his role in a Signal chat in which top administration officials\u00a0inadvertently disclosed sensitive details about a military strike in Yemen.",
      "The Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m., and Democrats have said they expect it will be \"brutal\" for Waltz.",
      "The role \u2014 the last of Mr. Trump's Cabinet to be confirmed \u2014 has been vacant for six months, leaving the U.S. without a top representative on a major world stage as several international crises play out.",
      "If confirmed, Waltz would take the position as Mr. Trump's frustrations increase with Russia over its refusal to end its war in Ukraine and as the U.S. seeks to manage tensions with China and Iran.",
      "Waltz was ousted as Mr. Trump's national security adviser in May, weeks after the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, revealed that he had unexpectedly received a connection request on the encrypted messaging app from a user with Waltz's name. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared sensitive details of an upcoming military operation in the chat, which included others like Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "The story ricocheted through Washington, with Democratic lawmakers demanding an investigation into why highly sensitive information was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "Administration officials acknowledged the conversation was \"sensitive\" but denied that the operational details shared in the chat were classified. Waltz admitted that he created the chat, but denied knowing how Goldberg's contact information got into his phone.",
      "Sources previously told CBS News that Waltz's nomination for the ambassador role, a high-profile post in New York, was a last-minute decision by the president, and that the Signal controversy was one of the factors that led to his departure from the National Security Council.",
      "Mr. Trump named Waltz as his national security adviser, a position that does not require Senate confirmation, days after the Florida Republican was reelected to a fourth term in Congress. The pick cut into Republicans' narrow majority in the House and Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, pleaded with Mr. Trump not to poach any more members for administration roles.",
      "The slim majority stalled Mr. Trump's first choice for U.N. ambassador, Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York. When nominating Waltz, Mr. Trump said he had asked Stefanik to remain in Congress, where she could help advance his legislative agenda.",

    "summary": "Some senators have concerns as Congress faces a Friday deadline to act on the rescissions request.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate could move forward as soon as Tuesday on a request from the White House to claw back $9.4 billion in funds for international aid and public broadcasting as Congress faces a Friday deadline to act.",
      "In what's known as a rescissions package, the White House in June requested that Congress cancel billions in funding that had previously been approved for spending, starting the clock on a process that gives lawmakers 45 days to act.",
      "The move seeks to make permanent some of the Department of Government Efficiency's spending cuts, with the package's primary focus being slashing foreign aid. But it would also effectively cut off federal funding for NPR and PBS.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said he hoped to hold the first procedural votes Tuesday, though he was still having conversations with some members who are resistant to pulling back all of the funding.",
      "Last month, the House approved the request, overcoming opposition from all Democrats and four Republicans.",
      "The rescissions package",
      "The rescissions request would cut $8.3 billion for the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, along with other international assistance programs \u2014 from peacekeeping efforts to refugee assistance and climate projects. Also included in the package is a proposed $1.1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the private nonprofit that serves as the steward of the funding to NPR and PBS. The White House has targeted the entities, claiming they have \"spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\"",
      "But some Senate Republicans have opposed components of the package, like cuts to a program aimed at combating HIV and AIDS globally.",
      "Started by former President George W. Bush, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, has been credited for saving millions of lives around the world. Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, told reporters last week that she wants to strike the PEPFAR rescissions, saying, \"I can't imagine why we would want to terminate that program.\"",
      "Collins, the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, pushed back when Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought testified to the panel in June that \"no lifesaving treatment will be impacted by this rescissions package\" and that \"anyone currently receiving lifesaving treatment will continue to receive that treatment.\"",
      "\"When you look at PEPFAR, you are eliminating a lot of the prevention programs,\" Collins said, also questioning whether the package would harm efforts to prevent the spread of tuberculosis, polio and malaria and what effects it would have on maternal and child health programs that help feed malnourished children. \"Those are all programs that have been proven effective.\"",
      "\"These are not only the right thing to do for humanitarian reasons, but they're incredible instruments of soft power,\" Collins said.",
      "Others have raised concerns about cuts to local radio and television stations, especially in rural areas where they take on added significance as a means of communicating emergency messages.",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican who also sits on the Appropriations Committee, told reporters last week that he's not comfortable with some of the provisions like cuts to public broadcasting, saying, \"That's the reason why we're proposing changes.\"",
      "Rounds pointed to Native American tribes that have a public radio system that relies heavily on funding and would be targeted under the White House proposal, saying Senate Republicans have been working with the Office of Management and Budget to \"find a path forward where the funding for those radio stations would be left alone.\" He added that the goal is not to eliminate a number of the provisions within the rescissions package, but \"specifically to take care of those that were in some of these rural areas,\" pointing to stations in South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana and Alaska.",
      "Thune said Monday that there were ongoing discussions about an amendment process on the rescissions package.",
      "\"I'm hoping that as we get on that bill we can see some savings achieved that will complement the things we already accomplished in reconciliation,\" Thune said last week, referencing the massive tax and spending package that Congress approved earlier this month.",
      "Amending the package would mean the House would have to sign off on the changes. And with the Friday deadline, time is running out to do so before the request expires. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Monday he hopes the Senate sticks with the House-approved package.",
      "\"I think you've got to respect the White House's request, and that's what we did,\" Johnson said.",
      "In the Senate, rescissions bills are not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation, requiring only a simple majority. But with just 53 Republicans, Senate GOP leaders can only afford to lose a handful of their members to approve the package.",
      "President Trump weighed in on the rescissions push late last week, saying in a post on Truth Social that it's \"very important that all Republicans adhere to my Recissions Bill,\" citing the public broadcasting cuts in particular. The president warned that any Republican who doesn't support the clawback in funding \"will not have my support or Endorsement.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the rescissions push has sparked frustration among Democrats, who have little ability to stand in its way. But an upcoming spending fight is another story. Democrats have begun suggesting that the GOP effort to claw back already approved congressional funds could have an impact on their willingness to work across the aisle on government funding down the road.",
      "Each year, Congress approves funding to keep the federal government running before the funds are disbursed to government agencies and programs. The rescissions process allows Congress to cancel funds that the federal government has not yet spent.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned about the upcoming rescissions push in a letter to his colleagues upon the return from the Fourth of July recess, arguing that the package's passage \"would be an affront to the bipartisan appropriations process.\" The New York Democrat called it \"absurd\" for the GOP to expect Democrats to engage in a bipartisan appropriations process that could be undermined by rescissions.",
      "\"Republicans are, in effect, proposing Congress negotiate bipartisan deals in the Committee room, while they retreat to a backroom to rubberstamp President Trump's purely partisan scheme that only needs a simple majority to pass to tear up those very same agreements,\" Schumer wrote.",
      "In response, Thune said on the Senate floor last week that he was \"disappointed\" to see Schumer \"implicitly threaten to shut down the government,\" while adding that he's \"hopeful that that is not the position\" of Senate Democrats.",
      "When asked by reporters about the possibility of a shutdown, Schumer said, \"Ask the Republicans why they are heading on this path.\"",
      "\"We are doing everything we can to keep the bipartisan appropriations process going, and they're undermining it with rescissions,\" Schumer added.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Monday that the U.S. will impose 100% tariffs on countries that do business with Russia if there is no peace deal to end the war in Ukraine within 50 days, unveiling his plans to implement secondary sanctions as his frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin grows.",
      "\"We're going to be doing secondary tariffs if we don't have a deal within 50 days. It's very simple,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office, alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. \"And they'll be at 100%.\"",
      "\"We are very unhappy, I am, with Russia,\" the president explained.",
      "Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev brushed off Mr. Trump's threat Tuesday, saying on X, \"Trump issued a theatrical ultimatum to the Kremlin. The world shuddered, expecting the consequences.  Belligerent Europe was disappointed.  Russia didn't care.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said Monday the U.S. has reached a deal to sell weapons to NATO nations, and Rutte said those countries will in turn send weapons to Ukraine to replenish their depleted stockpiles. The Pentagon paused shipments of some weapons shipments to Ukraine earlier this month, but Mr. Trump reversed course last week, saying Ukraine must be able to defend itself.",
      "\"We've made a deal today where we're going to be sending them weapons and they're going to be paying for them,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"We, the United States, will not be having any payment made. We're not buying it, but we will manufacture it, and they're going to be paying for it.\"",
      "\"This is really big,\" said Rutte, who said Mr. Trump called him last week to inform him of his decision. \"And the decision is that you want Ukraine [to have] what it needs to have to maintain to be able to defend itself against Russia, but you want Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical.\"",
      "Mr. Trump \u00a0expressed frustration with Putin, following his multiple calls with the Russian leader since taking office in January.",
      "\"I always hang up, say, 'Well, that was a nice phone call.' And then missiles are launched into Kyiv or some other city and I say, 'That's strange.' And after that happens three or four times, you say, the talk doesn't mean anything,\" he said.",
      "\"He's \u2014 I don't want to say he's an assassin, but he's a tough guy,\" Mr. Trump said of Putin, adding that Putin has fooled other presidents, \"but he didn't fool me.\"",
      "\"Ultimately, talk doesn't talk, it's got to be action, it's got to be results,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "He voiced similar sentiments to CBS News partner network BBC News Tuesday, saying of Putin, \"We'll have a great conversation. I'll say: 'That's good, I'll think we're close to getting it done,' and then he'll knock down a building in Kyiv.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he'd thought a deal was close with Russia four different times.",
      "The BBC reports that, when asked if he was \"done with\" Putin, Mr. Trump replied: \"I'm disappointed in him, but I'm not done with him. But I'm disappointed in him.\"",
      "Zelenskyy posted on X Monday afternoon that he spoke with Mr. Trump, and thanked him and the U.S. for the \"willingness to support Ukraine.\"",
      "\"We discussed the necessary means and solutions with the president to provide better protection for people from Russian attacks and to strengthen our positions,\" Zelenskyy wrote. \"We are ready to work as productively as possible to achieve peace.\"",
      "Some in Congress have pushed for even higher secondary sanctions on Russia as the war grinds on. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal are pushing legislation in the Senate that would give the president the ability to impose tariffs of up to 500% on any country that does business with Russia. Graham told\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that these sanctions would give Mr. Trump a \"sledgehammer\" to end the war.",
      "In a joint statement Monday, Graham and Blumenthal said the president's announcement was \"a real executive hammer to drive the parties to the negotiating table.\"",
      "\"The goal is not more tariffs and sanctions \u2014 the goal is to entice Putin to come to the peace table,\" they said.",
      "The senators said they will continue their legislative work to implement up to 500% tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil and gas.",
      "Graham also told \"Face the Nation\" that the U.S. has \"given Ukraine a lot. We give them the money, we give them military aid.\" But he noted that there could be a \"plan where America will begin to sell to our European allies tremendous amounts of weapons that can benefit Ukraine.\"",
      "Republican Rep. French Hill, who spearheaded legislation during the Biden administration giving the president authority to seize foreign assets, said on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that now is the time to act.",

    "published": "Mon, 14 Jul 2025 23:41:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Fresh tomatoes from Mexico \u2014 which supplies about 70% of the U.S. tomato market \u2014 will face a 17.09% duty.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is imposing a 17% tariff on most fresh Mexican tomatoes, the federal government said Monday, ending a yearslong agreement with the U.S.' southern neighbor over trade practices.",
      "The move comes amid a separate push by President Trump to increase tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, including Mexico, which was told over the weekend to\u00a0expect 30% tariffs starting in August. Critics argue the president's tariff strategy could push up consumer prices. But Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said in a statement Monday that the decision on tomatoes is \"in line with President Trump's trade policies and approach with Mexico.\"",
      "\"Mexico remains one of our greatest allies, but for far too long our farmers have been crushed by unfair trade practices that undercut pricing on produce like tomatoes. That ends today,\" Lutnick said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The U.S. gets around 70% of its tomatoes from Mexico, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange. Roughly $3 billion worth of tomatoes are exported from Mexico to the U.S. every year, an almost threefold jump over the last 15 years, federal data shows.",
      "Supporters argue the tariffs could give a boost to the domestic tomato industry, which the Florida Tomato Exchange says has been \"decimated by an influx of cheap Mexican tomatoes.\" But others warn the move could lead to higher prices and harm U.S. companies that rely on imported tomatoes.",
      "The tariffs follow a complicated,\u00a0nearly three-decade-long dispute over allegations that Mexican tomato producers were illegally selling tomatoes to the U.S. at unfairly low prices, harming U.S. growers. The federal government\u00a0struck a deal\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 during Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 that averted \"anti-dumping\" duties on tomatoes in exchange for Mexican producers agreeing to a minimum sale price.",
      "In April, the Commerce Department announced the U.S. would exit that deal in 90 days, saying it \"has failed to protect U.S. tomato growers from unfairly priced Mexican imports.\" The Commerce Department said it would impose 20.91% tariffs \u2014 slightly higher than the 17.09% levies announced Monday.",
      "The Florida Tomato Exchange praised the move in a statement Monday. The group's executive vice president, Robert Guenther, called it \"an enormous victory for American tomato farmers and American agriculture.\"",
      "A group of lawmakers in Florida \u2014 which is one of the U.S.' largest tomato-producing states \u2014\u00a0praised the planned duties\u00a0in a letter to Lutnick last month. Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, called the move \"a major victory for American growers and producers.\"",
      "But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged Lutnick not to exit the deal on Friday, arguing the Trump administration should try to cut a new deal with Mexico instead. The group said \"the import and sale of Mexican tomatoes generate an estimated $8.3 billion in economic benefits,\" and warned withdrawing from the deal could trigger retaliation from Mexico.",
      "\"Terminating the Agreement would likely have widespread repercussions on the U.S. economy, affecting agriculture, warehousing, logistics, grocery, and restaurant industries,\" the group said in a letter to Lutnick.",
      "The lead-up to Monday's decision also drew criticism from some Democrats.",
      "\"ARIZONA, BUY YOUR TOMATOES NOW!!\" Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, wrote on X last week. \"Groceries are already too expensive. [Mr. Trump] needs to reverse this decision now.\"",
      "\"Salsa will be pricier, shelves emptier, and groceries more expensive. Tens of thousands of jobs, including 30,000 Texans, will be at risk,\" Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas Democrat,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Mexico's agriculture and economy ministries criticized the move in a statement Monday, saying it was \"unfair and against the interests not only of Mexican producers but also of the U.S. industry.\" They also said the massive growth in tomato exports to the U.S. \"stems from the quality of the product, not from any unfair practices.\" The Mexican government said it expected to find a solution to the dispute.",
      "Mr. Trump has sent letters to dozens of U.S. trading partners over the last week threatening higher tariffs starting August 1, partially reinstating some of the steep country-by-country levies that were rolled out by the Trump administration in April, but quickly delayed for 90 days. The president argues the tariffs are necessary to protect domestic jobs and correct unfair trade practices, but many economists argue tariffs can lead to sluggish economic growth and higher prices.",
      "Food prices grew 2.9% in the 12-month period ending in May \u2014 higher than the country's overall 2.4% inflation rate, but well below mid-2022, when food prices were growing upwards of 10% year-over-year, according to federal data. The price of tomatoes fell 6.8% from May 2024 to May 2025.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers last month he expects tariffs to have some impact on prices. But he added: \"We really don't know how much of that's going to be passed through the consumer. We have to wait and see.\"",

    "story": [
      "An appeals court temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking deportation protections and work permits for thousands of people from Afghanistan.",
      "The administration had planned to end temporary protected status for Afghanistan on Monday, part of a broader push to cut back a program that gives migrants reprieve from deportation if their home country is deemed unsafe. The administration argues those protections aren't meant to be permanent and Afghanistan's security situation has improved, though opponents say the country remains unsafe and revocation would force people to uproot their lives.",
      "But in a late-night ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit blocked the administration from putting into place its withdrawal of temporary protected status for one week. The court's administrative stay didn't weigh in on the merits of the case, instead giving the administration and CASA \u2014 a group that sued the government over its policy \u2014 time to file briefs.",
      "CASA's national communications director Jossie Flor Sapunar told CBS News that, although the ruling is temporary, \"every moment counts when it comes to families figuring out their futures.\"",
      "AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that has helped relocate Afghans, told CBS News the ruling \"offers a brief but critical window of relief.\"",
      "\"TPS has been a vital lifeline for tens of thousands of Afghans who supported U.S. missions or fled Taliban persecution. Ending it would not only uproot families and destabilize communities, it would betray a promise we made,\" AfghanEvac President Shawn VanDiver said in an email. \"We are heartened by the court's stay, but this isn't a victory\u2014it's a pause. And it underscores the need for permanent protections, not political whiplash every few months.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House and Department of Homeland Security for comment.",
      "Some 11,700 Afghans are enrolled in temporary protected status, or TPS, according to federal estimates. The program was extended for Afghanistan in 2023, under the Biden administration, which cited a \"deepening humanitarian crisis\" and \"economic collapse\" in Afghanistan since the U.S. military's 2021 withdrawal led the Taliban to retake the country.",
      "The program is separate from the more permanent \"special immigrant visas\" issued to Afghans who worked for the U.S. military, often as translators.",
      "TPS for Afghanistan was set to expire in May of this year unless the Trump administration chose to extend it again. Two months ago, DHS announced it would end the program in mid-July, saying the administration was \"returning TPS to its original temporary intent.\"",
      "\"Afghanistan has had an improved security situation, and its stabilizing economy no longer prevent[s] them from returning to their home country,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said.",
      "CASA sued Noem over the decision. The group argued the government had not followed the right procedure to end TPS, and alleged the decision wasn't motivated by whether Afghans still qualified for protection, but instead was \"part of the Trump Administration's broader effort to reduce the number of nonwhite immigrants in this country.\"",
      "The government pushed back on the lawsuit, writing that Noem has \"broad discretion\" over which countries qualify for TPS, and arguing the court shouldn't intervene because the protections are only meant to be temporary.",
      "Last week, a federal judge denied DHS's request to dismiss the lawsuit, but also denied CASA's motion to halt the administration's policy. CASA appealed that ruling, and on Monday, an appellate court put the revocation of TPS on hold while it considers the case.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to wind down TPS for scores of other countries, impacting hundreds of thousands of migrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Haiti, Cameroon and Afghanistan. The program had been expanded by former President Joe Biden, but President Trump has shifted to a more hardline stance on immigration.",
      "The TPS rollback has drawn some lawsuits, but in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end TPS for Venezuelan migrants while the legal battles continue.",

Michael Gordon, who also handled a series of U.S. Capitol riot prosecutions, was among several prosecutors fired in recent weeks, CBS News has learned. Gordon had recently taken over formal duties for prosecuting Govoni's case in Florida.",
      "Critics have accused the Trump administration of seeking political retribution for the U.S. Capitol insurrection cases by firing prosecutors, investigators and at least one administrator who worked on the cases. The Justice Department also fired investigators and prosecutors who helped former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigation of President Trump's alleged mishandling of classified records and efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "More than 20 total firings have been confirmed by CBS News. The Justice Department has not commented on the firings.",

      "\"It took long enough to get him arrested. People have been through a lot and don't want any more delays,\" Bowman said.",
      "Govoni was charged with conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, money laundering conspiracy and multiple counts of fraud. He has not yet entered a plea, and an arraignment is scheduled for Thursday. Govoni's lawyers asked for him to be released pre-trial, noting he has \"no prior criminal history\" and describing him as a \"67-year-old in poor physical health.\" CBS News has reached out to his attorney for comment.",
      "An accountant for Govoni's company was also charged as part of the alleged conspiracy, and a not-guilty plea was entered in his case.",
      "Prosecutors said Govoni founded the Center for Special Needs Trust Administration in 2000 and helped manage approximately $200 million in funds and more than 2,000 special needs trusts.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Govoni used the organization's accounts as a \"slush fund.\" Federal investigators said Govoni used the money to \"purchase real estate, travel via private jet, fund a brewery, make deposits into his personal bank accounts, and pay personal debts.\"",
      "In a series of letters filed with the federal court in Tampa last month, one parent of a person with special needs wrote, \"I wish you could look into the eyes of my son and the many other medically needy victims and tell them that you're going to do the right thing and keep that man behind bars where he belongs.\"",

      "Gordon is listed in court records as a Tampa-based prosecutor for the Justice Department. Like many federal prosecutors, he brought cases related to the Jan. 6 riots \u2014 which was the largest criminal investigation in U.S. history, with more than 1,500 defendants. Hours after Mr. Trump returned to office in January, he pardoned almost everybody convicted in the riot and ordered the Justice Department to drop charges against any remaining defendants.",
      "Gordon had a role in prosecuting one of the best-known Jan. 6 defendants, Ray Epps, who was at the center of conspiracy theories claiming \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 he was a government-planted agitator.

      "The high court granted a request from the Trump administration to lift for now the injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Myong Joun, which blocked the mass layoffs at the Education Department. A federal appeals court rejected a bid to pause that decision while the Justice Department appealed, after which it sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "The decision to lift the stay was 6 to 3, with the majority saying the lower court's injunction would be paused while the case works its way through the appeals process.",

Rather than maintain the status quo, however, this Court now intervenes, lifting the injunction and permitting the Government to proceed with dismantling the Department.

      "Mr. Trump has overseen a sweeping effort to slash the size of the federal government since returning to the White House earlier this year. His administration has sought to conduct mass layoffs across the executive branch, and in March, the president signed an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to facilitate her agency's closure \"to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law.\"",
      "As part of the plan to dismantle the Department of Education, the Trump administration canceled a slew of grants and implemented a reduction-in-force that impacted 1,378 employees \u2014 roughly one-third of the agency's workforce. Those who were laid-off were placed on administrative leave in March, with their government service set to end June 9.",
      "A group of 21 Democratic attorneys general, teachers unions and the Somerville and Easthampton school districts sued the Trump administration, arguing that the president and McMahon are unlawfully attempting to reorganize the Department of Education without authorization from Congress.",
      "Joun found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims that the Trump administration's actions were unlawful and said it is \"effectively disabling the department from carrying out its statutory duties by firing half of its staff, transferring key programs out of the department, and eliminating entire offices and programs.\"",
      "The judge said that the reduction-in-force implemented by McMahon would \"likely cripple the department,\" and blocked the secretary from carrying out the layoffs or transferring certain functions from the Education Department.",
      "In last month's emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the layoffs at the Department of Education are part of the administration's \"policy of streamlining the department and eliminating discretionary functions that, in the administration's view, are better left to the states.\"",

    "story": [
      "Democratic officials from 24 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration on Monday seeking to restore access to billions of dollars in frozen education funding.",
      "The states lost out on funding for after-school and summer programs, teacher training, English language learners and support for the children of migrant farmworkers, among and other initiatives, as part of the June 30 freeze on more than $6 billion that the states say was allocated by Congress.",
      "The states were notified by email from the Education Department on June 30 that the funds, which had been expected the next day, were being held for a \"review\" geared toward \"ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities.\"",
      "The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities.",
      "In a complaint in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, lawyers for the states said the decision to freeze the funds had caused \"chaos.\" The suit named as defendants Education Secretary Linda McMahon, President Trump and Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget.",
      "\"States already have planned for the upcoming academic year \u2014 which is set to start in weeks in many areas \u2014 in reliance on the billions of dollars that are now frozen,\" they wrote. \"The budgets for many local educational agencies (LEAs) have already been approved and staffing plans have been developed so that LEAs can perform their responsibilities for the impacted programs.\"",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a press release that the funding freeze was done \"with no rhyme or reason.\" His office said the freeze is blocking $939 million in funding for California alone.",
      "\"Taken together with his other attacks on education, President Trump seems comfortable risking the academic success of a generation to further his own misguided political agenda,\" Bonta said. \"But as with so many of his other actions, this funding freeze is blatantly illegal, and we're confident the court will agree.\"",
      "The latest legal fight between Democratic state officials and the federal government comes as Mr. Trump has promised to dismantle the federal Department of Education, an ambition supported by McMahon. A federal judge in Massachusetts blocked an executive order to unwind the department in May.",
      "The Education Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "The states joining Monday's legal action are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.",

      "The Pentagon has signed on to use Grok, the AI chatbot built by Elon Musk's company xAI, as part of a new $200 million agreement that opens the door for its deployment across the federal government, the company announced Monday.",
      "The announcement comes amid Musk's public breakup with President Trump and days after Grok generated antisemitic responses and praised Adolf Hitler.",
      "The rollout is part of \"Grok for Government,\" a newly launched suite of tools designed for use by federal agencies, local governments, and national security operations. xAI said its products, including its latest Grok 4 model, will now be available for purchase through the General Services Administration (GSA), allowing any federal office to adopt the technology.",
      "The move aligns with the Trump administration's push for more aggressive adoption of artificial intelligence across the government. Since taking office in January, Mr. Trump has championed AI as a pillar of national security and innovation.",
      "Musk himself briefly served in the Trump administration earlier this year, overseeing the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, before stepping down in May amid a public break with Mr. Trump over his sweeping tax and spending bill. Musk has since emerged as a sharp critic of that legislation, even floating the idea of launching a third political party.",
      "Despite the rift, xAI has continued to expand its government work. The new offering includes custom national security tools, AI-powered science and health applications, and cleared engineering support for classified environments.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok generated antisemitic responses to user prompts and referenced Hitler  as part of what the company called an effort to make the model \"less politically correct.\" Hours later, Musk wrote in a post on X that \"Grok was too compliant to user prompts. Too eager to please and be manipulated, essentially. That is being addressed.\"",
      "The posts were later deleted and xAI said it \"quickly\" patched the issue. One day later, xAI launched an upgraded version of Grok it described as a major leap forward. Musk also announced that Grok would be used in Teslas.",
      "But the latest version was not without kinks, too: Grok checked with Musk's views before answering a question, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Grok was introduced in late 2023 as a more unfiltered alternative to other chatbots like ChatGPT, and is already integrated into Musk's social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.",

Ron DeSantis' administration to be allowed in. On Saturday, protesters lined the streets as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle arrived at the site.",
      "\"We saw people, of course, yelling for help,\" said Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost. \"We even saw someone yelling in the background, 'I'm an American citizen.'\"",
      "After touring the facility for several hours, Florida Democrats said that the food portions were smaller for detainees than for the staff, and while they didn't get to meet any of the detainees, they said the conditions they saw were \"appalling.\" Democratic lawmakers said they couldn't take pictures or bring their phones inside. Authorities have also denied media access to the detention center.",
      "\"I brought a thermostat in with me \u2014   a manual thermostat,\" said Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who called the facility \"an internment camp\" in a post on social media. \"In the medical area, it was 85 degrees.\"",
      "Detainees said they've went days without showering or getting prescription medicine, and at times the air conditioners would abruptly shut off in the sweltering heat.",
      "Officials have disputed such descriptions of the conditions at the detention center, with spokesperson Stephanie Hartman of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, which built the center, saying: \"The reporting on the conditions in the facility is completely false. The facility meets all required standards and is in good working order.\"",
      "\"Water has to be trucked into this facility \u2014   no working pipes,\" Democratic Rep. Darren Soto said Saturday. \"It makes no sense [that] this is here.\"",

    "story": [
      "European markets mostly fell Monday as investors digested President Trump's latest trade war salvos, which saw him threaten to hit the European Union and Mexico with 30% tariffs starting on August 1. Mr. Trump's threat came after a series of announcements last week that included warnings of a possible 50% levy on all copper imports and all goods from Brazil, 35% levies on Canadian goods, and a possible 200% tariff on imported pharmaceuticals.",
      "In announcing his latest intentions on Saturday, Mr. Trump cited Mexico's role in illicit drugs flowing into the United States and a trade imbalance with the European Union.",
      "The move threw months of painstaking talks with Brussels into disarray.",
      "European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has insisted the EU still wants to reach an accord with the U.S. On Sunday, the bloc delayed its planned retaliation for separate U.S. duties on steel and aluminum. EU officials had threatened in May to impose tariffs on U.S. goods worth around $117 billion, including cars and planes, if talks fail, from July 14.",
      "Von der Leyen said Sunday that Mr. Trump's letter showed \"that we have until the first of August\" to negotiate.",
      "\"We have always been clear that we prefer a negotiated solution,\" von der Leyen said, adding: \"We will continue to prepare countermeasures so we are fully prepared.\"",
      "In April, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on dozens of countries, quickly pausing them for three months to negotiate deals. As that 90 day period ended this week, Mr. Trump started sending tariff letters to leaders, but he pushed back the date of implementation of the threatened levies until August, The Associated Press reported.",
      "The EU's trade chief, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, said he planned to speak with his U.S. counterparts on Monday.",
      "\"I'm absolutely 100% sure that a negotiated solution is much better than the tension which we might have after the 1st of August,\" \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told journalists in Brussels. \"I cannot imagine walking away without genuine effort. Having said that, the current uncertainty caused by unjustified tariffs cannot persist indefinitely and therefore we must prepare for all outcomes, including, if necessary, well-considered proportionate countermeasures to restore the balance in our transit static relationship.\"",
      "He noted that the EU was also \"doubling down on efforts to open new markets\" beyond the United States.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron backed efforts to reach an agreement that \"reflects the respect that trade partners such as the European Union and the United States owe each other,\" but he urged the bloc to \"step up the preparation of credible countermeasures\" in the event the two sides fail to reach an agreement.",
      "Shares fell in Frankfurt and Paris, though London saw prices tick higher.",
      "In Asia, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seoul, Singapore, Manila, Bangkok and Jakarta all rose, while Tokyo, Sydney, Taipei, Mumbai and Wellington edged down.",

      "\"It is hard to say whether the muted market response over the week is best characterised by resilience or complacency,\" National Australia Bank's Taylor Nugent said. \"But it is difficult to price the array of headlines purportedly defining where tariffs will sit from 1 August when negotiations are ongoing.\"",
      "Data showed Chinese exports jumped more than expected in June after Washington and Beijing agreed a tentative deal to lower levies on each other. That included a 32.4% surge in shipments to the U.S., which had dropped in May.",
      "Traders were also keeping a nervous eye on the Federal Reserve as Mr. Trump continued to berate boss Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates soon enough, saying Sunday \"I hope he quits,\" and \"he should quit.\"",

      "CBS News reached out to the White House for additional comment.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham confirmed on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal will be meeting with Rutte on Monday.",
      "\"A turning point regarding Russia's invasion of Ukraine is coming,\" Graham said.",
      "While NATO's statement did not state a reason for Rutte's trip, it comes after Mr. Trump teased last week that he would make a \"major statement\" on Russia on Monday, as Ukraine struggles to repel massive and complex air assaults launched by Russian forces.",
      "The president also hinted that his administration will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine amid its war with Russia, days after\u00a0pausing\u00a0some weapons shipments.",
      "\"We're going to send some more weapons. We have to. They have to be able to defend themselves,\" Mr. Trump told reporters during a White House event with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday night.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday the U.S. would be sending more Patriot missiles to Ukraine, but that he hadn't yet\u00a0decided how many.",
      "Graham said on \"Face the Nation\" to \"stay tuned for a plan where America will begin to sell to our European allies tremendous amounts of weapons that can benefit Ukraine.\"",
      "\"The idea of America selling weapons to help Ukraine is very much in play,\" Graham said. \"We've given Ukraine a lot. We give them the money, we give them military aid. We now have a minerals agreement with Ukraine that's worth trillions of dollars. So, I don't want to get ahead of the President, but stay tuned about seized assets. The Europeans want to limit the interest on the assets to go to Ukraine.\"",
      "Rubio said Friday that some of the U.S.-made weapons that Ukraine is seeking are deployed with NATO allies in Europe. Those weapons could be transferred to Ukraine, with European countries buying replacements from the U.S., he said.",
      "\"It's a lot faster to move something, for example, from Germany to Ukraine than it is to order it from a (U.S.) factory and get it there,\" Rubio told reporters last week during a visit to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",
      "Mr. Trump is also facing calls from Republicans and Democrats, as well as European allies, to support legislation in the Senate that aims to cripple Russia's oil industry and hit Moscow with U.S. sanctions for its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The legislation, in part, calls for a 500% tariff on goods imported from countries that continue to buy Russian oil, gas, uranium and other exports. It would have an enormous impact on economic behemoths China and India, which account for roughly 70% of Russia's energy trade.",
      "Graham said he and Blumenthal have support for \"congressional sanctions with a sledgehammer\" that will \"go after\" Russian President Vladimir Putin's economy and \"all those countries who prop up the Putin war machine.\"",
      "\"This congressional package that we're looking at would give President Trump the ability to impose 500% tariffs on any country that helps Russia, and props up Putin's war machine,\" Graham said. \"He can dial it up or down. He can go to 0%, to 500%. He has maximum flexibility. But we're going after the people who keep Putin in business and additional sanctions on Russia itself. This is truly a sledgehammer available to President Trump to end this war.\"",
      "Blumenthal said this is a \"critical moment\" for these sanctions and \"bringing down this sledgehammer at this moment was emphasized by all of the European allies who were at the meeting that Sen. Graham and I attended in Europe.\"",
      "Elsewhere, multiple diplomatic sources told CBS News that Mr. Trump is considering authorizing fresh funding for Ukraine for the first time since he took office in January.",
      "The sources indicated the new funding could be intended to send a message to Russia. U.S. officials told CBS News Mr. Trump has $3.85 billion in leftover Biden-era presidential drawdown authority sitting at his fingertips, which could be used to send American military equipment to Ukraine. Former officials also told CBS News the president\u00a0has the authority to seize\u00a0around $5 billion in foreign Russian assets and direct the funds to Ukraine, though neither he nor former President Joe Biden has used that power.",
      "Congress has been prepared to act on the legislation, sponsored by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democrat Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, for some time.",
      "The bill has overwhelming support in the Senate, but Republican leadership has been waiting for Trump to give the green light before moving ahead with it. The White House had expressed some reservations about the legislation.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. French Hill, Republican of Arkansas, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 13, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Congressman French Hill. He is the chair of the House Financial Services Committee. Welcome back to the broadcast. Your ears must have been ringing with the two senators who started the program, because they were talking about grabbing some of those frozen Russian assets. You moved a bill and gave the president authority to actually seize them during the last administration, under the REPO Act. The U.S. has never before seized central bank assets from another country. Do you know if the Treasury Department is going to do so now?",
      "REP. FRENCH HILL: Well, Margaret, it's good to be with you. Yes, I certainly worked very hard with former Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul and others to put that in our 2024 national security package during the Biden administration, because we wanted another arrow in the quiver for the president to not just seize those assets, but to convert them to the benefit of Ukraine. But we could never get consensus between the United States and Europe for doing that, despite a unanimous vote of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe supporting it. So I continued to urge President Biden to do that. We got the interest off those frozen assets to benefit Ukraine, but I think it's time for the president to convert those seized assets to a trust account for the benefit of Ukraine. I'm glad to hear both Senators Blumenthal and Graham support that idea. It's time to do it, and I've encouraged Secretary Bessent that this should be a priority for President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On another topic, because you have some oversight in the financial space, I want to ask you about comments made in regard to Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The president says the economy is in good shape, but he still complains about the head of the central bank, says he's doing a terrible job because he's not lowering interest rates. On another network today, the president's top economic adviser said the White House is looking into whether the president has the authority to fire Chair Powell. Do you believe the president has the power and authority to fire the Fed president?",
      "REP. HILL: You know, Margaret, I don't, and I believe President Trump has spoken about this several times over the past few years, including recently. Mr. Powell's governorship, his chairmanship, is up next spring. The president has vacancies coming up on the Fed board, where he could name another governor. But look, just because Congress created the Fed and that we believe that it should be independent in the setting of monetary policy, it doesn't mean that it's immune from criticism. And every president since World War Two has had choice words for the Fed chair when they've not been in sync with the direction of the president. So look, the Congress continues to do oversight. I set up a special task force to oversee the Fed's decision making since the 2008 financial crisis. We have that investigation, review, and oversight underway, and we'll continue it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you'd acknowledge that most presidents might have those choice words behind closed doors, not on social media posts on a regular basis, Congressman. But on crypto, I want to ask you. Crypto has been the Wild West, right, in many ways, because they don't have the same kind of regulation in the digital asset space that there does exist for banks and financial services. You've got a few measures coming up this week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you make sure, as you put these regulations in place that kind of help crypto become more mainstream, that it doesn't also benefit some of those on the black market, for example, who use this to evade oversight?",
      "REP. HILL: Exactly. Well, in the work in the Senate led by Bill Hagerty and Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis on the GENIUS Act to create a dollar-backed stablecoin, we've heavily influenced that legislation over the two years of previous work by the House and our Clarity Act, which sets up the rules of the road for what's a commodity, what's a security, how to use digital assets, how to store them, how to custody them. These are the rules that will protect consumers, will limit access to our market and our investors from entities outside the United States trying to influence the crypto markets. We have none of that today. What we've had is a mismatch of rules by enforcement in the Biden administration, and I believe the bills we'll have on the House floor this week will protect investors, consumers, and make America, as President Trump wants, a leader in financial technology and crypto and digital assets innovation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, sir, that the concern is that this is the patina of protection of consumers without actual muscle behind it. It was interesting to see, and many Americans who hold mortgages might have noticed, that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy and sell mortgages, that the head of the agency, the Federal Housing Agency, Bill Pulte, told them they'll have to prepare a proposal to review crypto as an asset on mortgage applications.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Given the huge taxpayer stake in Fannie, Freddie, are you comfortable with people using crypto, something that isn't really, you know, tangible in many ways, to pay for a down payment on a house?",

One can hold it in their brokerage account through an exchange-traded product, an ETF, ETP. It's now an asset for millions of Americans, and it certainly could be treated like a stock or a bond or cash as a contribution to someone's net worth to qualify for a mortgage. And if we pass Clarity this week, which I expect we will on a bipartisan basis, and we craft a dollar-backed stablecoin like GENIUS offered by Senator Hagerty, we'll have the rules of the road. It won't be a patina of consumer enforcement. It will be real consumer enforcement, investor protection--",

You can determine if you think it's going to go up in value or down in value, just like stocks and bonds or other investments that people have on their financial statement to secure their financial statement for a net- for net worth purposes or to liquidate for a down payment.

    "story": [
      "Sen. Maria Cantwell said Sunday the federal government must take responsibility for investigating the breakdown in flood warnings during the recent deadly storms in Texas, calling it a \"national responsibility\" to improve forecasting systems and prevent future disasters.",
      "\"It's not community to community. It's a national system,\" said Cantwell on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"And we share that with local people to help them best respond.\"",
      "Since the July 4 flash floods in Kerr County, Texas, officials have confirmed at least 129 people are dead and more than 170 remain missing as of Sunday morning. Over the weekend, search and recovery efforts were temporarily halted for the first time due to new flood threats, as additional rain and rising water levels prompted fresh warnings from the National Weather Service.",
      "The Washington Democrat, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, said Sunday that she plans to send a letter to President Trump outlining bipartisan recommendations to upgrade the country's forecasting infrastructure. Among them are improvements to Doppler radar, increased use of ocean buoys to track sea temperatures, and enhanced data analytics and computing power for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
      "\"What the real question is, is what can we do to improve the weather forecasting of this nation,\" Cantwell said. \"To use science, to use better assets, to really do a once in a lifetime investment to upgrade the system.\"",
      "She pointed to more accurate tornado forecasts in the Midwest \u2013 where residents received two hours of warning \u2013 as evidence that federal investment in weather science can save lives.",
      "\"We should be the smartest government in the world using technology, analyzing the data, and putting a forecast system into place that gives people that kind of system,\" she said.",
      "The senator also warned against proposed budget cuts and privatization efforts under the Trump administration, which she said could undermine NOAA's mission. During the Texas floods, key forecasting and IT positions at the National Weather Service were unfulfilled, according to the union that represents NWS staffers. The vacancies raise questions about whether staffing shortages may have contributed to delays in emergency alerts.",
      "But Cantwell said \"it's a miniscule amount of money\" compared to the cost of disaster recovery, and she added\u00a0 that small businesses and first responders rely on government-issued alerts.",
      "Cantwell said she hasn't decided whether she will vote to confirm NOAA administrator nominee Dr. Neil Jacobs. The senator said she was pleased in a Senate hearing this week that Jacobs made \"some very positive\" commitments about supporting the Organic Act, which is aimed at establishing the NOAA as an independent agency. Before making a decision, Cantwell said she wants to \"drill down\" on Jacobs' thoughts about how to preserve the science mission amid increased spending on storms.",

    "published": "Sun, 13 Jul 2025 10:45:51 -0400",
    "summary": "Barbara Rae-Venter never anticipated that her genealogy hobby would lead to the capture of one of California's most notorious criminals, the Golden State Killer. Her pioneering use of genetic genealogy has since helped solve numerous cold cases.",
    "story": [
      "Barbara Rae-Venter, a 76-year-old patent attorney living in Marina, California, thought she'd spend her retirement leisurely playing tennis, traveling, and indulging in her favorite pastime: researching her ancestry and building a family tree. It didn't quite work out that way. For Rae-Venter, something she started as a hobby led to capturing one of the most notorious criminals in California.",
      "Seven years ago, Rae-Venter, using her genetic research skills, tracked down a fugitive in California who had eluded capture for more than three decades, and remarkably, she did it without ever leaving her home.",
      "The fugitive was the Golden State Killer. In April 2018, the FBI and California law enforcement made headlines with a stunning announcement: \"We found the needle in the haystack, and it was right here in Sacramento.\"",
      "Since 1974, investigators had sought the man responsible for at least 13 murders and more than 50 rapes in the state of California. But it wasn't until Rae-Venter joined the investigation that they learned his name: Joseph James DeAngelo. \"It's not that I'm so very special,\" said Rae-Venter. \"It's just I happened to be in the right place at the right time.\"",
      "Using DNA left by DeAngelo at a crime scene, Rae-Venter identified him by using a technique now known as investigative genetic genealogy. \"It's just basically doing the same as you would do if you're doing family history research, and augmenting that with DNA to make sure that the relatives that you find are really related to you,\" she said.",
      "Her crime-solving career began quite by accident. Rae-Venter, who also has a Ph.D. in biology, was volunteering as a search angel \u2013 a person who helps adoptees find their biological parents. \"It's such a fundamental desire,\" she said. \"They're just so focused. They just so want to know where they came from.\"",
      "A Living Jane Doe",
      "In 2015, Rae-Venter responded to an email sent by Peter Headley, then a veteran investigator with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, and fell into her first mystery. Headley was trying to uncover the true identity of a woman in her 30s who had been kidnapped as a child. \"She really wanted to know who she was,\" said Headley, referring to her as a living Jane Doe. \"She's alive, but we have no idea who she is,\" he said.",
      "That living \"Jane Doe\" went by the name of Lisa Jenson. At five years old, she had been abandoned at an RV park by a man called Gordon Jenson. \"It turned out she had been kidnapped by the suspect, and he just told everyone that he was her father,\" Headley said.",
      "Later, detectives learned that Gordon Jenson was just one of many aliases used by Terry Rasmussen, a notorious serial killer, who died in prison in 2010 without ever revealing who Lisa really was.",
      "Lisa Jenson did not know who her mother was, or if she had any sisters or brothers. Headley said that Lisa had heard about genetic genealogy and wondered if that could lead her to her real family: \"I said, 'Okay, let's try it.' So, opened an account for her, got her in Ancestry, and we had some distant matches, and I'm like, this might just work.\"",
      "But this was new territory for Headley, so he emailed DNA Adoption for help and found Barbara Rae-Venter. Asked why she agreed to collaborate, Rae-Venter replied, \"It was a puzzle!\"",
      "She began the laborious process of building family trees to find Lisa's real family, which involved more than just looking at DNA: \"The DNA is just the jump-off point. You're doing census records, you're doing birth, death and marriage records. My favorite is probably Facebook. I've actually built trees from the amount of stuff people have put in their Facebook pages.\"",
      "Headley helped by coaxing distant relatives to take DNA tests. \"People were skeptical, thought it was a scam,\" he said. \"One lady thought I was going to clone her.\"",
      "And DNA tests are expensive. Headley and Rae-Venter reached into their own pockets to help subsidize the costs.",
      "I asked, \"So, you're not only not getting paid to do this work, you're actually paying for these tests?\"",
      "\"We probably each spent a couple of thousand dollars on kits,\" Rae-Venter said.",
      "It took nearly a year, but in 2016, the DNA trail led to New Hampshire, and the case of a missing young mother, Denise Beaudin. She and her infant daughter had vanished from her home, along with a man named Bob Evans, which turned out to be yet another alias of that serial killer, Terry Rasmussen",
      "Investigators believe Rasmussen killed Denise and kidnapped her little girl. For the first time, Lisa Jenson was about to learn her real name: Dawn Beaudin.",
      "Headley said, \"I called Lisa up and I asked her if she wanted to know her real name, we had figured it out. And she just got real quiet, and very quietly said yes.\"",
      "Lisa has asked for privacy, but, in a phone call told Rae-Venter that she could finally move on in her life, including getting married.",
      "\"She just said it didn't feel right when she didn't really know who she was or where she'd come from,\" said Rae-Venter. \"And now that she knew that, she felt comfortable now going forward and getting married. I just thought that was so special.\"",
      "Building the Family Tree of a Killer",
      "It was one of the first times that genetic genealogy was used to solve a criminal case \u2013 and word spread fast. In 2017, Rae-Venter got a call: Could she use the same technique to find the Golden State Killer? At the time, there were six full-time investigators and three FBI agents on the case, and they couldn't find him. Rae-Venter thought the DNA would tell her who he was. \"I was absolutely certain of that,\" she said.",
      "Investigators provided a DNA profile left at a California crime scene, and Rae-Venter uploaded it to GED Match and Family Tree DNA. This time, she was building the family tree of a killer.",
      "Sixty-three days later, she said, \"I'm sitting there at three in the morning all by my little lonesome staring at my computer. I know who you are: You're Joseph DeAngelo.\"",
      "I asked, \"At that moment, were you the only person in the world who knew who the Golden State Killer was?\"",
      "\"Besides him? Probably,\" Rae-Venter replied.",
      "It was an astonishing breakthrough. But Rae-Venter's word was not enough to make an arrest. \"I'm providing an investigative lead. You still need some old-fashioned detective work,\" she said.",
      "So investigators got to work getting a DNA sample from DeAngelo himself to confirm he was the right guy. Within days, the brutal killer who had evaded law enforcement for decades was finally behind bars.",
      "In 2020, DeAngelo was sentenced to 13 consecutive life sentences. After DeAngelo was locked away, Rae-Venter decided that it was time to share her incredible story in a book, \"I Know Who You Are.\" She has been profiled in The New York Times, and appeared on Time Magazine's list of the most influential people.",
      "And she's come out of retirement. Her group, Firebird Forensics, works with law enforcement agencies nationwide to solve cases using genetic genealogy, and has solved approximately 60 cases. She even travels around the country teaching others her technique.",
      "In 2023 she described the process of using genetic genealogy as \"very addictive, because you know you're hot on the trail and you just know if you just keep going a little bit longer, you're going to find the connections you're looking for.\"",
      "But her line of work has also raised concerns about privacy. More than 53 million people have already uploaded their DNA profiles to public databases. Should police be able to use that information to track down the users' criminal relatives? \"Well, unfortunately, I think that horse left the barn a long time ago,\" Rae-Venter  said.",
      "And the trade-off may be worth it, says Rae-Venter and others, if it means getting killers and rapists off the streets. Michael O'Malley, the prosecuting attorney in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, said, \"There was a lot of light bulbs going off across the country saying, 'What great technology! How do we bring it to our community to solve violent crimes?'\"",
      "Watch Part Two of Erin Moriarty's report:",
      "Who is John Doe #147?",
      "O'Malley is a witness to a sad statistic in this country: more and more serious crimes are going unsolved. \"I get violent crime reports that come across my desk every day, and only a fraction of those are solved,\" he said.",
      "In 2020, O'Malley's office set up the G.O.L.D. Unit, a team of prosecutors who use the latest forensic tools to find criminals and get them off the streets. It's run by supervising assistant prosecuting attorney Mary Weston. \"We review cases, mostly sexual assaults and homicides at this time, that can be re-investigated using perhaps updated technologies,\" she said.",
      "Among them, cases involving sexual predators, like John Doe #147. \"That's all we knew him as,\" said Weston.",
      "On a hot afternoon in August 1997, a man grabbed a nine-year-old boy in the woods behind a school in the Cleveland suburbs, and sexually assaulted him.",
      "The nine-year-old victim is now a thirty-seven-year old man, who asked us to call him \"Michael,\" and not show his face. Describing the years since the assault, he said, \"It's just been a lot of ups-and-downs, you know? I had doubts, thinking, 'Would I ever, would we ever find the guy?'",
      "\"I remember running to my dad, him taking me to the hospital,\" Michael said. \"But the most I could remember is my mom. She was just crying hysterically on the front porch, just blaming herself, and the neighbors are trying to calm her down.\"",
      "Investigators knew little about the predator back in 1997, according to O'Malley: \"The young boy gave a description, roughly, of his age, and his body build. But really that was it,\" he said.",
      "There was DNA left on the child's clothing. In 2003, a profile was submitted to the federal database (known as CODIS), which contains DNA profiles of convicted offenders. There was no match. So, investigators had a DNA profile, but not a name to go with it.",
      "\"I was crushed,\" said Michael. \"I think, my only hope is just gone. He's gonna actually get away with it.\"",
      "To stop the statute of limitations for rape from running out, \"John Doe #147\" was indicted, but with no leads, the case went cold. Weston said, \"At the time, you know, we were at a loss. What are we gonna do for this boy? He's not a boy anymore, but what can we do to try to help solve his case?\"",
      "Michael said he was scared that the predator might find him again: \"Oh, yeah, I always thought, 'Could this guy be watching?' And he threatened to kill me if I had told anybody about the horrible incident.\"",
      "But in 2018, Michael \u2013 and the rest of the world \u2013 watched the Golden State Killer case play out on TV. \"And it was like a lightbulb lit above my head,\" he said. \"I'm like, 'Oh, there's another way.'\"",
      "The capture of notorious serial killer James James   DeAngelo introduced the world to investigative genetic genealogy. Could that same technique help solve Michael's case? Investigators would need a more complete profile of the rapist's DNA. But again, there was a hitch: when investigators went looking for the rape kit from Michael's case, they discovered that it had been destroyed.",
      "\"I'm not your victim anymore\"",
      "But investigators didn't give up, and got a stroke of luck when a key piece of evidence was discovered at the county's crime laboratory: an original tube used for testing that could have some leftover DNA. \"I was very, very excited,\" said Weston. \"But then there's the waiting. Is it gonna be enough? And then, 'Are you gonna be able to work with this very tiny amount of DNA?' It's nine nanograms.\"",
      "Astoundingly, it was enough, and in March 2022, they turned to someone familiar: Barbara Rae-Venter, the genealogist who tracked down the Golden State Killer. \"If I had faith in anybody to do it, it was her,\" said Weston. \"She had solved a few cases for us already, and I knew this case was in good hands.\"",
      "It took two months. Rae-Venter came up with a list of suspects, all brothers. Ohio investigators then were able to narrow that list down to just one, and asked Michael to view a photo lineup. \"Immediately, you know, my heart started pounding,\" he said. \"I started getting clammy and sweaty, sorta like a flashback, you know, to when I seen him standing there in the woods.\"",
      "The man he recognized was Dennis Gribble, an Ohio resident with a long history of sex crimes. It was all investigators needed to get a search warrant. Days later, they appeared on Gribble's doorstep to get a DNA sample, telling him, \"Please open your mouth.\"",
      "What was his reaction? \"He was stunned, but he complied,\" O'Malley said. \"And we took it back to our lab and confirmed that he was the individual who sexually assaulted Michael back in 1997.\"",
      "And that's how, in May 2023, John Doe #147, now identified as Dennis Gribble, appeared in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs in a Cleveland courtroom. Michael was there. He looked at Gribble (\"I was just disgusted\"), and read an impact statement to the court: \"I have learned to be a better person and a father than the monster you are and will always be.\"",
      "Michael said, \"I wanted to show him he didn't get the best of me. I'm not your victim anymore. I'm not somebody you prey on anymore.\"",
      "Gribble, now 75, pleaded guilty to one count of rape, and is currently serving 10 years in prison.",
      "With a federal grant to help cover the costs of testing, the G.O.L.D. Unit has now helped solve 13 rape cases in the Cleveland area, with Barbara Rae-Venter's help. Yet, neither O'Malley nor Weston has ever met Rae-Venter. \"We Zoom!\" Weston laughed.",
      "I asked, \"Is that a little odd, that you're working with this investigator who really never leaves her dining room table? That's where she does all her investigations.\"",
      "\"I hope she never leaves it again!\" O'Malley laughed.",
      "The technique that Rae-Venter used to track down Dennis Gribble has been used to identify other elusive criminals, including Bryan Kohberger, who earlier this month pleaded guilty to killing four University of Idaho students in 2022.",
      "O'Malley says he believes genetic genealogy will someday solve less serious offenses as well. \"Right now, it's still a very expensive tool, and it takes a lot of time,\" he said. \"But I do see it expanding in the future.\"",
      "Still, as the field expands, so have privacy concerns. Some states have set limits, although there are no national laws restricting the use of genetic genealogy by law enforcement.",
      "And for victims like Michael, the benefits outweigh the risks. Genetic genealogy was his only chance for justice. \"It was a needle in a haystack,\" he said. \"The guy would have got away scot-free. Had it not been for DNA and genealogy, I would have never been here today. We wouldn't even be talking about it.\"",

      "Bangkok \u2014 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says the technology giant has won approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence to China \u2014 a reversal of administration policy.",
      "The news came in a company blog post late Monday. Huang also spoke about the coup on China's state-run CGTN television network in remarks shown on X.",
      "\"The U.S. government has assured Nvidia that licenses will be granted, and Nvidia hopes to start deliveries soon,\" the post said.",
      "\"Today, I'm announcing that the U.S. government has approved for us filing licenses to start shipping H20s,\" Huang told reporters in Beijing. He noted that half of the world's AI researchers are in China.",
      "\"It's so innovative and dynamic here in China that it's really important that American companies are able to compete and serve the market here in China,\" he said.",
      "The White House said in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia's H20 chips and AMD's MI308 chips to China.",
      "Huang recently met with President Trump and other U.S. policymakers and is in Beijing this week to attend a supply chain conference and speak with Chinese officials.",
      "The broadcast showed Huang meeting with Ren Hongbin, the head of the China Council for Promotion of International Trade, host of the China International Supply Chain Expo, in which Nvidia is an exhibitor.",
      "Wall Street analysts said getting the nod to sell advanced chips to China is a significant boost for Nvidia and will help it compete.",
      "\"Nvidia getting back in China after a mid-April ban is a huge tailwind,\" Melius Research analysts said in a note to investors.",
      "\"Now Nvidia can better compete with Huawei \u2014 not only in the China market, but globally making sure more Chinese AI developers can create applications on a U.S.-friendly Nvidia AI stack,\" they added.",
      "Zhang Guobin, founder of the Chinese specialist website eetrend.com, told French news agency AFP the new policy would \"bring (Nvidia) substantial revenue growth, making up for the losses caused by the previous ban,\" adding that it would also ease the impact of trade frictions on the global supply chain for semiconductors.",
      "But he said Chinese firms stay focused on domestic chip development since \"the Trump administration has been ... prone to abrupt policy shifts, making it difficult to gauge how long such an opening might endure.\"",
      "Nvidia shares rose 4.5% to $171.40 before the start of the U.S. trade on Tuesday.",
      "Nvidia first to $4 trillion",
      "Nvidia has profited enormously from the rapid adoption of AI, becoming the first company to have its market value surpass $4 trillion last week. However, the trade rivalry between the U.S. and China has been weighing heavily on the industry.",
      "Washington has been tightening controls on exports of advanced technology to China for years, citing concerns that know-how meant for civilian use could be deployed for military purposes. The emergence of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot in January renewed concerns over how China might use the advanced chips to help develop its own AI capabilities.",
      "In January, before Mr. Trump began his second term in office, the Biden administration launched a new framework for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, an attempt to balance national security concerns about the technology with the economic interests of producers and other countries.",
      "Nvidia had said the tighter export controls would cost the company an extra $5.5 billion, and Huang and other technology leaders have been lobbying Mr. Trump to reverse the restrictions. They argue that such limits hinder U.S. competition in a leading edge sector in one of the world's largest markets for technology.",
      "They've also warned that U.S. export controls could end up pushing other countries toward China's AI technology.",

The posts were removed Sunday afternoon, shortly after appearing on the platform.",
      "Epstein's case has been back in the news after the Justice Department and FBI released a report saying their review had found no evidence of a long-rumored \"client list,\" and that security video confirms no one entered the cell area before Epstein's death. The findings sparked a furor among some Trump supporters after right-wing media figures spent years promoting the idea of a cover-up or conspiracy.",
      "The posts on Elmo's X account were published several days after the team behind Grok, Elon Musk's xAI chatbot, deleted several posts on Musk's X in which the chatbot made antisemitic comments and praised Adolf Hitler. The company later issued an apology.",
      "Musk and X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, have been criticized for a surge of antisemitic and other hate speech on the site since he took ownership in October 2022.

      "In an email to employees Thursday, Recruit Holdings CEO Hisayuki \"Deko\" Idekoba said that \"AI is changing the world\" and that the company must adapt accordingly. The layoffs represent about 6% of Recruit Holdings' HR technology workforce.",
      "The cuts will target the companies' research and development, as well as \"people & sustainability,\" teams in the U.S., but other areas and regions will also be affected, according to Recruit Holdings. The company will send notices to employees who are losing their jobs on Thursday.",
      "The move reflects Recruit Holdings' focus on using AI to transform how job-seekers look for work and how employers handle recruitment. As part of that effort, the company will fold Glassdoor operations into Indeed, the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Glassdoor CEO Christian Sutherland-Wong is stepping down.",
      "\"[W]hen we think about HR industry, which is $300 billion-plus industry, but it includes like 60% or 65% of human labor manual cost.

    "summary": "People are turning to AI dating assistants for help in crafting wittier, more conversational messages to attract romantic partners on apps.",
    "story": [
      "While online dating apps makes searching for love more convenient, finding that special person is as difficult as ever. A cute photo and simple \"hello\" may not be enough to help you break through the noise, which is why many of those feeling stuck on what to say are turning to artificial intelligence for assistance.",
      "According to a study\u00a0on singles in America released last month by dating app Match.com and The Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, 1 in 4 singles \u2014 and nearly half of Gen Z \u2014 use AI to up their dating game. That's a 333% increase from a year ago.",
      "\"People are turning to AI for literally any use case you could imagine,\" said Kasley Killam, a social health and human connection expert. \"And so it's inevitable that people are going to turn to AI for dating coaching.\"",
      "Capitalizing on the trend are AI dating assistants, which coach people on what to say, what tone to strike and how to keep the conversation flowing if it hits a lull. For individuals who feel writing isn't their strong suit, the technology can be a real confidence booster.",
      "Advice on what to say",
      "Roman Khaves, founder of a dating assistant app called Rizz \u2014 which is Gen Z-speak for \"charisma\" \u2014 said the service provides around-the-clock, objective advice for people who can't afford a human dating coach or are unable to reach their friends in a pinch.",
      "\"It'll never sleep on you,\" Khaves told CBS MoneyWatch, describing the app as an \"AI wingwoman or AI wingman in your pocket.\"",
      "Rizz works by letting users upload screenshots of their conversations from dating apps or social media. Rizz then suggests a reply using generative AI. The more you use Rizz, the more it understands what type of replies you tend to like or feel comfortable with. That trains the AI model to improve over time.",
      "Rizz has a user base of roughly 10 million, according to Khaves, and is composed of 65% men and 35% women, largely within the 18-to-25 age range.",
      "Another service, called Keepler, a dating-optimization app, has a feature that helps people navigate the dreaded practice known as \"ghosting,\" or when someone abruptly cuts off communication with someone without providing any explanation.",
      "One reason people ghost others is that they don't know the best way to let someone down easy, Keepler co-founder and CEO Rachel Abramowitz, told CBS MoneyWatch. Keepler's defense against ghosting is Keri, the app's in-house relationship guide.",
      "\"What we've built is a way to put in your raw, unedited feedback to Keri. Keri will rewrite it for you, and then you can send it to somebody,\" Abramowitz said.",
      "For those who have been ghosted, Keepler also allows users to request feedback from their vanishing date directly through the app, or have Keri help them write a message to send on their own.",
      "Abramowitz emphasizes that the app isn't aimed at providing therapy, but rather is there to offer support. With Keri, \"It really does feel like you have someone who is objective, who is on your side, who has no ulterior motives and really wants you to help reach your goals,\" she said.",
      "Last-gen dating apps are also getting into the AI game. Hinge and Grindr, two of the most popular dating apps, are taking steps to integrate AI into their platforms. In January, for example, Hinge introduced Prompt Feedback, an AI feature that provides users with immediate feedback on their profiles as they enter information.",
      "AI icebreaker",
      "The growing popularity of AI dating assistants gives rise to questions over authenticity as more users rely on the technology to convey their thoughts and feelings.",
      "One 36-year old Rizz user, who asked to remain anonymous to protect his privacy, told CBS MoneyWatch he could see why some people might find using AI to communicate disingenuous, but said he sees the tech simply as a way to stand out from the crowd.",
      "He also acknowledged that some of his dates appeared skeptical after he revealed to them that he was getting behind-the-scenes coaching from Rizz. But he still thinks the service is helpful as a conversation starter.",
      "\"For me personally, it's good for just initiating conversation, getting someone's attention, and then being able to just be myself after that,\" he said.",
      "Killam, the social health and human connection expert, said she thinks AI dating tools can be useful as long as people don't misrepresent who they are or lean on them too much.",
      "\"The risk is when we use AI as a substitute for human connection, rather than a supplement to it,\" she said.",

Not every time, but enough to raise eyebrows. Truth is stranger than fiction, eh?\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tariffs-trump-news-economy-uncertainty/",
    "published": "Tue, 15 Jul 2025 07:25:56 -0400",
    "summary": "As President Trump ramps up the pressure on dozens of countries, trade experts fear U.S. tariff policy leaves consumers and businesses in limbo.",
    "story": [
      "A flurry of tariff threats by President Trump leaves U.S. consumers and businesses in limbo ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline to deploy the import duties against more than 50 countries around the world, according to economists and trade experts.",
      "\"Nobody knows whether these are threats or whether they will become policy, so it seems like everyone has become desensitized to them,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that uncertainty over U.S. tariffs leaves companies in \"a very dense fog.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Saturday announced he is imposing 30% tariffs against Mexico and the 27-member European Union. That followed moves to threaten tariffs ranging from 20% to 50% on roughly two dozen countries, including key U.S. trading partners such as Brazil, Canada, Japan and South Korea.",
      "The White House last week also said it plans to impose a 50% levy on copper imports by Aug. 1, raising concerns about higher costs for electronics, cars and numerous other products that use the metal.",
      "Heat on Russia and Brazil",
      "In a separate development that illustrates the White House's willingness to use tariffs to accomplish its aims beyond trade, Mr. Trump is threatening sharply higher tariffs as he tries to tamp down conflict in Ukraine. The president said on Monday that the U.S. will impose 100% tariffs on countries that engage in trade with Russia if there is no peace deal to end the war in Ukraine within 50 days.",
      "In another case of hitching trade policy to other foreign policy priorities, Mr. Trump said last week that the U.S. would slap a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil next month, citing the criminal prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which Mr. Trump called an \"international disgrace.\"",
      "The Trump administration has defended its aggressive use of tariffs as a way to ensure fair trade for U.S. businesses; boost key domestic sectors; generate federal revenue; and advance other policy priorities, such as curbing fentanyl trafficking and authorized immigration from Canada and Mexico.",
      "According to\u00a0Reuters, customs duties in June surpassed $100 billion for the first time in a single fiscal year, a sign the stepped-up tariff regime is contributing more revenue.",
      "\"High uncertainty\"",
      "So far, the White House has notched only a handful of trade deals, experts note, while agreements with major trading partners like the EU have been harder to come buy. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump announced a pact between the U.S. and Vietnam, while in June a more limited deal was reached with the United Kingdom that the White House said provides gives \"American companies unprecedented access to British markets while bolstering U.S. national security.\"",
      "Also last month, the U.S. and China announced that they\u00a0had agreed on a framework for a trade deal that makes it easier for U.S. businesses to acquire Chinese magnets and rare earth minerals.",
      "But with little time to thrash out trade agreements ahead of the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, some trade experts say the U.S. has made little progress since suspending country-based tariffs in April.",
      "\"We don't have any comprehensive deals with our largest trading partners,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank. \"Where this leaves us is where we've been \u2014 in a period of high uncertainty for businesses and consumers.\"",
      "Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said mixed messages from the Trump administration on trade is making it difficult to nail down agreements.",
      "\"How do you negotiate with someone when you don't know what they want?\" he said. \"One day, [President Trump] says they are about trade deficits, the next day it's about raising revenue, the next it's about stimulating American industry \u2014 then it's a bargaining tool. His multiple goals conflict with one another.\"",
      "Demanding equal footing",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai said Mr. Trump's tariff agenda is driven in part by his desire for U.S. trade partners to lower both \"tariff and non-monetary trade barriers that are undermining American industries.\"",
      "Such moves by other nations would allow American industries to \"be on a more equal footing to compete and grow,\" Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's trade policies, tariffs have yet to significantly affect consumer prices in the U.S.",
      "Oxford's Daco said that the average U.S. tariff rate in June was around 15%, while the effective tariff rate -- or actual cost of tariffs on imports \u2014 was 10%. That's part of the reason, combined with a front-loading of imports by companies, why prices have been slow to rise.",
      "\"In terms of the full bite of tariffs, it's not yet visible in the duties collected,\" he said.",
      "Following are the tariff rates the U.S. said last week it would impose on roughly two dozen countries as well as members of the EU:",

      "Bell called on two friends and armed himself with an AK-47 rifle, authorities said. They found the car parked outside a liquor lounge and waited. When West, Smith and another woman eventually exited the club, Bell approached the car and opened fire, officials said.",

    "summary": "Fresh tomatoes from Mexico \u2014 which supplies about 70% of the U.S. tomato market \u2014 will face a 17.09% duty.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is imposing a 17% tariff on most fresh Mexican tomatoes, the federal government said Monday, ending a yearslong agreement with the U.S.' southern neighbor over trade practices.",
      "The move comes amid a separate push by President Trump to increase tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, including Mexico, which was told over the weekend to\u00a0expect 30% tariffs starting in August. Critics argue the president's tariff strategy could push up consumer prices. But Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said in a statement Monday that the decision on tomatoes is \"in line with President Trump's trade policies and approach with Mexico.\"",
      "\"Mexico remains one of our greatest allies, but for far too long our farmers have been crushed by unfair trade practices that undercut pricing on produce like tomatoes. That ends today,\" Lutnick said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The U.S. gets around 70% of its tomatoes from Mexico, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange. Roughly $3 billion worth of tomatoes are exported from Mexico to the U.S. every year, an almost threefold jump over the last 15 years, federal data shows.",
      "Supporters argue the tariffs could give a boost to the domestic tomato industry, which the Florida Tomato Exchange says has been \"decimated by an influx of cheap Mexican tomatoes.\" But others warn the move could lead to higher prices and harm U.S. companies that rely on imported tomatoes.",
      "The tariffs follow a complicated,\u00a0nearly three-decade-long dispute over allegations that Mexican tomato producers were illegally selling tomatoes to the U.S. at unfairly low prices, harming U.S. growers. The federal government\u00a0struck a deal\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 during Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 that averted \"anti-dumping\" duties on tomatoes in exchange for Mexican producers agreeing to a minimum sale price.",
      "In April, the Commerce Department announced the U.S. would exit that deal in 90 days, saying it \"has failed to protect U.S. tomato growers from unfairly priced Mexican imports.\" The Commerce Department said it would impose 20.91% tariffs \u2014 slightly higher than the 17.09% levies announced Monday.",
      "The Florida Tomato Exchange praised the move in a statement Monday. The group's executive vice president, Robert Guenther, called it \"an enormous victory for American tomato farmers and American agriculture.\"",
      "A group of lawmakers in Florida \u2014 which is one of the U.S.' largest tomato-producing states \u2014\u00a0praised the planned duties\u00a0in a letter to Lutnick last month. Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, called the move \"a major victory for American growers and producers.\"",
      "But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged Lutnick not to exit the deal on Friday, arguing the Trump administration should try to cut a new deal with Mexico instead. The group said \"the import and sale of Mexican tomatoes generate an estimated $8.3 billion in economic benefits,\" and warned withdrawing from the deal could trigger retaliation from Mexico.",
      "\"Terminating the Agreement would likely have widespread repercussions on the U.S. economy, affecting agriculture, warehousing, logistics, grocery, and restaurant industries,\" the group said in a letter to Lutnick.",
      "The lead-up to Monday's decision also drew criticism from some Democrats.",
      "\"ARIZONA, BUY YOUR TOMATOES NOW!!\" Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, wrote on X last week. \"Groceries are already too expensive. [Mr. Trump] needs to reverse this decision now.\"",
      "\"Salsa will be pricier, shelves emptier, and groceries more expensive. Tens of thousands of jobs, including 30,000 Texans, will be at risk,\" Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas Democrat,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Mexico's agriculture and economy ministries criticized the move in a statement Monday, saying it was \"unfair and against the interests not only of Mexican producers but also of the U.S. industry.\" They also said the massive growth in tomato exports to the U.S. \"stems from the quality of the product, not from any unfair practices.\" The Mexican government said it expected to find a solution to the dispute.",
      "Mr. Trump has sent letters to dozens of U.S. trading partners over the last week threatening higher tariffs starting August 1, partially reinstating some of the steep country-by-country levies that were rolled out by the Trump administration in April, but quickly delayed for 90 days. The president argues the tariffs are necessary to protect domestic jobs and correct unfair trade practices, but many economists argue tariffs can lead to sluggish economic growth and higher prices.",
      "Food prices grew 2.9% in the 12-month period ending in May \u2014 higher than the country's overall 2.4% inflation rate, but well below mid-2022, when food prices were growing upwards of 10% year-over-year, according to federal data. The price of tomatoes fell 6.8% from May 2024 to May 2025.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers last month he expects tariffs to have some impact on prices. But he added: \"We really don't know how much of that's going to be passed through the consumer. We have to wait and see.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to pause a lower court order that required the Department of Education to reinstate nearly 1,400 employees who had been laid off while proceedings over the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the agency continue.",
      "The high court granted a request from the Trump administration to lift for now the injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Myong Joun, which blocked the mass layoffs at the Education Department. A federal appeals court rejected a bid to pause that decision while the Justice Department appealed, after which it sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "The decision to lift the stay was 6 to 3, with the majority saying the lower court's injunction would be paused while the case works its way through the appeals process.",
      "The court's three liberals disagreed with the move, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor writing a dissent that was joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.",
      "\"When the Executive publicly announces its intent to break the law, and then executes on that promise, it is the Judiciary's duty to check that lawlessness, not expedite it,\" Sotomayor wrote. \"Two lower courts rose to the occasion, preliminarily enjoining the mass firings while the litigation remains ongoing. Rather than maintain the status quo, however, this Court now intervenes, lifting the injunction and permitting the Government to proceed with dismantling the Department. That decision is indefensible.\"",
      "President Trump hailed the ruling in a Truth Social post, calling it a \"Major Victory to Parents and Students across the Country\" as his administration works toward \"returning the functions of the Department of Education BACK TO THE STATES.\"",
      "Dismantling the Education Department",
      "Mr. Trump has overseen a sweeping effort to slash the size of the federal government since returning to the White House earlier this year. His administration has sought to conduct mass layoffs across the executive branch, and in March, the president signed an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to facilitate her agency's closure \"to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law.\"",
      "As part of the plan to dismantle the Department of Education, the Trump administration canceled a slew of grants and implemented a reduction-in-force that impacted 1,378 employees \u2014 roughly one-third of the agency's workforce. Those who were laid-off were placed on administrative leave in March, with their government service set to end June 9.",
      "A group of 21 Democratic attorneys general, teachers unions and the Somerville and Easthampton school districts sued the Trump administration, arguing that the president and McMahon are unlawfully attempting to reorganize the Department of Education without authorization from Congress.",
      "Joun found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims that the Trump administration's actions were unlawful and said it is \"effectively disabling the department from carrying out its statutory duties by firing half of its staff, transferring key programs out of the department, and eliminating entire offices and programs.\"",
      "The judge said that the reduction-in-force implemented by McMahon would \"likely cripple the department,\" and blocked the secretary from carrying out the layoffs or transferring certain functions from the Education Department.",
      "In last month's emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the layoffs at the Department of Education are part of the administration's \"policy of streamlining the department and eliminating discretionary functions that, in the administration's view, are better left to the states.\"",
      "He claimed that Joun's order \"thwarted the executive branch's authority to manage the Department of Education despite lacking jurisdiction to second-guess the executive's internal management decisions.\"",
      "But lawyers for the two Massachusetts-based school districts accused Education Department leaders of working to \"destroy the agency by executive fiat.\" They warned that if the Trump administration is allowed to move forward with its plans to dismantle the agency, the school districts may never be able to recover lost financial, informational and technical assistance.",
      "\"If the dismantling of the department is allowed to go forward now, and if respondents ultimately prevail at the end of this case, it will be effectively impossible to undo much of the damage caused,\" lawyers for the school districts argued in a filing. \"By contrast, if the government ultimately prevails in this case, it will be able to put its plans into operation merely slightly later than otherwise.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Democratic attorneys general said that the Trump administration has never drawn any connection between the layoffs at the Department of Education and its goal of increasing efficiency.",
      "\"If the administration disagrees with existing statutory law, it may propose legislation through which Congress might change its past policy judgments. And the secretary may exercise the department's lawful reorganization authority under\" federal law, they wrote in a filing. \"But the secretary cannot unilaterally redirect the nation's approach to education by starving the department of the staff necessary to do its work.\"",

Pieces of Mars found on Earth are rare. According to the auction house, just 400 of the more than 77,000 officially recognized meteorites found on Earth \u2014 or about 0.6% \u2014 are from Mars. The meteorite represents approximately 6.5% of all Martian material currently known on Earth.",
      "Meteorites come from meteors, space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere. Most meteors burn up as they fall toward Earth, but the ones that survive the trip through Earth's atmosphere are considered meteorites. The chunk of Martian rock being auctioned off by Sotheby's was likely dislodged from the planet by an asteroid strike.",
      "NWA 16788 traveled 140 million miles through space before it crashed in the Sahara Desert, where it was found in Niger's remote Agadez Region in 2023, according to Sotheby's.",
      "\"The odds of this getting from there to here are astronomically small,\" Cassandra Hatton, Sotheby's vice chairman of science and natural history, said in an auction house video.",
      "The meteorite weighs just over 54 pounds, which makes it the largest meteorite from Mars, but not the largest meteorite ever found. According to NASA, a meteorite originally weighing over 100 tons once fell to Namibia.",
      "It's believed that NWA 16788 is a \"relative newcomer here on Earth, having fallen from outer space rather recently,\" Sotheby's said in its auction listing. The meteorite is on public view at Sotheby's New York galleries until July 15.",
      "\"This isn't just a miraculous find, but a massive dataset that can help us unlock the secrets of our neighbor, the red planet,\" Hatton said in the auction house video.",
      "Sotheby's regularly auctions meteorites.",
      "\"Specimens of the Moon and Mars are among the greatest of rarities on our planet \u2014 as every bit of both would fit in the cargo hold of a large SUV,\" the auction house wrote in a 2022 collector's guide.",

      "A year later, the Obergs have a new house in a new spot on the same lot, but on top of a hill they built.",
      "To afford the house, they looked to the local trade school, where students build two ready-to-deliver homes every year. One went to Habitat for Humanity. The Obergs bid on the other last July and won.",

      "\"Irrigation systems, ditches, any infrastructure that exists in this field was basically replaced on our own dime. There was no help for that stuff,\" Chicoine told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "Martin Cruz Smith, the bestselling mystery novelist who engaged readers for decades with \"Gorky Park\" and other thrillers featuring Moscow investigator Arkady Renko, has died at age 82.",
      "Smith died Friday at a senior living community in San Rafael, California, \"surrounded by those he loved,\" his publisher, Simon & Schuster, said in a statement. Smith revealed a decade ago that he had\u00a0Parkinson's disease, and he gave the same condition to his protagonist. His 11th Renko book,\u00a0\"Hotel Ukraine,\"\u00a0was published this week and billed as his last.",
      "\"My longevity is linked to Arkady's,\" he told Strand Magazine in 2023. \"As long as he remains intelligent, humorous, and romantic, so shall I.\"",
      "Smith was often praised for his storytelling and for his insights into modern Russia; he would speak of being interrogated at length by customs officials during his many trips there. The Associated Press called \"Hotel Ukraine\" a \"gem\" that \"upholds Smith's reputation as a great craftsman of modern detective fiction with his sharply drawn, complex characters and a compelling plot.\"",
      "Smith's honors included being named a \"grand master\" by the Mystery Writers of America, winning the Hammett Prize for \"Havana Bay\" and a Gold Dagger award for \"Gorky Park.\"",
      "Born Martin William Smith in Reading, Pennsylvania, he studied creative writing at the University of Pennsylvania and started out as a journalist, including a brief stint at the AP and at the Philadelphia Daily News. Success as an author arrived slowly. He had been a published novelist for more than a decade before he broke through in the early 1980s with \"Gorky Park.\" His novel came out when the Soviet Union and the Cold War were still very much alive and centered on Renko's investigation into the murders of three people whose bodies were found in the Moscow park that Smith used for the book's title.",
      "\"Gorky Park,\" cited by the New York Times as a reminder of \"just how satisfying a smoothly turned thriller can be,\" topped the Times' fiction bestseller list and was later made into a movie starring William Hurt.",
      "\"Russia is a character in my Renko stories, always,\" Smith told Publishers Weekly in 2013. \"'Gorky Park' may have been one of the first books to take a backdrop and make it into a character. It took me forever to write because of my need to get things right. You've got to knock down the issue of 'Does this guy know what he's talking about or not?'\"",
      "Smith's other books include science fiction (\"The Indians Won\"), the Westerns \"North to Dakota\" and \"Ride to Revenge,\" and the \"Romano Grey\" mystery series. Besides \"Martin Cruz Smith\" \u2014 Cruz was his maternal grandmother's name \u2014 he also wrote under the pen names \"Nick Carter\" and \"Simon Quinn.\"",
      "Smith's Renko books were inspired in part by his own travels and he would trace the region's history over the past 40 years, whether the Soviet Union's collapse (\"Red Square\"), the rise of Russian oligarchs (\"The Siberian Dilemma\"), or, in the novel \"Wolves Eats Dogs,\" the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.",
      "By the time he began working on his last novel, Russia had invaded Ukraine. The AP noted in its review of \"Hotel Ukraine\" that Smith had devised a backstory \"pulled straight from recent headlines,\" referencing such world leaders as Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin of Russia and former President Joe Biden of the U.S.",

    "published": "Mon, 14 Jul 2025 16:47:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The tax and spending bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4 includes a limited tax break for car buyers.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of car buyers in the U.S. could soon get some tax relief thanks to a provision in the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" that was signed into law on July 4 by President Trump.",
      "The idea of giving a tax break for auto purchasers was first floated by Mr. Trump while on the campaign trail in October, when he promised that such a measure would \"make car ownership dramatically more affordable for millions and millions of working American families.\"",
      "That promise has now materialized as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, with the new tax break taking effect for car purchases starting in 2025. But the deduction also has income limitations that narrow the number of Americans who can claim it, while used car buyers and vehicle leasers do not benefit.",
      "Still, car buyers who have bought a new vehicle this year or are planning to do so in the next four years may get some tax relief when they file their 2025 tax returns. The deduction will expire in 2028, which means car buyers can only take advantage of the benefit for four tax years.",
      "At the same time, the One Big Beautiful Act eliminates the federal tax credit for electric vehicles after Sept. 30. The tax break, which provides a $7,500 for new EVs and a $4,000 credit for used EVs, is credited with helping make electric vehicles more affordable for many buyers.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How much is the new auto loan deduction?",
      "The new tax cuts and spending law enables car buyers to deduct up to $10,000 in \"qualified passenger vehicle loan interest during a given taxable year,\" beginning with 2025 purchases.",
      "While that's similar to the mortgage interest deduction available to homeowners, there is one major difference: Car buyers will be able to itemize their auto loan interest even if they take the standard deduction. By comparison, the mortgage interest deduction is only available to taxpayers who itemize.",
      "Which vehicles qualify for the deduction?",
      "The tax break applies to the purchase of new cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds (referred to as light vehicles). Used cars don't qualify.",
      "To qualify for the deduction, a vehicle also must be assembled in the U.S., which further limits the tax break.",
      "The deduction also only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes. And it excludes autos that are leased, which represent about one-quarter of all auto sales in the U.S., according to Experian.",
      "What are the income limits for the auto loan deduction?",
      "The full break can only be claimed by single taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $100,000 or less or married couples with a MAGI of $200,000 or less.",
      "Modified adjusted gross income is your adjusted gross income, which can be found on line 11 of your 1040 tax return, with some items like savings bond interest added back in, according to the IRS.",
      "Under the new law, the auto loan deduction shrinks for people with MAGIs above those thresholds, with the amount reduced by $200 for each $1,000 in income above those levels. The deduction is completely phased out for single filers earning above $150,000 and married couples with incomes above $250,000.",
      "How many Americans will qualify for the car loan deduction?",
      "An estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year if purchasing patterns stay the same and after excluding commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.",
      "About 60% of the 15.9 million new light vehicles sold last year were financed with auto loans, according to Cox data.",
      "How much will the car loan deduction save on my taxes?",
      "That depends on the size of your auto loan and whether you fall below the income thresholds for the new tax break, but the typical car buyer could save hundreds per year on their taxes.",
      "The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year because interest payments on loans are front-loaded, while principal payments grow on the back end.",
      "Car buyers who qualify for an auto loan rate of about 6.5%, typically available to consumers with high credit scores, could deduct $3,000 in the first year of owning their car and about $1,800 per year after that for the remainder of the loan,\u00a0according to the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.",
      "Deductions reduce a filer's taxable income, which helps lower their tax burden. For instance, someone in the 22% tax bracket could save $660 on their taxes by claiming a $3,000 auto loan deduction.",
      "At a 9.3% interest rate \u2014 typical of people with subprime credit scores \u2014 an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said.",

      "Two wildfires are burning at or near the North Rim, a less popular area of the park that draws only about 10% of the Grand Canyon's millions of annual visitors. The fires are known as the\u00a0Dragon Bravo Fire, which started on July 4, and the White Sage Fire, which began Wednesday. The Dragon Bravo Fire is the one that impacted the lodge and other structures.",
      "Map shows where fires are burning near Grand Canyon",
      "The Dragon Bravo Fire \"exhibited extreme and volatile fire behavior\" Saturday night and expanded to about 5,700 acres by Monday, officials said. It was fueled by up to 40 mph wind gusts, but firefighters were able to slow the fire's progression using aerial drops of flame retardant.",
      "More than 70 structures have been lost, including National Park Service administrative buildings and visitor facilities. Photos posted to social media by officials on Sunday showed structures near the Grand Canyon Lodge \u2014 the only lodging inside the park at the North Rim \u2014 burned to the ground.",
      "Nearly 5 million people visited the Grand Canyon last year, with most sticking to the South Rim. Roads in the North Rim are closed to vehicles in the winter, and the lodge was open in May through mid-October.",
      "The Grand Canyon Lodge was often the first prominent feature that visitors saw, even before viewing the canyon. A highway ends at the lodge, which was known for its sloped roof, huge ponderosa beams and massive limestone facade.",
      "Aramark, the company that operated the lodge, said all employees and guests were safely evacuated.",
      "\"As stewards of some [of] our country's most beloved national treasures, we are devastated by the loss,\" said spokesperson Debbie Albert.",
      "Caren Carney was staying at the lodge last week with her husband, parents and 12-year-old son when a park ranger knocked on their door Thursday and told them to evacuate.",
      "She said she was heartbroken Sunday to hear that such a \"magical place\" had burned down. After evacuating, the family from Georgia went to the South Rim and could see the blaze from across the canyon.",
      "\"I'm so glad we got to have one final look at it in the present before it was lost,\" Carney said.",
      "An original lodge burned down from a kitchen fire in 1932, four years after construction was completed, according to the Grand Canyon Historical Society. The redesigned lodge, using the original stonework, opened in 1937.",
      "Thomas Sulpizio, president of the historical society, said the lodge contained some valuable archives that he wasn't sure were saved.",
      "The lobby also contained a famous 600-pound bronze statue of a donkey named \"Brighty the Burro.\"",
      "\"Arizona lost more than a historic lodge, it lost a piece of our state history,\" said Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego in a message posted on social media.",
      "Gallego said he was devastated by the loss and backed a call by Gov. Katie Hobbs for \"a comprehensive, independent investigation into the handling of fire and the rationale for treating it as a controlled burn \u2014 especially as Arizona experiences the driest, hardest part of summer,\" adding: \"I will do my part on the federal level to get answers.\"",
      "Authorities first used a \"confine and contain\" strategy by clearing fuel sources, but shifted to aggressive suppression a week later as the fire rapidly grew because of hot temperatures, low humidity and strong wind gusts, fire officials said.",
      "\"Arizonans deserve answers for how this fire was allowed to decimate the Grand Canyon National Park,\" Hobbs said on social media.",
      "Park Superintendent Ed Keable told park residents, staff and others in a meeting Sunday morning that the visitor center, the gas station, a wastewater treatment plant, an administrative building and some employee housing were among the structures lost. Numerous historic cabins in the area were also destroyed, the park said.",
      "Fire personnel had to evacuate from critical zones, as \"the use of aerial retardant was not feasible\" due to the chlorine gas leak, the National Park Service said.",
      "Chlorine gas is heavier than air, meaning it can settle into lower elevations such as the inner canyon and pose a health risk to fire personnel and hikers, according to the park service.",
      "A hazmat team was working to mitigate the effects of the gas leak, officials said.",
      "Parts of the park are closed, and all Colorado River trips have been instructed to bypass Phantom Ranch, which has a set of cabins and dormitories along the river and is more than 200 miles south of the Dragon Bravo Fire.",
      "No injuries or loss of life have been reported, fire managers said.",
      "Meanwhile, the White Sage Fire located in Kaibab National Forest has forced hundreds to evacuate as it doubled in size on Sunday. It has scorched over 49,000 acres and hasn't been contained, according to authorities.",
      "Melinda Rich Marshall, who works at the nearby Jacob Lake Inn, had to evacuate quickly after a deputy called. It was the second time in five years she had to flee from the lodge, which has been owned by her family for more than a century.",
      "\"There is a doorjamb that catalogs all of the heights, right, that, you know, like your parents do,\" an emotional Marshall told CBS News correspondent Ian Lee. \"Well, it was my granddad that did that ... so I just went, and I took a video of it.\"",
      "Air tankers dropped nearly 180,000 gallons of retardant along the fire's northern and southern perimeters Sunday, slowing the spread of the blaze, officials said.",

      "Canadian wildfires' smoke blankets the Upper Midwest",

      "The conditions started Friday, dragging smoke from the Canadian wildfires down to the surface, said National Weather Service meteorologist Jennifer Ritterling, in Grand Forks. Periods of bad air quality were expected to last through the weekend in the region, she said.",
      "Limiting time outdoors, keeping windows closed and running air purifiers are good ideas for people with lung conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and even healthy people, Ritterling said.",
      "\"Our summers up here are fairly short and so everyone wants to get out and enjoy them, and it's a little frustrating when there's this smoke in the air,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, all of Manitoba is under a state of emergency because of the wildfires, which have led to 12,600 people evacuating their homes in the Canadian province. The fires in the central province have burned nearly 2.5 million acres, the most land burned in 30 years of electronic record-keeping.",

    "story": [
      "A famed Japanese destroyer sunk by U.S. torpedoes during a pivotal battle in World War II has been discovered on the floor of the Pacific Ocean more than 80 years after it sank, an exploration team has revealed. The warship was found still armed with unused depth charges, according to the explorers.",
      "The Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer Teruzuki was located by a remotely operated vehicle more than 2,600 feet below the ocean's surface near the Solomon Islands, the Ocean Exploration Trust announced on Saturday.",
      "\"Lying on the seabed at over 800 meters in the Solomon Islands, this is the first time anyone has laid eyes on Teruzuki since it was sunk in WWII's naval battles off Guadalcanal,\" said the trust, which released images and video of the wreck.",
      "Teruzuki (which translates to \"Shiny Moon\" in Japanese) was under the command of Rear Admiral Raizou Tanaka. The legendary naval leader earned the moniker \"Tenacious Tanaka\" among U.S. forces for leading dangerous attacks and so-called \"Tokyo Express\" supply missions during the middle of the night.",
      "Weeks before descending to its watery grave, the Teruzuki used its state-of-the-art weaponry to great effect. In November 1942, the 400-foot-long Akizuki-class destroyer used its rapid-fire 100mm guns to help sink two U.S. destroyers,\u00a0 according to the U.S. Naval Institute. The Teruzuki's torpedoes also severely damaged two other U.S. battleships.",
      "But on December 12, 1942, the Teruzuki was targeted by American PT boats as it tried to protect a convoy of supply ships on Guadalcanal's northern coast, according to historians. The Teruzuki was hit by two U.S. torpedoes, breaking its rudder and disabling the ship. Most of the crew were rescued or swam ashore, but nine men died as the Teruzuki plunged to the bottom of the ocean.",
      "A remotely operated camera launched by the Exploration Vessel (E/V) Nautilus brought the first glimpse of the ship since that day when it spotted the wreck on July 10, the trust said. The massive warship had been severed, with its stern and hull 650 feet apart on the seafloor \u2014 but its munitions were still intact.",
      "An eerie video released by the trust shows the stern armed with multiple depth charges. One scientist can be heard on the video saying that an expert warned the team to be \"extra careful as some Japanese ordnance at this time of the war had a reputation for being really sensitive.\"",
      "The team also noted that the ship was found with its forward artillery turrets pointing skyward.",
      "\"When the exploration team found a 19-meter-long severed segment of Teruzuki's stern littered with depth charges, it disproved a long-held theory that it was depth charge explosions that sealed the ship's fate,\" the trust said in a separate news release.",
      "Ship located in Iron Bottom Sound",
      "Iron Bottom Sound in the Solomon Islands was the site of five pivotal naval battles between August and December 1942.",
      "Located about 600 northeast of Australia, the Solomon Islands became coveted territory for both Japan and the Allied Forces during World War II. The tiny island of Guadalcanal was key because of its airfield and its location, which offered command over shipping lanes in the region.",
      "\"Recognizing this island and airfield's strategic value, both sides would soon commit substantial naval and air resources to control the island, the airfield, and its surrounding waters,\" the Ocean Exploration Trust  said.",
      "Dozens of warships were sunk in Iron Bottom Sound, and the Teruzuki is just the latest to be discovered. Earlier this month, the same researchers found the severed bow of the American warship USS New Orleans during seafloor mapping operations in the area.",
      "In addition to the Teruzuki, at least six Japanese warships were lost off Guadalcanal between August and December 1942, according to the trust, and at least 10 Allies ships were lost during the same period.",
      "One of the American vessels lost in the area ws the USS Laffey, a Benson-class destroyer that survived a major battle in October 1942 but was sunk in Guadalcanal on November 12, 1942. One of the ships that sank USS Laffey was in fact the Teruzuki, which had only seen combat for a few months until its demise.",
      "The designs and details of Japanese naval ships were cloaked in secrecy during World War II. There are no historical images of the\u00a0  Teruzuki, making the new discovery especially revealing, the trust said.",
      "\"I feel so lucky to see this ship. The fact that we have not seen Teruzuki in over 80 years underscores the importance of recording maritime heritage now,\" said Hiroshi Ishii, a Nautilus science team member and researcher at Kyoto University. \"As a Japanese person, I appreciate the opportunity to witness part of our history and to be part of an international team shedding light on this campaign, which is important to all of our nations' history.\"",
      "In 2023, the wreckage of a Japanese ship that was torpedoed during World War II off the coast of the Philippines was found. The ship was carrying Allied prisoners of war, most of them Australians, when it sank in 1942. All 1,080 people aboard perished.",

      "Mr. Trump also said Monday the U.S. has reached a deal to sell weapons to NATO nations, and Rutte said those countries will in turn send weapons to Ukraine to replenish their depleted stockpiles. The Pentagon paused shipments of some weapons shipments to Ukraine earlier this month, but Mr. Trump reversed course last week, saying Ukraine must be able to defend itself.",
      "\"We've made a deal today where we're going to be sending them weapons and they're going to be paying for them,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"We, the United States, will not be having any payment made. We're not buying it, but we will manufacture it, and they're going to be paying for it.\"",
      "\"This is really big,\" said Rutte, who said Mr. Trump called him last week to inform him of his decision. \"And the decision is that you want Ukraine [to have] what it needs to have to maintain to be able to defend itself against Russia, but you want Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical.\"",
      "Mr. Trump \u00a0expressed frustration with Putin, following his multiple calls with the Russian leader since taking office in January.",
      "\"I always hang up, say, 'Well, that was a nice phone call.' And then missiles are launched into Kyiv or some other city and I say, 'That's strange.' And after that happens three or four times, you say, the talk doesn't mean anything,\" he said.",
      "\"He's \u2014 I don't want to say he's an assassin, but he's a tough guy,\" Mr. Trump said of Putin, adding that Putin has fooled other presidents, \"but he didn't fool me.\"",
      "\"Ultimately, talk doesn't talk, it's got to be action, it's got to be results,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "He voiced similar sentiments to CBS News partner network BBC News Tuesday, saying of Putin, \"We'll have a great conversation. I'll say: 'That's good, I'll think we're close to getting it done,' and then he'll knock down a building in Kyiv.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he'd thought a deal was close with Russia four different times.",
      "The BBC reports that, when asked if he was \"done with\" Putin, Mr. Trump replied: \"I'm disappointed in him, but I'm not done with him. But I'm disappointed in him.\"",
      "Zelenskyy posted on X Monday afternoon that he spoke with Mr. Trump, and thanked him and the U.S. for the \"willingness to support Ukraine.\"",
      "\"We discussed the necessary means and solutions with the president to provide better protection for people from Russian attacks and to strengthen our positions,\" Zelenskyy wrote. \"We are ready to work as productively as possible to achieve peace.\"",
      "Some in Congress have pushed for even higher secondary sanctions on Russia as the war grinds on. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal are pushing legislation in the Senate that would give the president the ability to impose tariffs of up to 500% on any country that does business with Russia. Graham told\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that these sanctions would give Mr. Trump a \"sledgehammer\" to end the war.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-imposes-tariff-fresh-mexican-tomatoes/",
    "published": "Mon, 14 Jul 2025 23:41:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Fresh tomatoes from Mexico \u2014 which supplies about 70% of the U.S. tomato market \u2014 will face a 17.09% duty.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is imposing a 17% tariff on most fresh Mexican tomatoes, the federal government said Monday, ending a yearslong agreement with the U.S.' southern neighbor over trade practices.",
      "The move comes amid a separate push by President Trump to increase tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, including Mexico, which was told over the weekend to\u00a0expect 30% tariffs starting in August. Critics argue the president's tariff strategy could push up consumer prices. But Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said in a statement Monday that the decision on tomatoes is \"in line with President Trump's trade policies and approach with Mexico.\"",
      "\"Mexico remains one of our greatest allies, but for far too long our farmers have been crushed by unfair trade practices that undercut pricing on produce like tomatoes. That ends today,\" Lutnick said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The U.S. gets around 70% of its tomatoes from Mexico, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange. Roughly $3 billion worth of tomatoes are exported from Mexico to the U.S. every year, an almost threefold jump over the last 15 years, federal data shows.",
      "Supporters argue the tariffs could give a boost to the domestic tomato industry, which the Florida Tomato Exchange says has been \"decimated by an influx of cheap Mexican tomatoes.\" But others warn the move could lead to higher prices and harm U.S. companies that rely on imported tomatoes.",
      "The tariffs follow a complicated,\u00a0nearly three-decade-long dispute over allegations that Mexican tomato producers were illegally selling tomatoes to the U.S. at unfairly low prices, harming U.S. growers. The federal government\u00a0struck a deal\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 during Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 that averted \"anti-dumping\" duties on tomatoes in exchange for Mexican producers agreeing to a minimum sale price.",
      "In April, the Commerce Department announced the U.S. would exit that deal in 90 days, saying it \"has failed to protect U.S. tomato growers from unfairly priced Mexican imports.\" The Commerce Department said it would impose 20.91% tariffs \u2014 slightly higher than the 17.09% levies announced Monday.",
      "The Florida Tomato Exchange praised the move in a statement Monday. The group's executive vice president, Robert Guenther, called it \"an enormous victory for American tomato farmers and American agriculture.\"",
      "A group of lawmakers in Florida \u2014 which is one of the U.S.' largest tomato-producing states \u2014\u00a0praised the planned duties\u00a0in a letter to Lutnick last month. Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, called the move \"a major victory for American growers and producers.\"",
      "But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged Lutnick not to exit the deal on Friday, arguing the Trump administration should try to cut a new deal with Mexico instead. The group said \"the import and sale of Mexican tomatoes generate an estimated $8.3 billion in economic benefits,\" and warned withdrawing from the deal could trigger retaliation from Mexico.",
      "\"Terminating the Agreement would likely have widespread repercussions on the U.S. economy, affecting agriculture, warehousing, logistics, grocery, and restaurant industries,\" the group said in a letter to Lutnick.",
      "The lead-up to Monday's decision also drew criticism from some Democrats.",
      "\"ARIZONA, BUY YOUR TOMATOES NOW!!\" Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, wrote on X last week. \"Groceries are already too expensive. [Mr. Trump] needs to reverse this decision now.\"",
      "\"Salsa will be pricier, shelves emptier, and groceries more expensive. Tens of thousands of jobs, including 30,000 Texans, will be at risk,\" Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas Democrat,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Mexico's agriculture and economy ministries criticized the move in a statement Monday, saying it was \"unfair and against the interests not only of Mexican producers but also of the U.S. industry.\" They also said the massive growth in tomato exports to the U.S. \"stems from the quality of the product, not from any unfair practices.\" The Mexican government said it expected to find a solution to the dispute.",
      "Mr. Trump has sent letters to dozens of U.S. trading partners over the last week threatening higher tariffs starting August 1, partially reinstating some of the steep country-by-country levies that were rolled out by the Trump administration in April, but quickly delayed for 90 days. The president argues the tariffs are necessary to protect domestic jobs and correct unfair trade practices, but many economists argue tariffs can lead to sluggish economic growth and higher prices.",
      "Food prices grew 2.9% in the 12-month period ending in May \u2014 higher than the country's overall 2.4% inflation rate, but well below mid-2022, when food prices were growing upwards of 10% year-over-year, according to federal data. The price of tomatoes fell 6.8% from May 2024 to May 2025.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers last month he expects tariffs to have some impact on prices. But he added: \"We really don't know how much of that's going to be passed through the consumer. We have to wait and see.\"",

      "Marten largely cut off ties with her family when she began dating Gordon in 2016, and the couple moved around a lot, according to reports.",
      "Marten had told the court they absconded because they wanted to keep their daughter Victoria, after their other four children were taken into care.",

      "Samantha Yelland, London's senior crown prosecutor at the Crown Prosecution Service, said that the couple's \"reckless actions were driven by a selfish desire to keep their baby no matter the cost \u2013 resulting in her tragic death,\" the BBC reported.",
      "\"Justice... has finally been served for baby Victoria\"",
      "Marten had told police Victoria died when she fell asleep in the tent while holding her under her jacket.",
      "Detective Superintendent Lewis Basford of the Metropolitan Police welcomed the verdict.",
      "\"Today, the justice we have long fought for... has finally been served for baby Victoria,\" he said.",
      "\"The selfish actions of Mark Gordon and Constance Marten resulted in the death of a newborn baby who should have had the rest of her life ahead of her.\"",
      "He said the conviction was a vindication of the authorities' decision to take Marten's four other children into care. The pair will be sentenced on Sept. 15.",
      "Detective Chief Inspector Joanna Yorke led the homicide investigation into Victoria's death.",
      "\"We know today's verdict won't bring Victoria back, but I am pleased our investigation has resulted in the couple who caused her death finally being brought to justice,\" Yorke said in a statement Monday.",

      "Subsequent 2016-2017 test excavations found significant quantities of baby remains in a subterranean disused septic tank at the location, which now sits within a housing complex.",
      "Scientists say the remains are largely mixed together, the BBC reports, and a number of methods will be used to try to put remains back together and, where possible, identify them.",
      "Catholic nuns ran a so-called \"mother and baby\" institution there between 1925 and 1961, housing women who had become pregnant outside of marriage and been shunned by their families.",
      "After giving birth, some children lived in the homes too but many more were given up for adoption under a system that often saw church and state work in tandem.",
      "The history of unwed Irish mothers forced into hard labor is\u00a0well-documented. Oppressive and misogynistic, the institutions \u2014 which operated nationwide, some not closing until as recently as 1998 \u2014 represent a dark chapter in the history of once overwhelmingly Catholic and socially conservative Ireland.",
      "A six-year enquiry sparked by the initial discoveries in Tuam found 56,000 unmarried women and 57,000 children passed through 18 such homes over a 76-year period.",
      "It also concluded that 9,000 children had died in the various state- and Catholic Church-run homes nationwide.",
      "Records unearthed show as many as 796 babies and young children died at the Tuam home over the decades that it operated.",
      "Its grounds have been left largely untouched after the institution was knocked down in 1972 and housing was built there.",

      "Annette McKay, whose mother Maggie was sent to the home in Tuam when she was 17, told BBC Radio program that she believes her older sister Mary Margaret's remains could be in the mass grave.",
      "\"Mum's grave still doesn't have her name on the headstone,\" she told BBC Radio. \"It has my brother's and it has my stepfather's and I was the one that said 'let's wait for Mary Margaret.'\"",

      "It will involve exhumation, analysis, identification if possible, and re-interment of the remains found, its director Daniel MacSweeney told a recent press conference in Tuam.",
      "It follows local historian Catherine Corless in 2014 producing evidence that the 796 children \u2014 from newborns to a 9-year-old \u2014 had died at the home.",
      "State-issued death certificates she compiled show that various ailments, from tuberculosis and convulsions to measles and whooping cough, were listed as the cause of death.",
      "Corless' research indicated the corpses were likely placed in the disused septic tank discovered in 1975, while prompting the state-backed enquiries that have uncovered the full scandal of the homes.",

    "story": [
      "European markets mostly fell Monday as investors digested President Trump's latest trade war salvos, which saw him threaten to hit the European Union and Mexico with 30% tariffs starting on August 1. Mr. Trump's threat came after a series of announcements last week that included warnings of a possible 50% levy on all copper imports and all goods from Brazil, 35% levies on Canadian goods, and a possible 200% tariff on imported pharmaceuticals.",
      "In announcing his latest intentions on Saturday, Mr. Trump cited Mexico's role in illicit drugs flowing into the United States and a trade imbalance with the European Union.",
      "The move threw months of painstaking talks with Brussels into disarray.",
      "European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has insisted the EU still wants to reach an accord with the U.S. On Sunday, the bloc delayed its planned retaliation for separate U.S. duties on steel and aluminum. EU officials had threatened in May to impose tariffs on U.S. goods worth around $117 billion, including cars and planes, if talks fail, from July 14.",

      "\"We have always been clear that we prefer a negotiated solution,\" von der Leyen said, adding: \"We will continue to prepare countermeasures so we are fully prepared.\"",
      "In April, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on dozens of countries, quickly pausing them for three months to negotiate deals. As that 90 day period ended this week, Mr. Trump started sending tariff letters to leaders, but he pushed back the date of implementation of the threatened levies until August, The Associated Press reported.",
      "The EU's trade chief, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, said he planned to speak with his U.S. counterparts on Monday.",
      "\"I'm absolutely 100% sure that a negotiated solution is much better than the tension which we might have after the 1st of August,\" \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told journalists in Brussels. \"I cannot imagine walking away without genuine effort. Having said that, the current uncertainty caused by unjustified tariffs cannot persist indefinitely and therefore we must prepare for all outcomes, including, if necessary, well-considered proportionate countermeasures to restore the balance in our transit static relationship.\"",
      "He noted that the EU was also \"doubling down on efforts to open new markets\" beyond the United States.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron backed efforts to reach an agreement that \"reflects the respect that trade partners such as the European Union and the United States owe each other,\" but he urged the bloc to \"step up the preparation of credible countermeasures\" in the event the two sides fail to reach an agreement.",
      "Shares fell in Frankfurt and Paris, though London saw prices tick higher.",
      "In Asia, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seoul, Singapore, Manila, Bangkok and Jakarta all rose, while Tokyo, Sydney, Taipei, Mumbai and Wellington edged down.",
      "Bitcoin hit a new record high of $123,205.",
      "\"It is hard to say whether the muted market response over the week is best characterised by resilience or complacency,\" National Australia Bank's Taylor Nugent said. \"But it is difficult to price the array of headlines purportedly defining where tariffs will sit from 1 August when negotiations are ongoing.\"",
      "Data showed Chinese exports jumped more than expected in June after Washington and Beijing agreed a tentative deal to lower levies on each other. That included a 32.4% surge in shipments to the U.S., which had dropped in May.",
      "Traders were also keeping a nervous eye on the Federal Reserve as Mr. Trump continued to berate boss Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates soon enough, saying Sunday \"I hope he quits,\" and \"he should quit.\"",

      "The doctor is accused of injecting the victims, aged between 25 and 94, with deadly cocktails of sedatives and in some cases setting fire to their homes in a bid to cover up his crimes.",
      "The accused had \"visited his patients under the pretext of providing medical care,\" prosecutor Philipp Meyhoefer said at the opening of the trial at the state court in Berlin.",

      "\"Why do people kill?\"",
      "A further 96 cases were still being investigated, a prosecution spokesman told AFP, including the death of Johannes M.'s mother-in-law.",
      "She had been suffering from cancer and mysteriously died the same weekend that Johannes M. and his wife went to visit her in Poland in early 2024, according to media reports.",
      "The suspect reportedly trained as a radiologist and a general practitioner before going on to specialize in palliative care.",
      "According to Die Zeit, he submitted a doctoral thesis in 2013 looking into the motives behind a series of killings in Frankfurt, which opened with the words \"Why do people kill?\"",
      "The doctor allegedly \"administered an anesthetic and a muscle relaxant to his patients without their knowledge or consent,\" the Berlin prosecutor's office\u00a0said in a statement. \"The latter paralyzed the respiratory muscles, leading to respiratory arrest and death within minutes.\"",
      "In five cases, Johannes M. allegedly set fire to the victims' apartments after administering the injections.",
      "On one occasion, he is accused of murdering two patients on the same day.",
      "On the morning of July 8, 2024, he allegedly killed a 75-year-old man at his home in the Berlin district of Kreuzberg.",
      "\"A few hours later\" he is said to have struck again, killing a 76-year-old woman in the neighboring Neukoelln district.",
      "Prosecutors say he started a fire in the woman's apartment, but it went out.",
      "\"When he realized this, he allegedly informed a relative of the woman and claimed that he was standing in front of her flat and that nobody was answering the doorbell,\" prosecutors said.",
      "In another case, Johannes M. \"falsely claimed to have already begun resuscitation efforts\" on a 56-year-old victim, who was initially kept alive by rescuers but died three days later in hospital.",
      "Echoes of other cases",
      "The case recalls that of notorious German nurse Niels Hoegel, who was handed a life sentence in 2019 for murdering 85 patients.",
      "Hoegel, believed to be modern Germany's most prolific serial killer, murdered hospital patients with lethal injections between 2000 and 2005, before he was eventually caught in the act.",
      "More recently, a 27-year-old nurse was given a life sentence in 2023 for murdering two patients by deliberately administering unprescribed drugs.",
      "In March, another nurse went on trial in Aachen accused of injecting 26 patients with large doses of sedatives or painkillers, resulting in nine deaths.",
      "Last week, German police revealed they are investigating another doctor suspected of killing several mainly elderly patients.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. French Hill, Republican of Arkansas, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 13, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Congressman French Hill. He is the chair of the House Financial Services Committee. Welcome back to the broadcast. Your ears must have been ringing with the two senators who started the program, because they were talking about grabbing some of those frozen Russian assets. You moved a bill and gave the president authority to actually seize them during the last administration, under the REPO Act. The U.S. has never before seized central bank assets from another country. Do you know if the Treasury Department is going to do so now?",
      "REP. FRENCH HILL: Well, Margaret, it's good to be with you. Yes, I certainly worked very hard with former Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul and others to put that in our 2024 national security package during the Biden administration, because we wanted another arrow in the quiver for the president to not just seize those assets, but to convert them to the benefit of Ukraine. But we could never get consensus between the United States and Europe for doing that, despite a unanimous vote of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe supporting it. So I continued to urge President Biden to do that. We got the interest off those frozen assets to benefit Ukraine, but I think it's time for the president to convert those seized assets to a trust account for the benefit of Ukraine. I'm glad to hear both Senators Blumenthal and Graham support that idea. It's time to do it, and I've encouraged Secretary Bessent that this should be a priority for President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On another topic, because you have some oversight in the financial space, I want to ask you about comments made in regard to Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The president says the economy is in good shape, but he still complains about the head of the central bank, says he's doing a terrible job because he's not lowering interest rates. On another network today, the president's top economic adviser said the White House is looking into whether the president has the authority to fire Chair Powell. Do you believe the president has the power and authority to fire the Fed president?",
      "REP. HILL: You know, Margaret, I don't, and I believe President Trump has spoken about this several times over the past few years, including recently. Mr. Powell's governorship, his chairmanship, is up next spring. The president has vacancies coming up on the Fed board, where he could name another governor. But look, just because Congress created the Fed and that we believe that it should be independent in the setting of monetary policy, it doesn't mean that it's immune from criticism. And every president since World War Two has had choice words for the Fed chair when they've not been in sync with the direction of the president. So look, the Congress continues to do oversight. I set up a special task force to oversee the Fed's decision making since the 2008 financial crisis. We have that investigation, review, and oversight underway, and we'll continue it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you'd acknowledge that most presidents might have those choice words behind closed doors, not on social media posts on a regular basis, Congressman. But on crypto, I want to ask you. Crypto has been the Wild West, right, in many ways, because they don't have the same kind of regulation in the digital asset space that there does exist for banks and financial services. You've got a few measures coming up this week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you make sure, as you put these regulations in place that kind of help crypto become more mainstream, that it doesn't also benefit some of those on the black market, for example, who use this to evade oversight?",
      "REP. HILL: Exactly. Well, in the work in the Senate led by Bill Hagerty and Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis on the GENIUS Act to create a dollar-backed stablecoin, we've heavily influenced that legislation over the two years of previous work by the House and our Clarity Act, which sets up the rules of the road for what's a commodity, what's a security, how to use digital assets, how to store them, how to custody them. These are the rules that will protect consumers, will limit access to our market and our investors from entities outside the United States trying to influence the crypto markets. We have none of that today. What we've had is a mismatch of rules by enforcement in the Biden administration, and I believe the bills we'll have on the House floor this week will protect investors, consumers, and make America, as President Trump wants, a leader in financial technology and crypto and digital assets innovation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, sir, that the concern is that this is the patina of protection of consumers without actual muscle behind it. It was interesting to see, and many Americans who hold mortgages might have noticed, that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy and sell mortgages, that the head of the agency, the Federal Housing Agency, Bill Pulte, told them they'll have to prepare a proposal to review crypto as an asset on mortgage applications.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Given the huge taxpayer stake in Fannie, Freddie, are you comfortable with people using crypto, something that isn't really, you know, tangible in many ways, to pay for a down payment on a house?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, look at Bitcoin, for example. One can now buy Bitcoin. It is a commodity. It's been determined that it's a commodity by the CFTC and the SEC. One can hold it in their brokerage account through an exchange-traded product, an ETF, ETP. It's now an asset for millions of Americans, and it certainly could be treated like a stock or a bond or cash as a contribution to someone's net worth to qualify for a mortgage. And if we pass Clarity this week, which I expect we will on a bipartisan basis, and we craft a dollar-backed stablecoin like GENIUS offered by Senator Hagerty, we'll have the rules of the road. It won't be a patina of consumer enforcement. It will be real consumer enforcement, investor protection--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And the down payment for a house--",
      "REP. HILL: --both by the CFTC, the SEC, and the bank, and the bank regulators. Well, look again. Bitcoin is an asset. You can determine if you think it's going to go up in value or down in value, just like stocks and bonds or other investments that people have on their financial statement to secure their financial statement for a net- for net worth purposes or to liquidate for a down payment. So, I think it's a financial asset. Our bills will make it a more secure one, and one that's better for, I think, all households and businesses.",

If you do anything by mistake, it will affect someone\u2019s life,\u2019\" Wells shared.",
      "\"He said, \"I think Marty must have done something that changed Jennifer Parker\u2019s parents. One of the parents changed. So instead of your parents meeting, it was Elisabeth Shue\u2019s parents who met, where one parent was different. And therefore, they gave birth to Elisabeth Shue\u2019s version of Jennifer, not yours. And when he went into the present, everyone thought it was just normal because no one realized all the changes Marty made.\"",

      "This bacterium is so lethal, even at small doses, that it's been classified as a \"Tier 1 select agent\" by the CDC and is considered a \"potential bioterror weapon,\" according to Peer.",
      "Co-study author Prof. Dan Peer, left, is pictured with Dr. Inbal Hazan-Halefy, center, and Ph.D. student Shani Benarroch of Tel Aviv University. The team has developed a new vaccine that is \"100% effective\" against bacteria that is deadly to humans. (Tel Aviv University)",
      "\"Several natural local outbreaks have been recorded in the past few years, indicating that Y. pestis still poses a risk to the human population,\" he noted.",

      "The findings were published in the journal Science Advances.",
      "\"Our mRNA vaccine provides 100% protection against pneumonic plague, which is considered the most dangerous form of the disease.\"",
      "Before this study, mRNA vaccines were only shown to protect against viruses, such as COVID-19, but not bacteria, according to Tel Aviv University\u2019s Dr. Edo Kon, who co-led the study.",
      "\"Until now, scientists believed that mRNA vaccines against bacteria were biologically unattainable,\" said Kon in the announcement. \"In our study, we proved that it is, in fact, possible to develop mRNA vaccines that are 100% effective against deadly bacteria.\"",

      "Instead, the scientists used a different method to release bacterial proteins that successfully created a \"significant immune response.\"",

      "\"This research demonstrates yet another large application area for the technology.\"",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The primary limitation of the study, according to Peer, is that the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness was shown in mice.",

      "\"If tomorrow we face some kind of bacterial pandemic, our study will provide a pathway for quickly developing safe and effective mRNA vaccines.\"",
      "\"Due to excessive use of antibiotics over the last few decades, many bacteria have developed resistance to antibiotics, reducing the effectiveness of these important drugs,\" said Peer.",

      "Maxwell is serving out her prison sentence in Tallahassee, Florida. It is set to end in 2037.",

    "summary": "Florida tops First Liberty Institute&apos;s religious liberty rankings, with legislation passed by Gov. Ron DeSantis cited for the state&apos;s roughly 20-point improvement since 2022.",
    "story": [
      "The attorney general spoke about the DOJ's efforts to protect religious freedom rights during a hearing and indicated to lawmakers that she was focused on a range of religions, from Judaism to Islam.",
      "The Sunshine State ranks as the nation's number one defender of religious liberty out of all 50 states, according to the First Liberty Institute's fourth annual Religious Liberty in the States (RLS) index.",
      "For the first time, Florida tops the national rankings, followed by Montana, Illinois, Ohio and Mississippi. Illinois and Mississippi have garnered a spot in the top five every year since the index was first released by the First Liberty Institute's Center for Religion, Culture & Democracy (CRCD)\u00a0in 2022.",
      "The index uses a detailed scoring system measuring legal protections and ranking states based on the percentage of possible safeguards they have adopted.",
      "This year, with 2025's rankings, nearly 55 percentage points separates Florida from the last-place state, West Virginia, which has been last on the index for three years in a row.",
      "PARENT GROUPS, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY EXPERTS HAIL SCOTUS UPHOLDING PARENTS RIGHTS IN LGBTQ BOOKS CASE",
      "Florida was just given the top spot in conservative legal group First Liberty Institute's 2025 religious liberty rankings, with the group citing the state's increased protections for the religiously affiliated. (iStock)",
      "\"We find that the states are laboratories of religious liberty where different protections for free exercise can be implemented and tested,\" CRCD Executive Director Jordan Ballor wrote in an introduction for the 2025 index. \"One of the major goals of the RLS project is to raise awareness of what different states are doing. There are positive lessons to be learned from this experimentation, as states that have been at the vanguard of protecting religious liberty can serve as exemplars for states that have lagged behind.\"",
      "The index's accompanying report points out that Florida \"is an exemplar\" for how state lawmakers can improve their protections around religious freedom. According to the report, the Sunshine State has improved nearly 20 percentage points since the first RLS index was released in 2022.",
      "Much of this improvement came from legislation passed in 2023 strengthening religious protections that allow healthcare providers to refuse to participate in medical procedures or services, such as abortion or sterilization, based on their religious or moral beliefs. The report also pointed to Florida's passage of legislation in 2022 protecting houses of worship from discriminatory treatment during pandemics and other emergencies.",
      "Florida was crowned number one among all 50 states in the First Liberty Institute's 2025 religious liberty rankings. (Getty Images; iStock)",
      "\"Florida holds several #1 rankings, leading the nation in education, economy, and tourism \u2013 and now, Florida is #1 in religious liberty,\" said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. \"We\u2019re grateful for this recognition from the First Liberty Institute, which has just named Florida the number one state in the nation for protecting religious liberty.\"",
      "PASTOR URGES TRUMP TO PROTECT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AFTER ALLEGED BIDEN CRACKDOWNS",
      "\"This year\u2019s findings show clearly that states taking legislative action are pulling ahead,\" added Kelly Shackelford, president, CEO and chief counsel at First Liberty. \"Under the leadership of Gov. DeSantis, Florida passed real laws that protect real people, and now the Sunshine State is the national leader in protecting religious liberty. It\u2019s time for more states to follow Gov. DeSantis\u2019s example and adopt strong religious liberty laws.\"",
      "While Florida was pointed to in the RLS index as an \"exemplar,\" the report stated that religious freedom was becoming increasingly \"tenuous\" in the blue state of Illinois. The move downward for the Land of Lincoln was not because the state repealed protections, but mainly because it has not implemented new protections that other states, like Florida, have, the report noted.",
      "Per the 2025 RLS report, almost all of Illinois' protections came when the state was more conservative between 1934 and 1998.",

It said the state's complacency contributed to Colorado's \"abysmal\" 43rd-place finish in the 2024 RLS rankings and 34th finish in the 2025 rankings released Monday.",
      "The First Liberty Institute said the results of the 2024 election may give some people the idea that passing laws protecting religious liberty is not as important, but the conservative Christian legal group warned this is \"emphatically not the case,\" noting that data shows passing such laws is just as critical amid a \"favorable\" political climate."

This powerful feature lets you unsubscribe from dozens of mailing lists in just a few clicks, no more opening each email one by one or risking your privacy with sketchy unsubscribe links. Let's dive into how this tool works, how you can use it, and why it's a game-changer for anyone who wants a cleaner, more manageable Gmail inbox.",

This feature compiles every email list you're subscribed to, showing the sender's name, email address, and how many messages you've received recently, all in one convenient place. With just a click, you can unsubscribe from any or all of these lists without leaving the page. The tool offers several key benefits. You can quickly unsubscribe from dozens of mailing lists in just a few seconds.",
      "All of your active subscriptions are displayed on a single page, so there's no need to hunt through your inbox or open individual emails. It's also safer, as it avoids the risks of clicking on unknown or potentially malicious unsubscribe links found in some messages.",
      "Gmail's Manage Subscriptions tool also provides a secure and convenient way to reduce inbox clutter without depending on third-party services. Unlike those apps, Gmail's feature doesn't ask for access to your inbox, helping protect your personal data. It's built directly into Gmail, works with your current setup, and doesn't require any extra downloads or paid plans. In some cases, you may still need to visit a sender's website to complete the unsubscribe process, and Gmail will give you options like \"Go to website\" or \"Block\" on mobile.",

      "Make a habit of visiting Gmail's Manage Subscriptions page every few weeks. This tool shows you all the mailing lists you're currently subscribed to and how frequently each sender contacts you. Unsubscribing from irrelevant or annoying lists only takes a click and helps prevent your inbox from being overrun with marketing emails.",
      "Set up Gmail filters to automatically archive, label, or delete certain types of messages. For example, you can filter out promotional offers that arrive too often. This keeps your inbox focused without manually sorting through messages every day.",
      "Think twice before clicking on \"unsubscribe\" links in unfamiliar or suspicious emails. Some of these links are used in phishing attacks to confirm your email address or trick you into handing over personal information. If you're unsure, it's safer to use Gmail's built-in tools instead.",
      "For Android devices, Google Play Protect offers built-in malware protection and can automatically remove known threats. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices. That's why it's important to add a trusted antivirus app.",
      "The same goes for iPhones, Macs, and PCs. While Apple and Microsoft have built-in defenses, adding reputable antivirus software gives you extra layers of protection against phishing, ransomware, and other digital threats.",

      "See my picks for the best antivirus protection of 2025 for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech.",
      "Consider creating an alias email address for online shopping, newsletters, and one-time sign-ups. This keeps promotional messages out of your main inbox and makes it easier to manage subscriptions. By creating email aliases, you can protect your information and reduce spam. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",
      "For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Mail.",
      "When you receive an unwanted email, don't just delete it, mark it as spam. Gmail uses this feedback to improve its filtering system and automatically catch similar messages in the future. This helps protect not only your inbox, but other users' too.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Gmail's new Manage Subscriptions tool is a long-awaited upgrade for anyone tired of inbox overload. With the ability to see all your subscriptions in one place and unsubscribe in bulk, you can reclaim your inbox, and your attention, in just a few minutes. If you haven't spotted the feature yet, keep an eye out as Google continues to roll it out to more users. In the meantime, enjoy a cleaner, more focused email experience, one click at a time.",

    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/why-you-should-think-twice-before-joining-power-saver-program",
    "published": "Mon, 14 Jul 2025 15:00:42 -0400",
    "summary": "Despite the benefits, residential power saver programs come with several potential drawbacks and concerns that have been raised by both customers and experts.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior national correspondent William La Jeunesse reports on proposed changes to California's electric bills on 'Special Report.'",
      "Power saver programs are utility-sponsored demand response initiatives that help reduce electricity usage during periods of peak demand. These programs typically target central air conditioners (AC) and heat pumps, since cooling equipment drives spikes in summer energy demand. In exchange for incentives such as bill credits or rebates, participating homeowners allow the utility to temporarily adjust or cycle their HVAC systems on hot days.",
      "But it\u2019s not all that straightforward. I recently received an email from Leah, an HVAC professional based in Rio Rancho, New Mexico.",
      "\"I would like to see an article about the push for Smart Thermostats, and the convergence of the utilities' attempts to control air conditioning usage to conserve energy.\"",
      "He pointed to a growing push for smart thermostats and what he sees as an effort by utilities to take more control over air conditioning use, all under the banner of energy conservation.",
      "Let\u2019s discuss the power saver programs in detail, including their pros, cons and everything else you need to know.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER",
      "A smart thermostat (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How power saver programs control your AC",
      "Most residential power saver programs function by temporarily reducing air conditioner usage at participating homes during peak periods (usually summer afternoons). In most cases, the utility installs a control device on the outdoor AC unit\u2019s compressor. During a peak event, a radio signal from the utility will cycle the compressor off and on at set intervals. Legacy programs like Xcel Energy\u2019s Saver\u2019s Switch use this method.",
      "Another method utilities use is controlling thermostats. You\u2019re asked to enroll your Wi-Fi smart thermostat in a bring-your-own-thermostat program. During a demand response event, the utility or program operator remotely raises the thermostat setpoint for a few hours. This causes the AC to run less. Most of these programs allow you to override the change via the thermostat or app; however, emergency events may temporarily disable this option.",
      "Benefits of joining a power saver program",
      "Power saver programs provide several benefits for both participating consumers and the wider community. First, there are bill savings and incentives. Participants receive direct financial rewards, ranging from annual bill credits of up to $40 to up-front enrollment bonuses of $25-$100.",
      "These programs also result in collective demand reduction during peak times, helping prevent grid overloads and blackouts. By coordinating energy reductions across thousands of homes, utilities can avoid firing up expensive peaker plants or purchasing high-priced electricity on the open market.",
      "Reducing peak demand can also help avoid turning on older, more polluting fossil-fuel generators. That means fewer CO\u2082 emissions and lower air pollution on the hottest days, when health risks are already high.",
      "A smart thermostat\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Drawbacks and risks of power saver programs",
      "Despite the benefits, residential power saver programs come with several potential drawbacks and concerns that have been raised by both customers and experts.",
      "\"In New Mexico, where I live and work, our electric utility, PNM, offers a 'Power Saver' program. Customers can opt in to have a box mounted to their condenser, which disrupts the signal between the furnace and the condenser during peak consumption hours, effectively shutting it down,\" Leah tells me.",
      "\"It\u2019s not great for the condenser, and we often get calls from customers who don\u2019t fully understand what they signed up for and are confused when their AC stops working. Now, there\u2019s a push to gain access to Wi-Fi-enabled thermostats to achieve the same goal. They want to control our ACs.\"",
      "Understandably, many people are uncomfortable with utilities taking over their cooling systems, especially in extreme heat. Take the 2022 incident with Xcel Energy in Colorado. During an energy emergency, 22,000 smart thermostat users were temporarily locked out of adjusting their ACs. Many had never experienced a no-override event before and were understandably frustrated. While rare, these incidents raise valid concerns about control and consent.",
      "There are also technical concerns. Frequent short cycling of AC compressors can lead to increased wear and tear. Every startup strains the compressor motor, and repeated on-off cycles within a short period may reduce efficiency or shorten the unit's lifespan, although this depends on the system and the frequency of the events.",
      "HOW 432 ROBOTS ARE RELOCATING A 7,500-TON HISTORIC BUILDING",
      "Smart thermostats and utility control: What to know",
      "Some people enrolled in thermostat adjustment programs without realizing it. This leads to confusion and frustration when their air conditioning is unexpectedly limited. Often, this happens because smart thermostats come with default opt-in settings or vague incentive language that can be confusing.",
      "In Texas in 2021, many residents saw their smart thermostats rise above 78\u00b0F during an ERCOT conservation alert. They later found out they had unknowingly agreed to let utilities make temperature adjustments.",
      "Privacy and security concerns with smart thermostats",
      "These programs also raise important data privacy concerns. Wi-Fi-enabled thermostats collect and transmit sensitive information, including occupancy patterns, temperature preferences and when a home is likely unoccupied.",
      "Cybersecurity is another issue. Like any internet-connected device, smart thermostats can be vulnerable to hacking or malicious remote commands. So far, no major breaches have impacted AC demand programs, but privacy advocates say the risks are real and growing.",

      "Whether you're thinking about signing up or are already enrolled, these steps will help you stay in control, protect your comfort and avoid unwanted surprises:",
      "Before you join any power saver or thermostat program, read the terms completely. Ensure you understand the extent of the utility's control, whether you can override changes and how frequently adjustments may occur. Always choose manual enrollment during smart home app setup instead of letting it enroll you automatically.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Use a Wi-Fi thermostat that makes it easy to override changes during demand response events. Many models let you opt out temporarily or permanently through the app or the device itself. Learn how to do this before a peak event occurs, so you're not caught off guard.",
      "Find expert-reviewed smart thermostats that put you in control at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/SmartThermostats",
      "Turn on alerts from your utility so you receive notifications about peak demand events by email, text or app. Check your utility\u2019s website for schedules or forecasts and opt out in advance if needed. Staying informed gives you more control over how your system behaves.",

It's designed to create ultra-detailed tattoos quickly, cleanly and with less pain than traditional methods. And yes, it still uses real needles and real ink. But the way it works is totally different.",
      "How the AI tattoo machine applies ink with precision",
      "Once a human operator starts the process, the machine scans your skin. It then gets to work, placing ink with incredible accuracy. It's quiet. It's steady. And according to early users, it hurts a lot less. That's because the machine goes shallower into the skin than a human artist might. This avoids nerve endings that normally cause pain during a tattoo.",

      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why tattoo clients might prefer an AI tattoo machine",
      "Let's say you want a custom tattoo from an artist across the country. Normally, you'd need to travel, book months in advance, and hope the artist is available. With Blackdot, you can get that same artwork in your city, without ever meeting the artist in person. The machine can handle everything from ultra-sharp lettering to lifelike portraits. It can even replicate a child's handwriting or a piece of original art down to the tiniest detail. And if you're nervous about pain or needles, this machine might make you more comfortable than a traditional tattoo shop.",
      "How tattoo artists can benefit from AI tattoo machines",
      "Blackdot isn't trying to replace tattoo artists. It's trying to give them more options. Artists can license their work to be used by the machine. They control how many times a design can be tattooed. They approve the final work. And they get paid quickly. This opens up tattooing to painters, illustrators, digital artists, photographers and more. You no longer have to be a tattoo artist to get your work on someone's skin.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why some tattoo artists push back against AI tattoo machines",
      "Of course, not everyone is excited about this change. Some tattoo artists feel like a machine doesn't belong in an industry built on human connection and trust. They say machines can't replace the experience that comes from years of working with different skin types and guiding clients through the emotional side of getting a tattoo. They also worry about losing jobs, or about AI removing the \"soul\" of a hand-drawn tattoo.",
      "Some tattoo artists are exploring AI tattoo machines with curiosity",
      "At the same time, some artists are curious. A few have even tried tattooing side-by-side with the machine to see how it compares. One artist described it like watching a dinosaur stare at a meteor; he didn't think it would take over, but he knew it would change things. And in some cases, artists say the machine handles tedious jobs like fine lettering better than they can.",
      "The future of AI tattoo machines in salons, studios, and beyond",
      "Blackdot has big plans. It's not just focused on tattoo shops. The company wants to put machines in permanent makeup studios, high-end salons, barbershops and fashion stores. It also launched something called the Blackdot Gallery, where people can buy digital tattoo art that can be turned into real tattoos. You can even trade and collect tattoos the way you might trade digital art or collectibles.",
      "The machine goes shallower into the skin than a human artist might. This avoids nerve endings that normally cause pain during a tattoo. (Blackdot)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The AI tattoo machine isn't here to erase tradition. It's here to expand it. It offers new ways to create, new ways to connect, and a more comfortable experience for people who have always wanted a tattoo but held back. But it also raises big questions about what we value in a tattoo. Is it the art itself, or the artist behind it?",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Every day, millions of people install tiny browser add-ons they believe will improve productivity or entertainment. With so many options available on the Chrome Web Store, users often rely on trust markers like install counts, user reviews and developer reputation to make their choice. Many glance at shiny verification badges and five-star ratings, assume the vetting process was solid, and click \"Install\" without thinking twice.",
      "But attackers have started to exploit these very signals. Researchers recently uncovered a campaign where 18 browser extensions, all listed on the official Chrome and Edge Web Stores, tracked users\u2019 online activity. These extensions had already racked up more than 2 million installs.",

      "A person using Google on a laptop.\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How hackers are hiding malware in popular Chrome extensions",
      "Koi Security researchers discovered that attackers used long-term, strategic tactics to weaponize browser extensions. First, they released functional and legitimate utilities to gain user trust. Over time, these extensions collected positive reviews and built a solid reputation. Then, after months or even years of quiet operation, the attackers pushed a silent update that injected malicious scripts into the trusted codebase.",
      "Since these updates came directly from official sources, they easily bypassed corporate firewalls. Unlike phishing emails or shady downloads, the malicious code arrived through routine, automatic updates and raised no immediate red flags.",
      "How malicious Chrome extensions evade detection and spread",
      "As the investigation progressed, researchers traced suspicious traffic back to a seemingly harmless color picker extension. This led them to a cluster of connected domains, each acting as a command and control hub. These servers recorded every URL users visited and issued commands to force redirects to fake websites or ad-heavy landing pages.",
      "Next, the team analyzed the extension\u2019s code more closely and uncovered matching fingerprints in several unrelated tools. These included weather widgets, emoji keyboards, video speed controllers and volume boosters. Although they appeared different on the surface, they shared underlying code and behavior.",
      "HOW 432 ROBOTS ARE RELOCATING A 7,500-TON HISTORIC BUILDING",
      "Together, these extensions reached over two million installations. To avoid detection, the attackers used separate branding and categories for each one, making it difficult for marketplace monitors to spot patterns.

      "Using millimeter wave (mmWave) imaging, the same type of signal used in Wi-Fi, the researchers developed a system called mmNorm. There\u2019s nothing normal about this superpower.

      "NONINVASIVE BRAIN TECH AND AI MOVES ROBOTIC HAND WITH THOUGHT",
      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "How robots detect damage inside boxes using mmWave imaging",
      "Millimeter waves are particularly effective at penetrating materials such as cardboard, plastic and even interior walls. When these waves hit an object inside a box, they reflect. The mmNorm system captures these reflections and feeds them into an algorithm that estimates the shape and direction of the surface of the hidden item.",
      "Unlike traditional radar systems, mmNorm accounts for a challenging property called specularity, which refers to the way radio waves bounce off shiny or angled surfaces, much like a mirror. By estimating the surface normal (the direction a surface is facing), the system's accuracy improves dramatically. The method combines reflections from multiple antennas that \"vote\" on the surface normal direction based on signal strength, improving the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The technology powering robots that detect damage inside boxes",
      "What makes mmNorm different is its clever use of physics. Instead of ignoring reflections that bounce away from the radar (as most systems do), it captures them to infer the shape and orientation of hidden surfaces. Lead author Laura Dodds explained that the system doesn't just track where a signal comes from. It also analyzes the direction the surface is facing. To do this, the MIT team used a robotic arm equipped with a radar unit. As it moved around a sealed box, it gathered multiple measurements, building a detailed 3D picture of what was inside.",
      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "Why robots that detect damage inside boxes are a game-changer for warehouses",
      "During testing, mmNorm achieved 96% accuracy in reconstructing complex items, such as power drills and silverware. That's a big jump compared to the 78% accuracy offered by similar systems. In a warehouse setting, this means robotic arms could inspect the contents of packages moving down a conveyor belt without unpacking them.",
      "It also opens the door for humanoid robots to roam warehouses and assess packages for damage or missing parts in real time. However, the technology does not work well for objects hidden behind metal or very thick walls, which limits some applications.",

      "AI AND LEARNING RETENTION: DOES CHATGPT HELP OR HURT?",
      "A woman on the phone with customer service\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How chatbots are changing customer service for businesses",
      "A chatbot is an artificial intelligence tool designed to simulate real-time conversations with users. It operates around the clock, doesn't require breaks and can manage a high volume of requests simultaneously. For businesses, that sounds like an ideal solution. It's no surprise that the chatbot market has surged from $370 million in 2017 to $2.2 billion in 2024. Many companies now rely on chatbots as the first point of contact for customer service. Despite the convenience, not all customers are on board.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why most customers still prefer human agents over chatbots",
      "While companies are excited about the speed and efficiency of chatbots, many customers are not. A recent survey found that 71% of people would rather speak with a human agent. Even more concerning, 60% said chatbots often do not understand their issue. This is not just about getting the wrong answer. It comes down to trust. Most people are still unsure about artificial intelligence, especially when their time or money is on the line.",
      "Customer service representatives (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS CHATGPT?",
      "When customers want a human agent instead of a chatbot",
      "Not every customer question is the same. Some are simple and quick. Others are more complex or personal. And that's where chatbots fall short. A recent survey showed that 47% of people were OK with a company using their purchase history for marketing. But only 9% were OK with the company using their financial information. That's a big difference. When things feel more sensitive or serious, people want a real person to help.",
      "New research compares chatbots to human agents in customer service",
      "To better understand how people really interact with chatbots and human agents, researcher Vivek Astvansh partnered with a large North American retailer and analyzed more than 500,000 customer service chats. The findings are detailed in his peer-reviewed study, \"Insights from Customers' Chats with Bots and Human Agents.\"",
      "The study found that most inquiries fell into one of six categories: orders, coupons, products, shipping, account issues and payments. When customers had questions about detailed or sensitive topics, such as shipping or payment issues, they were far more likely to seek out a human agent rather than rely on a chatbot. Astvansh's research also revealed that human agents were more effective at matching the content and communication style of the customer than chatbots.",
      "This similarity in language and topic focus led to stronger rapport between customer and agent. In fact, the closer the agent's responses aligned with the dominant topic of the conversation, the faster and more frequently customers replied. The data suggests that customers feel more engaged when they sense they are being understood, which is a key driver of satisfaction during service interactions.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "How businesses can improve customer service with a hybrid approach",
      "So, how can businesses use these insights to improve customer service? Not every customer issue should be handled by a chatbot. Companies should determine the intent behind each inquiry before deciding whether it should be routed to a bot or a human.",
      "Human agents already know how to mirror a customer's tone and focus. For chatbots to succeed, they must be trained to recognize and adapt to customer intent and language patterns. While this doesn't come naturally to machines, it can be programmed using machine-learning models like those used in the study.",
      "If a company is investing in a chatbot system, it should track how well that system performs. Businesses should ask chatbot vendors to provide real-world data showing how their bots compare to human agents in terms of efficiency, accuracy and customer satisfaction. If the technology cannot meet a high standard, it may not be worth the investment.",
      "A man on the phone with customer service\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AI tools, such as chatbots, are helpful and are not going away anytime soon. But customers still want to feel heard and understood. That usually means talking to a real person. The best approach is not to replace humans but to use both people and technology in the right ways. Let the chatbot handle the quick stuff. Bring in the human when the conversation really matters.",

      "Pulling into a station, swapping your electric car battery and getting back on the road in under two minutes is now a reality.",
      "In China, CATL's swappable EV batteries are making this possible. This innovation is transforming the way drivers think about electric vehicle charging by making it fast, easy and as convenient as refueling with gasoline.",

      "ENERGY-SUCKING AI DATA CENTERS CAN LOOK HERE FOR POWER INSTEAD",
      "EV battery swapping station\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "What are swappable EV batteries?",
      "Swappable EV batteries are modular battery packs that can be quickly exchanged instead of recharged. CATL, a global leader in battery technology, created a system called Choco-SEB that allows drivers to replace a drained battery in about 100 seconds. This makes battery swapping a realistic alternative to traditional EV charging.",
      "Swappable EV battery on screen at launch event\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "How CATL's Choco-SEB battery system works",
      "CATL's Choco-SEB battery system is focused on speed and flexibility. It is designed to support a wide range of electric vehicles, from compact city cars to larger sedans. The system lets drivers swap batteries quickly and choose the setup that matches their needs best. With this technology, a single battery swap can deliver up to 373 miles of range, depending on the vehicle.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The Choco-SEB batteries are available in two sizes, making them adaptable for different car models. Drivers can install one, two or even three battery blocks, depending on how much driving range they want. For compact cars, the system can provide up to 311 miles of range, while midsize vehicles can achieve as much as 373 miles per swap. This flexibility makes the Choco-SEB system a practical solution for a wide variety of drivers and travel needs.",
      "Illustration of where swappable EV batteries are placed in a vehicle\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "CATL swappable EV batteries offer high-efficiency and safe chemistry",
      "The battery uses a blend of lithium iron phosphate and nickel manganese cobalt. This mix offers a balance of performance and safety, with an energy density of more than 160 Wh/kg and 325 Wh/L. The first car to launch with a Choco-SEB swappable EV battery is the Changan Oshan 520. It starts at around 166,800 yuan, or roughly $23,100. The vehicle offers a 320-mile range and is already gaining traction. Changan has delivered over 1,000 units and has received more than 15,000 orders.",

      "Battery swapping stations are expanding across China",
      "CATL is actively building a network of battery swap stations across China. As of now, 34 stations are operating in Chongqing. More than 50 are expected by the end of the year.",
      "By the end of 2025, CATL plans to have 1,000 stations across 31 cities. Each station is compact, requiring the space of just three parking spots, and they can hold up to 48 swappable EV batteries.",
      "CATL is working with major automakers, including GAC, Chery, NIO, FAW and BAIC. The company holds almost 29% of the global EV battery market. With the addition of swappable EV batteries, it is strengthening its position as a leader in the industry.",
      "EV battery swapping station\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "Why swappable EV batteries could change the industry",
      "Swappable EV batteries address one of the biggest challenges facing electric vehicles: long charging times. Instead of waiting 30 minutes or more, drivers can swap batteries in minutes and get back on the road with the ease of a gas-powered car.",
      "The concept is gaining traction in Asian markets and holds promise for global expansion. In the U.S., however, challenges such as vehicle compatibility, automaker collaboration, infrastructure needs and consumer acceptance remain significant.",
      "Some U.S.-based pilots and partnerships, including Stellantis collaborating with Ample for a fleet in Spain, point to growing interest. Still, CATL's Choco-SEB battery swap system has not been announced for rollout in the U.S.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "CATL's goal is to make electric vehicle ownership easier and more appealing. Swappable EV batteries give drivers the flexibility to power up without plugging in. With more stations on the way and compatibility across a wide range of cars, this system could redefine what it means to drive electric. While this technology isn't coming to the U.S. just yet, American EV manufacturers may want to take note, as swappable battery tech could be the game-changer drivers have been waiting for.",

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, taking your eyes off the road for just five seconds at 55 mph is like driving the length of a football field with your eyes closed.

      "Panelists Brian Brenberg and Ricky Cobb comment on the Newark airport disruptions on \u2018Fox News Saturday Night.\u2019",
      "Microsoft hasn't received much love for Windows 11, with many users still reluctant to ditch Windows 10 even four years after the newer OS launched. The main reasons include Microsoft's constant push to use its own services, strict hardware requirements and questionable interface changes.",
      "But if you're looking for yet another reason to dislike Windows 11, security researchers recently uncovered a critical vulnerability affecting Secure Boot. This feature is supposed to prevent malware from loading during startup. Now, hackers can bypass that protection and silently infect systems. The flaw allows attackers to disable Secure Boot on nearly any modern Windows PC or server, leaving even fully updated devices open to stealthy, undetectable malware.",

      "WINDOWS PCS AT RISK AS NEW TOOL DISARMS BUILT-IN SECURITY",
      "Windows PC\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is the Secure Boot vulnerability in Windows 11?",
      "The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-3052, was discovered by firmware security firm Binarly. They found that a legitimate BIOS update tool signed by Microsoft could be abused to tamper with the Windows boot process. Once exploited, the flaw allows attackers to shut off Secure Boot entirely. In the wrong hands, this vulnerability could lead to a new generation of malware. These threats could bypass even the most advanced antivirus or detection software.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Hackers can abuse Microsoft-signed tools to shut down Secure Boot",
      "At the center of the issue is a BIOS-flashing utility built for rugged tablets. Microsoft signed it using its UEFI CA 2011 certificate. Because that certificate is trusted on nearly every Secure Boot-enabled system, the tool can run without raising alarms. The danger lies in how the tool handles a specific NVRAM variable. Binarly's researchers found that it reads this variable blindly, without checking what's inside. That small oversight opens the door to a serious exploit.",
      "In a demonstration, Binarly used a proof-of-concept attack to change this variable's value. By setting it to zero, they were able to overwrite a global setting critical to enforcing Secure Boot. That action completely disabled Secure Boot protections. Once that happens, unsigned UEFI modules can run freely. Attackers can then install stealthy, low-level malware known as bootkits, malware that operates below the Windows operating system itself. For hackers, this method offers the ultimate persistence.",
      "Windows laptop\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Microsoft released a fix-but you must act to stay protected",
      "Binarly reported the flaw to CERT/CC in February 2025. At first, it appeared to affect only a single module. But Microsoft's deeper investigation uncovered a bigger problem. The same vulnerability affected 14 modules signed with the same trusted certificate. Microsoft responded in June 2025 by revoking the cryptographic hashes of all 14 affected modules. These hashes were added to the Secure Boot revocation list, known as the dbx. This prevents the modules from running during startup. However, this protection is not automatic. Unless users or organizations manually apply the updated dbx, their systems remain vulnerable, even with other patches installed.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "How long has this Windows tool been circulating?",
      "Binarly revealed that the vulnerable tool had been online since late 2022. Someone uploaded it to VirusTotal in 2024, but it went unnoticed for months. At this point, it's unclear whether any attackers have used it in the wild. We reached out to Microsoft for comment but did not receive a response before our deadline.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Six essential tips to protect your Windows 11 PC from hackers",
      "Protecting your PC doesn't have to be complicated. Just follow these simple steps to keep hackers at bay and your information safe.",
      "1. Keep your computer updated:\u00a0Software updates aren\u2019t just about new features. They fix serious security issues. In this case, Microsoft has already released a fix for the Secure Boot vulnerability, but it only works if your system is fully updated. Just head to your settings, open Windows Update, and make sure everything is installed. A lot of people delay updates for weeks, but these patches are the first line of defense against threats like this.",
      "2. Don\u2019t install tools you don\u2019t fully understand:\u00a0It might be tempting to download apps that claim to speed up your computer or fix problems, especially ones recommended in YouTube videos or tech forums. But that\u2019s exactly how a lot of threats sneak in. This particular vulnerability came from a legitimate-looking tool that was misused. So, if you\u2019re not sure what something does or if it asks for permission to change how your system boots up, skip it. Or ask someone who knows more, before you click anything.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and leave it running:\u00a0Even though this new threat targets something deep inside the system, having strong antivirus protection still helps catch related malware. If you're on Windows, Defender is already built in and does a decent job. But if you don\u2019t want to rely on Windows\u2019 built-in tools, use a third-party antivirus.",

      "4. Restart your computer every now and then:\u00a0This one sounds basic, but it matters. A lot of updates don\u2019t fully apply until after a restart. If you keep putting your computer to sleep or hibernating it for days at a time, your system might still be stuck in an unsafe state. Try to restart it at least every couple of days, or whenever an update asks for it.",
      "5. Don\u2019t ignore warnings from Windows or your antivirus:\u00a0If something pops up telling you a file looks dangerous or that an update is needed, pay attention. It\u2019s easy to get into the habit of closing these messages without reading them, but that\u2019s how problems get missed. If a warning looks confusing or too technical, take a screenshot or a photo, and ask someone for help. The important thing is not to ignore it and move on.",
      "6. Remove your personal data from people-search sites:\u00a0Even if hackers don't directly target you through the Secure Boot flaw, many cyberattacks begin by gathering personal information that's easily found online. This can include your full name, address, phone number and even the names of your relatives. Data broker websites collect and publish this information without your consent, putting you at greater risk. Using a personal data removal service helps you reduce your online exposure and make it harder for bad actors to target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap - and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "A woman wearing non-invasive brain technology\u00a0 (Carnegie Mellon University)",
      "How noninvasive brain tech turns thought into action",
      "Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have made significant progress with noninvasive brain technology. They use electroencephalography (EEG) to detect the brain's electrical activity when someone thinks about moving a finger. Artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning algorithms, then decodes these signals and translates them into commands for a robotic hand. In their study, participants managed to move two or even three robotic fingers at once, just by imagining the motion. The system achieved over 80% accuracy for two-finger tasks. For three-finger tasks, accuracy was over 60%. All of this happened in real time.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Meeting the challenge of finger-level control",
      "Achieving separate movement for each robotic finger is a real challenge. The brain areas responsible for finger movement are small. Their signals often overlap, which makes it hard to distinguish between them. However, advances in noninvasive brain technology and deep learning have made it possible to pick up on these subtle differences.",
      "The research team used a neural network called EEGNet. They fine-tuned it for each participant. Because of this, the system allowed for smooth, natural control of the robotic fingers. The movements closely matched how a real hand works.",
      "A robotic finger being controlled by non-invasive brain technology\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why noninvasive brain tech matters for everyday life",
      "For people with limited hand function, even small improvements can make a huge difference. Noninvasive brain technology eliminates the need for surgery because the system is external and easy to use. In addition, this technology provides natural and intuitive control. It enables a person to move a robotic hand by simply thinking about the corresponding finger movements.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The accessibility of noninvasive brain technology means it can be used in clinics and homes and by a wide range of people. For example, it enables participation in everyday tasks, such as typing or picking up small objects that might otherwise be difficult or impossible to perform. This approach can benefit stroke survivors and people with spinal cord injuries. It can also help anyone interested in enhancing their abilities.",
      "What's next for noninvasive brain tech?",
      "While the progress is exciting, there are still challenges ahead. Noninvasive brain technology needs to improve even further at filtering out noise and adapting to individual differences. However, with ongoing advances in deep learning and sensor technology, these systems are becoming more reliable and easier to use.

      "While multi-factor authentication adds critical protection, it works best when combined with strong, unique passwords for every account. That\u2019s where a password manager comes in. Instead of trying to memorize dozens of complex passwords, a password manager securely stores them for you and automatically fills them in when needed. It can generate strong, random passwords, store them in an encrypted vault, and sync across your devices so you always have access. Using NordPass along with multi-factor authentication is one of the best strategies to keep your accounts and personal data safe from hackers.",

      "Fake agent phone scams are targeting victims across the United States",
      "Reports of these calls have come in from New York, Illinois, Virginia, and nearly every other state. Some victims have lost thousands of dollars. In Michigan, scammers increased their credibility by using the real names and ranks of local officers. Meanwhile, in Maryland, suspects posing as FTC agents even showed up in person twice to collect cash. This scam is not limited to phone calls. Text messages, known as \"smishing\" attacks, are also on the rise. One version targeted iPhone users with fake DMV payment demands.

      "Why fake agent phone scams succeed and how they manipulate trust",
      "Fraudsters know how to exploit fear effectively. They count on the fact that most people will do almost anything to avoid arrest or protect a family member. By spoofing official numbers, they undermine our first line of defense: trust. However, it is not just about technology. Experts also warn of an emotional manipulation crisis. These scammers don't just steal your money, they steal your identity too. As a result, victims feel violated, scared, and uncertain about whom to trust.",

      "If someone calls claiming to be from a government agency and demands money, don't explain or ask questions; just hang up. Real law enforcement will never ask for payment over the phone, and they won't threaten you into silence.",
      "No legitimate government agency will ever ask you to settle a legal issue with a prepaid gift card or a trip to a Bitcoin ATM. These are hallmark signs of a scam, designed to move your money fast and leave no trace.",
      "The number on your screen might look official, but spoofing technology can fake any number, even 911 or the FBI. If the caller creates pressure or fear, hang up and verify using an official number from the agency's website.",
      "Even if you don't fall for the scam, reporting it can help authorities track these operations. Contact your local FBI field office, your state's Attorney General, or file a report at reportfraud.ftc.gov. Every report helps build a stronger case.",
      "Scammers often target people who are more likely to believe a false threat, especially seniors or non-native English speakers. Have a conversation with family and friends so they know what to look out for and what to do if they receive a suspicious call or message.",
      "Many scammers do their homework before making contact. They might already know your name, address, or even a relative's name to sound more convincing. Using a reputable personal data removal service can reduce the chances of your private information being misused. The less data available online, the fewer hooks criminals have to grab onto.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap - and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "These criminals are getting smarter, but so can we. Staying informed and understanding what real law enforcement will never do is key to protecting yourself and your family. Authorities will not threaten you over the phone, demand gift cards or cryptocurrency, or ask you to prove your innocence with money. If something feels off, trust your gut. Also, spread the word, because the more people who know, the harder it is for these criminals to succeed.",

      "Illustration of Emojis on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Scientific evidence: Emojis boost closeness and responsiveness",
      "A recent study led by Eun Huh at The University of Texas at Austin put this idea to the test. Researchers asked 260 adults to read text conversations that were identical except for one thing: the presence of emojis. Participants then rated how responsive and engaged their conversation partner appeared to be.",
      "The results? Messages with emojis made people feel their partners were more attentive and emotionally engaged. This perceived responsiveness led to greater feelings of closeness, higher relationship satisfaction, and even increased likability. And it didn't matter whether the emoji was a smiley face or a simple object; what mattered was that it matched the tone of the message.",
      "Example of a text exchange using emojis on an iPhone. (Eun Huh)",
      "Why emojis strengthen relationships in digital communication",
      "Emojis act as digital body language. In face-to-face conversations, we rely on tone, facial expressions, and gestures to show we care. In texts, emojis fill that gap by adding emotional nuance and clarity. They can make your intentions clear, reduce misunderstandings, and help your messages feel more personal and warm.",

      "Do all emojis equally enhance relationship closeness?",
      "Interestingly, the type of emoji, whether a smiling face or a random object, didn't make a difference in how responsive the sender seemed. What matters most is that the emoji is emotionally consistent with your message. So, don't stress over picking the \"perfect\" emoji; just make sure it fits the mood of your text.",

      "Emojis in texts: More than just fun, a tool for connection",

They're a modern twist on age-old ways of adding nonverbal cues to written messages, like underlining or using exclamation marks. And with billions of emojis sent every day, they're clearly here to stay.",

      "Google has taken a major step toward the future of clean energy by partnering with Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), an MIT spin-out working to build one of the world\u2019s first commercial fusion reactors. This Google fusion deal marks a pivotal moment for the tech giant as it looks to secure reliable, carbon-free power for its growing AI operations.",

      "A person browses Google on a laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Inside Google\u2019s historic fusion power deal",
      "Google will purchase 200 megawatts (MW) of electricity from CFS\u2019s planned ARC fusion power plant in Chesterfield County, Virginia. This amount of power could support roughly 150,000 to 200,000 homes. More likely, it will help run Google\u2019s expanding network of AI data centers. The actual usage will depend on how Google allocates the electricity.",
      "This is Google\u2019s first energy deal involving fusion technology. It is also the largest fusion power purchase agreement signed so far. The ARC plant is projected to begin operations in the early 2030s, though fusion projects often face delays. While the electricity does not yet exist, the deal highlights growing demand for long-term, clean energy solutions.",
      "Steam rises from cooling towers at a nuclear facility. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How nuclear fusion works and why it matters for clean energy",
      "Fusion is the same process that powers the sun. Instead of splitting atoms like traditional nuclear power, fusion forces hydrogen atoms to fuse together at extremely high temperatures. This reaction releases enormous amounts of energy. It does not produce greenhouse gases or long-lived radioactive waste.",
      "Scientists have worked on fusion for decades, but no one has produced fusion power at commercial scale yet. CFS aims to change that with its SPARC demonstration reactor, now under construction in Massachusetts. The larger ARC plant is planned to deliver commercial fusion energy.",
      "Hands framing the sun during a bright orange sunset. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Google invests in fusion to meet rising AI energy demands",
      "Google\u2019s energy needs are growing quickly as it scales up artificial intelligence models and data infrastructure. Since 2010, the company has invested in renewable sources like wind, solar, and geothermal. However, these sources are not always available when needed.",
      "Fusion could solve this problem by providing round-the-clock clean energy. By signing this agreement, Google is securing future power and helping to speed up fusion technology development. The company has also expanded its investment in CFS to support the ARC project.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Google\u2019s new partnership with CFS is the largest fusion energy deal ever signed. The company will purchase 200 MW of clean power from a future reactor in Virginia. The ARC plant is expected to come online in the early 2030s. Google is the first major company to sign on as a customer for commercial fusion energy. Unlike traditional nuclear power, fusion produces no carbon emissions and no long-lived radioactive waste. It also offers consistent, 24/7 electricity. As Google\u2019s AI systems drive up energy demand, this deal shows how tech companies are looking beyond wind and solar for scalable, future-proof solutions. If CFS delivers, fusion could finally move from science experiment to real-world power source.",

      "Brian Wice is a Houston-based post-conviction attorney who says that the brothers scored a new victory that is completely separate from their current bid for parole.",

      "MENENDEZ BROTHERS SCORE CRUCIAL LEGAL VICTORY IN DECADES-LONG FIGHT AS THEY AWAIT POTENTIAL FREEDOM",
      "\"My understanding is that the relief that they have sought is an entirely new trial, because they claim that with this newly discovered, newly available evidence that there's a reasonable probability, and that's the test \u2014 not a certainty \u2014 a reasonable probability the outcome would have been different,\" he said.",
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez were convicted and sentenced to life without parole in a bloody shotgun massacre that left their parents, Jose and Mary \"Kitty\" Menendez dead. Jose was shot six times, and Kitty 10.",
      "They have spent more than 35 years in jail for the slayings in a case that captivated the world.",
      "In March 2023, the brothers filed a habeas petition claiming that evidence was forbidden from being presented at their trial. That evidence, they say, would have led a jury to find them not guilty.",

      "Further, an affidavit from Roy Rossello, a member of a boy band called Menudo, claimed Jose, who was a record executive, raped him when he was a 14-year-old boy in 1983 or 1984. Rossello made the claim almost 40 years after the alleged rape.",
      "If that information had been available to a jury, the brothers claim, they would not have been convicted. They also contend that the letter and the affidavit constitute new evidence that must be considered.",
      "In an informal response to that petition, filed by Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman's office in February of this year, prosecutors denied that the letter and the affidavit constituted new evidence. They said that the Cano letter was \"untimely.\" They also said the Rossello affidavit was \"inadmissible, immaterial, and lacks credibility.\"",

      "Still, on July 8, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge William C. Ryan, said that the letter and the affidavit constituted a prima facie showing that the brothers are entitled to habeas relief, and ordered Hochman's office to respond to the claim and explain why the brothers should not be granted the relief.",

      "\"Essentially, this is your last ditch, all hands on deck, let's see what we can do to create a miracle, kind of context,\" he said.",
      "If the trial judge were to grant the habeas petition in favor of the brothers, vacating their conviction, that decision would then be reviewed by the California Court of Appeals, and after that, the California Supreme Court, Wice said. Either of those entities could say the trial judge erred in his or her decision, and refuse the brothers' opportunity for a new trial.",
      "\"They're in a position to win, and like I said, in the context of habeas, it's survive and advance,\" Wice said, using a basketball analogy. \"They survive and advance to another round. Are they going to cut down? Who knows?\"",

When the Jews emerged victorious, 156,000 Arabs remained within what became Israel.

      "Under the terms of the JCPOA, any signatory can unilaterally call up snapback sanctions if Iran is found to have violated the terms of the agreement.",
      "Though the U.S., which, alongside the U.K., France, Germany, China and Russia, signed the 2015 deal, was deemed by the U.N. and other JCPOA members unable to utilize the mechanism after Washington withdrew from the agreement in 2018 during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Despite repeated calls by the U.S. to enforce snapback \u2013 which would legally enforce all 15 U.N. members on the council, including Russia, to reimpose sanctions on Iran \u2013 no one on the UNSC or JCPOA has yet taken steps to enforce the sanctions.",

      "\"The problem is the lack of a game plan. Has America provided Europe with a game plan, a road map for post-snapback?\" he added, noting there needs to be a much larger strategy for next steps should sanctions be reinforced.",
      "Though the U.S. assesses that Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been stunted by up to two years, experts remain convinced that Tehran\u2019s atomic ambitions have not been deterred, and its ties to terrorist networks and adversarial nations mean it remains a top security concern.",

      "The GHF, which has faced stiff backlash for its divergence from traditional humanitarian assistance methods, has argued that its convoys have been far better secured from Hamas attacks than United Nations\u2019 delivery trucks, and therefore ensured the aid has actually ended up in the hands of Palestinian civilians.",
      "Hamas has long used humanitarian assistance as a means of control over Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and as a tool for recruitment, going so far as to threaten starving civilians from accepting\u00a0GHF food aid for their families in late May, telling them they \"will pay the price, and we will take the necessary measures.\"",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 For months, President Donald Trump\u2019s main message about the sweeping bill he pushed through Congress was that it was \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cbeautiful.\u201d",
      "Now that it\u2019s also law, the White House and its outside allies are pivoting to a more concrete, detailed description in the hopes that voters will have a clearer idea of what it means for their day-to-day lives.",
      "Democrats are poised to contest the Republican talking points at every turn, as the parties jockey for advantage over a tax cut and spending package that could swing the midterm elections next year.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a battle royal for the hearts and minds of the American people from now until November 2026,\u201d said Terry Holt, a former senior adviser to the Republican National Committee.",
      "Two Republican strategists said they are advising lawmakers to sell the act to a wider audience using different titles: the \u201cWorking Family Tax Cuts\u201d act or possibly the \"Trump Working Family Tax Cuts.\"",
      "The names allude to new policies such as no taxes on tips or overtime that could save money for Black, Latino and other voters who were important parts of Trump's 2024 electoral coalition, the strategists said.",
      "At the same time, the strategists are advising lawmakers to tout the additional money that will be going to their states for border enforcement and other priorities.",
      "\"Working families\" is a phrase that polls well and gives Republicans an opening to persuade voters they\u2019ll save money under the new law, said one of the strategists, who is working on Senate races.",
      "Trump remains pleased with the alliterative turn of phrase he coined and is apt to keep using it, allies said. But as midterm elections approach, GOP leaders grasp that they need to redefine Trump's signature legislative victory in people's minds.",
      "\"Big\" and \"beautiful\" may capture Trump's feelings about the law, but the superlatives say nothing about what the measure means for Americans worried about the prices of gas and groceries.",
      "\u201cThe president is going to say whatever he wants \u2014 he\u2019s earned that,\u201d said the other GOP strategist, who is close to Trump. \u201cWe are selling what the bill does to make sure our coalition knows that Trump delivered for them and they come back in 2026.\"",
      "Polling shows that Republicans have work to do. An Economist/YouGov survey taken after Trump signed the bill July 4 showed that only 35% of adults supported it, compared to 53% who opposed it. What\u2019s more, opposition rose 10 points since the last survey in April.",
      "\u201cThe polling on that has been crystal clear that with the electorate overall, the bill is significantly underwater in terms of its popularity,\" Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said. \u201cIt is most deeply underwater with people who have been following it most closely and know the most about it.\u201d",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News: \u201cThe One Big Beautiful Bill was the largest tax cut for middle class and working families in American history. The White House looks forward to continue working with our friends on Capitol Hill to define what this historic piece of legislation means for Americans across the country.\u201d",
      "In the weeks ahead, Trump Cabinet secretaries will largely be the ones showcasing popular portions of the bill that fall within their purview, White House officials said.",
      "While Trump is expected to highlight parts of the bill during an upcoming trip to Pennsylvania, any presidential travel focused on pitching the bill to voters is not set as of this point.",
      "Past presidents traveled extensively to drive home the benefits of far-reaching legislation they'd passed. After signing into law the Affordable Care Act in March 2010, then-President Barack Obama traveled to Iowa, North Carolina and Maine to explain and celebrate the expansion of healthcare coverage.",

      "An analysis last week by the Tax Policy Center concluded that the coming tax changes are \u201cregressive,\u201d benefiting wealthy households the most.

      "For Republicans and Democrats alike, the run-up to the midterms will be a scramble to shape voter impressions of the new law. Democrats will stress the cuts to the popular Medicaid program providing health insurance to low-income households; Republicans will emphasize tax cuts and new spending on border security.",
      "But the White House believes other parts of the bill that may not have gotten as much attention are also widely popular. A senior Trump administration official said that internal Republican polling shows a planned overhaul of the nation's air traffic control system is the best-liked component of the act.",
      "At stake is control of Congress. If Democrats win a majority in either the House or the Senate, they could paralyze Trump\u2019s agenda through the end of his term.",
      "The challenge that the GOP faces is that \u201cpeople don\u2019t want Medicaid cut,\u201d Holt said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want housing prices to skyrocket. They don\u2019t want any of it and that\u2019s mostly what they\u2019ve heard about so far. The president will try to bend that narrative to advantage in tactical ways around the county so they can mitigate their losses in the 2026 election.\u201d",
      "Asked about Republican lawmakers who voted to pass the bill, Holt added: \u201cI can\u2019t explain it any other way but that they fear Donald Trump more than they fear their own electorate.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump may have expected a Russian shudder of fear to greet his threat of \u201cvery severe tariffs\u201d on the country if it didn\u2019t agree a ceasefire in Ukraine. Instead, his comments appear to have prompted a collective public shrug.",
      "Calling Trump's statements \u201cvery serious,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that Russia needs \u201ctime to analyze\u201d them.",
      "But investors in the Russian capital who had been gearing up for tougher measures instead embraced a 50-day grace period on tariffs set by Trump on Monday and the Moscow Stock Exchange was up by 2.7% after it opened Tuesday morning.",
      "Oil prices also fell by more than $1 after the announcement, hinting that investors don't think Trump will follow through on his threat to impose the tariffs.",
      "Trump \u201cdid not announce any immediate anti-Russian measures or the confiscation of illegally blocked Russian assets,\u201d Leonid Slutsky, a prominent nationalist politician, said on Telegram Tuesday, adding that the president was trying to balance Western support for Kyiv while avoiding a confrontation with the Kremlin.",
      "Trump announced the levies along with the shipment of new weapons to Ukraine during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at the White House on Monday.",
      "His comments came as a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) made its way through Congress. If passed, it would seek to impose 500% tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil and gas.",
      "Praising Trump\u2019s announcement, Graham and his bill\u2019s co-sponsor,  Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn) said in a statement that \u201cthe ultimate hammer to bring about the end of this war will be tariffs against countries, like China, India and Brazil, that prop up Putin\u2019s war machine by purchasing cheap Russian oil and gas.\u201d",
      "However, Konstantin Kosachev, the Deputy Chairman of the Russian Federation Council, the upper house of the country\u2019s parliament, said Graham\u2019s bill made \u201cno sense.\u201d In 50 days, \u201chow much can change both on the battlefield and in the mood of those in power both in the U.S. and in NATO?\u201d he added.",
      "And former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, a hardliner who frequently issues over-the-top threats, called Trump\u2019s threat a \u201ctheatrical ultimatum\u201d in a post on X.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don\u2019t have a deal in 50 days, tariffs at about 100%,\u201d Trump said, without providing further details.",
      "After the announcement, a White House official said Trump's threat of 100% tariffs was referring to Russian goods, as well as secondary sanctions on other countries that buy its exports.",
      "The president\u2019s comments signal a marked shift in tone over his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, for whom he has long shown admiration. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for a long time. We\u2019ve always gotten along well,\u201d Trump said back in March.",
      "Many Western countries have have cut most of their own financial ties to Moscow during since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its smaller neighbor, triggering the first major land war in Europe since World War II.",
      "Still, buyers of Russia's crude oil like China and India have continued financing Moscow\u2019s war chest with hundreds of billions of dollars through business with the world\u2019s third-largest oil producer.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about tariffs on countries like India and China that are buying their oil,\u201d Matt Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO told reporters Monday after Trump\u2019s announcement. \u201cAnd it really is going to, I think, dramatically impact the Russian economy.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s threats of secondary tariffs are \u201cnever going to go anywhere\u201d as long as he is unwilling to impose costs on Moscow directly, Keir Giles, a senior fellow at the London-based Chatham House think tank, told NBC News Monday.",
      "The tariffs also risk upending delicate China-U.S. trade talks, according to Liu Baocheng at Beijing's University of International Business and Economics.",
      "The \u201cunilateral imposition of punitive trade measures...risks creating new and unnecessary complications,\u201d Baocheng said, adding that the 100% secondary tariffs intended to pressure Moscow could instead \u201cseverely backfire by undermining global economic stability and fragmenting international cooperation.\u201d",
      "Most concerning, Baocheng added, was that the threat comes at a delicate juncture in U.S.-China trade relations, where secondary tariffs on Chinese companies or sectors that import Russian goods \u201cwould seriously damage the fragile momentum of dialogue.\u201d",
      "Trump's tariff agenda has also raised the stakes for India, which has been negotiating a trade deal with Washington to see tariffs on goods from India drop below 20%.",
      "India\u2019s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar told reporters Tuesday that his country had \u201cbeen in touch\u201d with Graham over its concerns and interests on energy and security.",
      "Elsewhere, Europe\u2019s chief negotiator Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told reporters in Brussels on Monday that a 30% tariff on European goods would have a \u201chuge impact on trade.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will be almost impossible to continue trading as we are used to in a transatlantic relationship,\u201d \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said."

      "Martindale grew up on farms in upstate New York and Indiana, the child of missionaries who later moved to rural China, according to a Wall Street Journal report. A brief trip over the border into Russia\u2019s Far East during the family\u2019s time in China sparked Martindale\u2019s interest in Russia.",
      "In 2018, Martindale, now in his early 30s, moved to Vladivostok, a Russian port city on the Pacific, where he studied Russian and taught English, before being deported a year later for violating labour laws, the Journal said.",
      "He moved to southern Poland, but was keen to return to Russia, the Journal said. In 2022, Martindale entered Ukraine just days before President Vladimir Putin ordered thousands of troops into Ukraine.",
      "Martindale told reporters at a press conference last November that he established contact with pro-Russian forces via Telegram and passed them information on Ukrainian military facilities from the Donetsk region in the country\u2019s east.",
      "Reuters was not able to contact Martindale to ask about his motivation for helping Russia. A spokesperson for the U.S. embassy in Moscow did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "On Tuesday, Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-installed leader of the Russian-controlled part of Donetsk region, presented Martindale with his Russian documents, which he said were awarded by a decree from Putin. Pushilin expressed gratitude to Martindale, saying some of the information he had shared formed the basis for Russian planning to seize Kurakhove, a town near the key Ukrainian logistics hub of Pokrovsk.",
      "Martindale \u201chas long since proven with his loyalty and actions that he is one of us.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor us, this (the Russian passport) is a sign of respect and a sign of gratitude for what Daniel has done.\u201d"

      "In December 1993, Bell spotted what he thought was the car of the man who fatally shot his brother earlier that year, according to court records. Bell was apparently unaware that the man had sold the car to West.",
      "Bell called on two friends and armed himself with an AK-47 rifle, authorities said. They found the car parked outside a liquor lounge and waited. When West, Smith and another woman eventually exited the club, Bell approached the car and opened fire, officials said.",

      "Attorneys for Bell have filed appeals with the Florida Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The lawyers argued in their state filing that Bell\u2019s execution should be halted because of newly discovered evidence about witness testimony. But justices unanimously rejected the argument last week and pointed to overwhelming evidence of Bell\u2019s guilt in a 54-page opinion.",
      "Bell\u2019s attorneys filed a similar petition with the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday, but the panel has not yet issued a ruling."

      "\u201cI was just texting a buddy that I worked with in the minor leagues that was around during that season,\u201d said Taylor Bennett, now an assistant athletic trainer for the Mariners who, in 2019, was working for the Modesto Nuts when Raleigh joined. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018This year seems like Modesto when he was on the heater.' But, it just hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201d",
      "When Nuts manager Denny Hocking went searching for Raleigh on the afternoon of June 20, 2019, Raleigh was decidedly not on a heater at the plate. It was the only blemish on his otherwise strong second professional season since Seattle had drafted Raleigh in the third round out of college.",
      "Two days earlier, Raleigh had represented Modesto in the all-star game of the Cal League, a division of single-A teams clustered in northern and Southern California, and among the lower rungs of minor-league baseball. One knock on Raleigh out of college concerned his defensive potential. Yet in Modesto, empowered by coaches to run meetings directly with the Nuts\u2019 pitching staff, he  earned the trust of pitchers by making them look good. He showed up hours early to the ballpark, having scouted how their pitches could prevent opponents from getting on base. And if they did, he strengthened his arm to catch them stealing.",
      "When Raleigh arrived at the home of Catherine and John Benning south of Modesto before the season began, the Bennings repeated the instructions they had told dozens of minor-leaguers they\u2019d hosted during previous seasons. The players could expect barbecue tri-tips after Sunday day games, to feel free to add to the family\u2019s grocery list and, on rare days off for the Nuts, the Bennings would offer to take players on day trips to show them Yosemite National Park, Lake Tahoe or the beach. Raleigh almost always declined such offers, however. He preferred studying upcoming opponents on his iPad from their couch, or asking whether Michael Sadler, the Nuts\u2019 strength and conditioning coach, could come hang out by the family\u2019s pool. When the family welcomed a new grandson in 2019, Raleigh held the infant in an easy chair, allowing the infant to wrap its hand around his index finger.",
      "\u201cHe just wanted to hang out, swim, relax, get pedicures with my daughter,\u201d Catherine Benning said. \u201c\u2026 I just tell people, he\u2019s just the nicest, nicest kid.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t the only place where Raleigh was building rapport. At 6-foot-2 and pushing 230 pounds, Raleigh was among the roster\u2019s bigger players, and he embraced his frame by helping form a club he nicknamed the \u201cBeef Boy.\u201d Raleigh\u2019s parents, who owned a screen-printing business in his North Carolina hometown, had sent T-shirts with the outline of a cow and the words: \u201c100% Pure Beef, No Added Steroids or Fillers.\u201d Raleigh had also written a Beef Boy song with lyrics to the tune of Dobie Gray\u2019s \u201cDrift Away.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe qualifier to be a Beef Boy was that you had to be over like 225, 230 and you had to hit tanks,\u201d Bennett said.",
      "Yet Raleigh was not hitting tanks when Hocking found the catcher underneath the Valley Strong Ballpark in Visalia, California, on June 20.",
      "After hitting seven homers in the season\u2019s first 30 games, Raleigh hit just one in his last 29, one of several hitting metrics that had regressed.",
      "Hocking had scratched out a 13-year career in MLB by understanding the nuances of hitting. And what he had heard that day from a Mariners coach overseeing the hitting of the team\u2019s prospects had concerned him.",
      "\u201cHe was like, \u2018Man, I was talking to Cal, and his approach [as a hitter] is not, \u2018Yes-yes-yes-no,\u2019 it\u2019s, \u2018Maybe I should swing, maybe I shouldn\u2019t,'\" Hocking said. \"And I was like, 'Wait, what?' And immediately I leave my office, and I\u2019m like, 'Cal, let\u2019s go,' and we go into the cage.",
      "\u201cI'm like, 'Are you kidding me \u2014 your process in the batter\u2019s box isn\u2019t, swing-swing-swing-don\u2019t swing, it\u2019s just, maybe I\u2019m gonna swing at this pitch, maybe I won\u2019t?' And he looked at me like, yeah, what\u2019s wrong with that? I\u2019m like, dude.\u201d",
      "Hocking told Raleigh that hitting, like changing lanes on a freeway, depends on quick decision-making. There simply isn\u2019t time to process or to be timid in the less than a half-second it takes a 90-mile-per-hour fastball to reach home plate.",
      "The son and nephew of coaches, Raleigh already had strong fundamentals with his swing that didn\u2019t require remaking. Hocking made a small timing change to where Raleigh, a switch-hitter, made contact with the ball, but wanted the change to be just one part of a mental checklist that Raleigh could refer to to hold himself accountable in the batter\u2019s box.",
      "\u201cIt was a little bit of a mechanical change, but more an approach standpoint of, \u2018What do I want to do?\u2019\u201d Hocking said. \u201cAnd then learning it and growing it, and within that confidence, now you become invincible. I think what he did in that short period of time was made something that is really hard, that looks really hard, simplify it in a way that it became second nature to him.\u201d",
      "Raleigh went 0-for-5 on June 20 in Visalia. But the following night, he hit a home run and drove in two runs. Over the next 22 games, he hit 14 home runs in 78 at-bats, with 31 runs batted in, and got on base via walks nearly as many times as he struck out, another significant shift from early in the season.",
      "The Mariners did not make Raleigh available for an interview for this article, but in a 2020 interview he said the \"one little adjustment\" was more mental than mechanical.",
      "\"I was like, I kind of like this,\" Raleigh said. \"I don't have to think about my swing as much. All I have to do is mentally get ready to hit.\"",
      "Prodded by Hocking, the Nuts liked to perform karaoke on their bus during road trips throughout California \u2014 Raleigh sang country, Bennett recalled \u2014 and during Raleigh's hot streak, the party atmosphere could continue into each game.",
      "\"When he was going through that stretch there of just being absolutely on fire, it was like, man, this guy is the real deal, and we\u2019re seeing it firsthand,\" Sadler said.",
      "Raleigh's changes to his hitting preparation was part of a much larger routine he was beginning to instill while in Modesto. When Raleigh arrived at the ballpark, hours before teammates, he would run through the same routine of hip and leg exercises to keep his legs mobile, and an arm-strengthening routine, with Sadler, Modesto\u2019s strength coach, and Bennett, its trainer.",
      "In the Nuts\u2019 modest weight room, Raleigh\u2019s strong lower body \u2014 his generous backside had earned him the nickname \u201cBig Dumper\u201d \u2014 allowed him to lay back with a bar across his hips and thrust more than 500 pounds upward.",
      "\u201cSo, yes, his big dumper definitely is able to move some weight there,\u201d Sadler said.",
      "The strength allowed Raleigh to generate power and hit homers even when reaching for pitches that, for other hitters, may have turned into unthreatening bloopers.",
      "\u201cThe man can move a house if he wanted to,\" Bennett said.",
      "The changes to how Raleigh approached his preparation and plate appearances didn\u2019t take overnight. During a June 26 game in San Jose, less than a week after his discussion with Hocking about his hitting mindset, Raleigh took the first pitch without looking like he had any intent to swing, from Hocking\u2019s dugout perspective.",
      "\u201cAlmost like a statue,\u201d Hocking said.",
      "The manager stepped out onto the grass, \u201cand I walked down the line and screamed at him in my own non-screaming way, just basically an angry question, \u2018Hey, are you holding yourself accountable to your line?\u2019",
      "\u201cI turn around and I go back, next pitch, he hits a tank.\u201d"

      "The stimulus measures have lifted parts of the economy. Both official and private surveys showed an improvement in the manufacturing activity.",
      "Exports have also remained largely resilient in the quarter as businesses accelerated to divert trade to alternative markets. Its U.S.-bound shipment shrank 10.9% this year as of June, while exports to Southeast Asia nations and European Union countries \u2014 the groupings China counts as its two largest trading partners \u2014 jumped 13% and 6.6%, respectively.",
      "However, that resilience was mainly driven by \u201cprice discounting,\u201d which was \u201ceroding\u201d China\u2019s terms of trade and intensifying disinflationary pressures, Louise Loo, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, said in a note.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Democrats have been publicly grappling with the issue of impeaching President Donald Trump, with grassroots activists pressuring lawmakers to more aggressively confront Trump and centrist members of the party dismissing the push as futile.",
      "During a six-week stretch this year, House Democrats twice were confronted with impeachment votes \u2014 forced by their own rank-and-file members \u2014 that had zero chance of passing, given that Republicans control the chamber.",
      "In May, Democratic leaders convinced Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., to back off his impeachment push at the last minute. But the following month, Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, forced a failed vote to impeach Trump, exposing stark divisions among Democrats and putting the party's vulnerable members in a difficult position ahead of next year's midterm elections.",
      "Before the 119th Congress is over, it\u2019s likely there will be other pushes to impeach Trump, who survived two such efforts during his first term, even as many Democrats grow frustrated by them.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re massively unhelpful, and they just fire up the base,\u201d said one moderate House Democrat who opposed the recent impeachment efforts.",
      "A second centrist Democrat called them a \u201cwaste of time,\u201d and suggested that colleagues who had voted for impeachment had only done so to appease the party's base.",
      "\u201cEven people that voted 'no' on it, they don\u2019t really want to impeach Trump. But they have to feed the left-wing base,\u201d said the second Democrat, who spoke anonymously to freely discuss internal party dynamics. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to have to go home and answer questions why they didn\u2019t vote for impeachment.\u201d",

      "That was the roadmap that House Democrats followed in 2019 during Trump's first impeachment, over allegations he withheld military aid to pressure Ukraine to launch an investigation into political rival Joe Biden\u2019s family. Democrats voted to launch a formal impeachment investigation, took closed-door testimony and held a series of televised hearings.",
      "The second impeachment, in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, happened in a much more haphazard way as Trump was preparing to leave office. There was no lengthy House investigation or hearings before an impeachment vote. The Senate acquitted Trump in both cases.",
      "In Trump\u2019s second term, talk from some Democrats about impeaching the president began early. In February, Green gave a floor speech announcing he\u2019d pursue articles of impeachment. Two months later, he introduced a single article accusing Trump of \u201cdevolving democracy within the United States into authoritarianism\u201d and detailed a lengthy list of grievances about Trump flouting the courts and attacking the judiciary.",
      "But by June, when Green finally called up his resolution, forcing an impeachment vote on the floor, the Texas Democrat swapped out the language of the resolution and replaced it with new language hitting Trump for failing to consult with Congress before striking Iran.",
      "Green\u2019s resolution failed on a 344-79 vote, with 128 Democrats joining all Republicans to table the measure. Among those who backed Green were Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York,  Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, and Raja Krishnamoorthi and Robin Kelly, who are both running for Senate in Illinois.",
      "Some Democrats said the vote served only as a distraction from more pressing matters, like Republicans' megabill that was moving through Congress.",
      "But in an interview Monday night, Green said he had no regrets about forcing the impeachment vote and vowed to do it again \u2014 though he wouldn\u2019t say when or what the new articles might say.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t say that he committed an impeachable offense and then not vote to impeach. I have a conscience; it\u2019s a vote of conscience. And I say to members, \u2018Vote your conscience,'\" Green told NBC News. \"By the way, I\u2019m going to bring articles against him again. Those were not the last.\u201d",
      "He said he respected the views of colleagues who believe that political \u201ctactics supersede the Constitution.\u201d But he felt he had no choice but to act on impeachment.",
      "\u201cA person who breaches the Constitution that the courts can\u2019t manage and their party won\u2019t manage, then there\u2019s but one option left,\u201d Green added. \u201cAnd the Constitution is kind of important.\u201d",
      "In a sign of how Democrats are struggling to find the right message on impeachment, Rep. Andre Carson, D-Ind., who voted to kill the Green impeachment effort, asked to cosponsor impeachment articles one day later in a post to X.",
      "And Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., recounted how he changed his vote from killing the Green measure to supporting it after a conversation on the House floor with a colleague. Longtime Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who has participated in all four modern presidential impeachments, informed Beyer that the revised language of the resolution effectively made it a vote to restrict Trump\u2019s ability to use military force against Iran.",
      "\u201cThis is the only chance as a Democrat to make a war powers vote,\u201d Beyer said Lofgren told him. \u201cI would not have voted for it based on the original impeachment text that Al Green put in, which I thought was thin.\u201d",
      "Some freshman lawmakers have been worried about the optics of Democrats being publicly split over impeaching Trump. They\u2019re seeking more coordination and guidance from leadership to get rank-and-file members marching in the same direction, according to one Democratic member who spoke to NBC News on condition of anonymity.",
      "This lawmaker, who represents a progressive district, said they are getting inundated with calls from constituents who want Democrats to fight harder.",
      "\u201cThey aren\u2019t buying that just because we are in the minority, we can\u2019t do anything,\" the lawmaker said. \"The truth is we can. And we should.\u201d",
      "After Thanedar\u2019s impeachment push, the lawmaker said there was \u201canxiety\u201d among freshmen in particular. The lawmaker added that they\u2019d want to see a concerted push in relevant committees that has been blessed by leadership, rather than disjointed attempts from rank-and-file members.",
      "Still, there is little Democratic leaders to do to stop these efforts. Any lawmaker is able to call up an impeachment resolution as \u201cprivileged\" and force a full vote in the House.",
      "Democratic leaders have consistently poured cold water on the rogue impeachment efforts, arguing that Republicans \u2014 in control of the House and Senate \u2014 won't hold Trump accountable.",
      "The newly minted ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., said in the middle of last month's fight over Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d that Democrats should focus on stopping Trump\u2019s legislative agenda.",
      "\u201cWe know that Donald Trump is corrupt. We know that we\u2019re going to have the ability and we\u2019re going to need to investigate his corruption. But at this moment, the priority has to be in stopping this bill. I think that\u2019s the focus,\u201d Garcia told NBC News.",
      "Asked if Democrats will move to impeach Trump eventually, Garcia replied: \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to be held accountable for his actions. At this moment, we\u2019ve got to focus on stopping this massive bill.\u201d",
      "At various times this year, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has dodged the question of whether he supports impeaching Trump. But Jeffries and his top Democratic lieutenants all voted to table the Green resolution. And speaking with NBC News recently, Jeffries deferred to Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee who has dismissed impeachment as \u201cnot a plausible instrument\u201d while in the minority.",
      "\u201cImpeachment, of course, rests with the Judiciary Committee under the leadership of Jamie Raskin. He has been very clear that this is a moment where we have to expose the corruption and abuse of power that is taking place as a result of the extreme behavior by the Trump administration,\u201d Jeffries said.",
      "\u201cFollow the facts, apply the law, and be guided by the Constitution,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 For months, President Donald Trump\u2019s main message about the sweeping bill he pushed through Congress was that it was \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cbeautiful.\u201d",
      "Now that it\u2019s also law, the White House and its outside allies are pivoting to a more concrete, detailed description in the hopes that voters will have a clearer idea of what it means for their day-to-day lives.",
      "Democrats are poised to contest the Republican talking points at every turn, as the parties jockey for advantage over a tax cut and spending package that could swing the midterm elections next year.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a battle royal for the hearts and minds of the American people from now until November 2026,\u201d said Terry Holt, a former senior adviser to the Republican National Committee.",
      "Two Republican strategists said they are advising lawmakers to sell the act to a wider audience using different titles: the \u201cWorking Family Tax Cuts\u201d act or possibly the \"Trump Working Family Tax Cuts.\"",
      "The names allude to new policies such as no taxes on tips or overtime that could save money for Black, Latino and other voters who were important parts of Trump's 2024 electoral coalition, the strategists said.",
      "At the same time, the strategists are advising lawmakers to tout the additional money that will be going to their states for border enforcement and other priorities.",
      "\"Working families\" is a phrase that polls well and gives Republicans an opening to persuade voters they\u2019ll save money under the new law, said one of the strategists, who is working on Senate races.",
      "Trump remains pleased with the alliterative turn of phrase he coined and is apt to keep using it, allies said. But as midterm elections approach, GOP leaders grasp that they need to redefine Trump's signature legislative victory in people's minds.",
      "\"Big\" and \"beautiful\" may capture Trump's feelings about the law, but the superlatives say nothing about what the measure means for Americans worried about the prices of gas and groceries.",
      "\u201cThe president is going to say whatever he wants \u2014 he\u2019s earned that,\u201d said the other GOP strategist, who is close to Trump. \u201cWe are selling what the bill does to make sure our coalition knows that Trump delivered for them and they come back in 2026.\"",
      "Polling shows that Republicans have work to do. An Economist/YouGov survey taken after Trump signed the bill July 4 showed that only 35% of adults supported it, compared to 53% who opposed it. What\u2019s more, opposition rose 10 points since the last survey in April.",
      "\u201cThe polling on that has been crystal clear that with the electorate overall, the bill is significantly underwater in terms of its popularity,\" Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said. \u201cIt is most deeply underwater with people who have been following it most closely and know the most about it.\u201d",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News: \u201cThe One Big Beautiful Bill was the largest tax cut for middle class and working families in American history. The White House looks forward to continue working with our friends on Capitol Hill to define what this historic piece of legislation means for Americans across the country.\u201d",
      "In the weeks ahead, Trump Cabinet secretaries will largely be the ones showcasing popular portions of the bill that fall within their purview, White House officials said.",
      "While Trump is expected to highlight parts of the bill during an upcoming trip to Pennsylvania, any presidential travel focused on pitching the bill to voters is not set as of this point.",
      "Past presidents traveled extensively to drive home the benefits of far-reaching legislation they'd passed. After signing into law the Affordable Care Act in March 2010, then-President Barack Obama traveled to Iowa, North Carolina and Maine to explain and celebrate the expansion of healthcare coverage.",

      "An early test of the White House's ability to promote the new law comes Wednesday, when Vice President JD Vance gives a speech at a machine shop in Pennsylvania.",
      "In the address, Vance will try to highlight ways everyday Americans stand to gain, a person familiar with his upcoming speech said. Vance will touch on pocketbook issues, arguing that the new law \u201chelps working-class Americans most of all,\u201d the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.",
      "An analysis last week by the Tax Policy Center concluded that the coming tax changes are \u201cregressive,\u201d benefiting wealthy households the most. Those making between $460,000 and $1.1 million would see their after-tax incomes rise by more than 4%, while those earning less than $35,000 would get only a 1% increase, the report showed.",
      "For Republicans and Democrats alike, the run-up to the midterms will be a scramble to shape voter impressions of the new law. Democrats will stress the cuts to the popular Medicaid program providing health insurance to low-income households; Republicans will emphasize tax cuts and new spending on border security.",
      "But the White House believes other parts of the bill that may not have gotten as much attention are also widely popular. A senior Trump administration official said that internal Republican polling shows a planned overhaul of the nation's air traffic control system is the best-liked component of the act.",
      "At stake is control of Congress. If Democrats win a majority in either the House or the Senate, they could paralyze Trump\u2019s agenda through the end of his term.",
      "The challenge that the GOP faces is that \u201cpeople don\u2019t want Medicaid cut,\u201d Holt said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want housing prices to skyrocket. They don\u2019t want any of it and that\u2019s mostly what they\u2019ve heard about so far. The president will try to bend that narrative to advantage in tactical ways around the county so they can mitigate their losses in the 2026 election.\u201d",
      "Asked about Republican lawmakers who voted to pass the bill, Holt added: \u201cI can\u2019t explain it any other way but that they fear Donald Trump more than they fear their own electorate.\u201d",
      "While Vance travels to Pennsylvania this week, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., is heading to South Carolina for some counterprogramming.",
      "Khanna said he\u2019ll visit the congressional district of Republican Rep. Nancy Mace as part of a tour to publicize what he sees as the drawbacks of Trump\u2019s handiwork.",
      "\u201cUsually, Trump is such a master messenger and he floods the zone \u2014 and the Democrats get drowned out,\u201d Khanna said in an interview. \u201cBut now the Republicans are silent and there\u2019s an opportunity for the Democrats to flood the zone about all the bad things that this bill is doing and we need to be on offense doing that.\u201d"

      "A new slate of AI-powered web browsers have come onto the scene, as AI companies look for more ways to integrate their tools into daily life.",
      "Perplexity AI\u2019s web browser, Comet, launched on Wednesday to much fanfare from some tech circles, as early users tested out its capabilities. It enters a crowded space, which includes products like Dia, Google\u2019s Gemini in Chrome, and a reported upcoming browser from ChatGPT creator, OpenAI.",
      "Perplexity touts Comet, available only to those on the company\u2019s $200-per-month tier, as a \u201cthought partner\u201d that helps users accomplish tasks without having to do the work of actually browsing. In tests, NBC News found that the browser can book reservations, prepare online purchases and plan a full vacation. But the process wasn\u2019t as seamless as it appears in the demos.",
      "The browser is part of an escalating race to advance AI agents, or AI systems that can make decisions and take action on a user\u2019s behalf. When users chat with a tool like Claude or ChatGPT, they type a question and get a response, but they still need to decide what to do with the answer. An AI agent, however, will send questions directly to the browser and even generate new ones based on its knowledge about you and make decisions proactively.",
      "A browser-native AI might try to learn your routine; for example, when you eat lunch. When lunchtime arrives, it can automatically order one of your favorite meals or even reserve a table at your favorite restaurant.",
      "Comet opens to Perplexity\u2019s AI search engine and its AI operates in a sidebar. In tests conducted by NBC News, Comet was able to assist in tasks like applying to jobs, buying a new outfit and booking a gym visit. But it often required intervention from the user, largely due to privacy restrictions that prevent it from accessing and inputting personal information without a human taking the final steps.",
      "When trying to make a purchase online, for example, the Comet assistant stated that it can\u2019t directly conduct any transactions, though it offered to assist in other ways, such as tracking down deals or comparing products. It can also add items to the user\u2019s cart.",
      "\u201cFor your privacy and security, I cannot accept, process, or store any personal or payment information, and I am not able to complete transactions or purchases on your behalf,\u201d the assistant wrote. \u201cThis policy protects your sensitive data and ensures safe, responsible use of this assistant.\u201d",
      "And when asking the browser assistant to apply to a job on Indeed, it navigated to the site, selected a job and started the application process \u2014 though it needed the user to log into the site on their own. It then told the user, \u201cYou will still need to review and submit any application yourself, especially if the application requires personal details or verification steps that only you can provide.\u201d",
      "The browser did, however, successfully book a gym tour \u2014 with some extra prodding. When first asked to book the tour, Comet claimed a visit had been scheduled. When pushed for confirmation, it revealed that it had only landed on a \u201cplaceholder or a pre-selection\u201d page. Asking it to book again prompted the assistant to request the required information from the user before filling out and submitting the form in real time within the browser.",
      "Comet also appears capable of understanding multiple tabs at once. When asked to compare a selection of gyms based on the user\u2019s open tabs, it produced a chart comparing membership prices of the gyms whose websites were open in the browser.",
      "Perplexity says the browser will roll out to additional users over the summer through an invite-based system before eventually becoming free for use.",
      "AI agents have become more common on the internet this year as companies have added the tools to their websites. Expedia\u2019s AI travel agent is already capable of planning itineraries and booking trips. And Walmart in June launched an AI shopping assistant that can make recommendations and, soon, will help shoppers reorder products or book services.",
      "The agents arrive as adoption of generative AI surpassed adoption of the internet and personal computers at similar points of their development. It is also winning over key consumer demographics: trust in AI was 60% among individuals ages 18 to 24 and 62% among those earning over $100,000 a year, according to a Rutgers University-New Brunswick survey.",
      "Some expect artificial intelligence to replace search engines, with Apple Senior Vice President Eddy Cue testifying that Google searches fell in Safari for the first time in history in April 2025 and linking that drop to AI.",
      "In its efforts to keep up with the AI web revolution, Google has rolled out an \u201cAI Mode\u201d in its search engine and now offers its Gemini assistant as an add-on in Chrome. But Comet more broadly integrates its AI functions into the default web interface."

      "Robin Peguero, 39, said in an interview ahead of his announcement that he is running because Salazar has not \u201cstood up\u201d to President Donald Trump on issues like his deportation program and sweeping tax and spending cuts law.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been six months into this administration, and Congresswoman Salazar has not stood up to the president in any meaningful way,\u201d Peguero said.",
      "Peguero was a homicide prosecutor in Miami from 2014 until September 2021, when he took a job on the Jan. 6 committee as an investigative counsel. He continued in that position until the committee dissolved in 2021, after which he became chief of staff for Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., until January 2024. He has taught law in Miami since.",
      "Salazar has represented Florida\u2019s 27th Congressional District, which encompasses most of Miami and its southern suburbs, since 2021. The predominantly Hispanic district has shifted toward Republicans in recent years, as Trump won the district by 15 percentage points in 2024 after he carried it by less than half a percentage point in 2020.",

      "\u201cIt is the number one role of government, is again, to make sure that everybody has the opportunity for the American dream,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cThat was me wanting to take what I had learned as a prosecutor and present evidence of what was an awful mark in our country\u2019s history, the first non-peaceful transfer of power in our history, to uncover evidence to present to the American people so that they might decide what to do with it and how we might avoid it from ever happening again,\u201d Peguero said.",
      "Some 30-plus miles outside of Salazar\u2019s district lies \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d the new immigration detention center in the Everglades that Peguero said is a \u201cPR gimmick.\u201d He said he supports deporting violent criminals, but criticized the Trump administration for deporting \u201cgood, hard-working\u201d people who have been in the U.S. for a long time.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t vote for mass deportations without due process. They voted for border security and for the deportation of violent criminals and a government that\u2019s smart enough to be able to tell the difference between who ought to be deported and who should not,\u201d Peguero said.",
      "\u201cPeople are absolutely having regrets over their votes in the past, and the truth is we just got to move forward,\u201d he said.",
      "Salazar\u2019s seat is one of 35 that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has announced as targets, as House Democrats aim to flip the chamber next year, though the expansive list includes some districts that are heavily Republican at this point.",

      "The nearly century-old Grand Canyon Lodge in far northern Arizona was a refuge for ambitious hikers and adventurous tourists eager to bask in the magnificent views of one of the most remote and renowned landscapes in the world.",
      "But a wind-whipped wildfire reduced it to a skeleton of itself within hours over the weekend, devastating the many who saw it as an intrinsic part of the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. Fortified with Kaibab limestone and logs from the surrounding Ponderosa pine forest, it sat at the edge of the canyon, blending in and enhancing the natural environment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s tragic, it really is,\u201d retired National Park Service chief historian Robert K. Sutton said Monday.",
      "The lodge itself told a key part of history for both the Grand Canyon and the National Park Service.",
      "Gilbert Stanley Underwood, who designed the lodge in 1927, sought to immerse residents in the landscape that now draws millions of visitors annually from around the world with a rustic, organic architectural style. He designed similar lodges in Zion and Bryce national parks in Utah, Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming and Yosemite National Park in California, according to the park service.",
      "The Grand Canyon Lodge, the only lodging within the canyon\u2019s North Rim, was built at a time when the federal department was eager to find ways to engage the public with the country\u2019s best natural offerings, Sutton said.",
      "For a place as remote as the North Rim, that wasn\u2019t an easy task. The lodge was a winding 212-mile drive from the more popular South Rim where 90% of the tourists go. Hiking from one side to the other is even more arduous at over 20 miles with steep ascents at the end. But the historic building\u2019s tranquility is a fundamental part of its appeal.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re just on your own. It\u2019s just a completely different atmosphere,\u201d Sutton said.",
      "The drive up to the North Rim was a chance to see a bison herd that roams the far reaches of northern Arizona. The highway ended at the Grand Canyon Lodge, built right up to the edge of the rim. Across the lobby inside and down the stairs, visitors got a picturesque view of the Grand Canyon framed through the windows of the \u201cSun Room\u201d furnished with plush couches. Navajo woven rugs hung on the walls and elaborate light fixtures from the ceilings.",
      "In the corner of the room sat Brighty, a burro that lived at the canyon and inspired a children\u2019s book, immortalized in a statue as a sort of mascot for the North Rim.",
      "Jen Pinegan, 47, trained for months to hike from the South Rim to the North Rim in May 2024. She started before the sun came up to avoid what can be ruthless Arizona heat. After 12 grueling hours, she arrived at the North Rim, stayed the night at the Grand Canyon Lodge and awoke to a view she she said had \u201can indescribable magic to it.\u201d",
      "Others hikers were celebrating, too, creating an \u201celectric\u201d atmosphere as they soaked in the views, she said.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s what made it more incredible, is knowing that a lot of people don\u2019t see it,\u201d Pinegan said.",
      "She returned to the lodge for the Fourth of July weekend to take her youngest daughter and two step sons to lunch at the restaurant known for its elk chili. She said she was brought to tears when she heard it burned down.",
      "For those who enjoy a good road trip, like Erik Ammerlaan, the lodge had an elusive appeal. He\u2019s traveled to roughly 30 countries but counts his stay at the Grand Canyon Lodge in 2016 as one of his most memorable trips.",
      "\u201cIt was like you were looking at this movie, but its just nature,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re really just one with nature\u201d",
      "The lightning-caused wildfire that consumed the lodge and dozens of other structures at the North Rim began July 4. The National Park Service had been managing it to clear the landscape of fuel when winds shifted and it made a run toward the lodge. Hundreds of people were evacuated.",
      "The blaze wasn\u2019t the first time the lodge was destroyed. In September 1932, just five years after it opened, lodge employees and residents watched as a kitchen fire grew and overtook the structure, according to the park service. It was rebuilt in 1938.",
      "Sutton, the retired park service historian, and others are optimistic the Grand Canyon Lodge will get a new life.",
      "\u201cI suspect it will regenerate,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "Arizona\u2019s senators are demanding answers from the Department of the Interior over its handling of a devastating wildfire that is still burning out of control on the Grand Canyon\u2019s North Rim.",
      "In a letter sent Monday to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Democratic Sens. Ruben Gallego and Mark Kelly questioned the department\u2019s initial response to the Dragon Bravo Fire. The blaze spread quickly over the weekend and destroyed dozens of structures, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge, a visitor center and a wastewater treatment plant.",
      "\u201cIt has been reported that National Parks Service officials initially decided to monitor the fire as a controlled burn, but changed their approach as strong winds allowed the fire to jump multiple containment features,\u201d the senators wrote in the letter. \u201cThere are many questions over the initial decision to treat this fire as a controlled burn and subsequent decisions on how to respond.\u201d",
      "Neither the National Park Service nor the Department of the Interior immediately responded to requests for comment.",

      "\u201cAn incident of this magnitude demands intense oversight and scrutiny into the federal government\u2019s emergency response,\u201d Hobbs wrote. \u201cThey must first take aggressive action to end the wildfire and prevent further damage. But Arizonans deserve answers for how this fire was allowed to decimate the Grand Canyon National Park.\u201d",
      "As of Monday, the fire had consumed more than 5,700 acres and remained 0% contained, according to InciWeb, the U.S. Forest Service\u2019s wildfire information site.",
      "Gallego and Kelly said they were concerned that early decisions by the federal government \u201cmay have affected the spread of fire in northern Arizona,\u201d particularly since the North Rim has been under weeks of extreme heat and experienced a dry winter.",
      "The senators asked Burgum to detail the factors that contributed to the initial decision to treat the fire as a controlled burn.",
      "Controlled burns are fires that are intentionally set or allowed to burn to reduce the amount of dry and flammable vegetation in an area. These kinds of burns are used to manage ecosystems that need periodic fires to stay healthy and also to lower the risk of bigger wildfires from breaking out.",
      "Gallego and Kelly called the Grand Canyon \u201cArizona\u2019s crown jewel\u201d and asked about the resources available to fight the wildfire. They also questioned how the Interior Department plans to prevent other blazes from spreading. The senators requested responses by Aug. 10.",
      "The Dragon Bravo Fire was started by lightning on July 4. The National Park Service said Sunday that the blaze \u201cexhibited extreme and volatile fire behavior the evening of July 12, resulting in a 500-acre expansion.\u201d The fire's rapid expansion was fueled by sustained winds of 20 mph and gusts reaching up to 40 mph, according to the NPS.",
      "Early assessments suggest that between 50 and 80 structures have been lost, but no injuries or deaths have been reported so far.",

      "Lena Dunham swapped \u201cI dos\u201d with husband Luis Felber in 2021, and Jack Antonoff took a trip down the aisle alongside Margaret Qualley in 2023. But long before either of those nuptials, the \u201cGirls\u201d creator and the music bigshot were inseparable.",
      "In fact, in the early 2010s, they weren\u2019t just a couple; they were the \u201cit\u201d couple.",
      "Now, their relationship is in the spotlight thanks to \"Too Much,\" Dunham's new show. Dunham has said the show is inspired by her real life \u2014 specifically, how she met Felber.",
      "In the series, Jess (Meg Stalter), a 30-something American workaholic, moves to the U.K. after a devastating breakup. She processes her relationship to Zev (Michael Zegler), who gets engaged to a model soon after their breakup, as she falls for Felix (Will Sharpe), a British musician.",
      "Dunham has not said that Zev is based specifically on Antonoff, although the character inspired speculation. Instead, Dunham told Vanity Fair that Zev is a mix of bad boyfriends she's encountered.",
      "\u201cThat ex-boyfriend is very much an amalgamation of every ex that I\u2019ve had, or that a friend\u2019s had,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s this quotidian acceptance of unkindness that eats away at a person over a long period of time and degrades their sense of self. If someone were to say, \u2018Who inspired that character?\u2019 I\u2019d be like, \u2018Do you have time for me to give you 42 examples?\u2019\u201d",
      "Dunham and Antonoff met while both of their careers were hitting their first peaks. Antonoff\u2019s band at the time, Fun, had just broken big with the single \u201cWe Are Young,\u201d while Dunham\u2019s HBO hit about a group of young women living in New York City was an instant and relatable hit. Together, the rising stars were millennial romance goals.",
      "And for those who followed their relationship throughout its over five-year run, it was pure enjoyment. Because unlike so many privacy-loving stars of today, these two had a tell-all approach to love.",
      "See what they had to say about each other back then in this relationship retrospective.",
      "Their romance began in 2012",
      "Antonoff first met Dunham on \u201ca blind date, by modern standards.\u201d",
      "The two met in 2012, when comedian Mike Birbiglia, a friend of Antonoff, set them up. But as the Bleachers frontman explained to Vulture in 2014, he didn\u2019t really go into the date blind.",
      "\u201cI mean, I used the internet,\u201d he said.",
      "Nothing the internet told him prepared him for how quickly he and Dunham would hit it off, as he added, \u201cI told Lena everything about my whole life, because when you really like someone, you want them to know everything about you.\u201d",
      "Dunham was \u201clike 40 minutes late\u201d to that first meeting, but the delay clearly didn\u2019t harsh their vibe, she shared with The New York Times in 2014.",
      "\u201cWhen I met Jack, I said to my mom, \u2018I met this guy, and he\u2019s obsessed with dying, too,\u2019\u201d she told the New York Times. \u201cAnd he lives in his parents\u2019 house!\u201d",
      "For Dunham, who has been vocal about her own mortality anxiety and who lived with her parents at the time, those details made for a kismet connection.",
      "Revealing their relationship",
      "When asked about having a boyfriend during a chat with Interview in 2013, Dunham was thrilled to share the happy news.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m totally fine to state his name: it\u2019s Jack Antonoff,\u201d she said. \u201cI know there\u2019s some rule that you\u2019re not supposed to talk about your boyfriend publicly because it seems like all starlets under the age of 33 have decided not to do that, but if you\u2019re in love with someone great, then I don\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t tell everybody.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to post naked pictures of them on the internet or tweet pictures of your Christmas celebration, but I feel like, in a way, he\u2019s my best advertisement, so I\u2019m like, \u2018Why would I not tell people who ask?\u2019\u201d",
      "They went from long-distance to live-in",
      "Despite falling for one another from the very start, their careers came between them physically.",
      "\u201cWe met, and then the day after we met, we were apart for three months,\u201d Dunham once mentioned on The Howard Stern Show. \u201cSo, our relationship was sort of formed long-distance.\u201d",
      "But it didn\u2019t stay that way for long. Once they were able to be face-to-face again, they decided to cohabitate \u2014 even though it wasn\u2019t an easy arrangement. Soon enough, Antonoff was back on tour, and Dunham was left to decorate their tchotchke-filled abode with help from her mom.",
      "\u201cAnd he hated it,\u201d she later told Domino. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to hate it. He tried not to hate it. But he didn\u2019t like living among the insides of my mind. I thought I was giving him a gift, like the time I came home from summer camp and my mother had painted my walls four different chalky colors and installed a poster, a candle shaped like a slice of honeydew melon and an inflatable chair ... I wanted to give him the magic that she\u2019d always given me by dreaming her maddening dreams. But he wanted a Restoration Hardware couch and a giant watch to hang on the wall.\u201d",
      "Taylor Swift penned a song about them",
      "Antonoff, an 11-time Grammy winner, is a frequent producer and cowriter with Taylor Swift. In 2014, he spoke to the singer about the origin story behind her love song, \u201cYou Are in Love,\u201d for MTV.",
      "Swift then told him that he and her close friend, Dunham, were the inspiration for the lyrics.",
      "\u201cI was sitting in bed when I realized that these lyrics that I was writing were channeling everything Lena\u2019s told me about the two of you,\u201d she said of the song from her \u201c1989\u201d album. \u201cI was really emotional writing this song, because I was so happy for you guys. You guys are the benchmark of actual, true, real love, like it talks about in that song.\u201d",
      "Without knowing it was about the couple, Swift said that Dunham later told her that would be their \u201cwedding song.\u201d",
      "Why they never married each other",
      "Dunham and Antonoff often teased the topic of marriage during their time together. In one of many since-deleted Instagram posts from the former couple, Dunham even waved her ring finger at the camera and joked, \u201cI\u2019m waiting! Hello!\u201d",
      "Antonoff addressed that clip in his interview with Vulture, noting, \u201cI think all people in relationships that last longer than a year start talking about that stuff. It\u2019s hard to imagine when the right time is because things are so crazy at the moment.\u201d",
      "For her part, Dunham wasn\u2019t really in any rush anyway.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not against marriage,\u201d she told Howard Stern in 2014. \u201cBut I want to wait... My sister (Grace) is gay, and it just doesn\u2019t feel good to me to do something she can\u2019t do.\u201d",
      "Same-sex marriage was legally recognized nationwide in the U.S. the following year.",
      "The end",
      "After five-plus years of loved-up quotes and cute photo ops, in December 2017, Dunham and Antonoff broke up.",
      "\u201cWe sat in our shared kitchen of nearly four years and quietly faced each other, acknowledging what nobody wanted to say,\u201d Dunham recalled in an essay she wrote for Vogue just five months after the split.",
      "Dunham does not name Antonoff in the Vogue essay, but the timeline described aligns with their relationship.",
      "\u201cThat obsessive connection had turned to blind devotion, and the blinders were coming off to reveal that we had evolved separately (the least shocking reason of all and perhaps the most common). That anger wasn\u2019t sexy or sustainable. That our hearts were still broken from trying so hard to fix it but no longer uncertain about whether or not we could. The finality nearly killed me, and I remember muttering, \u2018But what if we still went on dates?\u2019 He laughed sadly. \u2018Whatever you want.\u2019\u201d",
      "Instead, from that point, she said they only shared \u201cthe kind of loving but overly careful check-ins that define a separation after longtime togetherness.\u201d"

      "\"Here\u2019s the letter I sent to get on 'Shark Tank.' The producer had already chosen someone else, but I wasn\u2019t ready to give up,\" Corcoran wrote in the caption of her post. \"So I wrote him a list of reasons why I deserved a shot.\"",
      "\"That email got me the seat and changed the course of my life. Seventeen years later, I\u2019m so glad I pressed send. Just a reminder, sometimes the door won\u2019t open until you knock louder,\" she continued.",

      "\"I've found in building teams myself that the combination of personalities is always more important than the expertise or strengths of single individuals,\" she said. \"You may even drop a man for me because, believe it or not, I'm just as smart and mean as the next guy.\"",
      "Corcoran's last reason was simple: \"I've known from the get-go the shark role is a perfect fit for me.\"",
      "She said she had watched 37 episodes of the show, and that she thought she could rival the best sharks \"in shrewdness and personality.\"",
      "\"Everything I've done so far in the business and TV worlds has made me ready,\" she said. \"My style is different than the other sharks' and your audience would fall in love with me.\"",

      "\"I've booked my flight for the 6th and hope to be on that plane,\" she wrote. \"Thanks, Barbara.\"",
      "This isn't the first time Corcoran has shared the letter while reflecting on her journey to \"Shark Tank.\" She posted the note on her Instagram in August 2020, using it as a lesson for how she \"turned a \u2018no\u2019 into a \u2018yes.\u2019\"",
      "Corcoran has been an investor on \"Shark Tank\" since 2009, and has appeared on all 15 seasons of the show.",

      "\"I am obsessed with you! THIS IS IS GOLD,\" another wrote.",

In the comments section, fans appeared to be \u201cexcited\u201d over the forthcoming release, with one fan saying, \u201cMadea is always hilarious to watch.\u201d",
      "Another said they found watching Madea therapeutic, writing, \u201cMadea has helped me through A LOT and ironic enough is why I am no longer hot headed or quick to make decisions. Tyler is amazing and I hope he continues to do these so many generations can partake in his wisdom.\u201d",

      "Still, other fans weren't as impressed, with one saying it's wasn't quite worth the watch.",
      "\u201cWhat a boring movie wasted my 1 hour 44 minutes. I give this a -1 rating,\u201d a commenter on X wrote.",
      "Another fan had similar sentiments, writing on X, \u201cThis movie was horrible, the worst Madea movie in awhile. Please sir, hire some writers and new hair/makeup people! That took 2 hours off my life for no good reason.\u201d",
      "The person also gave some advice to Perry, referencing Ryan Coogler's blockbuster horror film starring Michael B. Jordan.",
      "\u201cSinners set a new standard. Get there!\u201d the person added.",

      "LONDON \u2014 Senior aides to King Charles III and Prince Harry were pictured meeting in London on Sunday, fueling speculation about a royal reconciliation between the estranged father and son.",
      "Photos obtained by The Mail on Sunday newspaper showed Meredith Maines, Harry's chief communications officer, meeting with Tobyn Andreae, Charles' communications secretary, at the Royal Over-seas League, a private club near Buckingham Palace.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a long road ahead, but a channel of communication is now open for the first time in years,\" a royal source told the newspaper about the meeting.",
      "It comes after Harry, who is the fifth in line to the throne, saying he would \u201clove reconciliation with my family,\u201d during a BBC interview in May. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in continuing to fight people,\u201d he said.",
      "His comments came after he lost his appeal against the British  government\u2019s decision to axe his publicly funded security detail, an issue that he said had driven a wedge between him and his father.",
      "\u201cHe won\u2019t speak to me because of this security stuff,\u201d Harry said, adding that he didn\u2019t know how long his father had left to live after Charles was diagnosed with cancer last year.",
      "Relations between the pair became strained after Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, announced that they would take a step back as senior members of the royal family in 2020, saying they would split their time between the United Kingdom and the United States.",
      "As a result, the couple was stripped of their taxpayer-funded security, spurring Harry\u2019s legal challenge with the British Home Office.",
      "Harry has been a regular in British courts in recent years, challenging both his security arrangements and tabloid newspaper publishers for allegedly hacking phones and using private investigators to snoop on his life for news stories.",
      "Harry has also openly expressed his frustrations with his family, who were the source of pointed criticism in his best-selling book, \u201cSpare,\u201d two years ago, which saw him claim that he had been physically attacked by his brother William, the Prince of Wales.",
      "This came after Harry and Meghan alleged in a 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey that a member of the royal family had expressed concerns over the skin color of their son, Archie, before he was born."

      "China\u2019s gross domestic product expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, according to China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday. While the growth rate beat Reuters-polled economists\u2019 estimates of a 5.1% growth, it represented a slowdown from the 5.4% in the first quarter.",
      "In June, retail sales growth slowed to 4.8% from a year earlier, compared with the 6.4% year-on-year increase in May. That figure also disappointed Reuters-polled economists\u2019 forecast of 5.4%.",

The slump in real estate investment deepened, falling 11.2% in the first half of the year, compared to a 10.7% drop in the first five months, while investment in infrastructure and manufacturing also slowed.",
      "\u201cThe real estate market is still in a process of bottoming,\u201d Laiyun Sheng, deputy commissioner at the NBS, said at a press briefing following the data release, calling for \u201cstronger support\u201d to stabilize the sector.",
      "Domestic consumption contributed to 52% of GDP in the first half of the year, Sheng said, highlighting that the share of consumption rose in the second quarter while the contribution of trade fell. He spoke broadly of plans to support retail sales, and acknowledged that policymakers need to boost income to sustain a rebound in spending.",
      "Sheng expected modest improvement in consumer prices in the second half of the year, citing Beijing\u2019s efforts to encourage spending while stopping disorderly price wars.",
      "The urban unemployment rate remained at 5% in June, after touching a two-year high of 5.4% in February.",
      "\u201cAlthough growth is likely to slow in the second half-year, the 5% government target may be within reach,\u201d said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at Economist Intelligence Unit, who expected policymakers to refrain from rolling out additional stimulus measures at an upcoming meeting of the Communist Party\u2019s Politburo in late July.",
      "Beijing could hold off major stimulus until September to stage a final push to meet its growth target if momentum falters, Xu added.",
      "Tariff wildcard",
      "In April, U.S. President Donald Trump ratchet up tariffs on Chinese imports to a prohibitive level of 145%, spurring a round of stimulus measures from Beijing, including financial support for exporters struggling to take orders, subsidies for companies that hire fresh graduates and continuous expansion of a consumer goods trade-in program to boost demand.",
      "The two sides reached a truce in May, agreeing to roll back most of their tariffs on one another. Their respective trade negotiators later outlined a framework after a meeting in London in June, which involved China expediting approval for exports of rare-earth minerals and Washington walking back its restrictions on Beijing\u2019s access to advanced American technologies and Chinese students\u2019 visas to study in the U.S.",
      "Beijing faces an Aug. 12 deadline to work out a permanent deal with Washington.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC earlier this month that he expected a meeting with his Chinese counterpart \u201cin the next couple of weeks\u201d to advance discussion on trade and other matters.",
      "\u201cIf the threat of trade war diminishes at least in the short term, the chance of a large fiscal stimulus in China also declines,\u201d said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.",
      "Calls for stimulus",
      "China\u2019s economy has remained on a generally firm footing this year, buoyed by robust exports and support measures, but economists are largely cautious of more economic headwinds ahead, calling for the leadership to launch fresh fiscal stimulus.",
      "\u201cThe above-target growth in Q1 and Q2 gives the government room to tolerate some slowdown in the second half of the year,\u201d said Zhang.",
      "The Chinese leadership in May unveiled a slew of policy steps in its bid to shore up the tariff-hit economy, including cutting interest rates and injecting additional liquidity into the market.",
      "The stimulus measures have lifted parts of the economy. Both official and private surveys showed an improvement in the manufacturing activity.",
      "Exports have also remained largely resilient in the quarter as businesses accelerated to divert trade to alternative markets. Its U.S.-bound shipment shrank 10.9% this year as of June, while exports to Southeast Asia nations and European Union countries \u2014 the groupings China counts as its two largest trading partners \u2014 jumped 13% and 6.6%, respectively.",
      "However, that resilience was mainly driven by \u201cprice discounting,\u201d which was \u201ceroding\u201d China\u2019s terms of trade and intensifying disinflationary pressures, Louise Loo, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, said in a note.",
      "China\u2019s GDP deflator, a broad measure of prices across goods and services, however, was still down 1.2% year-on-year, marking the sharpest decline since the global financial crisis, Loo added.",
      "PBOC advisor Huang Yiping, in a report published last week with two other economists, said that authorities need to add as much as 1.5 trillion yuan in fiscal stimulus to spur household spending and offset impacts from the U.S. tariffs, as well as cut interest rates further.",
      "\u201cDeeper indicators such as soft consumer price index, weak purchasing managers\u2019 index readings, cautious credit dynamics and elevated migrant worker unemployment point to underlying fragility,\u201d the economists said.",
      "Structural reforms around China\u2019s fiscal plans, pension system and the financial sector are needed to ensure a more balanced, sustainable growth, the economists said."

      "Walking down a row of incubators in the neonatal unit of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, Dr. Ahmad Al-Farra, head of the facility's pediatric unit, shared each baby's story one by one.",
      "\"This baby is a full-term baby,\" he told NBC News' crew on the ground Thursday, gesturing at a tiny figure tucked into an incubator, wrapped in only his diaper and with an oxygen tube fixed to his nose with surgical tape.",
      "\"As you can see, he is depending on the mechanical ventilation,\" Al-Farra said. \"If the electricity was cut off ... this baby will not survive.\"",
      "His warning evokes memories of early on in the war, when a number of infants died at hospitals in northern Gaza after repeated warnings that a military assault in the area would end up being fatal for the babies.",
      "Nasser Hospital is just one of several facilities in Gaza facing \"imminent shutdown\" as fuel stocks in the enclave run out, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned Wednesday. The closure of vital units would most likely result in patients' deaths, including in the intensive care and neonatal units, it said.",
      "OCHA added that the \"total ban on fuel entry\" enforced by Israel for around 130 days was to blame for the shortages, which it said has also severely impacted water, sanitation and hygiene services.",

      "Dr. Mohammad Saqer, director of nursing at Nasser Hospital, told NBC News that the facility only had around 3,000 liters (790 gallons) of diesel left. He said it needed 4,500 liters (1,190 gallons) daily to operate all departments effectively. Already, he said, the hospital had turned off electricity for some departments, funneling power to only the most vital units.",
      "\"The situation is very catastrophic because the electricity will abruptly go off within 24 hours,\" Saqer said. \"This means that a lot of patients, especially in the ICU in addition to other departments, are subject to inevitable death.\"",

A woman placed a glitter tulle clip into the wispy hair of the girl in the princess dress, her chubby face still smeared with blood. A mortuary technician tidied another girl's curls that were clumped by blood, the child still in her green T-shirt printed with a cartoon panda.",
      "Several people tended to an inconsolable woman and a man doubled over as he wept into the pavement. Another woman cried about the senselessness of the killings, \u201cWhat have those children done? What is the guilt of this child to die?\u201d They were starving and just trying to get formula at the clinic, she said.",
      "According to UNICEF, which issued a statement on the strike Thursday, the 1-year-old who was killed had just spoken his first word hours earlier. His mother was injured in the blast and now lies in a hospital bed, clutching her dead baby's shoe.",
      "\u201cNo parent should have to face such tragedy,\u201d UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in the statement. \u201cThis is the cruel reality confronting many in Gaza today after months of insufficient aid being allowed into the territory, and parties to the conflict failing to uphold basic responsibilities to protect civilians.\u201d",
      "She called on Israel to \u201curgently review its rules of engagement to ensure full compliance with international humanitarian law, notably the protection of civilians, including children.\u201d",

More than 50,000 of those killed and injured have been children, Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF\u2019s regional director for the Middle East and Africa, said in May.",
      "Dua al-Hazarin, a local journalist who captured the immediate aftermath of Thursday's strike on video, told NBC News that she had been on her way to an assignment when the attack \"happened right in front of me.\"",
      "\"Shrapnel was flying. People were torn apart and the dust from the missile filled the entire area,\" she said.",
      "Later outside Al-Aqsa Hospital, men prayed over shrouded bodies and, in a scene now familiar, if no less heartbreaking after 20 months of war, one of them picked up a tiny white bundle to carry the child to the cemetery."

      "Back then, the couple had been dating for a year and were in a long-distance relationship: he a police officer in British Columbia and she a trainee nurse in Newfoundland.",
      "\u201cToday we enjoyed dinner, this bottle of wine and each other on the edge of the island,\u201d she wrote in the message. \u201cIf you find this, please call us,\u201d she added, providing a number but never imagining somebody actually would.",
      "They had shared a precious picnic together on the tiny Bell Island, a 20-minute ferry ride from St. John's. \"I gave it everything I had,\" Brad Squires said of his attempt to launch the bottled missive into the waves below.",
      "They soon forgot about it. They got married in 2016, settling  down in Newfoundland. They have three children, Allie, 19, Gabe, 16, and Harrison, 5.",
      "In Scraggane Bay on Ireland's picturesque Dingle Peninsula, the bottle was found Monday by another couple, Kate and Jon Gay, members of the local charity Maharees Conservation Association, who were doing a beach cleanup.",
      "They kept it until the association's meeting later that night, smashing it open, toasting the unknown writers but failing to get an answer from the number provided. So Farrell posted an appeal on Facebook thinking it might yield an answer in weeks or months. One hour later, Anita Squires had got in touch to say she was the note's author.",
      "\"It was phenomenal,\" Farrell said.",
      "There is a doubly serendipitous side to this story, too.",
      "The Maharees, where the bottle was found, is a 3-mile isthmus of sand that has been battered and eroded by extreme weather and sea-level rises fueled by climate change. So too have parts of Newfoundland.",
      "The grassroots Maharees Conservation Association wants to use this story to link up with people in Newfoundland experiencing the same issues. And the author of the letter in the bottle is going to connect them.",
      "\"They have a soft coastline, they have a sand dune system, and they are also vulnerable to sea level rises,\" Farrell said. \"It's a somber enough affair when you're thinking: How can we actually prepare ourselves for what's to come? So to have this little moment of pure joy in the middle of that, it was very welcome.\"",
      "Anita Squires says that her \"love story is cute, but the work they are doing is so important,\" referring to the conservation group's attempts to protect and adapt their  coastlines to the climate crisis. So, linking these campaigners is \"the beautiful thing at the end of the story.\""

      "President Donald Trump may have expected a Russian shudder of fear to greet his threat of \u201cvery severe tariffs\u201d on the country if it didn\u2019t agree a ceasefire in Ukraine. Instead, his comments appear to have prompted a collective public shrug.",
      "Calling Trump's statements \u201cvery serious,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that Russia needs \u201ctime to analyze\u201d them.",
      "But investors in the Russian capital who had been gearing up for tougher measures instead embraced a 50-day grace period on tariffs set by Trump on Monday and the Moscow Stock Exchange was up by 2.7% after it opened Tuesday morning.",
      "Oil prices also fell by more than $1 after the announcement, hinting that investors don't think Trump will follow through on his threat to impose the tariffs.",
      "Trump \u201cdid not announce any immediate anti-Russian measures or the confiscation of illegally blocked Russian assets,\u201d Leonid Slutsky, a prominent nationalist politician, said on Telegram Tuesday, adding that the president was trying to balance Western support for Kyiv while avoiding a confrontation with the Kremlin.",
      "Trump announced the levies along with the shipment of new weapons to Ukraine during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at the White House on Monday.",
      "His comments came as a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) made its way through Congress. If passed, it would seek to impose 500% tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil and gas.",
      "Praising Trump\u2019s announcement, Graham and his bill\u2019s co-sponsor,  Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn) said in a statement that \u201cthe ultimate hammer to bring about the end of this war will be tariffs against countries, like China, India and Brazil, that prop up Putin\u2019s war machine by purchasing cheap Russian oil and gas.\u201d",
      "However, Konstantin Kosachev, the Deputy Chairman of the Russian Federation Council, the upper house of the country\u2019s parliament, said Graham\u2019s bill made \u201cno sense.\u201d In 50 days, \u201chow much can change both on the battlefield and in the mood of those in power both in the U.S. and in NATO?\u201d he added.",
      "And former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, a hardliner who frequently issues over-the-top threats, called Trump\u2019s threat a \u201ctheatrical ultimatum\u201d in a post on X.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don\u2019t have a deal in 50 days, tariffs at about 100%,\u201d Trump said, without providing further details.",
      "After the announcement, a White House official said Trump's threat of 100% tariffs was referring to Russian goods, as well as secondary sanctions on other countries that buy its exports.",
      "The president\u2019s comments signal a marked shift in tone over his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, for whom he has long shown admiration. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for a long time. We\u2019ve always gotten along well,\u201d Trump said back in March.",
      "Many Western countries have have cut most of their own financial ties to Moscow during since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its smaller neighbor, triggering the first major land war in Europe since World War II.",
      "Still, buyers of Russia's crude oil like China and India have continued financing Moscow\u2019s war chest with hundreds of billions of dollars through business with the world\u2019s third-largest oil producer.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about tariffs on countries like India and China that are buying their oil,\u201d Matt Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO told reporters Monday after Trump\u2019s announcement. \u201cAnd it really is going to, I think, dramatically impact the Russian economy.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s threats of secondary tariffs are \u201cnever going to go anywhere\u201d as long as he is unwilling to impose costs on Moscow directly, Keir Giles, a senior fellow at the London-based Chatham House think tank, told NBC News Monday.",
      "The tariffs also risk upending delicate China-U.S. trade talks, according to Liu Baocheng at Beijing's University of International Business and Economics.",
      "The \u201cunilateral imposition of punitive trade measures...risks creating new and unnecessary complications,\u201d Baocheng said, adding that the 100% secondary tariffs intended to pressure Moscow could instead \u201cseverely backfire by undermining global economic stability and fragmenting international cooperation.\u201d",
      "Most concerning, Baocheng added, was that the threat comes at a delicate juncture in U.S.-China trade relations, where secondary tariffs on Chinese companies or sectors that import Russian goods \u201cwould seriously damage the fragile momentum of dialogue.\u201d",
      "Trump's tariff agenda has also raised the stakes for India, which has been negotiating a trade deal with Washington to see tariffs on goods from India drop below 20%.",
      "India\u2019s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar told reporters Tuesday that his country had \u201cbeen in touch\u201d with Graham over its concerns and interests on energy and security.",

    "summary": "A study of more than 1 million people found no link between aluminum in vaccines and an increased risk of autoimmune disease, allergies and autism.",
    "story": [
      "Aluminum in childhood vaccines is a target of vaccine skeptics, who blame the ingredient on myriad health concerns. But a study of more than 1 million people, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found no link between aluminum in vaccines and an increased risk of 50 chronic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergies and autism.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spread vaccine misinformation for years, said on a podcast in 2024 that aluminum in vaccines is \u201cextremely neurotoxic.\u201d (An HHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.)",
      "Senior study author Anders Hviid said that, as a parent, he understood the concerns about vaccine safety.",
      "\u201cOur study addresses many of these concerns and provides clear and robust evidence for the safety of childhood vaccines. This is evidence that parents need to make the best choices for the health of their children,\u201d said Hviid, who is a professor and the head of epidemiology research at Statens Serum Institut, a sector of the Danish Ministry of Health focused on combating and preventing infectious diseases.",
      "Hviid and his team used Denmark\u2019s nationwide registry to look for any connections between aluminum exposure from childhood vaccines and 50 chronic disorders, including 36 autoimmune disorders, nine allergy or asthma conditions, and five neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and ADHD.",
      "The study looked at more than 1.2 million people born in Denmark from 1997 through 2018 and followed them until the end of 2020. Because health records in Denmark are meticulously kept by government agencies, the researchers were also able to compare children who received more aluminum in their vaccines by age 2 compared those who received less. The study didn\u2019t include unvaccinated children.",
      "The researchers found no link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and any of the 50 conditions.",
      "Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said Scandinavian public health studies are of uniquely good quality.",
      "\u201c[This excellence is] partly because they have, for a long time, had such a unified health system,\u201d said Kedl, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study. \u201cEveryone is tracked for life from birth and you can go back for many years and ask, \u2018Can we find a link between something that happened in the past and in the future?\u2019\u201d",
      "Hviid said the catalyst for the Danish study was a widely criticized Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded study, published in 2022, that suggested a link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and increased asthma risk. The study, however, didn\u2019t distinguish between aluminum from vaccines and aluminum from other sources. It also contained inconsistencies: for example, in one group the researchers analyzed, more aluminum exposure wasn\u2019t linked to increased asthma risk, contrary to the study\u2019s conclusions.",
      "\u201cIf you are looking at people who got vaccines that contained aluminum versus those who had fewer, you have to control for confounding factors, you need to know that the only different source of aluminum these people received was from those vaccines,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "The CDC study was not able to do that, Offit said. Aluminum is the third-most abundant metal on Earth and people are exposed to the metal through breast milk, air and water, he said.",
      "\u201cAluminum is part of our daily diet and has been since the beginning of time. That is the point people don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.",
      "Neither Osterholm nor Offit were involved with the new study.",
      "CDC officials said at the time that it appears that aluminum-containing vaccines \u201cdo not account for the overall trends that we see.\u201d",
      "Osterholm said the strength of the broader research is that it piles on dozens of studies that have drawn the same conclusion as the new study.",
      "\u201cOne study does not make for a safe vaccine supply or not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the accumulative data that comes from many studies that have been done, that together demonstrate the safety of vaccines.\u201d",
      "Why is aluminum in vaccines?",
      "Different ingredients are added to vaccines for different reasons. Aluminum \u2014 added to vaccines as aluminum salts \u2014 is what\u2019s known as an adjuvant. These additives act as a beacon for the immune system, pointing out invaders and prompting the body to produce antibodies against an antigen, or the virus or bacteria a vaccine aims to protect against.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just have an antigen and have an immune response, you need some kind of stimulus to trigger that response,\u201d said Kedl, of the University of Colorado. \u201cAn adjuvant is a substance that alerts the body\u2019s immune response to the vaccine\u2019s antigen. Without adjuvants, you actually create tolerance, which is the opposite effect of what you want a vaccine to do.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., aluminum salts are used in the vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) as well as vaccines for pneumonia, HPV and hepatitis B.",
      "\u201cThe aluminum that is in vaccines is in the form of extremely small amounts of aluminum salts which is not the same as elemental aluminum which is a metal,\u201d Hviid said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for parents to understand that we are not injecting metal into children.\u201d",
      "Aluminum salts from vaccines are injected into the muscle and most are cleared away by the body and filtered out through the kidneys within two weeks, though small amounts can linger for years.",
      "\u201cThe aluminum-containing vaccines form the backbone of our childhood immunization programs,\u201d Hviid said, adding that there are currently no viable replacements. \u201cIt is critically important that we keep politics and science apart in this issue. If not, it is the children, including U.S. children, who are going to suffer the consequences.\u201d"

      "Those statements come after Trump sent a letter to the E.U. (and a separate one to Mexico) on Saturday threatening a blanket 30% tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. starting Aug. 1, an indication that ongoing trade negotiations have failed. After initially backing down from his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs and promising trade deals with dozens of countries, Trump has steadily returned to his trade war posture, sending letters to countries around the world with ultimatums and tariff rates from 20% to 40%.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron of France, a key source of U.S. food and wine exports, said Saturday he strongly disapproved of the 30% tariff and urged the E.U. to speed up \u201cthe preparation of credible countermeasures.\u201d He said trading partners such as the U.S. and Europe \u201cowe each other\u201d respect.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. was the top destination for E.U. exports. The top exported products from the E.U. to the U.S. last year were medical and pharmaceutical products, medicines, motor vehicles and machinery, according to Eurostat.",

    "story": [
      "A German doctor went on trial in Berlin Monday, accused of murdering 15 of his patients who were under palliative care.",
      "The prosecutor\u2019s office brought charges against the 40-year-old doctor \u201cfor 15 counts of murder with premeditated malice and other base motives\u201d before a Berlin state court. The prosecutor\u2019s office is seeking not only a conviction and a finding of \u201cparticularly serious\u201d guilt, but also a lifetime ban on practicing medicine and subsequent preventive detention.",
      "Murder charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. If a court establishes that the defendant bears particularly severe guilt, that means he wouldn\u2019t be eligible for release after 15 years as is usually the case in Germany.",
      "Parallel to the trial, the prosecutor\u2019s office is investigating dozens of other suspected cases in separate proceedings.",
      "The man, who has only been identified as Johannes M. in line with Germany privacy rules, is also accused of trying to cover up evidence of the murders by starting fires in the victims\u2019 homes. He has been in custody since Aug. 6.",
      "The doctor was part of a nursing service\u2019s end-of-life care team in the German capital and was initially suspected in the deaths of just four patients. That number has crept higher since last summer, and prosecutors are now accusing him of the deaths of 15 people between Sept. 22, 2021, and July 24 last year.",
      "The victims\u2019 ages ranged from 25 to 94. Most died in their own homes.",
      "The doctor allegedly administered an anesthetic and a muscle relaxer to the patients without their knowledge or consent. The drug cocktail then allegedly paralyzed the respiratory muscles. Respiratory arrest and death followed within minutes, prosecutors said.",
      "The doctor did not agree to an interview with a psychiatric expert ahead of the trial, German news agency dpa reported. The expert will therefore observe the defendant\u2019s behavior in court and hear statements from witnesses in order to give an assessment of the man\u2019s personality and culpability.",
      "So far, it is unclear what the palliative care physician\u2019s motive might have been, dpa reported. The victims named in the indictment were all seriously ill, but their deaths were not imminent.",
      "The defendant will not make a statement to the court for the time being, his defense lawyer Christoph Stoll said, according to dpa.",
      "The court has initially scheduled 35 trial dates for the proceedings until January 28, 2026. According to the court, 13 relatives of the deceased are represented as co-plaintiffs. There are several witnesses for each case, and around 150 people in total could be heard in court, dpa reported.",
      "Among the cases now being heard in court is that of a 56-year-old woman who died in September.",
      "On Sept. 5, the doctor allegedly administered an anesthetic and a muscle relaxant to the physically weakened woman in her home without any medical need. However, fearing discovery, he then made an emergency call and falsely stated that he had found the woman in a \u201ccondition requiring resuscitation,\u201d according to the indictment. Rescue workers were able to resuscitate the woman and took her to hospital, dpa reported.",
      "The indictment said that \u201cin continuation of his plan of action and in the knowledge of the injured party\u2019s living will\u201d, according to which the woman did not want any life-prolonging measures, the doctor is said to have called one of her daughters and apologized for violating this will. With the consent of both daughters, artificial respiration was discontinued and the woman died on Sept. 8 in a Berlin hospital.",
      "An investigation into further suspected deaths is continuing.",
      "A specially established investigation team in the homicide department of the Berlin State Criminal Police Office and the Berlin public prosecutor\u2019s office investigated a total of 395 cases. In 95 of these cases, initial suspicion was confirmed and preliminary proceedings were initiated. In five cases, the initial suspicion was not substantiated.",
      "In 75 cases, investigations are still ongoing in separate proceedings. Five exhumations are still planned for this separate procedure, prosecutors said.",
      "Among the cases still being investigated is the death of the doctor\u2019s mother-in-law, who was suffering from cancer, court spokesman Sebastian B\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdchner said. Local media reported that she died during a visit by the doctor.",
      "In 2019, a German nurse who murdered 87 patients by deliberately bringing about cardiac arrests was given a life sentence.",
      "Earlier this month, German investigators in the northern town of Itzehoe said they were examining the case of a doctor who has been suspected of killing several patients."

Meanwhile, state visits are ceremonial meetings between heads of state that are used to honor friendly nations and sometimes smooth relations between rivals.",
