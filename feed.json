      "Underwood, who launched her career on \u201cAmerican Idol,\" is to perform shortly before Trump takes the oath of office at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 20, according to a copy of the inaugural program provided to The Associated Press on Monday.",
      "\u201cI love our country and am honored to have been asked to sing at the Inauguration and to be a small part of this historic event,\u201d Underwood said in a statement Monday. \u201cI am humbled to answer the call at a time when we must all come together in the spirit of unity and looking to the future.\u201d",
      "The pomp and spectacle that comes with the inauguration of a new president kicks off this weekend in Washington with a fireworks show at Trump\u2019s golf club in Sterling, Virginia, a campaign-style rally in D.C., a visit to Arlington National Cemetery and glitzy dinners before the former president takes the oath to become the next president.",
      "Trump\u2019s second inauguration is expected to be a much different affair than the last time America got a new president. Trump, who refused to accept his 2020 loss, did not attend Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol, where there were still visible reminders of the violent Jan. 6, 2021 siege on the building by Trump\u2019s supporters.",
      "The committee planning Trump\u2019s inaugural ceremonies released a schedule Monday of four days of events centered around the Jan. 20th swearing-in ceremony, which Biden is planning to attend.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is dedicated to uniting the country through the strength, security, and opportunity of his America First agenda,\u201d Steve Witkoff and Kelly Loeffler, the co-chairs of the inaugural committee, said in a statement.",
      "Witkoff is Trump\u2019s incoming Middle East envoy and Loeffler is a former Georgia senator who is Trump\u2019s pick to run the Small Business Administration.",
      "\u201cThe 2025 inaugural celebrations will reflect President-elect Trump\u2019s historic return to the White House and the American people\u2019s decisive vote to Make America Great Again,\" Witkoff and Loeffler said.",
      "On Saturday, Trump is scheduled to attend a reception and fireworks display at his Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia. Separately, Vice President-elect JD Vance will attend a reception for the incoming Cabinet members and host a dinner.",
      "On Sunday, the president-elect is to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery and then hold a campaign-style \"MAGA Victory\u201d rally at Capital One Arena in downtown Washington.",
      "Th Republican's Inauguration Day plans include tea at the White House, the swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol, a congressional luncheon, a parade on Pennsylvania Avenue and a trio of balls.",
      "The inaugural balls include a Commander in Chief Ball focused on military service members, a Liberty Inaugural Ball geared toward Trump supporters, and the Starlight Ball, focused on high-dollar donors. Trump is scheduled to speak at all three balls.",
      "Incoming first lady Melania Trump will join tea with the Bidens. In 2021, the Trumps did not invite the Bidens for a tea before Biden's inauguration, instead leaving town before the next president was sworn in. In November, when Joe Biden invited President-elect Trump to the White House, Melania Trump chose to skip the visit.",
      "Tuesday, Trump's first full day as the 47th president, will include a National Prayer Service in the morning.",
      "Greenwood will perform as Trump walks out to take the oath, according to Trump's inaugural committee. Macchio is Trump's choice to perform the National Anthem at the end of the program.",
      "Macchio performed at the Republican National Convention in July, at Trump's return rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in October after his first rally there was marred by an assassination attempt, and during his Madison Square Garden rally that drew blowback for crude and racist jokes from some speakers.",
      "The invocation is scheduled to be delivered by Franklin Graham, son of the late pastor Billy Graham, and New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan.",
      "Trump's first inauguration in 2017 featured performances from the Rockettes, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and 16-year-old \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d singer Jackie Evancho.",

      "Oliviero Toscani, the photographer behind Benetton\u2019s provocative ad campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s who later broke with the Italian knitwear brand under controversy, has died at age 82",
      "MILAN -- Oliviero Toscani, the photographer behind Benetton\u2019s provocative ad campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s who later broke with the Italian knitwear brand amid controversy, died Monday at age 82.",
      "Toscani disclosed last year he had a rare disease. \"It is with immense pain that we announce that our beloved Oliviero has undertaken his next journey,\" his wife, Kirsti, and their three children said in a statement. He died at a hospital in Livorno, Tuscany, the news agency ANSA reported.",
      "Toscani had amyloidosis, a disease characterized by a buildup of abnormal protein deposits in the body. He told Corriere della Sera in August he had lost 40 kilograms (nearly 90 pounds) in a year, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I have left to live, but I\u2019m not interested in living like this anyway.\u201d",
      "Toscani also said he would like to be remembered \u201cnot for any one photo but for my whole work, for the commitment.\u201d",
      "Toscani was the creative force behind shock ad campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s that featured images such as the pope kissing an imam on the lips, which angered the Vatican.",
      "Other images promoting the United Colors of Benetton depicted a priest embracing a nun, a newborn baby with its umbilical cord and a black woman breastfeeding a white baby, part of the brand\u2019s advocacy for diversity, religious tolerance and environmental messages.",
      "During a 1997 shoot of a Benetton campaign featuring Jews and Arabs living peacefully together in Israel, Toscani told The Associated Press, \u201cAny picture is a political image, so we make our choice and we go for the real thing.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cYou might have to face criticism. A lot of people don\u2019t like things that are different. Everybody likes to conform. We don\u2019t conform.\u201d",
      "His decadeslong relationship with Benetton was severed in 2020 after Toscani outraged relatives of victims of the deadly 2018 Genoa bridge collapse, telling RAI television, \u201cWho cares about a bridge collapse?\u201d He was responding to an outcry over a photograph of founding members of a political protest movement alongside key members of the Benetton family, which controlled the company that maintained the bridge.",
      "Toscani apologized in an interview with La Repubblica, saying: \u201cI am sorry. More: I am ashamed to apologize. I am humanly destroyed and deeply pained.\u201d But the damage was done, and Benetton ended a relationship that had flourished from 1982-2000 and been rekindled in 2018.",
      "Benetton remembered Toscani in a social media post: \u201cFarewell, Oliviero. Keep on dreaming,\u2019\u2019 beneath Toscani's 1989 photo of a hand offering a bouquet of flowers.",
      "Toscani was born in Milan on Feb. 28, 1942, the son of a photojournalist for Corriere della Sera. He studied photography and graphics at the University of the Arts in Zurich from 1961-65, and worked with the newly founded Vogue Italia and other major fashion publications.",
      "Over the years, he shot campaigns for such brands as Chanel, Robe di Kappa, Fiorucci and Esprit. But he was probably best known for his work for the United Colors of Benetton, with images that carried messages promoting equality and diversity while denouncing anorexia, homophobia, the death penalty and racism.",
      "His work for United Colors of Benetton, a brand then known most for its colorful knitwear, raised its global profile. In the early 1990s, he conceived and directed \u201cColors,\u201d a global publication distributed in Benetton stores, and created along with Luciano Benetton the research center Fabrica in Benetton\u2019s home city of Treviso that supported and launched many fashion industry careers.",
      "Toscani tackled the AIDS crisis in the early 1990s with a colored condom campaign, during which Benetton sold a range of colored condoms, and used a colorized version of a portrait of AIDS activist David Kirby surrounded by family as he was dying.",
      "In 2007, Toscani\u2019s \u201cNo Anorexia\u201d campaign for the Italian fashion brand Nolita sparked fresh discussions about the illness and its relationship to the fashion industry. Toscani\u2019s photograph with skeletally thin model Isabelle Caro was revealed on giant billboards and in newspaper ads during Milan Fashion Week and received worldwide attention.",
      "He was also involved in projects addressing problems such as road safety, violence against women and stray dogs.",

      "Woods added: \u201cIn this hellish landscape \u2018standing\u2019 is relative, but smoke and other damage is not like the utter destruction around us.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Woods was among hundreds of thousands around Los Angeles who were forced to evacuate as the fires spread and intensified. He has posted regular updates on X, showing charred ruins of homes near his, and had been convinced his house would fare no better.",
      "\u201cSo many beautiful messages from all of you,\u201d he posted later Friday. \u201cI\u2019m so happy and grateful, but honestly the entire area looks like the dark side of the moon.\u201d",
      "Numerous celebrities, from Paris Hilton to Billy Crystal, have confirmed their homes were lost or sustained damage in blazes burning in and around Los Angeles. At least 10 people have died, and thousands of structures and vehicles have been destroyed."

      "CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as \u201cSoul Man\u201d and \u201cHold On, I'm Comin,\u2019\u201d has died. He was 89.",
      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \u201ccall and response\u201d of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music\u2019s most enduring hits, which also included \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Like I Know,\u201d \u201cWhen Something is Wrong With My Baby\u201d and \u201cI Thank You.\u201d",
      "Most of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music\u2019s most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called \u201cPlay it, Steve\u201d midway through \u201cSoul Man.\u201d",
      "Like many \u201960s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \u201cSoul Man\u201d hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \u201cSoul Men\u201d depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",
      "\u201cTwo thousand dollars for my lifetime?\u201d Moore said then. \u201cIf you\u2019re making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don\u2019t give me cornbread and tell me it\u2019s biscuits.\u201d",
      "Moore wrote the song \u201cDole Man,\u201d modeled on \u201cSoul Man,\u201d for Republican Bob Dole\u2019s presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama\u2019s campaign used the song \u201cHold On, I\u2019m Comin\u2019.\u201d",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s, but didn\u2019t meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label\u2019s Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band\u2019s troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",
      "\u201cI did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,\" during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,\" he said. \"But you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I\u2019m laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\u201d",

      "With homes smoldered, streets emptied and friends scattered by evacuation orders, Guttenberg counted himself among the fortunate. His property was miraculously spared. But the actor-producer still struggled to reconcile his relief with the haunting sight of his ravaged, once lavish community.",
      "\u201cJust this morning, I woke up and I was really conscious of my mental state and my mental health, because the last three days, I've seen so much tragedy,\u201d said Guttenberg, pacing through the ruins of his neighborhood. He said his home has electricity but no running water.",
      "Guttenberg thanked God that his block was safe, but he said about 20 homes were burned \u201cpretty bad\u201d in his 80-home community after wind-whipped fires tore across Los Angeles, destroying homes, clogging roadways as tens of thousands fled as the fires burned uncontained Wednesday. He said the fires are the worst he's ever seen in his 66-years.",
      "The wildfires have burned the homes of several celebrities including Billy Crystal, Carey Elwes and Paris Hilton.",

      "During Guttenberg\u2019s stroll, it was an eerie scene with scorched palm trees, homes reduced to ash and rubble, and the daytime skies casted an ominous twilight over the devastation.",
      "\u201cI've seen people scared, people in wheelchairs, mothers and fathers trying to find their kids, people having anxiety and panic attacks,\u201d said Guttenberg, who returned to his neighborhood to help others who stayed behind with relief efforts. He has helped move cars to clear the street, handed out food and assisted neighbors from out their homes.",
      "\"All these houses behind me burned to the ground where their families enjoyed wonderful times together with their friends and family,\" said Guttenberg while pointing at one charred home before dropping his head in sadness. \u201cThere's really a lot of pain going on right now. I'm doing whatever I can to help alleviate it.\u201d",
      "For those looking to help, Guttenberg suggested starting with a simple call or text to ask displaced neighbors what they might need like food, supplies or emotional support. He also encouraged those who can return to their homes, if safe, to check on their property and assist others in assessing the damage.",
      "Guttenberg, the star of films like \u201cShort Circuit,\u201d \u201cPolice Academy and \u201dThree Men and a Baby,\" is unsure how the film and TV industry will able to help during the beginning of awards season.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s gonna do what regular people do: Help each other, give each other food and water, help each other in their backyards, in their front yards,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though somebody\u2019s an actor, producer, writer, director, we\u2019re all just people. .. Maybe people can donate at one point to some sort of fund. But I just think, be a good neighbor right now.\u201d",
      "When asked about the timeline for his neighborhood's recovery, Guttenberg thinks it could take anywhere from five to 10 years to rebuild and fully heal.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot of work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be unbelievable to try to rebuild this. Rebuild all the beautiful trees, homes and retail shops and lifestyle. The psychology of it all, it\u2019s going to take a long time.\u201d"

      "Schenk lived in Austria, and his death was announced by the Vienna State Opera.",
      "He created 31 productions there, starting with Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s \u201cJen\u016ffa\u201d in 1964 and ending with Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s \u201cThe Cunning Little Vixen\u201d in 2014. Many of his creations remain in use, including a 1979 version of Johann Strauss II's \u201cDie Fledermaus\u201d that was streamed around the world on New Year's Eve.",
      "\u201cOtto Schenk is an essential, unforgettable chapter in the history of our theater,\u201d Vienna State Opera Director Bogdan Ro\u0161\u010di\u0107 said in a statement. \u201cBut he was also an artist who shaped the world of theater for half a century like few others. As sacred as the theater was to him, he approached the works naturally and fearlessly, drawing on an immense knowledge. An infinite love for the singers went hand in hand with hard, uncompromising rehearsal work and honesty. \u201d",
      "Schenk led 16 productions at New York's Metropolitan Opera, starting with Puccini's \u201cTosca\u201d in 1968 and ending with Donizetti's \u201cDon Pasquale\u201d in 1996. His staging of Wagner's four-work \u201cDer Ring des Nibelungen\u201d premiered from 1986-89 and was shown in 20 full cycles from 1989 to 2009 and broadcast on public television in 1990. Schenk received a huge ovation when he took a curtain call after an April 18, 2009, performance of \u201cSiegfried.\u201d",
      "His romantic, realistic staging had set designer G\u00fcnther Schneider-Siemssen create images of a river, forest and mountains dominated by greens and oranges, and costumes by Rolf Langenfass that evoked the original Ring of the 1876 Bayreuth Festival. It was in a way a response to Patrice Ch\u00e9reau's centennial Ring at Bayreuth in 1976, set in an industrial age Ring and interpreted by some as Marxist.",
      "\u201cI wanted to tell a romantic old story, like starting with \u2018Once upon a time,\u2019\u201d Schenk said during a 1989 interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAll the secrets of Wagner\u2019s Ring should be guessed by the audience or found by the audience.\u201d",

He continued to act and performed 237 times at the Salzburg Festival from 1950-97, becoming head of drama there from 1986-88.",

      "\u201cAt a time when many new productions of `Der Ring des Nibelungen' might be more aptly entitled `Der Ringling des Barnum und Bailey,' the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s staging of Wagner\u2019s epic has cast a vote for the notion that maybe, just maybe, the composer knew best,\" New York Times critic Donal Henahan wrote in 1989. \u201cThe Metropolitan\u2019s trend-bucking project has aroused widespread suspicion, even resentment. `Traditional,' `conventional,' `regressive' and `childishly representational' were some of the nicer epithets thrown about in lobbies and in print. ... Even granting the possibility that radical rethinking of Wagner\u2019s works might occasionally stimulate thought about their everyday relevance, a staging that pays honor to the original is a useful counterbalance.\u201d",
      "Met presentations were long dominated by Schenk and Franco Zeffirelli, who had 11 stagings that premiered from 1964-98. Schenk said he did not look for hidden meanings.",

      "The Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand sent a jolt across the music world two decades ago",
      "LONDON -- Two decades ago, the Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand sent a jolt across the music world. They waltzed in stripped-shirts and quickly became global icons for their deliriously hooky songs, hitting a critical mass in the chant-along singles \u201cTake Me Out\u201d and \u201cDo You Want To.\u201d A lot has changed in that time, but the band never wavered in their dedication to 2000s indie ebullience. Over the last few years there's been a bit of an indie music resurgence, but for Franz Ferdinand, it never went away.",
      "On Friday, they will release \"The Human Fear,'' their sixth studio album and the first in seven years, making the end of the longest break between full lengths in their career.",
      "Frontman Alex Kapranos says the album tackles relationships forming and breaking down. \u201cThe title is a clue to the scene,\u201d he teases. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t written to the theme, at least not consciously.\u201d",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press in London, Kapranos and Franz Ferdinand bassist Bob Hardy discussed about \u201cThe Human Fear,\u201d the resurgence of indie music and the band's love for Chappell Roan and Charli XCX. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "KAPRANOS: The last song that was written, the last lyrics that were written was (for) the song \u201cHooked.\u201d It starts off with the line, \u201cI\u2019ve got the fear / I\u2019ve got the human fear.\u201d And I realize that so many of the songs had an underlying theme of fear to them. But not necessarily succumbing to fear, but more like overcoming fear.",
      "\u201cThe Doctor\u201d is about the fear of leaving an institution, and \u201cBar Lonely\u201d is the fear of leaving a relationship. \u201cNight or Day\u201d is the fear of committing to a relationship. But fear is fascinating because fear is universal. We all experience fear. We all experience the same fears. But how we respond to it is individual. And that\u2019s how we find who we are, our personalities. And overcoming fear feels good. That\u2019s why we watch horror films or ride rollercoasters \u2014 because you overcome fear and then feel very alive for having done so.",
      "KAPRANOS: The song starts off addressing that feeling that we all have sometimes, which is, you know, you feel that your life is collapsing around about you for one reason or another. It could be a relationship that is disintegrating. Often, it'll go that things tend to happen to you (all) at once. The relationship starts going south as well as your professional life. And then you realize that the washing machine leaked and your basement\u2019s flooded and just all that kind of annoying stuff. Your phone gets nicked or whatever. And it can be overwhelming. And you just, you have this sense of fear that, \"Gosh, everything\u2019s collapsing.\"",
      "I guess I was feeling a little bit like that when I was writing the song for one reason or another. And I thought, \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d ... I\u2019m just going to do something astonishingly audacious. I\u2019m going to go into it with an audacious attitude and get through it that sort of way. And don't blame anybody else for it as well. Like, own the responsibility of overcoming the fear myself.",
      "KAPRANOS: We\u2019re not one of these kinds of bands that will sit down and say, \u201cRight, we\u2019ve got two months to write an album. \u201d For me, you\u2019re always writing, you\u2019re always coming up with ideas. And so, on this album, there\u2019s ideas that were written in the studio literally the day before it was sent off to be mastered. And there\u2019s also ideas \u2026 I think the oldest idea is the bassline (of) one of the songs, which is from 1995.",
      "I think the way my brain works is like if you imagine going into the office of a university\u2019s eccentric professor that\u2019s scattered with bits of paper. It's all kind of like catastrophic, organizational hell, but they know exactly where everything is. That\u2019s what my brain is like with bits of ideas and bits of songs and stuff like that. I know where they are, and when I need to use them, they\u2019ll come out.",
      "HARDY: And the show has become the reward for making records, to me. It all kind of focuses playing it live in front of an audience and seeing people react to it in the moment. When you release a record, you don\u2019t see people listen to it at home. You know, the way you kind of get the reaction is these live shows.",
      "HARDY: It's never gone away.",
      "KAPRANOS: There was a period in the late-2000s where there was point of saturation where, like, you turned on any mainstream radio show and you heard nothing but indie bands. And when it becomes that saturated, maybe the quality control goes down slightly. And then when that happens, there\u2019s always a reaction to it. And I think over the last decade, there\u2019s been a bit of, \u201cRight, okay, so we\u2019re going to listen to like pure pop instead.\u201d And of course, there\u2019s some brilliant stuff like Charli XCX. Amazing. Chappell Roan (is) incredible. But there\u2019s a lot of stuff that\u2019s maybe not quite premier tier as well. And I think there's been maybe a little bit of a reaction to that.",
      "I think from our perspective, just, yeah, make the thing that you love and then you\u2019re not really going to go wrong."

      "Appearing on \u201cSesame Street\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- Appearing on \u201cSesame Street\u201d? That's the best idea.",
      "The 55th season of the acclaimed family program features a star-studded lineup of musicians that would be the envy of any summer festival: SZA, Chris Stapleton, Noah Kahan, Rene\u00e9 Rapp and Samara Joy.",
      "The upcoming season will focus on lessons in emotional well-being. It debuts Jan. 16 on MAX with new episodes releasing every Thursday. \u201cSesame Street\u201d will also be available on PBS stations and to stream on PBS Kids in the fall.",
      "No one is more excited than Elmo himself.",
      "\u201cThere's a lot to learn from music \u2014 yeah, timing and harmonies and melody and different styles and different cultures,\u201d the 3 1/2-year-old monster told The Associated Press. \u201cIt's really cool! We've got a lot of wonderful people come and do some music with us on \u2018Sesame Street,' like Miss Rene\u00e9 Rapp and SZA! Chris Stapleton, Noah Kahan, Samara Joy \u2014 lots of great people!\u201d",
      "Songs double as life lessons on \u201cSesame Street,\u201d from an alt-R&B-pop track about gratitude with SZA to an acoustic number about feelings with Rapp.",
      "\"SZA is really cool \u2014 really talented. And \u2018gratitude\u2019 was a new word for Elmo, too. So, Elmo learned all about gratitude with SZA,\u201d he said.",
      "\"Elmo was feeling really, really happy after his playdate with Miss Rene\u00e9. It was a really beautiful song. She's got a great voice and Elmo hopes she comes back soon.\u201d",
      "As for the secret to a great \u201cSesame Street\u201d song? According to Tony - and Grammy-winning composer, producer and \u201cSesame Street\u201d music director Bill Sherman, its \u201cearworms on earworms.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the verse is an earworm, so is the chorus. Mostly in pop music, the chorus is the earworm, and the verses are just a bunch of jumble.\u201d The difference, he explains, is that pop songs are about three and a half minutes long. Children's music is about a minute and a half. \u201cYou only have a very finite amount of time to do what you got to do.\u201d",
      "Usually, writers on the show provide Sherman and his team of songwriters with a script and lyrics detailing the lesson of each episode, as well as the name of the musical guest. Then they get to work, composing music true to the genre and spirit of each artist.",
      "Those musical guests take different levels of involvement, but the result is always awe-inspiring.",
      "Other highlights from this season include Kahan performing a foot-stomping folk song about music and feelings, Joy using jazz improvisation to teach a lesson in taking turns and a country ode to music and friends courtesy of Stapleton.",
      "\u201cChris Stapleton really wanted to write his own song,\u201d says Sherman, and so the pair hopped on a Zoom and wrote a song together, Stapleton with his guitar in tow, ideas flowing. \u201cIt was really one of the most surreal two-hour Zooms that I really ever had in my life.\u201d",
      "Joy took a different approach. \u201cSamara Joy insisted on singing live,\" says Sherman. \u201cIt very rarely happens on \u2018Sesame Street.\u2019 I can only count, like, a few times. So, there was like Stevie Wonder back in the day, which is a classic. And there\u2019s like Billy Joel, there\u2019s John Legend, there\u2019s a couple people that actually sing live. But Samara insisted on it.\u201d",
      "Her reasoning was simple. \"She said, \u2018Well, this whole episode is about improvisation and thinking on your toes. And so, if it\u2019s prerecorded, that\u2019s the opposite of what we\u2019re trying to teach.\u2019\"",
      "If there is a theme that connects all these performances to one another, it's a spirit of connection. At least, that's Elmo's theory: \u201cElmo thinks that music brings people together, you know? And some people who like some things and some people who like other things can kind of come together because they like the same kind of music. And that's kind of cool!\u201d",
      "\u201cSesame Street,\u201d designed by education professionals and child psychologists, is shown in more than 150 countries, has won over 200 Emmys, 11 Grammys, two Peabody Awards and received a Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime artistic achievement, the first time a television program got the award.",
      "There've been no shortage of great musical guests across the show's five decade run. So, who would they like to see pay a visit in the future? \u201cMiss Taylor Swift! Maybe she could revisit her \u2018Red\u2019 era?\u201d chimes in Elmo. That's his favorite of her albums.",
      "\u201cBut also, Elmo would love to sing with Miss Beyonc\u00e9. Destiny's Child was on \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 so Elmo would love to have her back.\u201d"

      "Adams, 51, lost his right leg to cancer 40 years ago, and he has worn out more legs than he can count. He picked a gold plan on the Colorado health insurance marketplace that covered prosthetics, including microprocessor-controlled knees like the one he has used for many years. That function adds stability and helps prevent falls.",
      "",
      "But when his leg needed replacing last January after about 5 years of everyday use, his new marketplace health plan wouldn't authorize it. The roughly $50,000 leg with the electronically controlled knee wasn't medically necessary, the insurer said, even though Colorado law leaves that determination up to the patient's doctor, and his has prescribed a version of that leg for many years, starting when he had employer-sponsored coverage.",
      "",
      "\"The electronic prosthetic knee is life-changing,\" said Adams, who lives in Lafayette, Colorado, with his wife and two kids. Without it, \"it would be like going back to having a wooden leg like I did when I was a kid.\" The microprocessor in the knee responds to different surfaces and inclines, stiffening up if it detects movement that indicates its user is falling.",
      "",
      "People who need surgery to replace a joint typically don't encounter similar coverage roadblocks. In 2021, 1.5 million knee or hip joint replacements were performed in United States hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory facilities, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ. The median price for a total hip or knee replacement without complications at top orthopedic hospitals was just over $68,000 in 2020, according to one analysis, though health plans often negotiate lower rates.",
      "",
      "To people in the amputee community, the coverage disparity amounts to discrimination.",
      "",
      "\"Insurance covers a knee replacement if it's covered with skin, but if it's covered with plastic, it's not going to cover it,\" said Jeffrey Cain, MD, a family physician and former chair of the board of the Amputee Coalition, an advocacy group. Cain wears two prosthetic legs, having lost his after an airplane accident nearly 30 years ago.",
      "",
      "AHIP, a trade group for health plans, said health plans generally provide coverage when the prosthetic is determined to be medically necessary, such as to replace a body part or function for walking and day-to-day activity. In practice, though, prosthetic coverage by private health plans varies tremendously, said Ashlie White, chief strategy and programs officer at the Amputee Coalition. Even though coverage for basic prostheses may be included in a plan, \"often insurance companies will put caps on the devices and restrictions on the types of devices approved,\" White said.",
      "",
      "An estimated 2.3 million people are living with limb loss in the U.S., according to an analysis by Avalere, a healthcare consulting company. That number is expected to as much as double in coming years as people age and a growing number lose limbs to diabetes, trauma, and other medical problems.",
      "",
      "Fewer than half of people with limb loss have been prescribed a prosthesis, according to a report by the AHRQ. Plans may deny coverage for prosthetic limbs by claiming they aren't medically necessary or are experimental devices, even though microprocessor-controlled knees like Adams' have been in use for decades.",
      "",
      "Cain was instrumental in getting passed a 2000 Colorado law that requires insurers to cover prosthetic arms and legs at parity with Medicare, which requires coverage with a 20% coinsurance payment. Since that measure was enacted, about half of states have passed \"insurance fairness\" laws that require prosthetic coverage on par with other covered medical services in a plan or laws that require coverage of prostheses that enable people to do sports. But these laws apply only to plans regulated by the state. Over half of people with private coverage are in plans not governed by state law.",
      "",
      "The Medicare program's 80% coverage of prosthetic limbs mirrors its coverage for other services. Still, an October report by the Government Accountability Office found that only 30% of beneficiaries who lost a limb in 2016 received a prosthesis in the following 3 years.",
      "",
      "Cost is a factor for many people.",
      "",
      "\"No matter your coverage, most people have to pay something on that device,\" White said. As a result, \"many people will be on a payment plan for their device,\" she said. Some may take out loans.",
      "",
      "The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed a rule that would prohibit lenders from repossessing medical devices such as wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs if people can't repay their loans.",
      "",
      "\"It is a replacement limb,\" said White, whose organization has heard of several cases in which lenders have repossessed wheelchairs or prostheses. Repossession is \"literally a punishment to the individual.\"",
      "",
      "Adams ultimately owed a coinsurance payment of about $4,000 for his new leg, which reflected his portion of the insurer's negotiated rate for the knee and foot portion of the leg but did not include the costly part that fits around his stump, which didn't need replacing. The insurer approved the prosthetic leg on appeal, claiming it had made an administrative error, Adams said.",
      "",
      "\"We're fortunate that we're able to afford that 20%,\" said Adams, who is a self-employed leadership consultant.",
      "",
      "Leah Kaplan doesn't have that financial flexibility. Born without a left hand, she did not have a prosthetic limb until a few years ago.",
      "",
      "Growing up, \"I didn't want more reasons to be stared at,\" said Kaplan, 32, of her decision not to use a prosthesis. A few years ago, the cycling enthusiast got a prosthetic hand specially designed for use with her bike. That device was covered under the health plan she has through her county government job in Spokane, Washington, helping developmentally disabled people transition from school to work.",
      "",
      "But when she tried to get approval for a prosthetic hand to use for everyday activities, her health plan turned her down. The myoelectric hand she requested would respond to electrical impulses in her arm that would move the hand to perform certain actions. Without insurance coverage, the hand would cost her just over $46,000, which she said she can't afford.",
      "",
      "Working with her doctor, she has appealed the decision to her insurer and been denied three times. Kaplan said she's still not sure exactly what the rationale is, except that the insurer has questioned the medical necessity of the prosthetic hand. The next step is to file an appeal with an independent review organization certified by the state insurance commissioner's office.",
      "",
      "A prosthetic hand is not a luxury device, Kaplan said. The prosthetic clinic has ordered the hand and made the customized socket that will fit around the end of her arm. But until insurance coverage is sorted out, she can't use it.",
      "",
      "At this point she feels defeated. \"I've been waiting for this for so long,\" Kaplan said.",

      "To age well, geriatricians say one underappreciated key is maintaining good balance",
      "Taking a shower. Grocery shopping. Moving around the kitchen. Getting dressed. The underappreciated link between these mundane activities is good balance, which geriatricians say is key to maintaining an independent lifestyle as we age.",
      "Lacking balance can be dangerous. In the U.S., 3 million older people seek medical care for fall-related injuries each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control. But falls are not inevitable, said Roopa Anmolsingh, a geriatrician who created the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s balance classes.",
      "\u201cSome people have a misconception that part of getting old is, you\u2019re going to fall. That\u2019s not true,\u201d Anmolsingh said. \u201cYou can control how you fall, or if you fall.\u201d",
      "To prevent falls, geriatricians say people should start asking themselves questions about their balance as early as 50 years old.",
      "Besides muscles and bones, other systems in the body can affect balance, so it\u2019s important to have a doctor check you if you ever feel unsteady, even if only occasionally. The cause could be related to blood pressure, a medication, inner-ear function, a nervous system issue or countless other potential problems.",
      "Even if unsteadiness is not an issue, you can determine whether you still might need an intervention with an easy at-home assessment.",
      "Standing next to a wall or something that can lend support if needed, raise one leg. If you can balance on each leg for 10 seconds, you should be fine, said Greg W. Hartley, a University of Miami professor of physical therapy specializing in geriatrics.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t do that, then you should probably go see a physical therapist,\u201d he said.",
      "Another assessment, which Hartley recommended doing supervised, is called TUG, for \u201ctimed up and go.\u201d Sit in a chair and start a timer when you stand. Walk 10 feet (3 meters), come back and stop the timer upon sitting back down. If it takes longer than 15 seconds, the risk for a fall is very high. Twelve seconds or less, the likelihood of a fall is almost zero.",
      "The National Council on Aging offers an online resource to assess the risk of a fall with questions about medications, whether you worry about falling and if you have trouble stepping over a curb, among others.",
      "Because muscle mass begins to decline in most people during their 30s, geriatricians say the best way to preserve good balance is to stay physically active throughout life. But it\u2019s never too late to start prioritizing it, Anmolsingh said.",
      "Tai chi and yoga are particularly good for older adults because they involve controlled movements while shifting body weight. There also are individual exercises people can work into their everyday lives.",
      "Anmolsingh recommended standing on one foot while waiting in line at the grocery store. At home, try sitting up and down from a chair several times without using arm rests. While holding onto a chair or the wall, do three-way leg lifts on each side, lifting a leg to the front, side and then back. At the kitchen counter, take a few steps to the side in each direction.",
      "For general physical activity, which will improve balance as well as mood and overall health, the National Institute of Aging recommends at least 150 minutes per week. That should include a mixture of stretching to improve flexibility, an aerobic activity increasing the heart rate and strength training with weights or resistance bands.",
      "For balance-specific exercises, it\u2019s particularly important to do them regularly because it takes at least 50 hours of training to have a measurable impact, Hartley said. Besides strengthening the associated muscles, doing exercises repetitively for extended periods trains the brain to react properly when you slip or trip.",
      "\u201cJust like an athlete needs to do repetition to train for a sport, you\u2019re doing repetition to train for everyday balance activities,\u201d he said.",

      "The week began with a biting cold snap that hammered much of the U.S., the product of a jet stream that slips out of its usual path more often these days",
      "It was a week of fire and ice.",
      "It began with millions of people across the U.S. shivering amid blizzard conditions and frigid air that lasted for days, thanks to a jet stream that slips out of its usual path more often these days. Then, catastrophe in California, with wind-whipped flames taking off in a landscape parched by months of drought to become Los Angeles' worst-ever wildfires.",
      "To cap it off, major weather monitoring agencies confirmed 2024 as the hottest year in global history. Even more dire, four of the six agencies said it was the first full year Earth went beyond a warming threshold seen as critical to limiting the worst effects of climate change.",
      "Welcome to one wild week of the climate crisis, scientists say. There will be more.",
      "\u201cFor the average person, this means the changes you\u2019re experiencing \u2014 more extreme weather, rising costs due to climate impacts, threats to food and water security \u2014 aren\u2019t anomalies,\u201d said Victor Gensini, a meteorology professor at Northern Illinois University. \u201cThey\u2019re the new normal unless we take action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe last week of weird weather has been alarming,\u201d said Natalie Mahowald, chair of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not a sign of things to come, because we\u2019ve barely seen any climate change compared to what we are going to get unless we radically cut CO2 emissions.\u201d",
      "Here's how the week unfolded.",
      "The cold came first.",
      "The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world, which means the difference between temperatures up north and down south are shrinking \u2014 along with sea ice that releases more heat into atmosphere. That means more energy bouncing off and warping or moving the polar vortex, scientists say. And climate change is also messing with the jet stream, the air currents that circle the globe.",
      "The result? More frequent blasts of intense cold in winter even as global temperatures heat up overall.",
      "The blizzard dumped more snow in some parts of Kansas than they usually get in a year, one Kansas State University meteorologist said. Ice-coated trees downed power lines in eastern Kentucky, and a U.S. Olympian skied on the National Mall in Washington.",
      "Farmers rushed to move cows to keep them from freezing to death and to feed and water them as rural roads became impassable. Travel stalled as multiple states warned motorists not to chance the treacherous snow and ice.",
      "About 200 people, many homeless, sheltered at a roller rink in Cincinnati. The alternative was frostbite or worse in exposure to temperatures that were expected to slip from freezing to sub-freezing overnight.",
      "Out West, wildfire took hold.",
      "The Palisades Fire erupted in the Santa Monica mountains and moved quickly on Santa Ana winds gusting to 100 mph \u2014 much faster than normal. The winds were so strong they grounded airplanes normally used to drop water on the flames.",
      "The blaze reached near the Getty Museum and by the end of the day, several celebrities, including Billy Crystal, Mandy Moore and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko, had lost homes. Less than 72 hours before, many stars had convened to walk the Golden Globes\u2019 red carpet.",
      "The Eaton Fire tore through Altadena, killing 2 people and closing about 10 school districts.",
      "Climate change laid the groundwork for California\u2019s megafires. Atmospheric rivers dumped huge amounts of water on the region that caused plenty of plant growth. Then, a fast onset of drought dried them out, providing plenty of fodder for the flames.",
      "The water system used to fight the Palisades fire in Los Angeles buckled in the morning, as some hydrants ran dry as they were overstressed without assistance from firefighting aircraft.",
      "The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was pumping from aqueducts and groundwater into the system, but demand was so high that it wasn\u2019t enough to refill three 1-million gallon tanks in hilly Pacific Palisades. At least 1,000 buildings were engulfed in flames.",
      "The Sunset Fire started, too, threatening the Hollywood Hills and forcing mandatory evacuations in Hollywood.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump criticized state and local officials' water management policies. But experts said critics were connecting unrelated issues and spreading false information during a crisis.",
      "By the afternoon, calmer winds aided firefighters in making some headway, though by that point at least five fires were still active and some burned out of control in the L.A. area.",
      "Scenes of the destruction started to emerge. Recovery crews pulled a body from the rubble of a beachfront residence in Malibu.",
      "AccuWeather, a private company that provides data on weather and its impact, estimated the overall wildfire damage could reach $57 billion, though much of the destruction remains to be surveyed.",
      "At the same time, another winter storm bore down on the South, with warnings and advisories for at least 20 states. Many had gone through the same thing just days earlier.",
      "Major weather monitoring agencies said 2024 was the hottest since record-keeping began, easily passing 2023.",
      "Even more significant: 2024 was the first year with a global average that broke the long-term warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s that was set as a goal by the 2015 Paris climate agreement.",
      "Extreme weather like this week's is \u201caffecting so many more people all at one time,\u201d said Barbara Hofer, a professor emerita of psychology at Middlebury College. \u201cIncreasingly, the scale is changing. The loss is mounting.\"",
      "Hofer said the growing impact may make some people deny climate change, ignore it or become numb to it as \u201ca way to avoid what's psychologically uncomfortable.\"",
      "Such a week can also energize positive change, she said. But Hofer said she thinks that will be harder, at least in the U.S., as Trump takes office. He's promised to halt federal climate action and repeal existing legislation aimed at the problem.",
      "\u201cI worry about the denial, the misinformation, and the forces that are feeding that denial,\" she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we have to address.\u201d",

      "A California man says his two cats died and a third was hospitalized after he fed them raw milk recalled for bird flu risk",
      "A California man whose two cats died after drinking raw milk recalled for bird flu risk says he meant to keep his beloved pets healthy, but his efforts tragically backfired.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrible when you realize that you\u2019re the one that actually gave them the milk that killed them,\u201d said Joseph Journell, 56, of San Bernardino.",
      "Journell lost his 14-year-old tabby, Alexander, and Tuxsie, a 4-year-old tuxedo cat, in late November. A third cat, 4-year-old Big Boy, was hospitalized for a week before tests showed the animal was infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus.",
      "The cats drank unpasteurized milk from lots recalled by Raw Farm, of Fresno, whose dairy products were pulled from California store shelves in December after health officials found the virus in milk for sale, he said. The animals' deaths were confirmed by state and county health officials. The cats were kept indoors, with no access to potentially infected birds, and ate conventional, not raw, pet food, the owner said.",
      "Journell said he had been drinking Raw Farm milk himself for several months because he heard it had \u201cbetter immunity and healing properties\u201d than pasteurized milk. He thought it might be able to help Alexander, who had been losing weight.",
      "\u201cI was trying to make him healthier and make him live longer,\u201d Journell said.",
      "Instead, Alexander died on Thanksgiving Day. Tuxsie followed two days later.",
      "Big Boy was hospitalized and treated with antiviral medications, Journell said. The veterinary team collected urine samples from the cat, which were confirmed positive for H5N1 at labs run by the U.S. Agriculture Department and Cornell University, records show.",
      "Big Boy returned home blind and without the use of his back legs, though he is recovering, Journell said. A fourth cat, Cleo, didn\u2019t drink the milk and remained healthy.",
      "Journell has demanded that Raw Farm owner Mark McAfee compensate him for the more than $12,000 he spent treating the cats, according Seattle food safety lawyer Ilana Korchia, who is representing him.",
      "In an interview, McAfee disputed that the virus was capable of sickening the animals days after it was bottled and sold, citing preliminary research.",
      "But Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, said flu virus survival likely varies widely in different lots of milk. Experts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously confirmed that cats that drank raw milk from infected cows developed neurological disease and died.",
      "\u201cI think the poor cats are the best indicator!\u201d Webby wrote in an email.",
      "Nearly a dozen cats in California have died since early December after consuming raw milk or raw pet food contaminated with bird flu, health officials have said.",
      "The infections have followed a massive outbreak of the bird flu virus in dairy cows, which has affected in more than 900 U.S. dairy herds in 16 states. About 80% of those herds are in California.",
      "Federal and state health officials have warned people not to drink raw milk because of the potential for infection with bird flu and a host of other germs. Officials also have cautioned pet owners to avoid feeding unpasteurized milk and raw meat diets to their animals.",
      "\u201cCats should not be fed any products from affected farms if those products have not been thoroughly cooked or pasteurized to kill the virus,\u201d the FDA warned last month.",
      "After the cats got sick, Journell said he fell ill himself and sought care at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in Fontana, Calif. He said he wasn't checked for bird flu, despite his known exposure to the virus, because medical staff didn't have tests available to detect it.",
      "A Kaiser spokesperson declined to comment on Journell's case specifically, but said the hospital system is following CDC guidelines for screening for bird flu.",
      "Journell has recovered physically but said he's still suffering from the \u201cmental anguish\" of losing his pets. Despite the ordeal, he said he still thinks raw milk offers some health benefits.",
      "Nevertheless, he won't be drinking it any time soon.",
      "\u201cNot right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not in the foreseeable future.\u201d",

      "\"We would prefer to provide your care ourselves, but Providence executives' refusal to continue meeting with caregivers has forced us onto the picket line to advocate for you, our communities, and our colleagues,\" the statement continued. \"Going into a hospital or clinic to get the care you need is not crossing our strike line. We invite you to come join us on the strike line after you've received the care you need.\"",
      "",
      "Ben LeBlanc, MD, chief executive officer at Providence Medical Group Oregon, told MedPage Today that operations were running smoothly Friday morning. \"Nearly 2,000 temporary replacement nurses received intensive Providence orientation over the last several days and they have started their shifts in the hospitals, helping our patients.\"",
      "",
      "\"Obviously, a strike is not good for anyone -- not our caregivers, not our community,\" he added. \"We want this situation resolved. We want to reach fair agreements, finalize these contracts, and we want our nurses and doctors off the picket line and back inside our hospitals and clinics to care for this community.\""

      "While many of the germs that cause this misery can circulate throughout the year, scientists think that the winter surge of flu and cold activity may be because we spend more time indoors and the cold, dry air may weaken our defenses.",
      "But knowing what these bugs are and how they spread can help. While it may be difficult to make it through the season totally unscathed, there are some things you can do to protect yourself from these respiratory and stomach viruses.",
      "Some symptoms are hard to distinguish among illnesses, especially with respiratory viruses. Others are unmistakable.",
      "\u2014 Norovirus is a foodborne illness that can spread through water and contaminated surfaces and can cause vomiting, diarrhea, nausea and stomach pain for about one to three days.",
      "\u2014 The common cold can be caused by several different types of viruses and can cause a runny nose, congestion, cough, sneezing, sore throat, headaches, body aches or low fever for less than a week.",
      "\u2014 The flu, caused by influenza viruses that are always changing, leads to fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, headaches and feeling tired. Flu symptoms tend to hit more quickly than cold symptoms, and can last anywhere from a few days to two weeks.",

      "\u2014 RSV can cause a runny nose, congestion, coughing, sneezing, wheezing, fever and a loss of appetite for a week or two.",
      "Seriously. Rigorous and frequent handwashing \u2014 with soap! \u2014 is crucial to reduce the spread of norovirus, colds, flu and COVID-19.",
      "This is especially true after using the bathroom and eating or preparing food, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "Don't speed through it, either. Count to 20, slowly, while you scrub away.",
      "If you don't have access to soap and water, try a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol \u2014 though that isn't enough to wipe out norovirus.",
      "If norovirus has found you, you'll want to immediately clean surfaces that came in contact with contaminated food or bodily fluids. The CDC recommends disinfecting things with a chlorine bleach solution or one of the products listed on this Environmental Protection Agency website.",
      "Don't forget to wash any clothing that came in contact with vomit or feces \u2014 use hot water and detergent. Then, wash your hands. Again.",

      "Use household cleaning products that contain soap or detergent, and follow it up with a sanitizer. The CDC has more tips on how to clean.",
      "COVID-19 generally spreads through the air from droplets and particles, and the CDC says the risk of getting the virus from a contaminated surface is low.",
      "Viruses can spread through talking, coughing and sneezing, so cover your mouth with a tissue if you feel a tickle in your throat or your nose. Then, wash your hands. Again.",
      "Also, even if you're not sick, consider masking in crowded areas with an N95 or medical-grade mask to protect yourself from respiratory viruses.",
      "Don't touch your face: If you have a germ or virus on your unwashed hands \u2014 respiratory or norovirus \u2014 and touch your face, eyes or nose, it can get into your mucus membranes and, voila!, you're sick!",
      "Updated COVID-19 vaccines are available, as well as annual flu shots for people 6 months and older. For those 60 and older or for people who are pregnant, you may want to get the RSV vaccine.",
      "But there is no vaccine for norovirus or the common cold.",
      "Your immune system may not work as well if you're sleep-deprived, stressed out or dehydrated. So don't grind yourself into the ground if you can help it. Rest. Sleep. Drink water.",
      "If you do get sick, prompt testing can help determine whether you have COVID-19 or influenza. That\u2019s important to see if you need one of the medicines that can help prevent severe illness: Paxlovid for COVID-19 and Tamiflu for flu.",
      "Above all, if you're symptomatic, stay at home to keep from getting others sick.",
      "To treat a cold, flu or COVID-19, rest and drink fluids. You can take pain relievers to lower a fever or help with an achy body. Humidifiers can help with symptoms, too.",
      "There's no medication for norovirus. Instead, you'll need to rehydrate as much as possible with water and other liquids. Seek help if you are dehydrated and notice you have a dry mouth and throat, aren't urinating as much or feel dizzy when you're standing up.",

    "summary": "The District of Columbia is suing the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, hoping it will lead to a cleanup of the urban waterway",
    "story": [
      "The District of Columbia is suing the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, hoping it will lead to a cleanup of the urban waterway",
      "The District of Columbia on Friday filed a lawsuit against the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, arguing it has inflicted \u201ccatastrophic harm\u201d on the mostly poor and minority communities living along the urban waterway.",
      "The lawsuit argues that federal government, which owns and controls the riverbed, has since the 1800s dumped toxic waste, heavy metals and chemicals including carcinogenic PCBs in the river and refused to clean it up. The 9-mile (14-kilometer) river flows through Washington, D.C. and parts of Maryland. For decades, it was treated as a municipal dumping ground for industrial waste, storm sewers and trash. That contamination largely affected communities of color.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that PCBs from the Washington Navy Yard were dumped in the river along with hazardous chemicals from the Kenilworth Landfill and chemical waste from federal printing facilities. It also blamed the federal government for poorly managing the District of Columbia's sewer system, which led to the dumping of raw sewage and toxic waste into the river.",
      "That pollution has led to swimming bans and warnings about fishing along the river, the lawsuit alleges, calling the federal government its biggest polluter.",
      "\u201cIt has systematically contaminated the River through the indiscriminate dumping and release of hazardous substances and through destructive dredge and fill operations,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said pollutants in the river don't break down and cause long-lasting harm to the environment, aquatic wildlife, and human health, including cancer, neurological and developmental disorders and birth defects.",
      "The District of Columbia is demanding that the federal government pay for the river's cleanup.",
      "The lawsuit comes as the District of Columbia has made progress in cleaning up the river and returning to a time where residents fished and boated and wildlife including bald eagles, osprey, cranes, kingfishers and eel thrived there.",
      "A $3.29 billion sewer upgrade, including a series of tunnels drilled under the city to capture storm and sewage water, has reduced overflows into the river by 91%, according to DC Water, the city\u2019s water utility. The final section of the Anacostia Tunnel System went online in 2023, and the overall system is expected to reduce overflows by 98%.",
      "Pepco, the city\u2019s utility, also reached an agreement with the District of Columbia to pay more than $57 million for discharging hazardous chemicals from their power plants into soil, groundwater and storm sewers for decades that polluted the Anacostia and other areas. The settlement was believed to be the largest in the utility\u2019s history.",
      "The payments will be used in part to clean up the river. Other measures the city government instituted like a fee on plastic bags since 2009 have also helped keep trash out, experts say.",
      "Still, the Anacostia remains polluted. It received a failing grade for the third time in six years in 2023 from a nonprofit that grades the river\u2019s health based on its fecal bacteria content and the state of its aquatic vegetation.",

      "Setting boundaries at work can be tricky",
      "NEW YORK -- When Justin Stewart started his career, he juggled several jobs to make ends meet. He poured himself into his full-time role as a news show production assistant from 3 a.m. until noon. Then he rushed to the airport where he rented cars or to the big box stores where he pulled retail shifts.",
      "Sometimes, he slept in his car between jobs. Then he was hospitalized for exhaustion and a staph infection.",
      "\u201cWhile people around me praised my hustle, I eventually paid the price,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThe doctor looked at me and said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what lifestyle you\u2019re living, but you\u2019re too young to be this stressed. You\u2019re going to have to quit something.'\"",
      "So Stewart, now 36, began setting boundaries. He gave up the side jobs, deciding he could survive without extra income. If people from the news show texted him after-hours, he let them know he was off-duty and where else to call.",
      "Setting boundaries at work, and in life, can be tricky. Many people find it difficult to say no, especially to a manager. Some get a sense of satisfaction from being needed or pleasing others.",
      "But learning to turn down a request or invitation is essential for protecting our physical and mental health, experts say. And as with any new skill, drawing boundaries gets easier with practice.",
      "Experts in well-being and organizational behavior, along with other workers, shared strategies for setting limits.",
      "Adding tasks to your calendar may seem counterintuitive if scaling back is the goal, but can provide more control over your time.",
      "Bobby Dutton, the founder of event production company GBM6, uses a technique he calls \u201caggressive calendering.\u201d He schedules the task he\u2019s most likely to procrastinate on, such as handling contracts and invoices, for every Monday at 2 p.m. To keep his calendar from becoming overloaded, he also books time for recurring routine tasks like making coffee, walking the dog and eating lunch.",
      "If you\u2019re unaccustomed to saying no, you can write down what you\u2019re going to say beforehand and rehearse it. Stewart worked on letting colleagues know when his assignment load began feeling too heavy with phrases like \u201cHey, this is a lot for me\" or \"You gave me seven stories, I think I can get four or five done.\u201d",
      "Cara Houser, a workplace engagement coach, says you don\u2019t have to explain yourself when declining a request. You can simply say you\u2019re not available at that time, followed by \u201cThanks for asking, and I hope to have more capacity next time.\u201d",
      "If the recipient of your \u201cno\u201d tries to argue, you can respond, \u201cI hear you feel that way. But for me, this is what I\u2019ve decided to do for that day,\u201d Houser said.",
      "Entrepreneur Amber Krasinski grew up in a working-class environment where saying no to a boss could mean losing a paycheck. As the founder of marketing company IvyHill Strategies, Krasinski worries she'll lose clients if she turns down a project. \u201cNot yet\u201d is her go-to phrase when one more project is too much.",
      "\u201cThat phrase has helped me through a lot of situations,\u201d she said.",
      "It can be tempting to agree immediately when we're asked to chip in. But there may be times when we're better off demurring. When faced with a new work request, take five minutes to assess your workload, energy level and priorities before responding, suggests Israa Nasir, a psychotherapist in New York.",
      "Nasir says a former boss frequently texted work-related questions at 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. \u201cI didn\u2019t say, \u2018Don\u2019t text me,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI said, \u2019Can we check in on Fridays before the weekend? So everything that\u2019s on your mind, you can (tell me) and then I can plan my time accordingly.\u201d",
      "Pay attention to the activities and interactions that leave you feeling drained or overwhelmed, Nasir said. Put those kinds of events on a \u201cNo List.\" The list doesn't mean you decline every time you're asked, but don't say yes right away, she advises.",
      "Mobile devices make it easier to work from anywhere, and harder to draw boundaries. But there are ways to adjust our devices so they're less distracting.",
      "After noticing that she checked email far too frequently on weekends, Nasir starting moving the Gmail app from her iPhone\u2019s homepage to the second page from Friday night to Sunday night.",
      "An email signature is another tool you can use to manage expectations, by publishing working hours or upcoming vacation schedules, said Candice Pokk, a senior consultant in organizational effectiveness at Segal Consulting.",
      "Pokk includes a \u201cWell Being Notice\u201d at the bottom of her emails which reads, \u201cReceiving this email outside normal working hours? Managing a work-life balance is unique for everyone. I have sent this email at a time that works for me. Please respond at a time that works for you.\u201d",
      "With the popularity of online meeting software, it's easy for others to overload your calendar with invitations. Accepting every one can leave little time for other work.",
      "Janine Pelosi, CEO of Oslo-based video technology company Neat, thinks workers should be able to leave a meeting that's not relevant to them, if it's an environment where that's accepted.",
      "If you're unsure it's worthwhile to attend, you can request an agenda in advance, or ask what is the desired outcome, she said.",
      "Publisher Lori Perkins, 65, was working 12 to 16 hours daily when a cancer diagnosis halted her routine. During chemotherapy, she could only muster up enough energy to put in four hours a day, and even then felt like she was working \u201cin a vat of molasses.\u201d",
      "After treatment, \"I realized I was going to live, and then I said to myself, \u2018Do I want to continue doing this?\u2019\u201d Perkins said.",
      "She now caps her work as owner of Riverdale Avenue Books at about 50 hours per week, and as a result can't review as many manuscripts. Instead of sending rejection letters, she tells authors to come back in three to six months when it's less hectic.",
      "She practices saying \u201cno\u201d in her head and in her journal, where she also chronicles what happened after she said it. She's gained time to visit museums, friends and the theater.",

      "An annual U.S. government report on \u201cnotorious markets\u201d known for counterfeiting and other violations of intellectual property says that nearly all 35,000 online pharmacies around the world are being run illegally",
      "BANGKOK -- Nearly all of the world\u2019s 35,000 online pharmacies are being run illegally and consumers who use them risk getting ineffective or dangerous drugs, according to the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s annual report on \u201c notorious markets.\u201d The report also singled out 19 countries over concerns about counterfeit or pirated products.",
      "The report also named about three dozen online retailers, many of them in China or elsewhere in Asia that it said are allegedly engaged in selling counterfeit products or other illegal activities.",
      "The report says 96% of online pharmacies were found to be violating the law, many operating without a license and selling medicines without prescriptions and safety warnings.",
      "Their websites often look like legitimate e-commerce platforms, often with false claims that they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, said the report, released Wednesday. The FDA and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have both issued warnings about risks of buying prescription medicines from such sources.",
      "It cited a survey by the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies\u2019 Global Foundation that found nearly one in four Americans who have used online pharmacies reported having encountered substandard, fake or harmful medicines.",
      "Last year, Federal prosecutors reported that a network of illegal drug sellers based in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and India had packaged potentially deadly synthetic opioids into pills disguised as common prescription drugs and sold millions of them through fake online drugstores, federal prosecutors said Monday. At least nine people died of narcotics poisoning between August 2023 and June 2024 after consuming the counterfeit pills, the indictment said.",
      "Apart from the risks of using drugs that may contain inert ingredients or those that could cause allergies, the medicines are sometimes made in unsanitary conditions, said the report, which did not give annual statistics for those who may have died or otherwise been harmed.",
      "The USTR\u2019s annual report cited examples from inside the United States, but and also mentioned risks of imported ingredients including fentanyl from China. Many of the illicit online pharmacies are based outside the U.S.",
      "The \u201cNotorious Markets List\u201d did laud progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods.",
      "In one case, U.S. authorities, industry groups and the police collaborated in shutting down a Hanoi, Vietnam-based piracy ring, Fmovies, and other related piracy sites, in July and August.",
      "The report said the world\u2019s then-largest pirated movies site had drawn more than 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.",
      "In another Vietnam-linked case, two people operating pirate television platform BestBuyIPTV were convicted and ordered to pay fines and forfeit property.",
      "The report also cited crackdowns on online piracy in Brazil and the United Kingdom and busts of sellers of counterfeit purses, clothing and shoes in Kuwait.",
      "But problems remain with cyberlockers that thwart efforts to restrict piracy of movies and other content and of so-called \u201cbulletproof\u201d internet service providers, or ISPs, that promise people using them leeway for using pirate sites, it said.",
      "One such ISP is Avito, a Russian-based ad platform that allegedly lets sellers advertise counterfeit products.",
      "Baidu Wangpan, a cloud storage service of China\u2019s largest search engine provider, Baidu, was named for allegedly failing to enforce or being slow to act on copyright protection.",
      "The report also pointed to social-commerce site Pinduoduo and to Douyin Mall, a Chinese online platform owned by Tiktok owner ByteDance. It said the shopping platforms have sought to build up protections but that they still host many counterfeit goods.",
      "It also named Shopee, a Singapore-based online and mobile e-commerce site, saying some country-focused platforms serving Southeast Asia and South American had better track records in fighting piracy than others.",
      "IndiaMART, an big business-to-business marketplace in India, still offers a slew of counterfeit products, it said.",
      "While a large share of theft of intellectual property has moved online, the report also highlighted real world locations notorious for selling counterfeit products, including markets in Turkey, bazaars in the United Arab Emirates and Saigon Square Shopping Mall in Vietnam\u2019s Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "The report said Bangkok\u2019s MBK Center, a huge mall of about 2,000 stores, had actively cracked down on counterfeiting, though such products still can be found there."

      "The British government has pledged to rip up the red tape hindering construction of data centers that underpin artificial intelligence while promoting its \u201cpro-innovation\u201d approach to regulating the technology",
      "LONDON -- The British government pledged on Monday to rip up the red tape hindering construction of data centers that underpin artificial intelligence while promoting its \u201cpro-innovation\u201d approach to regulating the technology.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the potential of AI as he outlined wide-ranging plans to harness the technology, indicating that it will be a key part of his government\u2019s efforts to \u201cturn around the economy\u201d and jump-start lackluster growth.",
      "Starmer said he wanted to Britain to become \u201cone of the great AI superpowers\u201d that can keep up with other countries like the United States and China that have led advances in the technology.",
      "Under the 50-point plan, which provided few details on investment amounts, the government plans to massively expand public computing power, including by building a new national supercomputer and setting up AI \u201cgrowth zones\u201d with \u201cstreamlined\u201d building approval process.",
      "\u201cSo if you\u2019re looking at where to build your data centers, we will speed up planning permission if you need better access to power,\u201d Starmer said.",
      "Britain's complex building permission rules are frequently blamed for preventing development of big projects such as data centers. After taking power in July, Starmer's Labour government vowed to review decisions by local authorities to reject some projects.",
      "The government will also stick to its \u201cpro-innovation\u201d approach to regulating AI, which involves giving responsibility to existing industry regulators instead of drawing up a new set of rules like the European Union has done. It will also continue to support of U.K.\u2019s AI Safety Institute, set up under Starmer\u2019s Conservative predecessor Rishi Sunak to carry out research on the most cutting-edge AI models and the existential but far-off risks they pose.",
      "\u201cWe will test and understand AI before we regulate it to make sure that when we do it, it\u2019s proportionate and grounded in the science,\u201d Starmer said.",

      "ISTANBUL -- President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has marked the launch of Turkey\u2019s \u201cYear of the Family\u201d on Monday with an attack on the LGBTQ+ community and the announcement of measures to boost birth rates.",
      "Citing the \u201chistorical truth that a strong family paves the way for a strong state,\u201d Erdogan unveiled a series of financial measures to support young families.",
      "The president returned to themes he has espoused before about LGBTQ+ people, including the portrayal of the LGBTQ+ movement as part of a foreign conspiracy aimed at undermining Turkey.",
      "\"It is our common responsibility to protect our children and youth from harmful trends and perverse ideologies. Neoliberal cultural trends are crossing borders and penetrating all corners of the world,\u201d he told an audience in Ankara. \u201cThey also lead to LGBT and other movements gaining ground.",
      "\u201cThe target of gender neutralization policies, in which LGBT is used as a battering ram, is the family. Criticism of LGBT is immediately silenced, just like the legitimate criticisms of Zionism. Anyone who defends nature and the family is subject to heavy oppression.\u201d",
      "Despite its low profile in Turkey, the LGBTQ+ community has emerged as one of the main targets of the government and its supporters in recent years.",
      "Pride parades have been banned since 2015, with those seeking to participate facing tear gas and police barricades. In recent years, meanwhile, anti-LGBTQ+ rallies have received state support.",
      "Turning to the \u201calarming\u201d decline in the population growth rate, Erdogan said Turkey was \"losing blood\u201d and recalled his 2007 demand that families have at least three children.",
      "The president also pointed to people getting married later in life and rising divorce rates as causes for concern. Turkey\u2019s annual population growth rate dropped from 2.53% in 2015 to 0.23% last year.",
      "\u201cIf we do not take the necessary measures, the problem will reach irreparable levels. In such an environment, population loss is inevitable,\u201d he added.",
      "To combat the threat to the family, Erdogan revealed policies such as interest-free loans for newlyweds; improved monetary allowances for the parents of new-born children; financial, counselling and housing support to encourage new families; and free or low-cost childcare.",

      "The European Commission is denying that it tried to cover up the state of health of its president, Ursula von der Leyen, who was hospitalized with severe pneumonia",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Commission denied on Monday that it had tried to cover up the state of health of its president, Ursula von der Leyen, after the head of the EU\u2019s executive branch was hospitalized with severe pneumonia.",
      "Von der Leyen, 66, is the EU\u2019s most high-profile political figure. In September, she marked the start of her second five-year term as commission president by traveling to Ukraine and then to South America for a major trade meeting.",
      "On Jan. 3, the commission had said von der Leyen was ill with \u201csevere pneumonia\u201d and that her appointments for the next two weeks had been canceled. It said her agenda was cleared of meetings in Lisbon and in Poland, which has just taken over the EU\u2019s rotating presidency.",
      "No details were provided about her condition or how she fell ill, but German news agency dpa later reported that she had been admitted to the hospital. It raised questions about transparency at the EU\u2019s powerful executive branch.",
      "Asked by reporters why news of her hospitalization had been withheld, commission spokesperson Paula Pinho said: \u201cWe said that the president had severe pneumonia. We said that she was dealing with severe illness\u201d at her home in the German city of Hannover.",
      "Pinho said the media was informed that von der Leyen had canceled her appointments in early January but was taking important phone calls, including with Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, and was able to conduct commission business.",
      "\u201cWe therefore gave you the critical information about the health status of the president, by saying what sickness she had, and how serious it was,\u201d Pinho said in response to questions from several reporters, without explaining why the hospital details were withheld. \u201cHer ability to act was never in question.\u201d",
      "Von der Leyen spent eight days in the hospital, from June 2-10. Pinho said the president is \u201crecovering well,\u201d and was due to return to Brussels to her office at the commission, where she has a small apartment, at the end of this week.",
      "The former German defense minister usually keeps a punishing travel schedule. She is due to attend a European Parliament session in Strasbourg, France, next week and will travel to the World Economic forum in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "After coming to office in 2019, von der Leyen led the EU drive to secure COVID-19 vaccines and has been a major supporter of Ukraine in its war against Russia. With governments weakened in France and Germany, she has sought to play a greater role in the 27-nation bloc\u2019s affairs."

      "BANGKOK -- An overnight landslide at a jade mining area in northern Myanmar has killed at least a dozen people and left many others missing, according to a resident, rescuers and independent media on Monday. They said about 50 houses were buried or damaged.",
      "The accident occurred early Monday in Kachin state\u2019s Hpakant township, a remote mountainous region at the center of the lucrative jade mining industry, about 950 kilometers (600 miles) north of Myanmar\u2019s biggest city, Yangon. It\u2019s a region where sporadic fighting has broken out between the Myanmar army and ethnic guerrilla forces.",
      "Tarlin Mg, a resident near the accident area, told The Associated Press that the bodies of 12 people, including four children, had been recovered in Spott village.",
      "He said about 50 houses there were buried by muddy water that seeped from a pond about 300 feet (91 meters) away where many tons of mining debris and waste had been poured.",
      "Two local rescuers told the AP it was difficult finding missing people due to the large amount of mud, and large machinery was needed. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation from the military or the guerrilla forces fighting it.",
      "Kachin-based online media reported that about 30-50 people could be missing.",
      "Landslides occur several times a year around Hpakant\u2019s jade mines. In July 2020, at least 162 people died in a landslide in the same area, and 113 were killed in a November 2015 one.",
      "Most victims are independent miners who settle near mounds of discarded earth excavated by heavy machinery used by mining companies. They scavenge for bits of jade and usually work and live in abandoned mining pits at the base of the mounds, which become particularly unstable during the rainy season.",
      "Most scavengers are unregistered migrants from other areas, making it hard to determine how many people are missing after accidents.",
      "Smuggling and illicit sales make it hard to know how big the local jade mining industry is, but revenue from sales of jade, pearls and gemstones from the area is estimated to run in the billions of dollars.",
      "Human rights activists say jade mining is an important source of revenue for Myanmar\u2019s military government.",
      "The mines are also a main source of revenue for the Kachin Independence Army, an ethnic armed group based in Kachin state that has been fighting for decades against the central government for greater autonomy.",
      "A ceasefire in the region has been disrupted since since the military seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. The region is now embroiled in conflict that has driven many civilians into refugee camps and nearby townships."

    "story": [
      "Israel and Hamas have been holding indirect talks for more than a year aimed at ending the war in Gaza and returning scores of militant-held hostages in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel",
      "Israel and Hamas have been holding indirect talks for more than a year aimed at ending the war in Gaza and returning scores of militant-held hostages in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.",
      "But despite intensive mediation by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, the talks have repeatedly stalled over several key issues, including the details of the exchange, whether the ceasefire would be permanent and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.",
      "As each side has accused the other of backtracking, the war has ground on.",
      "Dozens of Palestinians have been killed each day in Israeli strikes, and most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are huddled in squalid tent camps, their neighborhoods in ruins. Humanitarian groups struggle to deliver desperately needed aid, and experts have warned of famine.",
      "In Israel, families of the hostages have held weekly rallies demanding a deal for their release, fearing their loved ones will die in the harsh conditions of their captivity the longer the fighting drags on.",
      "Here's a look at the main points of contention.",
      "Hamas and other groups are still holding around 100 hostages captured in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that ignited the war, in which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. The Israeli military has declared a third of the hostages dead, but suspects that the true number could be around half.",
      "Hamas is demanding the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners, including senior militants convicted of orchestrating attacks that killed civilians. Israel is reluctant to free such prisoners, especially since one of the masterminds of the 2023 attack, the slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, was a former prisoner released in such a deal.",
      "The two sides have exchanged lists of names, with Israel demanding more information about which hostages are alive to ensure they come out first. Hamas says it needs at least a brief truce to determine the status of the hostages, because they are being held by various groups in scattered, secret locations.",
      "The emerging deal calls for a multiphase plan. In the first stage, Hamas would release the most vulnerable hostages and Israeli forces would pull back from some areas, allowing some Palestinians to return to their homes and a surge of humanitarian aid.",
      "In the second step \u2014 which would be negotiated during the first \u2014 the rest of the living hostages would be released in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.",
      "Hamas has said it won't release the remaining hostages without assurances that the war will end. Israel's offensive has killed more than 46,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to local health authorities, which don't say how many of the dead were militants.",
      "Hamas likely fears that Israel will resume its offensive \u2014 and step up its intensity \u2014 once the hostages are out and the militants no longer have their most valuable bargaining chip.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to do just that. He says that Israel won't end the war until it has destroyed Hamas' military and governing abilities and ensured that the Palestinian militant group no longer poses a threat.",
      "The lack of trust goes both ways: Israelis fear that Hamas will drag out negotiations over the second phase, extending the ceasefire indefinitely while the hostages languish.",
      "The talks nearly collapsed last summer when Netanyahu said that Israel would maintain a lasting presence in the Philadelphi corridor, a strip of land along the Gaza-Egypt border.",
      "Israel says Hamas has long smuggled weapons into Gaza through tunnels beneath the corridor and that it must control the area to prevent Hamas from rebuilding. Egypt, a key mediator, says it blocked the tunnels years ago, and is opposed to any Israeli presence on the Gaza side of its border.",
      "Israel has also demanded a mechanism for inspecting people returning to their homes in northern Gaza, from which around a million people fled following Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war. Their return is a key Hamas demand, the details of which are still being worked out.",
      "Israel says people returning to the north should be searched for weapons. That would probably require an Israeli presence in what's known as the Netzarim corridor, a strip of closed roads and military installations stretching from the border to the sea just south of Gaza City.",
      "The Palestinians are opposed to any permanent Israeli occupation, though Hamas has reportedly shown flexibility on the timetable of the Israeli withdrawal.",
      "Israel says Hamas can never again rule Gaza, but it has yet to endorse a realistic plan for an alternative government. With no internal rivals, Hamas has been able to quickly regroup after Israeli operations, even in the hardest-hit areas, and still controls much of the territory.",
      "The Biden administration has long pushed for a grand bargain in which a reformed Palestinian Authority would govern postwar Gaza with the support of Arab and Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, which would also take the historic step of forging ties with Israel.",
      "But Arab and Muslim leaders say they will only sign onto such plans if they include a pathway to a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank, Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem and Gaza, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "Israel's government is opposed to Palestinian statehood and has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza. Netanyahu says that Israel will maintain open-ended security control while delegating governance to politically independent Palestinians. But none appear to have volunteered, and Hamas has threatened anyone who cooperates with Israel in running the territory.",
      "Hamas has said, however, that it's willing to relinquish control of Gaza to other Palestinians. Late last year, it agreed to an Egyptian-brokered plan for a group of independents to govern the territory under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority, which has yet to accept the proposal.",
      "Hamas has also demanded the lifting of a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt after it seized power in 2007, which experts say is needed for Gaza to be rebuilt.",
      "The lifting of the blockade, however, would allow Hamas to claim a major victory and to eventually rebuild its military capabilities. That's another nonstarter for Israel.",

      "\u201cThe procedure of those who do not have legal intentions cannot be legal,\u201d he said.",
      "The prosecutor\u2019s office said a three-month investigation led to arrest warrants for 47 people, including Akpolat and Ahmet Ozer, the CHP mayor of Istanbul\u2019s Esenyurt district.",
      "Ozer has been behind bars since October as part of a separate investigation into his alleged connections to the banned Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK.",
      "The tender-rigging scheme was allegedly led by a man named Aziz Ihsan Aktas, prosecutors said. He and 24 other suspects were detained on charges of establishing and running a criminal organization, being members of a criminal organization, bribery, bid-rigging, violating tax laws and asset laundering.",
      "Police set up barriers around Besiktas municipal offices while Akpolat\u2019s office was searched and checked staff IDs before allowing workers to enter.",
      "Akpolat, 42, was elected Besiktas mayor in 2019 with nearly three-quarters of the vote, having previously run unsuccessfully for parliament on the CHP ticket.",
      "Along with other municipal officers, he was detained on charges of membership in a criminal organization, bid-rigging, bribery and unjust acquisition of property.",
      "Since opposition parties successfully won control of major cities across Turkey in 2019 \u2014 and retained them in last year\u2019s local elections \u2014 local officials have often been arrested and removed from office. Members of the pro-Kurdish party have been the main targets over alleged ties to the PKK.",
      "Two co-mayors from the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Equality and Democracy Party, or DEM, were jailed Monday pending trial on terrorism-related charges. A government-appointed trustee was placed to run the Akdeniz municipality in Mersin on Turkey\u2019s south coast."

      "Experts say the tunnel project is important to the military, which will gain significantly improved capabilities to operate in Ladakh while also providing civilians with freedom of movement year-round between the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh.",
      "In October, gunmen fatally shot at least seven people working on the tunnel project and injured at least five others. Police blamed insurgents fighting for decades against Indian rule in the region.",
      "In 2019, New Delhi stripped Kashmir\u2019s special status as a semi-autonomous region with a separate constitution and inherited protections on land and jobs. The federal government also downgraded and divided the former state into two centrally governed union territories, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir, the first time in the history of India that a region\u2019s statehood was downgraded to a federally administered territory.",
      "India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi\u2019s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels\u2019 goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country.",
      "India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict."

      "Officials say U.S. and Arab mediators made significant progress overnight toward brokering a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and the release of scores of hostages held in the Gaza Strip, but a deal has not been reached yet",
      "CAIRO -- U.S. and Arab mediators made significant progress overnight toward brokering a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and the release of scores of hostages held in the Gaza Strip, but a deal hasn't been reached yet, officials said Monday.",
      "Three officials acknowledged that progress has been made and said the coming days would be critical for ending more than 15 months of fighting that has destabilized the Middle East. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the talks.",
      "One of the three officials and a Hamas official said that there were still a number of hurdles to clear. On several occasions over the past year, U.S. officials have said that they were on the verge of reaching a deal, only to have the talks stall.",
      "One person familiar with the talks said there had been a breakthrough overnight and that there was a proposed deal on the table. Israeli and Hamas negotiators will now take it back to their leaders for final approval, the person said.",
      "The person said that mediators from the Gulf country of Qatar had put renewed pressure on Hamas to accept the agreement, while U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, was pressing the Israelis. Witkoff recently joined the negotiations and has been in the region in recent days.",
      "The person said that the mediators had handed off the draft deal to each side and that the next 24 hours would be pivotal.",
      "An Egyptian official said that there had been good progress overnight, but that it would likely take a few more days, and that the sides were aiming for a deal before Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. A third official said that the talks were in a good place, but hadn't been wrapped up. That official also assessed that a deal was possible before the inauguration.",
      "Asked about the talks at a press conference, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said \u201cprogress has been made, and I hope that within a short time we will see things happening. But it is still to be proved.\"",
      "A Hamas official said a number of contentious issues still need to be resolved, including an Israeli commitment to ending the war and details about the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the hostage-prisoner exchange. The official wasn't authorized to brief media and spoke anonymously.",
      "The Egyptian official confirmed that those issues were still being discussed.",
      "The Biden administration, along with Egypt and Qatar, has spent more than a year trying to broker an agreement to end the deadliest war ever fought between Israelis and Palestinians and secure the release of scores of hostages captured in Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the conflict.",
      "But the sides have been divided over the details of the planned exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, as well as the nature of the ceasefire itself. Hamas has said that it won't release the remaining captives without an end to the war, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the campaign until \u201ctotal victory\u201d over the militant group.",
      "Under discussion now is a phased ceasefire. Netanyahu has repeatedly signaled that he is committed only to the first phase, a partial hostage release in exchange for a weekslong halt in fighting. The possibility of a lasting ceasefire and other issues would be negotiated after the first phase begins. Hamas has demanded a full withdrawal and complete end to the war, and is hoping that this first phase will lead to that outcome.",
      "A deal could weaken Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, which includes two far-right factions that have threatened to leave the government if Israel makes too many concessions. Members of the opposition have promised to give Netanyahu the support that he needs to approve a hostage release, but the hardliners' anger could be a source of instability down the road.",
      "Netanyahu is hoping that the prospect of a Trump administration \u2014 which includes allies of the West Bank settler movement \u2014 will persuade his partners to remain in the government.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden, who hopes to wrap up a deal before leaving office next week, spoke with Netanyahu about the talks on Sunday.",
      "The head of Israel\u2019s Mossad foreign intelligence agency, David Barnea, and Biden\u2019s top Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, were both in the Qatari capital, Doha. Barnea\u2019s presence meant high-level Israeli officials who would need to sign off on any agreement are once again involved in the talks.",
      "McGurk has been working on final details of a text to be presented to both sides, Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d But he said that he would not predict whether a deal can be reached by Jan. 20.",
      "\u201cWe are very, very close,\u201d he said. \u201cYet being very close still means we\u2019re far, because until you actually get across the finish line, we\u2019re not there.\u201d",
      "Just one brief ceasefire has been achieved during the war, and that was in the earliest weeks of fighting. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week that a deal is \u201cvery close\u201d and he hoped to complete it before handing over diplomacy to the incoming Trump administration.",
      "Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, the majority women and children, according to the territory\u2019s Health Ministry, whose count doesn't give a breakdown between fighters and civilians. Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted around 250 others in the attack that ignited the war.",
      "Families of the roughly 100 hostages still held in Gaza are pressing Netanyahu to reach a deal to bring their loved ones home. Israelis rallied again Saturday night in Tel Aviv, with photos of hostages on display.",
      "In Gaza, Palestinians were tempering their hopes for a stop to Israel\u2019s campaign, which has devastated much of the territory and driven around 90% of its 2.3 million people from their homes.",
      "\u201cWe hear that there are negotiations every day, but we see nothing,\u201d said Mazen Hammad, a resident of the southern city of Khan Younis. \u201cWhen we see it on the ground, then we believe that there is a truce.\u201d",

      "The Congolese army says several towns that fell to armed groups in the eastern North Kivu and South Kivu provinces have been recaptured by government forces",
      "GOMA, Congo -- Several towns that fell to armed groups in eastern Congo\u2019s North Kivu and South Kivu provinces have been recaptured by government forces, a Congolese army spokesman said, even as the rebels have made advances in other areas amid intensified fighting in the conflict-battered region.",
      "Eastern Congo has been in conflict for decades with more than 100 armed groups, most of which are vying for territory in the vast and mineral-rich region near the border with Rwanda. The conflict has created one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises with more than 7 million people displaced, including 100,000 who have fled their homes this year.",
      "The Congolese army said some of the recovered towns have been occupied by rebels for months, including Ngungu, a key town in the Masisi territory that is near the North Kivu provincial capital, Goma. Some Masisi villages, however, remain under the control of rebels, including its center known as the Masisi Center.",
      "\u201cThey (the rebels) have seen their adventure come to a halt by the FARDC (Congolese security forces),\u201d Guillaume Ndjike Kaiko, army spokesman in North Kivu, told reporters, listing other recovered towns as Lumbishi, Ruzirantaka, Kamatale, Bitagata and Kabingo.",
      "\u201cAll over there, they have been pushed back,\u201d Kaiko said Sunday, attributing the victories to a joint military operation led by the commanders of the two provinces.",
      "The news of the recovered towns brought mixed feelings among villages that had fled the areas. They worried for their safety as they celebrated their return home.",
      "\u201cWe are in Ngungu \u2026 but we continue to suffer because the security is not well established,\u201d said Nsabimana Alexis, a resident. \u201cPeople continue to die, we just buried a person 30 minutes ago,\u201d he said.",
      "Frequent clashes between the Congolese forces and the rebels have made dozens of villages inaccessible and out of the reach of aid. The most dominant rebel group in the region has been the M23 rebel group, which the Congolese government and United Nations experts say is being backed by neighboring Rwanda. Rwanda denies this.",
      "In Masisi, displaced camps and aid facilities are being overstretched as more people try to seek refuge from the violence, French charity Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, has said.",
      "\u201cWe are doing our best to respond to this situation. But the severe lack of humanitarian responders in the area is making things difficult,\u201d said Romain Briey, the MSF coordinator in Masisi."

    "story": [
      "South Korea\u2019s spy agency has told lawmakers that two North Korean soldiers captured by Ukrainian forces while fighting alongside Russian forces in Russia\u2019s Kursk border region haven\u2019t expressed a desire to seek asylum in South Korea",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s spy agency told lawmakers on Monday that two North Korean soldiers who were captured by Ukrainian forces while fighting alongside Russian forces in Russia\u2019s Kursk border region haven\u2019t expressed a desire to seek asylum in South Korea.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on the social media platform X that he\u2019s willing to hand over the soldiers to North Korea if the country\u2019s authoritarian leader, Kim Jong Un, arranges for an exchange with Ukrainian prisoners of war in Russia. Zelenskyy added that \u201cthere may be other options\u201d for North Korean soldiers who do not wish to return home, and a video released by his government indicated that at least one of the captured soldiers expressed a desire to remain in Ukraine.",
      "In a closed-door briefing at South Korea\u2019s National Assembly, the National Intelligence Service confirmed its participation in the questioning of the North Korean soldiers by Ukrainian authorities. The agency said the soldiers haven\u2019t expressed a request to resettle in South Korea, according to two lawmakers who attended the meeting.",
      "The agency said it was willing to discuss the matter with Ukrainian authorities if the soldiers eventually do ask to go to South Korea. About 34,000 North Koreans have defected to capitalist rival South Korea to avoid economic hardship and political suppression at home, mostly since the late 1990s.",
      "Koo Byoungsam, spokesperson of South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, said facilitating the asylum of the North Korean soldiers would require \u201clegal reviews, including on international law, and consultations with related nations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can say at the current stage,\u201d Koo said.",
      "Seoul\u2019s spy agency believes that about 300 North Korean soldiers have died and another 2,700 have been injured while fighting against Ukrainian forces, in what represents North Korea's first involvement in large-scale conflict since the 1950-53 Korean War.",
      "The agency assessed that the North Koreans are struggling to adapt to drones and other elements of modern warfare. They are further disadvantaged by the crude tactics of their Russian commanders, who have thrown them in assault campaigns without providing rear-fire support, according to Lee Seong Kweun, a lawmaker who attended the agency\u2019s briefing.",
      "The agency said memos found on dead North Korean soldiers indicated that they had been ordered to commit suicide before being captured, according to Lee. The agency said one North Korean soldier, facing the threat of being captured by Ukrainian forces, shouted \u201cGeneral Kim Jong Un\u201d and tried to detonate a hand grenade before he was shot and killed.",
      "Zelenskyy confirmed the capture of the North Korean soldiers on Saturday, days after Ukraine, facing a slow Russian onslaught in the east, began pressing new attacks in Kursk to retain ground captured in a lightning incursion in August \u2014 the first occupation of Russian territory since World War II.",
      "Moscow\u2019s counterattack has left Ukrainian forces outstretched and demoralized, killing and wounding thousands and retaking more than 40% of the 984 square kilometers (380 square miles) of Kursk that Ukraine had seized.",
      "Moon Seong Mook, a retired South Korean brigadier general, said the high death toll for North Korean soldiers was predictable, as they would not have been sufficiently prepared for an unfamiliar mission in the terrain of the Kursk region, which is vastly different from North Korea\u2019s mountainous landscape.",
      "Another disadvantage for the North Koreans is that they are not conducting independent operations but are being thrust into combat under Russian commanders, possibly struggling with unfamiliar tactics and communication issues due to language barriers, said Moon, who has taken part in numerous military talks with North Korea. The North Korean forces could be operating special surveillance teams to arrest or execute attempted deserters, he said.",
      "\u201cThe current battlefield environment, combined with drones and other technologies, have created situations North Korean soldiers have never encountered before,\u201d Moon said. \u201cThey are also being deployed in large numbers in wide-open fields, where there is no place to hide, in continuous battles to retake the area, and that seems to be where the casualties are coming from.\u201d",
      "North Korea\u2019s decadeslong financial troubles, which have forced many soldiers to grow their own food or spend long hours deployed in construction and other work to sustain the national economy, could also have impacted the quality of training they receive at home, Moon said.",
      "Still, there are concerns in Seoul that North Korea\u2019s participation in the Ukraine crisis poses a significant threat to South Korea, as North Korean forces may gain crucial combat experience and Russia may provide technology transfers that could enhance North Korea\u2019s nuclear-armed army.",

      "A fresh drive to bring an end to Turkey's 40-year Kurdish conflict has seen politicians from the pro-Kurdish party meet jailed leaders",
      "ANKARA, Turkey -- Talks between politicians from Turkey\u2019s pro-Kurdish party and jailed Kurdish leaders have been gathering steam as they try to end 40 years of fighting between the state and the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK.",
      "The latest peace effort comes at a time of heightened instability and fundamental changes reshaping the region. These include the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, the weakening of the Hezbollah militant movement in Lebanon, and the reconfiguration of power in Syria after the toppling of President Bashar Assad.",
      "The cautious process was initiated in October by Devlet Bahceli, a firebrand ultranationalist who has usually opposed any concessions to Kurdish identity or rights.",
      "Since then, the fall of Assad in a lightning rebel offensive has triggered intensified fighting between Turkish-backed and Kurdish groups in northern Syria.",
      "The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, who have controlled northeast Syria for the past decade, are under attack from the Syrian National Army, an umbrella of militias fighting on behalf of Turkey, which regards the SDF as an extension of the PKK and wants to neutralize it as an independent fighting force.",
      "Recently, senior members of the Peoples\u2019 Equality and Democracy Party, or DEM, met jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and Selahattin Demirtas, another imprisoned figurehead of the Kurdish movement. They have also met with the leaders of other political parties to explain their discussions.",
      "The Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, has waged an armed insurgency against Turkey since 1984, initially with the aim of establishing a Kurdish state in the southeast of the country. Over time, the objective evolved into a campaign for autonomy and rights for Kurds within Turkey.",
      "The conflict between militants and state forces, which has spread beyond Turkey\u2019s borders into Iraq and Syria, has killed tens of thousands of people. The PKK is considered to be a terror group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.",
      "Abdullah Ocalan, who as a student of political science in Ankara became deeply involved in leftist movements, formed the PKK in 1978 as a Marxist organization. He fled to Syria in 1979, along with other PKK members, where he remained until 1998, when Syria expelled him under intense pressure from Turkey.",
      "Ocalan was captured in Kenya in 1999 and imprisoned on Imrali island in the Sea of Marmara, where he remains to this day. His death sentence for treason was commuted to a life term in prison after Turkey abolished the death penalty.",
      "The 75-year-old endures as a symbol for Kurdish independence and rights and continues to wield influence over the Kurdish movement, with past messages relayed through family members or lawyers resonating beyond Turkey, in Iraq and Syria.",
      "In a message relayed by his nephew in December, Ocalan said he has the power to end the conflict if the conditions are right.",
      "In October, Bahceli, a close ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, suggested Ocalan could be granted parole if he renounces violence and disbands the PKK. It was a major shift for the hardline politician who had previously strongly supported the state\u2019s military action against the militant group and its affiliates in neighboring Syria and rejected any notion of negotiation.",
      "Erdogan appears to have endorsed Bahceli's stance.",
      "There is a mixed reaction among politicians and analysts to suggestions of a new peace effort. Some describe it it as a historic opportunity, while others strongly oppose any notion of leniency toward Ocalan or the PKK.",
      "A recent attack on Turkey\u2019s key aerospace company outside of Ankara that killed several people was claimed by the PKK, complicating the debate.",
      "There have been several peace efforts between the Turkish state and the PKK over the years, including secret negotiations held in Oslo, Norway from 2009 until 2011. However, none have yielded results.",
      "The last attempt to reach a peace deal took place between 2013 and 2015 with a series of talks between Turkish officials and Ocalan, who declared a ceasefire and withdrew fighters to bases in northern Iraq.",
      "Turkish officials took steps to improve Kurdish rights, including allowing Kurdish-language broadcasts. The process collapsed in July 2015, after a series of violent attacks, including one by the Islamic State group that killed 33 pro-Kurdish activists.",
      "Since then, Turkey has cracked down on its pro-Kurdish movement and has jailed thousands of people, including the former leader of the main pro-Kurdish political party, Selahattin Demirtas, over alleged links to the PKK.",
      "The latest peace effort comes at a time when Turkey and the Kurds are both seeking security to face the challenges in the Middle East.",
      "However, some believe the main aim of the reconciliation effort is for Erdogan\u2019s government to garner Kurdish support for a new constitution that would allow him to remain in power beyond 2028, when his term ends.",
      "Bahceli has openly called for a new constitution, saying it was essential to keep Erdogan in power for Turkey\u2019s future. Erdogan and Bahceli are reportedly seeking parliamentary support from the DEM."

      "Millions of Hindu devotees and mystics have gathered in the northern Indian city of Prayagraj for the Maha Kumbh festival, which is the largest religious congregation on earth",
      "PRAYAGRAJ, India -- Millions of Hindu devotees, mystics and holy men and women from all across India flocked to the northern city of Prayagraj on Monday to kickstart the Maha Kumbh festival, which is being touted as the world's largest religious gathering.",
      "Over about the next six weeks, Hindu pilgrims with gather at the confluence of three sacred rivers \u2014 the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati \u2014 where they will take part in elaborate rituals, hoping to begin a journey to achieve Hindu philosophy\u2019s ultimate goal: the release from the cycle of rebirth.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the festival:",
      "Hindus venerate rivers, and none more so than the Ganges and the Yamuna. The faithful believe that a dip in their waters will cleanse them of their past sins and end their process of reincarnation, particularly on auspicious days. The most propitious of these days occur in cycles of 12 years during a festival called the Maha Kumbh Mela, or pitcher festival.",
      "The festival is a series of ritual baths by Hindu sadhus, or holy men, and other pilgrims at the confluence of three sacred rivers that dates to at least medieval times. Hindus believe that the mythical Saraswati river once flowed from the Himalayas through Prayagraj, meeting there with the Ganges and the Yamuna.",
      "Bathing takes place every day, but on the most auspicious dates, naked, ash-smeared monks charge toward the holy rivers at dawn. Many pilgrims stay for the entire festival, observing austerity, giving alms and bathing at sunrise every day.",
      "\u201cWe feel peaceful here and attain salvation from the cycles of life and death,\u201d said Bhagwat Prasad Tiwari, a pilgrim.",
      "The festival has its roots in a Hindu tradition that says the god Vishnu wrested a golden pitcher containing the nectar of immortality from demons. Hindus believe that a few drops fell in the cities of Prayagraj, Nasik, Ujjain and Haridwar \u2014 the four places where the Kumbh festival has been held for centuries.",
      "The Kumbh rotates among these four pilgrimage sites about every three years on a date prescribed by astrology. This year\u2019s festival is the biggest and grandest of them all. A smaller version of the festival, called Ardh Kumbh, or Half Kumbh, was organized in 2019, when 240 million visitors were recorded, with about 50 million taking a ritual bath on the busiest day.",
      "At least 400 million people \u2014 more than the population of the United States \u2014 are expected in Prayagraj over the next 45 days, according to officials. That is around 200 times the 2 million pilgrims that arrived in the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj pilgrimage last year.",
      "The festival is a big test for Indian authorities to showcase the Hindu religion, tourism and crowd management.",
      "A vast ground along the banks of the rivers has been converted into a sprawling tent city equipped with more 3,000 kitchens and 150,000 restrooms. Divided into 25 sections and spreading over 40 square kilometers (15 square miles), the tent city also has housing, roads, electricity and water, communication towers and 11 hospitals.

      "Gunmen have kidnapped an Austrian woman in Niger's Agadez city",
      "NIAMEY, Niger -- An Austrian woman has been kidnapped by gunmen in Niger's Agadez city, local residents and the Austrian Foreign Ministry said on Sunday, the first time a European citizen is known to have been kidnapped in the conflict-hit West African nation since a military junta took power in 2023.",
      "The ministry said Austria's embassy in Algeria, which is also responsible for Niger, had been informed of the kidnap of an Austrian woman in Agadez and was in contact with regional authorities on the ground.",
      "Residents and local media identified the victim as Eva Gretzmacher and reported she is an aid worker who has lived in Agadez \u2014 hundreds of kilometers (miles) away from the capital city of Niamey \u2014 for more than 20 years.",
      "\u201c(She) is well known for her social commitment (and) created a skills center in 2010 that initiated various projects, notably in the fields of education, women\u2019s empowerment, ecology, culture and art,\u201d the local Air Info Agadez reported.",
      "Gretzmacher also supported education programs through her development work and provided assistance to local non-government organizations in various sectors, local media said.",
      "No group claimed responsibility for her abduction and authorities in Niger did not immediately comment on the incident.",
      "Niger has for many years battled a jihadi insurgency linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, a security crisis that analysts say has worsened since the military toppled the country's government in July 2023. Despite their promise to restore peace in hot spots, the junta\u2019s capacity to improve Niger\u2019s security has increasingly been questioned amid increasing attacks.",
      "Niger was seen as one of the last democratic countries in Africa\u2019s Sahel region that Western nations could partner with to beat back the jihadi insurgency in the vast expanse below the Sahara Desert. The country has severed decadeslong military ties with the West and turned to Russia as a new security partner."

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Joe Biden have spoken in a phone call on the latest efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release in the Israel-Hamas war",
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Joe Biden spoke Sunday about efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal in the Israel-Hamas war, a sign of the intensifying push to reach a deal before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration next week.",
      "Talks mediated over the past year by the United States, Egypt and Qatar have repeatedly stalled at moments when they seemed close to a deal. Still, in recent days, U.S. officials have expressed hope of sealing an agreement.",
      "Sunday\u2019s call between Biden and Netanyahu came as the head of Israel\u2019s Mossad foreign intelligence agency, David Barnea, and Biden\u2019s top Mideast adviser, Brett McGurk, were both in the Qatari capital Doha. Barnea\u2019s presence, confirmed by Netanyahu\u2019s office, meant high-level Israeli officials who would need to sign off on any agreement are now involved in talks.",
      "McGurk has been working on final details of a text to be presented to both sides, Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d But he said he would not predict whether a deal can be reached by Jan. 20, the day of the inauguration.",
      "\u201cWe are very, very close,\u201d he said. \u201cYet being very close still means we\u2019re far because until you actually get across the finish line, we\u2019re not there.\u201d",
      "The White House and Netanyahu\u2019s office both confirmed the phone call between the two leaders without providing details.",
      "Just one brief ceasefire has been achieved in 15 months of war, and that was in the earliest weeks of fighting. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this week a deal is \u201cvery close\u201d and he hoped to complete it before handing over diplomacy to the incoming Trump administration.",
      "Under discussion now is a phased ceasefire, with Netanyahu signaling he is committed only to the first phase, a partial hostage release in exchange for a weekslong halt in fighting.",
      "Hamas has insisted on a full Israeli troop withdrawal from the largely devastated territory, but Netanyahu has insisted on destroying Hamas\u2019 ability to fight in Gaza.",
      "Issues in the talks have included which hostages would be released in the first part of a phased ceasefire deal, which Palestinian prisoners would be released and the extent of any Israeli troop withdrawal from population centers in Gaza.",
      "Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, the majority women and children, according to the territory\u2019s Health Ministry, whose count does not give a breakdown between fighters and civilians. Israel\u2019s campaign was triggered by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attack, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted around 250 others.",
      "Families of the roughly 100 hostages still held in Gaza are pressing Netanyahu to reach a deal to bring their loved ones home. Israelis rallied again Saturday night in the city of Tel Aviv, with photos of hostages on display.",
      "In Gaza, Palestinians were tempering their hopes for a stop to Israel\u2019s campaign, which has devastated much of the territory and driven more than 80% of its 2.3 million people from their homes.",
      "\u201cWe hear that there are negotiations every day, but we see nothing,\u201d said Mazen Hammad, a resident of the southern city of Khan Younis. \u201cWhen we see it on the ground, then we believe that there is a truce.\u201d",

      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia's striking university students protested outside the Balkan country's top court on Sunday to draw their attention to what they say have been violations of their civil rights under the populist authorities, including pressure from the secret service.",
      "The rally began with thousands of people standing in silence for 15 minutes in front of the Constitutional Court in the capital, Belgrade, to commemorate the victims of a concrete canopy collapse in the northern city of Novi Sad in November which triggered almost daily anti-corruption protests.",
      "A separate rally was also held in the southern city of Nis.",
      "The ongoing protests reflect wider discontent with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic\u2019s increasingly autocratic rule. Vucic formally says he wants to steer Serbia toward European Union membership but he has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms rather than advancing them",
      "Classes at Serbia's universities have been suspended for weeks with the students demanding accountability for the canopy collapse at the railway station building in Novi Sad on Nov. 1.",
      "Many in Serbia believe the huge canopy collapsed because of sloppy reconstruction work that resulted from corruption. The Novi Sad railway station building was renovated twice in recent years in a deal with Chinese state companies.",
      "Fourteen people were killed and three others were severely injured after tons of concrete crashed without warning. One more person later died while in the hospital.",
      "Striking students have reported pressure from Serbian state security and Vucic, who has accused the students of receiving money from the West for their protests.",
      "The pro-government media have bluntly published personal data of some of the protesters, which would not be possible without the involvement of Serbia's secret service, or BIA.",
      "Luka Stojakovic, who was targeted by the pro-government media along with his twin brother, told N1 television that \u201cwe have learned that BIA (Serbia\u2019s state security agency) can knock on our doors, conduct repression against our parents and invited us for a \u2018friendly\u2019 chat.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey published our (personal) data and no one was held responsible,\u201d said Stojakovic.",
      "\u201cI expect that there will be more pressure, I know there will be,\u201d added Stojakovic. \u201cI expect there will be pressure on our parents and that they will link us to political parties, but we will not give up until all our demands are fulfilled.\"",
      "Student protests have posed the biggest challenge so far on Vucic\u2019s tight grip on power. The students have received widespread popular support and their rallies have drawn tens of thousands of people.",
      "During their rally on Sunday, the protesters read out the articles of Serbia's Constitution that they say have been violated with the various forms of state pressure on their protests. Vucic's constitutional role as president should be mostly ceremonial, but instead he has gradually assumed control of almost all levers of power since taking office 13 years ago.",
      "In one of his frequent public appearances on state-controlled media, Vucic called the Sunday protest \u201cstupid\u201d and added that he will step down only when he decides to do so.",
      "\u201cThey (the protesters) live in their own world. They are not my problem, but I blame those who are pushing them about all this. I mean their professors,\u201d Vucic told Pink TV.",
      "Serbia\u2019s prosecutors have filed charges against 13 people over the train station canopy collapse, including a government minister and several state officials. But doubts prevail over the probe\u2019s independence under the authorities."

      "Automakers are joining forces to boost their scale and competitiveness to contend with industry newcomers like iPhone maker Foxconn",
      "BANGKOK -- Auto industry newcomers like Taiwan-based iPhone maker Foxconn and China's Huawei Technologies are maneuvering to gain an edge in the electric vehicle sector, prompting automakers like Japan's Nissan and Honda to announce plans to join forces against a flood of ambitious competitors.",
      "Also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, Foxconn has been snapping up links in the automotive supply chain, one of a growing number of technology companies that are leveraging their knowhow in electronics and communications.",
      "Foxconn's auto venture with Taiwan automaker and importer Yulon Motor Co., Foxtron, showcased its Model B, a sleek EV hatchback, as well as its automotive electronics, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week.",
      "Honda and Nissan announced in December that they plan to seek a merger, a move that reports said may have partly been driven by Foxconn's interest in Nissan.",
      "Here's an update on Foxconn's auto ambitions.",
      "Whether or not Foxconn wanted to make a bid for Nissan, it has big ambitions, saying it eventually intends to make four of every 10 EVs sold in the world. The contract manufacturer has invested nearly $1.3 billion in auto-related acquisitions in the past decade, according to Mergermarket, a merger and acquisitions research firm.",
      "In addition to Foxtron, its automaking joint venture with Taiwan's Yulon Motor, it has a 50% joint venture with Stellantis NV to design and sell automotive semiconductors and a 50% joint venture with Germany\u2019s ZF Friedrichshafen AG, a major auto supplier, to make passenger car chassis. It has invested in Indigo Technologies, which is commercializing a road sensing system developed at MIT. It also has a collaboration agreement with Blue Solutions to develop solid state batteries and has a collaboration with Italian auto designer Pininfarina.",
      "Foxconn holds a 34% stake in Japanese electronics company Sharp, which has been inching toward the automotive sector. This year, Foxconn and Sharp introduced an LDK+ (living, dining, kitchen) concept vehicle, a boxy minivan that converts to a living space with solar and storage battery and a big LCD screen.",
      "\u201cLeveraging a plug-and-play strategy similar to its electronics operations, Foxconn\u2019s foray into electric vehicles is a pre-emptive move in anticipation of the increasing convergence of electronics and automotive technologies,\u201d Vivian Wong, head of Mergermarkets\u2019 M&A Analytics for the Asia Pacific, said in an emailed comment.",
      "China\u2019s Huawei Technologies, smartphone and appliance maker Xiaomi and e-commerce giant Alibaba and Baidu also are scaling up their EV operations, relying on their scale and strength in advanced technologies as vehicles become ever more computerized.",
      "Huawei has several EV joint ventures in what it has dubbed its Harmony Intelligent Mobility Alliance, including Luxeed brand EVs with Chery Automobile and Aito brand EVs with Seres Group. Its joint venture with JAC Motor, an automaker based in eastern China's Anhui province, has announced plans to compete with luxury brands such as Rolls-Royce and Mercedes Benz AG.",
      "Some Japanese electronics companies also are jumping on the bandwagon. Apart from Sharp's partnership with Foxconn, entertainment and technology giant Sony Corp. has an EV joint venture with Honda that plans to introduce the EV Afeela sedan for pre-sale this year.",
      "The increasing reliance on connectivity between cars, phones, laptops and televisions has lured such companies into a market that is quickly being transformed by electrification, even if inroads into some markets have stalled due to tariffs and other factors.",
      "Nissan introduced the Leaf, the first mass-market EV, in 2010 and has strong EV technology, vehicle platforms and sales capacity that would appeal to a newcomer like Foxconn.",
      "Reports by Japanese media and by Taiwan\u2019s Central News Agency said Hon Hai\u2019s chief strategy officer, Nissan veteran executive Jun Seki, visited France for talks with France\u2019s Renault SA, which holds a 15% stake in Nissan and more shares held in a French trust. Seki is a former chief operating officer of Nissan and former president of Dongfeng Nissan, a joint venture in China.",
      "In formally announcing plans to attempt a merger with Honda, Nissan Motor Corp. CEO Makoto Uchida said Foxconn had not directly approached his company about a possible merger. Foxconn did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Nissan\u2019s internal woes are a small part of the bigger challenge posed to all major automakers by the ascent of Tesla, which makes more than half of its EVs in China, and Chinese automakers like BYD in an industry so competitive that more than a dozen Chinese EV makers have already folded, bested by bigger and stronger companies that got into the game before them.",
      "As the pace of sales growth slows, with car buyers questioning the affordability and convenience of switching to electrics, the going has been rough, and Foxconn has a long way to go before it can compete with industry leaders like BYD and Tesla.",
      "It was set to manufacture the Endurance battery EV truck at a former General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which it acquired in 2023. Lordstown Motors Corp. then filed for bankruptcy. Foxconn also set up a partnership in 2021 with Fisker Inc., maker of the Ocean EV truck, that called for making up to 250,000 vehicles. Fisker filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June.",
      "But the company appears undaunted.",
      "Foxconn lists six models of EVs on its website, including its Model T bus, Model V pickup truck, Moden N van, its Model B, and its \u201cluxury flagship\u201d Model E sedan."

      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has suggested that President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s remarks about Canada becoming America\u2019s \u201c51st state\u201d is distracting the public from the harm that steep tariffs would have on U.S. consumers",
      "VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Canada's outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday suggested that President-elect Donald Trump's remarks about Canada becoming America's \u201c51st state\u201d has distracted attention from the harm that steep tariffs would inflict on U.S. consumers.",
      "Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian imports.",
      "\u201cThe 51st state, that\u2019s not going to happen,\" Trudeau said in an interview with MSNBC. \u201cBut people are talking about that, as opposed to talking about what impact 25% tariffs (has) on steel and aluminum coming into the United States.\"",
      "Trudeau told MSNBC: \"No American wants to pay 25% more for electricity or oil and gas coming in from Canada. That\u2019s something I think people need to pay a little more attention to.\u201d",
      "Trump has also said that if Canada merged with the U.S., taxes would decrease and there would be no tariffs.",
      "\u201cI know that as a successful negotiator he likes to keep people off balance,\" Trudeau said of Trump's threats to use economic force to turn Canada into the 51st state. Trump has also erroneously cast the U.S. trade deficit with Canada \u2014 a natural resource-rich nation that provides the U.S. with commodities like oil \u2014 as a subsidy.",
      "Canadian officials say that if Trump follows through with his threat of punishing tariffs, Canada would consider slapping retaliatory tariffs on American orange juice, toilets and some steel products. Already during Trump's first term in the White House, Canada responded to Trump's tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum with its own on American products like bourbon, Harley Davidson motorcycles and playing cards.",
      "\u201cHe got elected to try and make life easier for all Americans, to support American workers,\u201d Trudeau said of Trump. \u201cThese (tariffs) are things that are going to hurt them.\u201d",
      "Trump said last week that the U.S doesn\u2019t need oil, or anything else, from Canada. But almost a quarter of the oil that the U.S. consumes each day comes from Canada. The energy-rich western province of Alberta exports 4.3 million barrels of oil a day to the U.S.",
      "Data from the United States Energy Information Administration shows that the U.S. consumes 20 million barrels a day, and produces about 13.2 million barrels a day.",
      "Canada, a founding partner of NATO and home to more than 40 million people, is also the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $2.7 billion worth of goods and services cross the border each day.",
      "Trump has said that he would reconsider his tariff threat if Canada made improvements in managing security at the Canada-U.S. border, which he and his advisers see as a potential entry point for undocumented migrants.",
      "Trudeau has said that less than 1% of illegal immigrants and fentanyl cross into the U.S. from Canada.",
      "But after a meeting last November with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, the president-elect\u2019s private club and residence in Florida, Trudeau announced an increase in spending on border security, expressing willingness to address Trump's concerns in hopes that he would reconsider his tariff threat.",
      "With the challenge of Trump\u2019s second administration looming and Trudeau's party trailing badly in the polls, the beleaguered Canadian prime minister announced his resignation last Monday. He will be replaced on March 9, when his Liberal party is set to pick a new leader."

      "PHILADELPHIA -- The Philadelphia 76ers have decided not to build a $1.3 billion downtown arena, a surprising move that comes just weeks after the team received approval for the controversial project from the city council.",
      "The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday that multiple council members had confirmed the change in plans. The team has struck a deal with Comcast Spectacor to remain in the city's sports stadium district, the newspaper said, but further details about the new proposal have not been released.",
      "The 76ers, the mayor's office and Comcast Spectator \u2014 which owns the Wells Fargo Center, where the team currently plays \u2014 did not respond Sunday to requests for comment. The team rents the arena from Comcast Spectacor, which also owns the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL, who also play there.",
      "The council had voted on Dec. 19 to approve the downtown arena after more than two years of heated debate over the proposal, and the owners of the NBA team had hoped to move in to what would be called 76 Place by 2031. The council vote came despite vocal opposition from nearby Chinatown residents and other activists.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so livid right now I don\u2019t even know what to do,\u201d Jimmy Harrity, an at-large member of the council, told the newspaper. Harrity, who supported the team\u2019s move, said, \u201cI feel as though I was used as a pawn.\u201d",
      "Mayor Cherelle Parker, a Democrat who had championed the plan, has said the entire city will benefit from what she called a \u201chistoric game-changing economic development project.\u201d Supporters had hoped the 18,500-seat arena would help revive a distressed retail corridor called Market East, which runs from City Hall to the Liberty Bell. The area has struggled for years despite several redevelopment efforts.",
      "The team owners, Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, had pushed for city approval by year\u2019s end so they could meet their target opening date. They had vowed not to ask the city for any construction funding, although they were free to seek state and federal funds. Instead of property taxes, they would have paid about $6 million in annual payments in lieu of taxes.",
      "Opponents feared the arena would bring gridlock on game days as well as gentrification and rising rents to the area.",
      "The Chinatown community has fought a series of proposed developments since the 1960s, including casinos, a prison, a baseball stadium and a highway, the last of which dissected the neighborhood when it opened in 1991."

They have been communities of racial and economic diversity, where many people own their own homes.",
      "Some now fear the most destructive fires in California\u2019s history have altered that for good. Recovery and rebuilding may be out of reach for many, and pressures of gentrification could be renewed.",
      "Samantha Santoro, 22, a first-generation college student at Cal Poly Pomona, remembered being annoyed when the initial news coverage of the wildfires focused more on celebrities. She and her sister, who attends UC Berkeley, worry how their Mexican immigrant parents and working-class neighbors who lost their homes in Altadena will move forward.",

About 58% of residents are non-white, with one-fourth of them Hispanic and nearly a fifth Black, according to Census data.",
      "During the Civil Rights era, Altadena became a rare land of opportunity for Black Americans to reach middle class without the discriminatory practices of denying them access to credit. They kept homes within the family and helped others to flourish. Today, the Black home ownership rate there is at 81.5%, almost double the national rate.",
      "That's impressive considering 92% of the 15,000 residences in Altadena are single-family homes, according to the 2023 Census American Community Survey. The median income is over $129,000. Just over 7% of residents live in poverty.",

By comparison, AccuWeather estimated the damage and economic losses caused by Hurricane Helene, which tore across six southeastern states last fall, at $225 billion to $250 billion.",
      "\u201cThis will be the costliest wildfire in California modern history and also very likely the costliest wildfire in U.S. modern history, because of the fires occurring in the densely populated areas around Los Angeles with some of the highest-valued real estate in the country,\u201d said Jonathan Porter, the private firm\u2019s chief meteorologist.",

Aon ranks a wildfire known as the Camp Fire in Paradise, California, in 2018 as the costliest in U.S. history up to now at $12.5 billion, adjusted for inflation. The Camp Fire killed 85 people and destroyed about 11,000 homes.",
      "The L.A. County wildfires, which were fueled by hurricane-force Santa Ana winds and an extreme drought, remained largely uncontained Saturday. That means the final tally of losses from the blazes is likely to increase, perhaps substantially.",
      "\u201cTo put this into perspective, the total damage and economic loss from this wildfire disaster could reach nearly 4% of the annual GDP of the state of California,\u201d AccuWeather's Porter said.",
      "In a report Friday, Moody's also concluded that the wildfires would prove to be the costliest in U.S. history, specifically because they have ripped through densely populated areas with higher-end properties.",
      "While the state is no stranger to major wildfires, they have generally been concentrated in inland areas that are not densely populated. That's led to less destruction per acre, and in damage to less expensive homes, Moody's noted.",
      "That's far from the case this time, with one of the largest conflagrations destroying thousands of properties across the Pacific Palisades and Malibu, home to many Hollywood stars and executives with multimillion-dollar properties. Already, numerous celebrities have lost homes to the fires.",
      "\u201cThe scale and intensity of the blazes, combined with their geographic footprint, suggest a staggering price tag, both in terms of the human cost and the economic toll,\u201d Moody's analysts wrote. The report did not include a preliminary cost estimate of the wildfire damage.",
      "It could be several months before a concrete tally of the financial losses from the wildfires will be possible.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the very early stages of this disaster,\u201d Porter said."

      "Bourbon Street should have been made into a pedestrian mall long ago, Casey said: \u201cThere\u2019s people watching and they\u2019re going to get you, so you got to be careful.\u201d",
      "Much of the immediate focus has centered on the absence of the bollards, which had stopped working reliably and were being replaced ahead of the Super Bowl.",
      "City leaders have been criticized for the timing of that project and failing to implement a suitable replacement during their repair. A lawsuit filed Thursday on behalf of victims alleged the city \u201chad years of opportunities\u201d to patch up vulnerabilities.",
      "But a half dozen current and former law enforcement officials in Louisiana described the bollard issue as a red herring, saying that even if they had been functioning they may not have prevented the attack given how hell-bent Jabbar appeared on creating carnage.",
      "The broader safety conundrum is more complex, they said, given the quarter's dense, alcohol-fueled crowds and structural challenges inherent to an early 18th-century neighborhood built for horse-drawn buggies. Policing here is even more complicated in a city with notoriously high crime, a chronic shortage of officers and a new state law allowing permit-less concealed carry of firearms.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know of another place that has the same challenges for protecting people,\u201d said Ronnie Jones, a public safety consultant who served in the Louisiana State Police for 32 years, including as deputy superintendent.",
      "\u201cA lot of people in public safety don\u2019t want to talk about it, but we just can\u2019t guarantee that everybody going to the French Quarter is going to be safe,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere\u2019s a tradeoff here, and we\u2019ve never, ever, found that balance.\u201d",
      "The city\u2019s newly hired security consultant, William J. Bratton, a former New York City police commissioner, said he recognizes the importance of maintaining a festive atmosphere during carnival even as he works with city police to bolster security over the next few months.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I talked about is developing security provisions that don\u2019t change Mardi Gras, don\u2019t change the flavor of it, the excitement of it and the nature of it,\u201d Bratton said at a news conference this week. \u201cTo develop security protocols that don\u2019t become so intrusive, so disruptive.\u201d",
      "The New Year's attack was far from the first deadly vehicle incident on Bourbon Street.",
      "In 1972, one person died and 18 were injured when a teenager fleeing police in a stolen car crashed through metal barricades and sped down the thoroughfare at 70 mph (about 113 kph). Ten years later a man smashed through steel barricades and careened down nearly seven blocks, injuring at least 11. And in 1995, an intoxicated 63-year-old man drove a beer van through a crowd attending a St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade, killing one and injuring 38.",
      "More recent Bourbon Street tragedies have involved gun violence, including multiple fatal shootings last year. In 2014, a mass shooting killed a 21-year-old woman and wounded nine others, including a bystander shot through her cheek. Two years later a person was killed and nine others were wounded in a shooting.",
      "Many of those incidents prompted similar calls for change and accountability, raising questions about civil liberties and what, if anything, the city is willing to sacrifice in the name of public safety. City, state and federal law enforcement officials have offered varying solutions that critics have said were mere stopgaps, likening them to putting Band-Aids on a wound that has never quite healed.",
      "\u201cI was part of those conversations when we were looking to create a very robust security package, including metal detectors and infrared technology that could alert if something metal was in someone's clothing \u2014 none of that ever materialized,\u201d said Michael Harrison, a former head of New Orleans police who later became commissioner in Baltimore. \u201cThere are ways to prevent ramming attacks. There\u2019s not yet a way to prevent people from walking on Bourbon Street and doing bad things.\u201d",
      "Pedicab driver Jody \u201cCajun Queen\u201d Boudreaux, 65, said Bourbon Street has always embodied New Orleans' laissez-faire charm and she is not sure whether the city has the will to shore up its lax security.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a target, clearly. They know we have holes, they know we are all scrambling and they also know that our vibe is \u2018Laissez les bons temps rouler\u2019\u201d she said, invoking the famous Cajun French saying that means, \u201cLet the good times roll.\u201d \u201cI think it can be balanced, I truly do.\u201d",
      "Andrew Monteverde, co-vice president of the New Orleans Firefighters Association, said first responders and law enforcement deal with a raft of emergencies, from extinguishing fires to saving people in cardiac arrest. The more that limited resources are dedicated to one part of the city, he added, the less is available to deal for elsewhere.",
      "\u201cCould you possibly make the French Quarter so secure that you couldn\u2019t even spit on the sidewalk?\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe, but then what would you trade off?\u201d",
      "At The Beach on Bourbon Street, where workers screen clubgoers at every entrance with handheld metal detectors, general manager Woody Ryder has become inured to the frequent shootings after working there for seven years. \u201cThere's crazy people out there,\u201d he said.",
      "But the recent attack has made him uneasy. Ryder and his staff are still recovering from witnessing what he and others likened to a \u201cwar zone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe city has already failed us,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hesitant as soon as I turn on Bourbon Street.\u201d",

      "Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba arrived in Jakarta on Friday from Kuala Lumpur after meeting Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.",
      "He said he hopes to meet Trump at the earliest possible timing after his Jan. 20 inauguration, and plans to convey the importance of engaging with the region.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how much interest Mr. Trump has in this region until I actually talk with him,\u201d Ishiba told reporters. \u201cI am convinced that having diplomatic engagement in this region is extremely important for Japan, and it is extremely important for America as well.\u201d",
      "Japan wants to send a message that its respect for a rules-based international order, in contrast to China\u2019s more aggressive behavior in claiming islands in the disputed South China Sea, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety, makes it the best partner for Southeast Asian countries.",

      "Ishiba also promised to help Indonesia become a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "The two sides signed an agreement on a Japanese loan of up to 90.4 billion yen ($573 million) for projects including a new port construction at Patimban to improve Indonesian transportation and distribution systems.",

      "Japan and Indonesia earlier agreed to continue negotiations on the joint development of naval ships and other military equipment and on technology transfer. Japan is unable to export finished frigates or submarines under its current defense guidelines.",
      "Indonesia has pledged to remain nonaligned amid the rivalry between Washington and Beijing but has expressed anxiety over heightening security tensions in the region.",

      "The Sounion had been a disaster-in-waiting in the waterway, with 1 million barrels of crude oil aboard that had been struck and later sabotaged with explosives by the Iranian-backed Houthis as part of their campaign over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. It took months for salvagers to tow the vessel away, extinguish the fires and offload the remaining crude oil.",
      "\u201cOver three challenging weeks, the fires were extinguished, cargo tanks patched and pressurised with inert gas, and the vessel declared safe,\u201d said the private security firm Ambrey, which helped lead the response alongside a European naval force and salvagers. \u201cIn early October, she was towed north to Suez for removal of her cargo, which has now been successfully completed.\u201d",
      "The U.S. State Department had warned that a spill from the Sounion would have been \u201cfour times the size of the Exxon Valdez disaster\u201d in 1989 off Alaska.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Houthis, who have held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, for over a decade and have been battling a Saudi-led coalition backing the country's exiled government for nearly as long.",
      "The Houthis initially attacked the Greek-flagged Sounion tanker on Aug. 21 with small arms fire, projectiles and a drone boat. A French destroyer operating as part of Operation Aspides rescued its crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, after they abandoned the vessel and took them to nearby Djibouti.",
      "The Houthis later released footage showing they planted explosives on board the Sounion and ignited them in a propaganda video, something the rebels have done before in their campaign.",
      "The Houthis have targeted some 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.",
      "The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.",
      "The tempo of Houthi attacks has slowed in recent weeks, particularly involving ships at sea. However, they have continued to launch drones and missiles targeting Israel.",

      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- A senior official of the European Investment Bank says the regional lending agency is keen to double its funding for Bangladesh, but she expressed concern over human rights as the country endures a spell of political turmoil.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, the bank\u2019s Vice President Nicola Beer said the lending arm of the European Union will support reforms initiated by the interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus that has been running the country since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in mass protests in early August.",
      "The 27-nation European Union is the largest destination for Bangladesh\u2019s garment exports, a vital lifeline for millions of the country\u2019s workers that earns the country more than $36 billion a year. The industry employs about 4 million workers, mostly women from rural areas.",
      "Beer said the Luxemburg-based lending agency wants to double its fund portfolio for Bangladesh to 2 billion euros ($2.06 billion) while supporting the South Asian country's democratic transition, rule of law and freedoms of expression.",
      "\u201cYes, of course, we are focusing on human rights, rule of law and freedom of expression,\u201d she said. \u201cIn our discussions we always are very firm on these points that the freedom of expression, freedom of opinion ... are very important, and that this and all the following governments have really to make sure that these human and citizens rights are guaranteed.\u201d",
      "Hasina has been in exile in neighboring India since Aug. 5, when she fled the country. Yunus has promised to hold an election in December of this year or in the first half of 2026, depending on progress in reforms in various sectors.",
      "Yunus is facing criticism over problems with law and order, rising commodity prices, treatment of minority groups and economic woes after many factories were shuttered due to labor protests or poor security. Economic growth fell to only 1.8% percent in the July-September quarter as student-led unrest disrupted business activities, according to a report released earlier this month by the Bureau of Statistics.",
      "Beer said she appreciated reform measures taken by the Yunus-led government.",
      "\u201cThis is important from what I hear, especially from entrepreneurs, is that they are applauding this course of reforms, which is now on the table,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, we as a bank (will) try to support because this is important for the economy here in Bangladesh, for investors \u2026 coming from outside or inside the country.\u201d",
      "In October, the World Bank slashed its forecast for the fiscal year that will end in June to 4%, citing \u201csignificant uncertainties following recent political turmoil.\u201d",
      "The European Investment Bank is involved in some major infrastructure development projects, mainly focused on green energy, safe water, communication and climate change.",
      "Beer visited bank-funded projects and met with officials, including Yunus, during her three-day visit to Bangladesh.",
      "She emphasized the importance of working on integrating the region in such areas as electricity grids that could link to hydropower projects in mountainous Nepal, for example.",
      "\u201cI think we should discuss in the region to get more out of this interconnectivity, because this is a win-win situation, a win situation for Bangladesh, a win situation for the smaller neighbors like Bhutan and also Nepal or Myanmar. And it could be also a win situation for India,\u201d she said."

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit hard without electricity,\u201d said the former deputy school director who has stockpiled firewood to ensure he can use his wood burning stove in the room he shares with his wife to stay warm. \u201cThere\u2019s still gas \u2026 but it will end soon.\u201d",
      "The village of Copanca is situated just several kilometers across the de facto border from Moldova\u2019s separatist pro-Russian Transnistria region, where hundreds of thousands of people have been left without heating and hot water after Russia halted gas supplies to the region on Jan. 1, over an alleged $709 million debt for past supplies to Moldova.",
      "The decision by Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant Gazprom, which came into effect a day after a gas transit agreement between Russia and Ukraine expired, halted gas supplies to Transnistria\u2019s gas-operated Kuciurgan power plant, the country\u2019s largest, which provided a significant portion of Moldova\u2019s electricity.",
      "Copanca, like over a dozen other towns or villages administered by Moldovan authorities in the capital Chisinau but situated close to Transnistria, remains interconnected to the separatist region\u2019s Soviet-era energy infrastructure leaving them vulnerable amid the energy crisis.",
      "Planned daily electrical outages throughout Transnistria \u2014 which includes Copanca \u2014 are currently scheduled for four hours twice a day. While the Kuciurgan power plant transitioned to coal and has led to some unexpected outages, some residual gas remained in the pipes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get by with the electricity and gas shortages,\u201d said Donici. \u201cYesterday, we were without power for eight hours. Everyone is scratching their heads, figuring out what to do, so they don\u2019t freeze.\u201d",
      "Citing findings by British and Norwegian audit firms, Moldova\u2019s pro-Western government claims its debt stands close to $8.6 million, and has accused Moscow of weaponizing energy to destabilize the European Union candidate country. Russia has denied it is meddling in Moldova.",
      "Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean this week accused Russia of artificially creating an energy crisis to cause \u201cinstability in the region\u201d and \u201cto influence the results of the parliamentary elections\u201d that Moldova will hold later in 2025.",
      "\u201cWhat they want to achieve is to have a pro-Russian government in Moldova that would ultimately allow for the consolidation of the military capacity of Russia in the Transnistrian region, and correspondingly to use this leverage over Ukraine,\u201d Recean told journalists in a closed call with other senior officials on Monday.",
      "Transnistria \u2014 which broke away after a short war in 1992 and is not recognized by most countries \u2014 declared a state of emergency last month as the gas crisis loomed. A large majority of Transnistria\u2019s roughly 350,000 people speak Russian as their first language and some 200,000 are Russian citizens. Russia also bases about 1,500 troops in a so-called frozen conflict zone as \u201cpeacekeepers.\u201d",
      "Moldova has repeatedly claimed Russia is conducting a sprawling \u201chybrid war\u201d against it by meddling in elections, funding anti-government protests and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail the country\u2019s EU aspirations.",
      "Last month, Moldova\u2019s parliament also voted to impose a state of emergency in the energy sector, as the crisis threatened to leave the former Soviet republic without sufficient energy this winter, and fears that the situation could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, where temperatures often drop to subzero degrees Celsius.",
      "The looming crisis also prompted Chisinau to implement a series of energy-saving measures beginning Jan. 1, which include reducing lighting in public and commercial buildings by at least 30%, and energy-intensive businesses operating during off-peak hours.",
      "Moldova's state energy company, Energocom, has increased electricity purchases from neighboring Romania to ensure capacity but are also more costly. Although a mild January is helping matters, energy prices have increased and the government has said it will provide help to offset bills.",
      "EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, wrote on the social media platform X this week that Russia \u201ccontinues to use gas as a weapon and once again Moldova is a target of its hybrid warfare,\" adding that \u201cThanks to EU support Moldova remains resilient and well-connected to European energy networks.\"",
      "Moldova\u2019s government this week announced plans to connect more than a dozen towns and villages under Chisinau\u2019s control that are interconnected with energy infrastructure in Transnistria to energy networks in Moldova.",
      "Afanasii Cutzari, the mayor of Copanca, says that so far the situation is manageable with planned electrical outages, but that if, or when, the gas runs out, \"then there will be problems.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhere possible, people bought generators, but that\u2019s also not a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cEven with a generator, someone needs to start it, a person who understands how to use it. It requires money, staff.\u201d",
      "Cutzari added that institutions in his village including a kindergarten, medical facilities, an ambulance, city hall and a post office would struggle if the gas ran out entirely. \u201cIt would be better if electricity and gas were always available,\u201d he said.",
      "Prime Minister Recean said that since the beginning of the energy crisis, his government in Chisinau has \u201cproposed organizing procurement for purchasing gas on behalf of the Transnistrian side,\" but that authorities in the region\u2019s de facto capital, Tiraspol, have refused.",
      "\u201cTiraspol is not autonomous in the decisions it makes,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cThis crisis is induced by the Russian Federation in order to destabilize the Republic of Moldova and to use the Republic of Moldova in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.\u201d",
      "After visiting Copanca and other villages in a similar bind on Thursday, Moldovan President Maia Sandu said some kindergartens and schools have been provided with power generators, and that mayors can request help from Chisinau to supply firewood, wood-burning pellets, and generators.",
      "\u201cWe communicated with them that we are doing our best to provide them alternatives that provide light, water and heat for their families,\u201d she said, adding that Moldova is discussing \u201cpotential assistance\u201d with external partners.",
      "Carina Cazac, the owner of a convenience store in Copanca, said locals rushed to purchase essentials like oil and flour when the crisis hit, and that generators and oil lamps quickly sold out.",
      "\u201cA lot of people were stressed, and they started buying gas lamps,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's easier in the villages because most people have wood-burning stoves \u2026 others bought generators.\u201d",

    "summary": "Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest amount in 14 years",
    "story": [
      "Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest amount in 14 years",
      "NEW YORK -- Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest level in 14 years. U.S. credit card defaults jumped to a record $46 billion from January through September 2024, according to the Financial Times, citing data analyzed by BankRegData.",
      "With high levels of credit card debt and high inflation, many consumers have found themselves unable to cover monthly payments, leading some to default.",
      "A borrower goes into default when they miss credit card payments for over 180 days, roughly six months. When there is a failure to pay over such a long period, banks generally take this as a sign that a borrower won't pay the debt anymore, said Matt Sotir, financial advisor with Equitable Advisors based in New Hampshire.",
      "Defaulting on credit card debt can have serious consequences, including a negative impact on credit reports that lead to a long-lasting effect on the ability to borrow money, said Sotir.",
      "\u201cThese are debts that have a lot of impact and I think sometimes people don't realize that if they missed (a payment), how bad it could be for them in other areas,\u201d added Sotir.",
      "Here\u2019s what you should know about credit card defaults.",
      "There are several levels of consequences when credit card payments are not made. It begins with late fees, higher interest rates and a potentially lower credit score. If a borrower doesn't pay for 30 days the bank considers the credit card \u201cdelinquent\u201d and the borrower's credit scores can be damaged further.",
      "When a borrower fails to make a payment for roughly six months, the bank considers the credit card in default, which means they will close your account and refer you to a collection agency, said Chip Lupo, writer at WalletHub.",
      "\u201cThat's where you're going to really have trouble obtaining future credit for a while,\u201d said Lupo.",
      "When a collection agency assumes your debt, they will reach out via phone, email and mail to encourage you to pay up. Eventually, if not paid, the collection agency may take legal action against the borrower.",
      "The first step is to be proactive, recommended Sotir. Whether it\u2019s reaching out to your bank or working with a financial advisor, the quicker you start looking for viable solutions the more consequences you will be able to avoid.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen it over the years, when someone gets in trouble, it\u2019s easy to cocoon and not want to deal with it,\u201d said Sotir",
      "Sotir and Bandebo recommend that you reach out to your credit card company to negotiate the debt since it\u2019s in the bank\u2019s best interest to help you catch up. If your account goes to a collections agency, find out if they can offer a payment plan or seek help from a non-profit credit counseling organization or financial advisor.",
      "It's best if you pay your credit card in full every month, but if that is not possible, gettting to at least the minimum monthly payment each month can help you avoid falling further into debt, said Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore, a credit modeling company.",
      "\u201cDo whatever you can not to get to the next stage. If you're 30 days late, try to avoid getting to 60 days and absolutely try to do everything you can to avoid getting default,\u201d said Bandebo.",
      "If you are having trouble making payments on your credit card, Bandebo recommends you reach out to your bank and ask if you can be placed in a payment plan.",
      "Other alternatives include reaching out to a credit counseling organization or transferring your credit card debt to a 0% interest card, though that typically comes with a fee.",
      "Defaulting on a credit card will mean serious consequences for your credit score, and that will limit how much you will be able to borrow in the future, and how much it will cost you. If you don't pay your credit card bill for a month, your credit score will likely fall between 60 and 100 points, said Bandebo. While there is not an specific amount of points that your credit score will fall should you default, it will appear on your credit report for seven years, added Bandebo.",
      "Bandebo often uses the analogy of credit scores being similar to reputation; it takes a long time to build up but one mistake to set you back for a long time.",
      "\u201cThere's not miracle solutions that once you've missed a payment, or you've gone to default, to simple go back to where you were. You can't just flip a switch,\" said Bandebo.",
      "If you find that you cannot regularly make payments to your credit cards, Sotir recommends you start by looking at your budget to find which expenses can be cut, and or considering whether you need an extra source of income.",
      "\u201cFor most people, it's really about understanding how much money is coming in and where it's going,\u201d added Sotir.",
      "If your expenses outweigh your income, Sotir recommends looking for a temporary second job, find if you have assets that you can sell, or asking family if they can help you while you get back on your feet. Additionally, some banks offer hardship programs that provide assistance for people who can\u2019t afford large and high-interest credit card balances.",
      "Bankruptcy should be considered the last option if you have exhausted all other alternatives, added Lupo.",
      "If your budget doesn\u2019t allow you to resume payments, it\u2019s important to start looking for alternatives as soon as possible, recommended Bandebo.",

      "The report points out that China sees its own strong growth slowing slightly from 4.9% in 2024 to 4.8% in 2025 due to lower consumption and property-sector weaknesses that are failing to make up for public investment and export strength. This is forcing the government to enact policies to lift property markets, fight local government debt and boost demand.",

      "Michelsen's three booming service returns in the ninth game of the fourth set helped him earn a vital break against the 11th-seeded Tsitsipas and, after shaking off jitters on his own serve, he closed out for his first ever victory over a player ranked in the top 20.",
      "Gauff went into her opening round on a streak of winning 33 matches against players ranked outside the Top 50, dating to a loss to Kenin at Wimbledon 2023.",
      "It was tough going early, with Gauff converting an early break before Kenin got back on serve at 2-2, hitting deep ground strokes and getting good bounce off the hard court.",
      "But Gauff, who had five aces and four double-faults in her first two service games, lifted her tempo, started taking the ball earlier and won four of the next five games. She finished the match with 12 aces and nine double-faults, and saved seven of the eight breakpoints she faced. She also had 28 winners, including two rifling backhands on key points in the second set, and 13 unforced errors.",

      "The Bills methodically wore down the Broncos by scoring on six of their first seven drives in building a 31-7 lead in a game where they finished with a 23-minute edge in time of possession.",
      "And Buffalo didn\u2019t flinch after rookie Bo Nix capped Denver\u2019s five-play game-opening drive with a 43-yard touchdown pass to Troy Franklin.",
      "With Buffalo leading 13-7, Allen broke the game open with a 24-yard touchdown pass to sliding running back Ty Johnson in the back of the end zone on fourth-and-1 with 3:06 left in the third quarter.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been saying it all year long that Ty Johnson\u2019s the best third down back in football,\" Allen said. \"The things that he\u2019s able to do for us, the way we communicate, him in the pass game, blocking and running the ball. He does it all. I\u2019m so happy for him, so proud of him. He made a heck of a play. It was fourth down, no point in holding it and taking a sack there. They played man (coverage) and I just gave him a chance.\u201d",
      "On Buffalo\u2019s next possession, Allen completed a 55-yard pass to Curtis Samuel on the first snap of the fourth quarter.",
      "The five-time defending AFC East champion Bills advanced to the divisional round for a fifth straight postseason, and will face the third-seeded Baltimore Ravens next weekend.",

It\u2019s a great quarterback, obviously with Lamar and what he\u2019s able to do. He\u2019s one of the most dynamic, if not the most dynamic, quarterback in the league. He\u2019s so fun to watch. But I\u2019ll be watching their defense this week, so that\u2019s our focus.\u201d",

      "The seventh-seeded Broncos were outclassed in their first playoff appearance since their Super Bowl-winning season in 2015.",
      "Nix finished 13 of 22 for 144 yards in an outing where Denver punted four times and turned the ball over on downs twice.",
      "And the Broncos attacking defense was kept at bay by an Allen-led attack that was more than content in gaining small chunks of yards on lengthy time-consuming drives.",
      "The Broncos, who had an NFL-leading 63 sacks this seasons, sacked Allen just twice in an game where the Bills punted once.",
      "Trailing 7-3, Cook scored the go-ahead touchdown 2:03 into the second quarter to cap a 13-play, 81-yard drive. All three of Buffalo\u2019s first-half possessions featured 11 or more offensive snaps.",
      "The Broncos had little response in a first half that ended with Denver trailing 10-7 after Wil Lutz banked a 50-yard field-goal attempt off the right upright as time expired. The miss was Lutz\u2019s first since Week 10 when his 35-yard attempt was blocked by the Chiefs to preserve Kansas City\u2019s 16-14 win.",

      "Morant finished with just 12 points, but he had the tying basket with 54 seconds to go before his 11-footer for the lead. Desmond Bane had 21 points for Memphis, going 4 for 8 from 3-point range.",

      "There is just one member of the Big Three left in men's tennis",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- And then there was one: The Big Three is down to just Novak Djokovic, who stands alone from a golden generation of men\u2019s tennis now that Rafael Nadal has joined Roger Federer in retirement.",
      "The Australian Open, which started Sunday (Saturday night EST), is the first Grand Slam tournament of 2025 \u2014 and the first major championship to be held since Nadal, 38, played his final match at the Davis Cup in November. Federer's last match came in 2021, although he didn't announce he was done until 2022.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s coming to an end, this era. It\u2019s tough for us. We grew up watching all of them. We saw them winning all the events,\u201d said Francisco Cer\u00fandolo, a 26-year-old from Argentina who\u2019s been ranked in the top 20. \u201cThen suddenly we started playing against them, sharing the locker room or practicing with them, having conversations with them.\u201d",
      "Djokovic has won 10 of his 24 Slam trophies at Melbourne Park since making his Grand Slam debut there in 2005, and was scheduled to begin his bid for Nos. 11 and 25 on Monday against 19-year-old Californian Nishesh Basavareddy, who recently announced he was leaving Stanford University to turn pro.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a nice number of years that I\u2019ve been coming to Australia,\u201d Djokovic said, \u201cthe place where I had the greatest Grand Slam success.\u201d",
      "One big change for him as he seeks to become the first player in tennis history with 25 major singles titles: He is being coached, at least for this event, by his former on-court rival, Andy Murray, who retired as a player last August.",
      "\u201cWe thought we\u2019d give it a go and see if I can help,\u201d said Murray, who collected three major titles and two Olympic singles gold medals. \u201cNovak is not just one of the best tennis players of all-time. He\u2019s one of the best athletes of all-time.\"",
      "One other difference this time in Melbourne is that Djokovic was accompanied by his wife and two children.",
      "Basavareddy, roughly half the age of the 37-year-old Djokovic, grew up cheering for the Serb, as did plenty of other current players.",
      "\u201cHe's been my favorite player ever since I started watching (tennis), really,\u201d at about age 6 or 7, Basavareddy said. \u201cJust watched a lot of his matches and tried to learn from him.\u201d",
      "Some opted for Federer, a 20-time major champ, or Nadal, who won 22 Slam titles, as role models, of course.",
      "As time passes, inevitably, Djokovic will move on from his playing days. Just not yet.",
      "And even if he went without a Grand Slam triumph last season for the first time since 2017, the man many call \u201cNole\u201d did manage to collect the only piece of significant hardware missing from his tremendous resume, an Olympic singles gold medal.",
      "Aiming to rebound from what, for him, was a so-so season, hampered by a surgically repaired knee \u2014 the Paris Games success represented his only tournament victory \u2014 Djokovic cut his 2024 short, skipping the ATP Finals, and got to work in the offseason with Murray.",
      "Now folks inside and outside the sport wonder how much, exactly, the No. 7-seeded Djokovic plans to compete and what, exactly, he can continue to win.",
      "\u201cIt was a sad moment when Roger went, because the injuries had a lot to do with it. And Rafa also struggled with injuries. Nole is still quite fit, I have to say,\u201d said Wesley Koolhof, 35, who retired last year with one Grand Slam title in men's doubles and one in mixed doubles. \u201cYou know it\u2019s going to happen at one point that all the legends are going to retire. Nole is still going strong. Who knows how many years he has left in him?\u201d",
      "There is little doubt among his fellow players that Djokovic is not to be dismissed.",
      "\u201cFor me,\u201d said Alexander Zverev, a two-time major finalist who is seeded No. 2 in Australia, \u201che\u2019s still one of the best players in the world.\u201d",
      "Asked what he expects to see from Djokovic in Australia, Carlos Alcaraz smiled and replied: \u201cA really dangerous player.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf he goes to Australia ... hungry,\" said Alcaraz, who beat Djokovic in the past two Wimbledon finals and lost to him in the Olympic final, \"(he) is going to be one of the favorites to win.\u201d",

      "After Laine blasted a one-timer past Oettinger during a 5-on-3 power play late in the second, Benn responded with 2:26 left in the period, picking the top-left corner on an odd-man rush to quickly even the score at one.",

      "In a collision between free speech and national security, the Supreme Court will hear arguments over the fate of TikTok, a digital age cultural phenomenon that roughly half the U.S. population uses for entertainment and information",
      "WASHINGTON -- In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok says it plans to shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\u201cRarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\u201d lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \u201cno one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\u201d",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok\u2019s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \u201cconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\u201d TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\u201d D. John Sauer, Trump\u2019s choice to be his administration\u2019s top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump\u2019s solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law\u2019s most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",

      "Analysis of the ancient ice is expected to show how Earth's atmosphere and climate have evolved. That should provide insight into how Ice Age cycles have changed, and may help in understanding how atmospheric carbon changed climate, they said.",
      "\u201cThanks to the ice core we will understand what has changed in terms of greenhouse gases, chemicals and dusts in the atmosphere,\u201d said Carlo Barbante, an Italian glaciologist and coordinator of Beyond EPICA, the project to obtain the core. Barbante also directs the Polar Science Institute at Italy's National Research Council.",
      "The same team previously drilled a core about 800,000 years old.

      "\u201cIt was a great a moment for us when we reached the bedrock,\u201d Scoto said. Isotope analysis gave the ice's age as at least 1.2 million years old, he said.",
      "Both Barbante and Scoto said that thanks to the analysis of the ice core of the previous Epica campaign they have assessed that concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, even during the warmest periods of the last 800,000 years, have never exceeded the levels seen since the Industrial Revolution began.",

Hyundai Mobis unveiled a full-windshield holographic technology, while BMW spotlighted its new \u201ciDrive\u201d panoramic display.

      "Hyundai Mobis' holographic windshield display provides a glimpse into that. The technology, which won't be on the market for at least several more years, projects information ranging from driving speed to safety alerts across the entire windshield, and also provides some entertainment options for those who aren\u2019t behind the wheel. To keep the driver's eyes on the road, the panoramic display looks different depending on where you sit. A demo from the South Korean company shows the front row passenger can watch a movie or play a video game projected ahead of them, for example, but it's not visible to the driver.",

Simplicity is also key, says Ian Reagan, a senior research scientist at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an education and research nonprofit.

      "\u201cDriver distraction is a big concern with visual displays in vehicles,\u201d said Reagan, who cautions that safety \u201cdoesn't always win out\u201d over what some companies determine is going to be \u201csexy and sell\u201d for consumers. Still, Reagan says he's encouraged by recent developments in panoramic displays that aim to keep key, minimal information in a car's line of sight.",
      "Beyond Hyundai Mobis, that's part of what BMW, which showed off its new Panoramic iDrive and Operating System X, also says it's trying to do. The system, which will be integrated into of new models starting later this year, projects a panoramic display onto the vehicles' lower windscreen.",
      "The technology offers a range of digital features and can be personalized by different colors, apps and other preferences. But in the driver's line of sight, Stephan Durach, BMW\u2019s Head of UI/UX Development, said the goal was to avoid redundancies.",
      "\u201cYou often hear the phrase, \u2018your car is your smartphone on wheels.\u2019 And to be honest, I don\u2019t like this at all,\u201d Durach told The Associated Press. He said that the display aims to show a minimal amount of the most important information above the dashboard, in efforts to help reduce distractions.",
      "Honda and Sony Honda Mobility also spotlighted in-cabin features that drivers will soon encounter in their new EV lineup.",
      "Sony Honda Mobility says \u201cAfeela 1\" will include an interactive AI-powered voice agent. In Monday's remarks, CEO Yasuhide Mizuno said that \u201ccustomers can be entertained by communicating with Afeela 1\u201d \u2014 noting that Afeela's agent is \u201cfocused on conversation\u201d and \u201cproactively talks to you\u201d to provide useful information as you drive.",
      "The Afeela 1, scheduled to go on sale later this year with deliveries anticipated for mid-2026, also touts a panoramic screen and infotainment system filled with a variety of entertainment apps. Online reservations for the car opened in California this week.",
      "Meanwhile, Honda spotlighted \u201cultra-personal optimization\u201d for customers of its upcoming 0 series of electric vehicles \u2014 the first two models of which are set to launch in North America next year. The Japanese car giant unveiled the operating system that it plans to use in all 0 series models, \u201cAISMO OS,\u201d which it says will be integrated into vehicle operations ranging from automated driving and advanced driver assistance to in-car infotainment.",
      "In-vehicle software functions will also continue to be updated after purchase. \u201cThe more it is used, the more personalized it will become,\u201d Katsushi Inoue, global head of electrification business development at Honda, said in Tuesday remarks.",
      "While there's ample excitement around the latest bells and whistles announced from car companies like those on display at CES this week, there are still questions about the safety and efficacy of new features.",
      "Reagan points to AI-powered voice agents and the growing buzz around partial automated driving. He says his team's research shows that people interacting with partially-automated driving are \u201cmore distracted than ever\u201d because drivers have to \u201calways be ready\u201d for changes in vehicle assistance.",
      "And while AI voice assistants bring promising solutions to keeping drivers' eyes on the road, Reagan notes that they're not all built equally. How they are implemented is key, he said, noting that if a voice assistant requires too much back and forth or complicated answers it can also lead to frustration and distraction.",
      "Beyond in-vehicle experiences, EVs showcased at CES this week highlighted the state of sustainable energy in the car industry today \u2014 and the need to expand charging sources for consumers. Honda has a venture with seven other automakers to create the \u201cIONNA\u201d charging network in North America and said Tuesday it plans to expand such efforts \u201cto ensure that Honda 0 Series owners will have access to more than 100,000 charging stations by 2030.\u201d",
      "Honda is also exploring ways to provide \u201cpersonalized\u201d charging experiences for its EV customers down the road. The company said it's considering incorporating AI technology from Amazon Web Services to help individuals find nearby charging facilities, for example, or simplify payments.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 07:22:30 -0500",

      "Hearing a lot about Lemon8 lately",
      "Hearing a lot about Lemon8 lately? You\u2019re not the only one.",
      "Amid a looming U.S. ban on TikTok, content creators have been pushing the platform's sister app. Lemon8 resembles an amalgamation of the types of short-form videos found on TikTok and the picture-perfect aesthetic of Instagram and Pinterest.",
      "Like its popular relation, Lemon8 is owned by China-based ByteDance, whose collection of internationally available apps also includes the video editing app CapCut and the photo and art editing app Hypic. In addition, the company operates Douyin, the Chinese sibling of TikTok that follows Beijing\u2019s strict censorship rules.",
      "Lemon8 launched in the U.S. in 2023, a few years after it first popped up in Asian markets. Though it garnered some media and user interest in its early days, the app hasn\u2019t taken off as much as TikTok, which has more than 170 million U.S. users.",
      "But more people have downloaded the app in the past month, making it one of the top-ranking free apps on Apple\u2019s app store. Lemon8's popularity could potentially soar further depending on the outcome of a U.S. Supreme Court hearing Friday over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with ByteDance or face a U.S. ban.",
      "TikTok says it plans to shut down the platform in the U.S. by Jan. 19 if the government prevails, as it did in a lower court.",
      "Influencers previously partnered with Lemon8 to promote the lesser-known app on TikTok. In recent weeks, many of them have hailed Lemon8 as the place to go if TikTok is banned under federal law. Some have also been recommending it through paid sponsored posts tagged #lemon8partner, showing a recent corporate push to generate more users.",
      "But there's a hitch. The law, which would wipe out TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation if it\u2019s not sold to an approved buyer, states the divest-or-ban requirement applies generally to apps that are owned or operated by ByteDance, TikTok or any of their subsidiaries. That means even though Lemon8 and CapCut are not explicitly named in the statute, their futures in the U.S. also are in jeopardy.",
      "Jasmine Enberg, an analyst at market research company Emarketer, noted that the creators recommending Lemon8 may not be aware of the possible implications for the other ByteDance apps because the law does not identify them.",
      "The recent Lemon8 ads on TikTok also may be a sign that ByteDance is \u201choping or betting\u201d Lemon8 slips through the cracks as lawmakers and regulators focus their attention on TikTok, Enberg said. Representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "To boost Lemon8\u2019s user base, TikTok announced in November that creators would be able to access a Lemon8 account with the same account they use on TikTok, a feature the company says will enhance their ability to cross-post content. TikTok said the integration was designed to expand creators \u201creach and engagement potential.\u201d",
      "Like TikTok, Lemon8\u2019s main feed features both a \u201cfollowing\u201d section that lets users look at content from the creators they follow and a \u201cFor You\u201d section that recommends other posts. The newer platform also sorts posts into different categories, like relationships, wellness and skincare.",
      "ByteDance has not disclosed the number of global or U.S. users on Lemon8, which is believed to be miniscule compared to its trend-setting sister app. Data from the research firm SimilarWeb indicates Lemon8 has a little over 1 million daily active users.",
      "Market intelligence company Sensor Tower estimates the app saw a significant jump in global downloads in December \u2014 a 150% increase \u2014 compared to an average 2% month-over-month decline last year. The U.S. accounted for 70% of the month's downloads.",
      "The largest number of U.S. downloads were performed on Dec. 19, according to Sensor Tower. That was the day after the Supreme Court said it would hear this week's oral arguments over the constitutionality of the federal law that could ban TikTok.",
      "The law passed with bipartisan support last year after lawmakers and Biden administration officials expressed concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over U.S. user data or sway public opinion towards Beijing\u2019s interests by manipulating the algorithm that populates users\u2019 feeds.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Dec. 27 to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until he is inaugurated and his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue."

    "story": [
      "A renowned Israeli TV journalist who lost his ability to speak clearly because of ALS is returning to the air using artificial-intelligence software that recreates his widely recognized gravelly voice",
      "JERUSALEM -- When a renowned Israeli TV journalist lost his ability to speak clearly because of ALS, he thought his career might be over. But now, using artificial-intelligence software that can recreate his widely recognized gravelly voice, Moshe Nussbaum \u2014 known to generations of viewers simply as \u201cNussi\u201d \u2014 is making a comeback.",
      "Nussbaum, 71, was diagnosed two years ago with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive disease also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease that attacks nerve cells that control muscles throughout the body.",
      "At the time, he vowed to viewers of Israel's Channel 12 News to continue working as long as he was physically able. But, gradually, it became more and more difficult.",
      "It was a devastating blow to the career of a leading, no-nonsense reporter who for more than 40 years had covered many of Israel\u2019s most important stories from the field. He had appeared from the scenes of suicide bombing attacks and the front lines of wars in Gaza and Lebanon, and had covered scandals in Israel\u2019s parliament and high-profile court cases.",
      "After Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war in Gaza, Nussbaum was unable to report from the field. It was the first war of his career he had ever sat out, he noted in a recent interview with colleagues at Channel 12, the country's largest station.",
      "Even though he was having trouble moving and speaking, he launched a segment interviewing injured soldiers from Israeli hospitals. His questions were slow and halting, but he kept it up for the first half of the war. Then, as it became increasingly difficult to speak, and to be understood, his interviews became less frequent.",
      "On Monday, Channel 12 made the surprising announcement that it would bring Nussbaum back to the air in the coming weeks as a commentator\u2014 with the help of AI.",
      "\u201cIt took me a few moments to absorb it and to understand that it is me speaking now,\u201d Nussbaum told The Associated Press via text message. \u201cSlowly, slowly, I\u2019m understanding the incredible meaning of this device for everyone with disabilities, including me.\u201d",
      "Nussbaum will report his stories, and then write them up, using an AI program that has been trained to speak using Nussbaum\u2019s voice. He will be filmed as if he were presenting, and his lips will be \u201ctechnologically adjusted\u201d to match the words.",
      "People with speech disorders have used traditional text-to-speech technology for years, but those voices sound robotic and flat, and lack emotion. In contrast, AI technology is trained using recordings of a person\u2019s voice \u2014 there are thousands of hours of Nussbaum speaking thanks to his lengthy career in TV and radio \u2014 and it can mimic their intonations and phrasing.",
      "Thrilled by the possibilities the technology affords him, Nussbaum said he is also worried about the ease with which the technology could be used by bad actors to spread fake news and falsehoods.",
      "In its current form, the technology will not work for live broadcasts, so Nussbaum won't be able to go out into the field, which is his favorite part of the job, he said. Instead, he will focus on commentary and analysis about crime and national security, his areas of expertise for decades.",
      "Ahead of the broadcasts, Channel 12 released a preview showing snippets of Nussbaum speaking naturally \u2014 garbled and difficult to understand \u2014 followed by the new \u201cNussi AI.\u201d The new version sounds strikingly like the old Nussbaum, speaking quickly and emphatically. Nussbaum was filmed as if he was presenting the report, sitting straight with his trademark bushy eyebrows moving up and down for emphasis.",
      "\u201cHonestly, this is my first time sitting here in the studio after more than a year,\u201d AI Nussbaum says in the preview. \u201cIt feels a bit strange, and mostly, it tugs my heart.\u201d",
      "AI-powered voice cloning has grown exponentially in recent years. Experts have warned that the technology can amplify phone scams, disrupt democratic elections and violate the dignity of people \u2014 living or dead \u2014 who never consented to having their voice recreated to say things they never said.",
      "It\u2019s been used to produce deepfake robocalls mimicking President Joe Biden. In the U.S., authorities recently charged a high school athletic director with using AI to generate a fake audio clip of the school\u2019s principal making racist remarks.",
      "But the technology also has tremendous potential to help people who have lost their ability to speak clearly. A U.S. congresswoman who cannot speak due to complications from Parkinson\u2019s and a related palsy has used a similar AI program to give a speech on the House floor, and the technology has also helped a young woman who lost her voice due to a tumor.",
      "Channel 12 declined to say which AI program it was using.",
      "Nussbaum had worried that ALS would rob him of the career he loved. In an interview with Channel 12, he recounted telling his managers \u201cdon\u2019t feel like you\u2019re pitying me, doing me a favor,\" he said. \"The day you come to the conclusion that this is it \u2014 tell me. I\u2019ll know how to accept it without a problem.\u201d",
      "He calls his new AI-enabled persona a \u201cmagic trick\u201d that enabled his comeback, and believes it will raise awareness in Israel of ways that people with disabilities \u2014 especially progressive disabilities \u2014 can continue to work.",
      "\u201cThe fact that Channel 12 and my news managers are allowing me to reinvent myself anew, that is one of the most important medicines I can get in my fight with this disease,\u201d he said."

      "Rescue workers in the freezing, high-altitude Tibet region are searching for more survivors and victims, one day after a strong earthquake leveled thousands of houses and killed at least 126 people near a holy city for Tibetan Buddhists",
      "BEIJING -- Rescue workers in the freezing, high-altitude Tibet region in western China searched Wednesday for more survivors and victims of a strong earthquake that struck a day earlier near a holy city for Tibetan Buddhists, killing at least 126 people and leveling thousands of houses.",
      "Tents, quilts and other relief items were being delivered to people whose homes were uninhabitable or unsafe. Temperatures fell well below freezing overnight in an area with an average altitude of about 4,200 meters (13,800 feet).",
      "The confirmed death toll stood at 126 with another 188 injured as of Tuesday evening. The earthquake struck the city of Xigaze, the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama, the second-highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism. It was not immediately known whether he was in his Tashi Lhunpo Monastery at the time of the quake or how much damage the city sustained. The quake's distance from Xigaze, which sprawls across a high altitude plain, was about 25 kilometers (15 miles).",
      "The Chinese government and followers of the Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's highest figure, have feuded over who should hold the position of Panchen Lama since a boy appointed by the Dalai Lama disappeared in the mid-1990s and a Chinese-backed candidate was approved for the position. The Dalai Lama, viewed by the Chinese government as a dangerous separatist, denounced the move and has refused to recognize the current Panchen Lama.",
      "China's government says Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, but many Tibetans say they were functionally independent for most of that time. China's People's Liberation Army invaded the territory in 1950 and the Dalai Lama fled to India nine years later during an uprising against Chinese rule, seen as eroding Tibet's unique Buddhist culture.",
      "More than 500 aftershocks were recorded after the earthquake, which the U.S. Geological Survey said measured magnitude 7.1. China\u2019s earthquake center recorded a magnitude of 6.8.",
      "The quake was also about 75 kilometers (50 miles) from Mount Everest and the border with Nepal, where the shaking sent people running out of their homes in the capital.",
      "The dead included at least 22 of the 222 residents of Gurum, the official Xinhua News Agency cited the village's Communist Party chief, Tsering Phuntsog, as saying. The victims included his 74-year-old mother, and several other of his relatives remained buried in the debris.",
      "\u201cEven young people couldn\u2019t run out of the houses when the earthquake hit, let alone old people and children,\u201d Tsering Phuntsog said.",
      "More than 3,600 houses collapsed, according to a preliminary survey, and 30,000 residents have been relocated, Xinhua said, citing the city government in Xi, also known by its Tibetan spelling, Shigatse.",
      "The Ministry of Emergency Management has 1,850 rescuers on the ground along with firefighters and others, state broadcaster CCTV said.",
      "Tibet is generally closed to foreign journalists over reports about the ill treatment of the native population by Chinese authorities.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping ordered \u201call-out rescue efforts to save lives and minimize casualties,\u201d Xinhua reported. Communications in the area have also been restored, allowing smoother delivery of emergency goods, it said.",
      "A candlelight vigil was planned in Dharamsala, India, home of the Dalai Lama and a large Tibetan population, on Wednesday night, and an announcement on the Dalai Lama\u2019s website said he would lead a prayer ceremony in memory of the victims on Thursday.",
      "Asked about the prayer ceremony, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said, \u201cWe are very clear about the separatist nature and political schemes of the Dalai Lama and remain highly vigilant.\u201d",

      "When he was still a boy making the long, tedious trips between his school and his woodsy home in the mountains during the 1980s, JoeBen Bevirt began fantasizing about flying cars that could whisk him to his destination in a matter of minutes",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- When he was still a boy making long, tedious trips between his school and his woodsy home in the mountains during the 1980s, JoeBen Bevirt began fantasizing about flying cars that could whisk him to his destination in a matter of minutes.",
      "As CEO of Joby Aviation, Bevirt is getting closer to turning his boyhood flights of fancy into a dream come true as he and latter-day versions of the Wright Brothers launch a new class of electric-powered aircraft vying to become taxis in the sky.",
      "The aircraft \u2014 known as \"electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle, or eVTOL \u2014 lift off the ground like a helicopter before flying at speeds up to 200 miles per hour (322 kilometers per hour) with a range of about 100 miles (161 kilometers). And these craft do it without filling the air with excessive noise caused by fuel-powered helicopters and small airplanes.",
      "\u201cWe are just a few steps from the finish line. We want to turn what are now one- and two-hour trips into five-minute trips,\u201d Bevirt, 51, told The Associated Press before a Joby air taxi took off on a test flight in Marina, California \u2014 located about 40 miles south from where he grew up in the mountains.",
      "Archer Aviation, a Silicon Valley a Silicon Valley company backed by automaker Stellantis and United Airlines, has been testing its own eVTOLs over farmland in Salinas, California, where a prototype called \u201cMidnight\u201d could be seen gliding above a tractor plowing fields last November.",
      "The tests are part of the journey that Joby Aviation and other ambitious companies that collectively have raised billions of dollars are taking to turn flying cars into more than just pie-in-the-sky concepts popularized in 1960s-era cartoon series, \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d and the 1982 science fiction film, \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d",
      "Archer Aviation and nearby Wisk Aero, with ties to aerospace giant Boeing Co. and Google co-founder Larry Page, are also at the forefront in the race to bring air taxis to market in the United States. Joby has already formed a partnership to connect its air taxis with Delta Air Lines passengers while Archer Aviation has lined up a deal to sell up to 200 of its aircraft to United Airlines.",
      "Flying taxis have made enough regulatory inroads with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to result in the recent creation of a new aircraft category called \u201cpowered lift,\u201d a step that the agency hadn't taken since helicopters were introduced for civilian use in the 1940s.",
      "But there are more regulatory hurdles to be cleared before air taxis will be allowed to carry passengers in the U.S., making Dubai the most likely place where eVTOLs will take commercial flight \u2014 perhaps by the end of this year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky business to develop a whole new class of vehicles,\u201d said Alan Lim, director of Alton Aviation Consultancy, a firm tracking the industry's evolution. \u201cIt is going to be like a crawl, walk, run situation. Right now, I think we are still crawling. We are not going to have the Jetsons-type reality where everyone will be flying around everywhere in the next two to three years.\u201d",
      "China is also vying to make flying cars a reality, a quest that has piqued President-elect Donald Trump's interest in making the vehicles a priority for his incoming administration during the next four years.",
      "If the ambitions of eVTOL pioneers are realized in the U.S., people will be able to hop in an air taxi to get to and from airports serving New York and Los Angeles within the next few years.",
      "Because its electric taxis can fly unimpeded at high speeds, Joby envisions transporting up to four Delta Air Lines passengers at a time from New York area airports to Manhattan in about 10 minutes or less. To start, air taxi prices almost certainly will be significantly more that the cost of taking a cab or Uber ride from JFK airport to Manhattan, but the difference could narrow over time because eVTOLs should be able to transport a higher volume of passengers than ground vehicles stuck in traffic going each way.",
      "\u201cYou will see highways in the sky,\u201d Archer Aviation CEO Adam Goldstein predicted during an interview at the company's San Jose, California, headquarters. \u201cThere will be hundreds, maybe thousands of these aircraft flying in these individual cities and it will truly change the way cities are being built.\u201d",
      "Investors are betting Goldstein is right, helping Archer raise an additional $430 million late last year from a group that included Stellantis and United Airlines. The infusion came shortly after a Japanese automaker poured another $500 million into Joby to bring its total investment in that company to nearly $900 million.",
      "Those investments were part of the $13 billion that eVTOL companies have raised during the past five years, according to Alton Aviation.",
      "Both Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation went public in 2021 through reverse mergers, opening up another fundraising avenue and making it easier to recruit engineers with the allure of stock options. Both companies have been able to attract workers away from electric automaker Tesla and rocket maker SpaceX and, in Archer's instance, raiding the ranks of Wisk Aero.",
      "The Wisk defections triggered a lawsuit accusing Archer of intellectual property theft in a dispute that was resolved with a 2023 settlement that included an agreement for the two sides to collaborate on some facets of eVTOL technology.",
      "Before going public, Joby also acquired eVTOL technology developed by ride-hailing service Uber in an $83 million deal that also brought those two companies together as partners.",
      "But none of the deals or technological advances have stopped the losses from piling up at the companies building flying cars. Joby, whose roots date back to 2009 when Bevirt founded the company, has sustained $1.6 billion in losses since its inception while Archer has amassed nearly $1.5 billion in losses since its founding in 2018.",
      "While they moved to commercial air taxi services, both Joby and Archer are trying to bring in revenue by negotiating contracts to use their eVTOLs in the U.S. military for deliveries and other other short-range missions. Archer has forged a partnership with Anduril Industries, a military defense technology specialist founded by Oculus headset inventor Palmer Luckey, to help it win deals.",
      "The uncertain prospects have left both companies with relatively low market values by tech industry standards, with Joby's hovering around $7 billion and Archer's $6 billion.",
      "But Bevirt sees blue skies ahead. \u201ceVTOLs are going to transform the way we move,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dramatically better way to get around. Seeing the world from the air is better than being stuck in the traffic on the interstate.\u201d"

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 19:06:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Special counsel David Weiss slammed President Biden's characterization of his probe as infected with \"raw politics\" in his final report on his probes into Hunter Biden.",
    "story": [
      "The report caps a yearslong probe into the president's son.",
      "Special counsel David Weiss slammed President Joe Biden's characterization of his probe as being infected with \"raw politics\" in his final report detailing his investigations into the president's son Hunter Biden, which was released Monday by the Justice Department.",
      "Weiss' work culminated in two separate criminal convictions of Hunter Biden that his father wiped clean with a sweeping pardon in early December, just weeks after Election Day. In July 2024, Weiss' office secured a guilty verdict from a Delaware jury on three felony gun charges, and months later, on the eve of trial, Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to numerous tax crimes, including six felonies.",
      "Weiss' report -- 27 pages in length plus hundreds of pages of public filings -- caps a yearslong and politically fraught probe that remained a source of seemingly endless fodder for President Biden's political opponents in Congress and elsewhere. Weiss' prosecutors examined Hunter Biden's years of drug and alcohol abuse, his controversial foreign business dealings, and his procurement of a gun in 2018.",
      "When President Biden issued a pardon for Hunter Biden in early December, he claimed that \"raw politics has infected\" the investigation into his son.",
      "\"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son -- and that is wrong,\" Biden wrote.",
      "Weiss, in the report, criticized the president's assertion.",
      "\"Other presidents have pardoned family members, but in doing so, none have taken the occasion as an opportunity to malign the public servants at the Department of Justice based solely on false accusations,\" Weiss wrote.",
      "Weiss defended his work as \"thorough, impartial investigations, not partisan politics.\"",
      "\"Eight judges across numerous courts have rejected claims that they were the result of selective or vindictive motives,\" Weiss wrote. \"Calling those rulings into question and injecting partisanship into the independent administration of the law undermines the very foundation of what makes America's justice system fair and equitable. It erodes public confidence in an institution that essential to preserving the rule of law.\"",
      "\"These prosecutions were the culmination of thorough, impartial investigations, not partisan politics. Eight judges across numerous courts have rejected claims that they were the result of selective or vindictive motives,\" Weiss wrote.",
      "\"Calling those rulings into question and injecting partisanship into the independent administration of the law undermines the very foundation of what makes America's justice system fair and equitable. It erodes public confidence in an institution that is essential to preserving the rule of law,\" wrote Weiss. \"These baseless accusations have no merit and repeating them threatens the integrity of the justice system as a whole.\"",
      "Weiss says because of the pardon, he was prevented from making \"additional charging decision\" regarding Hunter Biden's 's conduct over an 11-year span, suggesting there were other cases he could have pursued against the president's son. However, because of the pardon, \"it would thus be inappropriate to discuss whether additional charges are warranted,\" he wrote.",
      "Hunter Biden's legal team said they were not given an opportunity to read Weiss' report prior to its release.",
      "Federal investigators began looking into the younger Biden's taxes in 2018, before his father launched his successful presidential bid. That probe grew to include scrutiny of his overseas business dealings in China, Ukraine, and elsewhere, ABC News previously reported.",
      "In the summer of 2023, prosecutors in Weiss' office struck a plea deal with Hunter Biden that would have allowed him to plead guilty to a pair of tax-related misdemeanors and avoid prosecution on one felony gun charge.",
      "But that deal fell apart under questioning by a federal judge -- and within months, Weiss secured special counsel status from Attorney General Merrick Garland and filed charges in both cases.",
      "Over the course of his probe, Weiss emerged as one of those rare figures in politics who attracted scrutiny from across the political spectrum. Republicans loyal to Donald Trump accused him of failing to bring more serious and substantial charges against the Biden family, while Democrats complained that a GOP-led pressure campaign influenced Weiss' prosecutorial decisions.",
      "Sentencing in both cases had been scheduled to take place just weeks after President Biden issued his pardon, with Hunter Biden facing the possibility of years in prison and more than a million dollars in fines.",
      "Weiss also brought a third successful case against a former FBI informant who pleaded guilty to spreading lies about the Bidens' business dealings. Last week a federal judge sentenced the former informant, Alexander Smirnov, to six years in prison.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is calling state lawmakers into a special session to help carry out President-elect Donald Trump's promises for a swift crackdown on immigration.",
      "Trump is preparing more than 100 executive orders starting Day One of the new White House administration, in what amounts to a shock-and-awe campaign on border security, deportations and a rush of other policy priorities.",
      "While Trump and his advisers have pledged mass deportations, many questions remain about how they would deport anywhere close to the 11 million people estimated to be in the country illegally.",
      "DeSantis announced Monday he's scheduling the special session for the week of Jan. 27, the week after Trump is sworn in, so that state lawmakers will be poised to help implement the incoming president's policies immediately.",
      "\u201cState and local officials in Florida must help the Trump administration enforce our nation\u2019s immigration laws,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cIn order to do that effectively, we are going to need legislation to impose additional duties on local officials and provide funding for those local officials.\u201d",
      "The Republican governor said he's prepared to suspend elected officials from office if they are \u201cneglecting their duties\u201d under the new immigration mandates and that he would consider activating the Florida National Guard and the Florida State Guard to carry out in-state enforcement measures. DeSantis said he anticipates allocating tens of millions of dollars in new funding to help state and local officials expand their enforcement and detention efforts.",
      "\u201cThere also needs to be measures to hold people accountable who are violating our anti-sanctuary policies,\u201d he said. \u201cFlorida needs to make sure that we don\u2019t have any lingering incentives for people to come into our state illegally.\u201d",
      "DeSantis is also calling on Florida lawmakers to pass hurricane relief, work on reforms for the state's condominium market, which has seen rising prices following a safety law passed by state lawmakers in 2022 in the wake of the Surfside collapse, which killed 98 people in June 2021. The governor also wants legislators to overhaul Florida's citizen ballot initiative process for proposing constitutional amendments, after claiming a 2024 measure that would have expanded abortion rights was plagued by fraud.",

      "Approximately 92,000 people remain under mandatory evacuation orders with another 89,000 under evacuation warnings, due to intense Santa Ana winds fueling the flames that have scorched 40,000 acres and left at least 24 people dead. Severe fire conditions are expected to continue through Wednesday.",
      "The fires -- which are only partially contained -- first broke out in the Pacific Palisades on Jan. 7, followed by multiple other infernos across LA county, which have decimated entire neighborhoods and sent people fleeing from their homes to safety.",
      "Amid all the devastation and uncertainty, people in LA and across the country have stepped up to lend a hand individually and through organization-led efforts to deliver basic resources like food, water and clothing to fire evacuees.",
      "The culinary community and restaurants outside the impacted fire areas have transformed their eateries into donation centers and community hubs where droves of volunteers have showed up around the clock to gather and distribute those in-demand necessities.",
      "Humanitarian chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s instantly deployed relief efforts in Southern California last week via his nonprofit World Central Kitchen, mobilizing a network of restaurant and food truck partners within hours of the blazes to serve nourishing meals to first responders and evacuees with the help of hundreds of volunteers.",
      "The nonprofit, which responds to natural disasters worldwide, has been inundated with both donations and offers to lend a helping hand on the ground.",
      "There has been a robust response to deliver aid during this difficult time, including from celebrities like Jennifer Garner -- who has lived in the Pacific Palisades for over 20 years and spoke to NBC News about passing out meals with World Central Kitchen in Altadena -- to Good Samaritans and longtime residents alike.",
      "Cameron Smith, an LA resident of 12 years who volunteered all weekend with World Central Kitchen, told \"Good Morning America\" the nonprofit is \"delivering food to pretty much everyone who needs it.\"",
      "\"It's been nothing short of incredible seeing them mobilize and combine forces, sometimes even collaborating to deliver incredible meals to those in need,\" he said. \"I've had the specific pleasure of delivering to frontline firefighters, as well as animal control workers who have been hard at work saving animals from the fires.\"",
      "Smith added that \"it's been absolutely incredible to see the restaurant community come together.\"",
      "\"Even restaurants in LA that have extremely sought-after reservations, like Felix Trattoria in Venice, are stepping up and committing to the cause,\" he said, referring to chef Evan Funke's famed Italian spot on Abbot Kinney Boulevard. \"Everyone has been more than happy to help, even providing much more than initially outlined by WCK to ensure everyone is getting the meals they deserve.\"",
      "On top of his and wife Nikki Smith's combined efforts with World Central Kitchen, the father-to-be told \"GMA\" he's been organizing virtual donations and pooling his efforts with local friends Nick and Karin Ruffini, coordinating Costco and Walmart shopping trips, purchasing highly requested relief items and filling up his Jeep Grand Cherokee to the brim with supplies.",
      "With 200 private donations as of time of publication, Smith and his friends have worked directly with donation drop-off locations and used donated funds to purchase additional essential supplies such as baby diapers, wipes, new baby clothes, strollers, non-perishable food, flashlights, batteries, new blankets, toiletries, bottled water, and new socks and undergarments \"for frontline workers and those directly affected by the fires.\"",
      "\"The volunteers' heartfelt gratitude and excitement upon receiving these much-needed supplies has been truly uplifting,\" Smith said of the continued efforts with YMCA and Baby2Baby locations around LA.",
      "Just 50 miles south of Pacific Palisades in Huntington Beach, chef Andrew Gruel has transformed his popular seafood restaurant Calico Fish House into a community hub where those impacted have been able to get everything from free meals to air purifiers.",
      "\"Over the past three days, we've probably had over 300 volunteers and $200,000 worth of product donations,\" Gruel told \"GMA.\" \"This weekend was a full blown donation drive through here. We had traffic cones and volunteers helping repackage items that were being dropped at the restaurant, with pallets full of supplies.\"",
      "Like so many, Gruel has helped coordinate donations, spreading the word for requests on social media to help support those in need with the help of his wife Lauren Gruel, who has also acted as a support to displaced families, hearing their stories and offering some moments of comfort.",
      "\"We've had probably 50 families come down here that have been affected by the fires to get a meal. Some of them for two days straight,\" Gruel said. \"We're letting them pick up and take everything they need until they move to where they're going next.\"",
      "With such demand in the impacted area, Gruel said one of his longtime farmer vendors in Bakersfield -- Santa Carota Beef -- \"took his trailer out and brought us about 1,000 pounds of meat.\"",
      "\"He loaded it up with diapers and wipes too and drove eight hours there and back to help out,\" he said.",
      "Without a forklift of his own to move the massive amounts of supplies, Gruel worked directly with the Dream Center Foundation in LA -- which has 1,700 rooms for people displaced since the fire evacuations began -- using its machinery to help do the heavy lifting and ultimately distribute the products.",
      "\"There are so many amazing stories in the midst of all this,\" Gruel said. \"We're individually talking to these families and its really horrible, but then we had three giant Amazon trucks pull up full of donations, so I'm trying to stay positive.\"",

      "Shekarchian recalled driving home last Tuesday evening and seeing a \"lightning strike of fire\" in the hills near their home in Altadena. He said that when he got to his house, there was no electricity and he found Cooper sitting inside next to candles \"like the candles we had from when we survived Hurricane Milton.\"",

      "Even after evacuating, Cooper said she believed they would find their home still intact only to learn she and Shekarchian suffered a complete loss.",
      "The couple said that unlike a lot of homeowners, they have home insurance to rebuild and have already decided to do so.",
      "\"I think of it as not necessarily losing a physical structure, but we lost a home, we temporarily lost that sense of community,\" Cooper said. \"And that's why I want to rebuild.\"",

      "Neighbors of the couple told ABC News they also saw the Eaton Fire apparently ignite near the transmission tower and rapidly explode.",
      "\"There was no other fire, no flames anywhere around,\" said neighbor Pedro Rojas, who recorded video of the flames near the transmission tower at 6:24 p.m. on Tuesday. \"Because it was so dark that if there were flames in any other places we would have noticed it.\"",
      "Fire officials trying to determine the cause of the Eaton Fire and the other blazes told ABC News they were aware of the videos showing flames near the transmission tower at the onset of the firestorm.",
      "The Southern California Edison company issued a statement to ABC News, saying that while the Eaton Fire started in its service area, a preliminary analysis shows \"no interruptions or electrical or operational anomalies until more than one hour after the reported start of the fire.\" The utility company also said no fire agency has suggested its equipment caused the Eaton Fire.",

      "\"Those people will not be able to come back. And if they do and they have insurance, will they rebuild?\" Geller said. \"Look, if I'm 75, 80 years old, you know, how much time do I have?\u201d",
      "Geller said he and his wife are considering not rebuilding.",
      "\"It's about quality of life,\" he said. \"If it takes me three years to rebuild, how much time do I actually have left at that point?\"",
      "'Nobody stood a chance'",
      "They are used to saving lives and property, but on Monday veteran Los Angeles Fire Department members Capt. Jerry Puga, Capt. Al Hugo and firefighter George Baxter told ABC News that the Eaton Fire has left them all homeless.",

      "\"Nobody stood a chance. Nobody could prepare for it. It's just a natural disaster,\" said Baxter, who has been a member of the LAFD for 30 years.",
      "Hugo recalled that as a rookie firefighter, he had helped battle a large fire that struck Altadena in 1994, but he said he's never seen a fire as ferocious as the one that destroyed his home.",
      "\"As prepared as you can be, nobody expected the fire to do what it did,\" Hugo said. \"It caught everybody off guard. It really did.\"",
      "When the Eaton Fire started just after 6 p.m. on Tuesday, Puga said he didn't expect it to grow into a monster inferno.",
      "\"I went to sleep that night knowing that there was a fire, but never thinking that it was going to get to me,\" Puga said.",
      "When Puga awoke the next morning and started to drive into the city, he said he realized the erratic behavior of the fire was something he had never witnessed before and that the blaze was headed to his neighborhood. He said he turned around and headed back home, calling his family from his vehicle to warn them.",
      "\"As soon as I got home, we were able to get out. An hour later, we managed to go back and the house was fully engulfed,\" Puga said. \"We lost the house, the property, the materials -- but the family is safe, and that's the most important thing.\"",

      "\"Despite knowing of an extreme fire risk, Defendants deliberately prioritized profits over safety. This recklessness and conscious disregard for human safety was a substantial factor in bringing about the Eaton Fire,\" said a complaint filed by a group of renters, including Michael Kreiner, who was forced to evacuate.",
      "\"In my decades of experience handling wildfire litigation, the Eaton Fire is among the most devastating and heart-wrenching cases I've seen,\" said Patrick McNicholas, the attorney who represents Kreiner and other renters. \"This goes beyond a failure of responsibility -- it is gross negligence in an area highly vulnerable to wildfires, especially with well-documented weather alerts and high wind risks.\"",
      "One of the lawsuits filed on behalf of multiple families who lost their homes, alleges the Eaton Fire was caused when SCE's energized transmission and electrical equipment created an \"electrical arcing event which sent a shower of spars and molten metal down to the ground into a receptive fuel bed.\"",
      "The complaints also allege SCE failed to properly inspect and maintain their electric facilities.",
      "\"These Defendants failed to properly inspect and maintain their electric facilities in order to cut costs, with the full knowledge that any incident was likely to result in a wildfire that would burn and destroy real and personal property, displace homeowners from their homes and disrupt businesses in the fire area,\" said a complaint filed by Jeremy Gursey, who lost his home in Altadena.",
      "According to Gursey's complaint, SCE's electrical transmission system \"was in a dangerous condition, posing a significant risk of electrical failure, fire and property damage to surrounding property and communities.\"",
      "\"Had SCE acted responsibly, the Eaton Fire could have been prevented,\" the complaint says.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for SCE told ABC News, \"Our hearts remain with our communities during the devastating fires in Southern California, and we remain committed to supporting them through this difficult time. SCE crews, contractors and mutual assistance partners are dedicated to safely restoring power to our customers. SCE understands that a lawsuit related to the Eaton fire has been filed but has not yet been served with a complaint. SCE will review the complaint when it is received. The cause of the fire continues to be under investigation.\"",
      "When asked, the spokesperson acknowledged more than one lawsuit had been filed against SCE.",
      "Some of the complaints include public statements from residents and photos that allegedly show fire emerging from the base of power transmission towers owned and operated by SCE.",
      "The Gursey complaint includes satellite photos from Google Earth that allegedly confirm the origin area of the fire where SCE's overheard circuit lines traverse Eaton Canyon.",
      "In a press release by SCE included in the complaint, the utility company confirmed that the Eaton Fire began in SCE's service area.",
      "The four lawsuits seek compensatory damages for the plaintiffs and punitive damages.",
      "\"The conduct alleged against Defendants in this complaint was despicable and subjected Plaintiffs to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of their safety and rights, constituting oppression, for which Defendant must be punished by punitive and exemplary damages in an amount according to proof,\" the Gursey complaint says.",
      "More than 7,000 structures have been damaged or destroyed in the Eaton Fire, which has consumed more than 14,000 acres, according to Cal Fire, and killed at least 16 people, according to the LA County medical examiner.",

      "As brush fires continue to spread across Los Angeles County, two granddaughters told ABC News' Los Angeles station that they fear that their 95-year-old grandmother, Dalyce Curry, was killed in the Eaton Fire.",
      "Dalyce Kelley and Loree Beamer-Wilkinson said they were still waiting on official confirmation as of Sunday.",
      "The Eaton Fire has ravaged over 14,000 acres in Altadena, California, with 27% containment.",
      "The Southern California fires have killed at least 24 people since their outbreak on Jan. 7, according to Los Angeles County fire officials, who have also said the numbers are expected to increase.",
      "Kelley told KABC that she last saw her grandmother last Tuesday, which was the day that the fire broke out.",
      "They had been at a medical center earlier in the day, and Kelley drove her grandmother home after she was discharged. Driving home, they saw the fire in the mountains -- but it seemed far away, Kelley said.",
      "Once they arrived at Curry's address, close to midnight, Kelley noted that the power was still on and there was no sense of imminent danger.",
      "Kelley said that her grandmother had asked her to stay over because they were both so exhausted from the long day at the hospital.",
      "But Kelley said that she has another sibling who is dealing with cancer. Someone had been with the sibling throughout the day but needed to go home, Kelley said, meaning that she had to drive back and relieve them.",
      "She's a primary care provider to both that sibling and her grandmother, she said, which means \"if she was still alive, I would have been called by now.\"",
      "Kelley checked the Pasadena Civic Center for her with no luck.",
      "The family is hoping for a miracle, \"but honestly we don't feel very hopeful that she's still here with us,\" Kelley said.",
      "The family received a message about the power going out in Altadena around 2 a.m. -- a few hours after Curry had been brought home.",
      "Altadena has eclectic little homes, Kelley explained, adding that the neighbors all knew each other. She said that it seemed like someone would get her grandmother out of there, \"if I was absent and if there was an evacuation order that came into play.\"",
      "But when she woke up at 6:30 a.m. on Wednesday, she saw that someone had texted the neighborhood chain asking if anybody got Didi -- a nickname for her grandmother.",
      "At that point, Kelley said that she \"panicked\" and called 911. She headed back to her grandmother's address.",
      "As she approached Altadena, \"It was so black, daytime turned into night,\" she said.",
      "There was a barricade, but she jumped out of her vehicle and grabbed an officer to say that her elderly grandmother was at home by herself.",
      "The officer suggested going to civic center to see if she had been evacuated to that location, explaining that he would check the address in the meantime.",
      "However, Curry was not at the evacuation spot. The officer then called Kelley and said \"I'm sorry your grandmother's property is gone -- it totally burned down,\" she recalled in her interview with KABC.",
      "She was told to file a missing persons police report.",
      "A member of the national guard was able to escort Kelley to her grandmother's address on Friday, she said. When she arrived, \"it was total devastation,\" she said, adding: \"Everything was gone except her blue Cadillac.\"",
      "Beamer-Wilkinson, Kelley's sister who lives in Colorado, tried to help from afar by calling the medical examiner's office. But she wasn't able to get any concrete answers.",
      "They said they hadn't been out to that area yet, but it was on their list and they had her name, Beamer-Wilkinson said.",
      "That was all the two granddaughters had been able to do so far.",
      "\"We are just kind of in a wait-and-hold pattern right now,\" Beamer-Wilkinson added. \"It's very hard to be waiting and not know anything.\"",
      "ABC News reached out to the medical examiner for comment.",
      "\"Our souls are aching, our hearts are broken,\" Kelley told KABC. \"She loved Altadena. There is no one who loved that city more than my grandmother.\"",
      "\"She just loved life, and at 95 she was still very active,\" Beamer-Wilkinson added. \"She looked beautiful \u2013 she took really good care of herself, she took great pride in who she was and who she represented -- and she was an amazing grandmother.\"",
      "\"She said she had yet began to live, so I knew she would just be here beyond 100,\" Kelley said. \"She still wanted to date, she wanted to find a husband.\"",
      "\"I felt so privileged to know this woman and to have her as my grandmother,\" Beamer-Wilkinson said.",
      "The sisters explained that they couldn't think of any reason that Curry wouldn't have reached out to them by now if she had survived.",
      "\"You just wouldn't think that a fire is going to destroy everything,\" Beamer-Wilkinson said.",
      "\"They have to do better with the emergency system because there's a that was a very elderly kind of community,\" Kelley said. \"There's a lot of retirees there, and we can't just rely on the cellphone, because elderly people don't really do cellphones. They don't. That's not the only way we should notify people when there's evacuation orders.\"",
      "\"And why did it not happen earlier?\" she continued. \"Why was I allowed to be to have access to her home at midnight and not have any danger warnings? No highway signs up the way saying, 'This is evacuation zone.'\"",
      "\"When we talk about the elderly, I think we tend to, as a society, dismiss them and think, 'Well, they live their life.' And yes, she was 95, but she had a lot more to give,\" Beamer-Wilkinson said. \"It's a shame that no one saved her.\"",
      "\"And I mean, again, maybe we're talking out of turn. Maybe she's going to turn up, right? We're pulled by that 1% I hope,\" she said, adding that they were not confident that they would see their grandmother again, but: \"We just want to know, right?\"",

    "summary": "The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds reached its highest level in 14 months.",
    "story": [
      "The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds reached its highest level in 14 months.",
      "Bond yields have surged worldwide, threatening to lift mortgage rates and credit card payments for hundreds of millions of people. The U.S. is no exception.",
      "The yield on a 10-year Treasury bond, or the amount paid to a bondholder annually, stands at about 4.8%, marking about half a percentage-point jump over the past month. That figure marks the highest yield for 10-year Treasury bonds in 14 months.",
      "Yields spiked in recent days after a stronger-than-expected jobs report last week gave the Federal Reserve reason to delay interest rate cuts forecast for later this year.",
      "The news came after a monthslong stretch of stubborn inflation had already dampened hopes of a rate cut early in 2025.",
      "The rise in bond yields may hammer borrowers, but larger annual payments from low-risk treasuries could offset some of that pain, analysts said. Higher yields, they added, could make it more difficult for the stock market to sustain gains from previous years, but the exact effect remains uncertain.",
      "\"The rising rates on bonds will certainly impact everybody,\" Adam Lampe, CEO of Mint Wealth Management, told ABC News.",
      "Here's what the increased bond yields mean for your finances, according to experts:",
      "'Benefits savers and punishes borrowers'",
      "The downside of rising bond yields is clear, experts said: borrowing costs go up.",
      "Long-term Treasury yields help set interest payments for mortgages, credit cards, car loans and just about any other type of borrowing, Dominic Pappalardo, chief multi-asset strategist at Morningstar Investment Management, told ABC News.",
      "This financial pain is exemplified by the housing market, where the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has climbed to 6.93%, Freddie Mac data shows. In September, that average rate hovered just above 6%.",
      "\"Anybody who has to borrow money will have to pay higher interest rates, therefore increasing their costs,\" Pappalardo said.",
      "The impact of bond yields on consumers isn't entirely negative, however.",
      "The trend means better returns for investors who place their money into financial instruments such as money market funds or high-interest savings accounts, which are safer investments than the stock market.",
      "The average yield for a money market fund -- a batch of investments in low-risk government and corporate debt -- stands at 4.27%, according to Vanguard. That rate well exceeds the current year-over-year inflation rate of 2.7%, meaning a money market fund offers an opportunity for returns even when accounting for inflation, experts said.",
      "\"For those who want to see their money go up faster than the inflation rate, you can do it now with almost no risk,\" Jim Bianco, a market analyst at Bianco Research, told ABC News.",
      "In other words, the rise in bond yields portends good days to come for those with money to save and bad ones for those in need of a loan.",
      "\"High interest rates benefit savers and punish borrowers,\" Pappalardo said.",
      "Risk for the stock market",
      "The rise in bond yields could also prove a warning sign for the stock market, experts said.",
      "Inflation has slowed dramatically from a peak of more than 9% in June 2022, but price increases remain above the target rate of 2%. The inflation rate has ticked up in recent months.",
      "Traders anticipate higher interest rates for a longer period, suggesting expectations of a more prolonged bout of inflation than previously thought just a few months ago.",
      "If that worry comes to pass, the central bank would need to keep borrowing costs high, which could place downward pressure on economic activity and weaken corporate profits.",
      "\"Equities don't look as attractive in a higher-interest-rate environment,\" said Lampe, of Mint Wealth.",
      "The stock market climbed to record highs in 2024, extending banner gains achieved the previous year. The S&P 500 -- the index to which many people's 401(k)s are pegged -- soared 25% last year.",
      "The market may be due for a cooldown in 2025, Bianco said. \"You'll get more moderate types of returns,\" he added.",
      "Still, stock performance may defy expectations, as it did in previous years when many analysts expected an economic downturn, some experts said.",
      "Inflation may come under control sooner than expected, or initiatives put forward by President-elect Donald Trump could accelerate economic growth, even in the face of high interest rates.",
      "The possibility of breakneck growth presents its own risk, however, since a booming economy would likely bring a burst of consumer demand and further price increases, Bianco said.",
      "The thorny outlook for the stock market may bolster investor appetite for bonds, he added.",
      "\"Bond funds will return you most of what the stock market will return you, but with less risk,\" Bianco said.",

      "The scuttling of the government's latest legal battle isn't necessarily the end of RMS Titanic Inc.'s attempts to enter the rapidly deteriorating ocean liner or to fetch more historic objects. The company said last month that it's still considering the implications of future expeditions.",
      "But the U.S. on Friday withdrew its motion to intervene in a federal admiralty court in Virginia, which oversees salvage matters for the world's most famous shipwreck. The withdrawal concluded the second of two legal battles in five years that the U.S. has waged against RMS Titanic Inc, the company that has retrieved and exhibited the ship's artifacts.",
      "The U.S. filed its latest legal challenge in 2023 when RMST was planning to take images inside the ship's hull and pluck items from the surrounding debris field. RMST also said it would possibly recover freestanding objects from the room where the ocean liner broadcast its distress calls.",
      "The U.S. argued that entering the hull \u2014 or disturbing the wreck \u2014 would violate a 2017 federal law and a corresponding agreement with Great Britain. Both regard the site as a hallowed memorial to the more than 1,500 people who died when the ship struck an iceberg in 1912.",
      "RMST ultimately scaled back its dive plans, stating that it would only take external images. The change followed the 2023 implosion of the Titan submersible, which killed RMST\u2019s director of underwater research Paul-Henri Nargeolet and four others onboard.",
      "The experimental Titan craft was operated by a separate company, OceanGate, to which Nargeolet was lending his expertise. He was supposed to lead the RMST expedition.",
      "After RMST revised its dive plans, the U.S. stopped trying to block that particular expedition, which produced detailed images of the wreck in September. But the government told the federal court in Norfolk last year that it wanted to leave the door open to challenging subsequent expeditions.",
      "RMST, however, told the court in December that it won\u2019t visit the wreck in 2025 and hasn't settled on any plans for future expeditions. The company said it will continue to \u201cdiligently consider the strategic, legal, and financial implications of conducting future salvage operations at the site.\u201d",
      "In response, the U.S. withdrew its motion to intervene.",
      "\u201cShould future circumstances warrant, the United States will file a new motion to intervene based on the facts then existing,\u201d the government wrote in a filing on Friday.",
      "RMST has been the court-recognized steward of Titanic artifacts since it won salvage rights to the ship in 1994. The firm has recovered and conserved thousands of items, from silverware to a piece of the ship\u2019s hull, which millions of people have seen through exhibits.",
      "The company's last expedition to recover artifacts was in 2010, before the federal law and international agreement took effect.",
      "The first federal enforcement was in 2020, when RMST wanted to retrieve and exhibit the radio that broadcast the Titanic\u2019s distress calls.",
      "U.S. District Judge Rebecca Beach Smith, who presides over Titanic salvage matters, gave RMST permission. But the U.S. government swiftly challenged the plan. The legal battle never played out because RMST indefinitely delayed the expedition in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Smith noted during a court hearing in March that time may be running out for expeditions inside the Titanic. The ship is rapidly deteriorating on the North Atlantic seabed."

      "As wildfires continue to blaze across Los Angeles County, authorities are sounding the alarm on another potential threat to the public: scams relating to the disaster.",
      "Multiple law enforcement officials have warned of bad actors scheming to take advantage of charitable people looking to chip in and give to those in need due to the fires.",
      "\u201cWe have people with big hearts who want to help, they want to donate, they want to support the victims,\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a press conference Saturday. \"We also see scammers who are taking advantage of that goodness and that generosity and scamming and defrauding those individuals.\u201d",
      "Bonta urged the public to beware of fraudulent organizations falsely claiming to be charities or nonprofits aiding fire victims.",

      "McDonnell also recommended steering clear of cash donations whenever possible, instead \u201copting instead for secure, traceable payment methods to ensure that your contributions reach those in need.\u201d",
      "And if you suspect a donation request is fraudulent, McDonnell asked the public to contact police so they can investigate the matter.",
      "Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert G. Luna said law enforcement officials are \u201ceager to prosecute\u201d anyone caught preying on people\u2019s generosity.",
      "Bonta reiterated this warning on Sunday, emphasizing there will be harsh consequences.",
      "\u201cTo anyone who would go out and take advantage of this tragedy for their greedy gain, who would further victimize people who have potentially lost everything, who are already victims, who would look at this devastation and see dollar signs, I have a message for you: You will be held accountable,\u201d Bonta said. \u201cMy office will be engaged to hold you accountable.\u201d",

      "Delta Air Lines topped profit and revenue expectations in the fourth quarter on strong demand during the crucial holiday period.",
      "Delta said Friday that travel demand picked up throughout the quarter. During November and December, the airline said that it saw four of the top 10 revenue days in its history and double-digit growth in cash bookings driven by both leisure and corporate travelers.",
      "\u201cAs we move into 2025, we expect strong demand for travel to continue, with consumers increasingly seeking the premium products and experiences that Delta provides,\u201d CEO Ed Bastian said in a prepared statement on Friday.",
      "The company earned $843 million, or $1.29 per share. Per share earnings removing one-time expenses were $1.85, easily beating Wall Street projections of $1.76, according to industry analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.",
      "A year earlier, Delta earned $2.04 billion, or $3.16 per share.",

      "Among U.S. carriers, Delta scored the highest for on-time arrivals last year, aviation-data provider Cirium reported last week. That was despite a computer outage that caused thousands of flight cancellations in July.",
      "Delta, based in Atlanta, achieved an on-time rate of more than 83%, good enough to rank third worldwide behind Aeromexico and Saudia, respectively. The next-best U.S. carriers were United Airlines, at nearly 81%, and Alaska Airlines, at just over 79%, Cirium said.",

      "As author of several books and a former Fox News Channel host, Hegseth has been forced to defend himself against a long record of his own public comments, including in his most recent book, \u201cThe War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.\u201d",
      "His wide-ranging opinions could provide some insight into how he could approach the top Pentagon job if confirmed. At times, he says he's been misconstrued, but other times he's tried to soften his previously stated views on contentious topics.",
      "Here's a look at Hegseth in his own words:",
      "An Army veteran who rose to the rank of major and served in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, Hegseth, 44, says he believes that standards have declined and that efforts to expand diversity, equity and inclusion have driven white men away.",
      "He complains in his latest book that \u201cwoke\u201d generals and the leaders of the elite service academies have left the military dangerously weak and \u201ceffeminate\u201d by promoting DEI. He says, \u201cthe next commander in chief will need to clean house.\u201d",
      "\u201cTurns out, all the \u2018diversity\u2019 recruiting messages made certain kids \u2014 white kids \u2014 feel like they\u2019re not wanted,\u201d he said in his book.",
      "If confirmed, he has said there will be no more \u201csocial justice, politically correct approaches to how we fight and conduct wars.\" Instead, he said, \u201cthis is about lethality, meritocracy, readiness.\u201d",
      "And he has vowed to fire generals involved in \u201cwoke\u201d programs.",
      "Hegseth's opposition \u2014 stated in his book and interviews \u2014 was simple and direct before his nomination on Nov. 12. But, in the face of questions from Congress, he appears to have altered his stance.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn\u2019t made us more effective. Hasn\u2019t made us more lethal. Has made fighting more complicated,\u201d he said in a podcast hosted by Shawn Ryan on Nov. 7.",
      "Women have a place in the military, he said, just not in special operations, artillery, infantry and armor units.",
      "In his book, he said women have performed well in dangerous support roles during war, but \u201cwomen in the infantry \u2014 women in combat on purpose \u2014 is another story.\u201d He adds, \u201cwomen cannot physically meet the same standards as men.\u201d",
      "He said, \"Dads push us to take risks. Moms put the training wheels on our bikes. We need moms. But not in the military, especially in combat units.\"",
      "His views riled some members of Congress.",
      "Asked about the issue on the \u201cMegyn Kelly Show\u201d in early December, Hegseth said he cares only that military standards are maintained. Women serve in combat, he said, and, \u201cif we have the right standard and women meet that standard, roger. Let's go.\u201d",
      "Hegseth faced allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman he met at a conference in California in 2017. He has denied it, saying it was consensual. No charges were filed.",
      "He has acknowledged paying a settlement to his accuser, contending he did so to head off a baseless lawsuit. \u201cThe matter was fully investigated, and I was completely cleared,\u201d he said.",
      "He also has acknowledged multiple instances of infidelity, including the California incident, which happened while he was going through a divorce with his second wife after having a child with the woman who is now his current wife, Jennifer Rauchet.",
      "He told Kelly that going to a hotel room with someone who was not his wife \u201cis not OK\u201d and that he paid the settlement \u201cto protect my wife. I did it to protect my family. I did it to protect my job.\"",
      "He said it was fair to call him a \u201cserial cheater\u201d but he \u201ctruly was changed by Jen and my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ\u201d and is now a different man.",
      "Senators have also expressed concerns about reports of excessive drinking.",
      "Hegseth has denied having a drinking problem and said publicly that he told lawmakers he wouldn\u2019t drink while defense secretary.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to have a drink at all,\" he said, likening it to following the Pentagon\u2019s general order No. 1, which prohibits troops from drinking while deployed.",
      "He said that often when service members come home from war they \u201chave some beers.\u201d But insisted in the Kelly interview that, \"I\u2019ve never had a drinking problem.\"",
      "Hegseth has said the Pentagon overreacted by taking steps to address extremism and has taken leadership to task for the military\u2019s efforts to remove people it deemed white supremacists and violent extremists.",
      "He wrote that the problem is \u201cfake\u201d and characterized it as \u201cpeddling the lie of racism in the military.\u201d He said efforts to root out extremism had pushed \u201crank-and-file patriots out of their formations.\u201d",
      "Hegseth was pulled from Washington National Guard duty during President Joe Biden's inauguration after he was flagged as a possible \u201cInsider Threat\u201d by a fellow service member due to a tattoo.",
      "Hegseth has said it was due to a Christian cross tattoo on his chest. But the fellow Guard member, who was on an anti-terrorism team at the time, shared with The Associated Press an email he sent to the unit\u2019s leadership flagging a different tattoo on Hegseth's bicep that's associated with white supremacist groups.",
      "Shortly after President-elect Trump announced his nomination, Hegseth posted on X, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time for a @SecDef who has\u2026 Led in combat. Been on patrol for days. Pulled a trigger. Heard bullets whiz by. Called in close air support. Led medevacs. Dodged IEDs.\"",
      "He said Trump told him that, \u201cI chose you because you\u2019re the guy that\u2019s gonna put the warfighters first. We haven\u2019t had that. We need a guy that\u2019s kicked down doors and understands the consequences of war.\u201d",
      "Trump's first defense secretary, retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, served in combat in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and was awarded a Bronze Star with a V for valor for serving in one of the lead assault units going into Kuwait in the first Gulf War.",
      "Current Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, a retired Army four-star general, also commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and was awarded a Silver Star, the nation's third-highest award for valor, for leading troops into Iraq during the 2003 invasion.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve led troops in combat in pretty significant and tough situations,\u201d Austin told The Associated Press. \u201cEven if you are a self-described \u2018door kicker\u2019 or whatever you want to call it, I had run large, complex organizations before I came into this job, and I did that successfully.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo I think you have to have a perspective on what\u2019s happening on the ground, but you also have to have an understanding of how things fit in terms of the bigger picture,\u201d he said.",

      "NORTH WOODSTOCK, N.H. -- An annual architectural celebration of ice is up and running again in New Hampshire and several other states.",
      "Ice Castles, which are both temporary art installations and tourist attractions, feature towers, tunnels, archways and caves, all created by growing, harvesting and arranging thousands of icicles and then blasting them with sprinklers.",
      "The company behind the displays has expanded since its first installation in 2011. This year it has operations in Utah, Minnesota, two locations in Colorado and New Hampshire, where the site includes a snow tubing hill and ice bar. After a mild winter last year, officials were thrilled that temperatures were cold enough to open earlier this season.",
      "\u201cIt's one of the biggest ice castles we've ever built,\u201d said Jared Henningsen, the company\u2019s vice president for operations. \u201cWe're looking at about 25 million pounds of ice spread over two acres.\u201d",
      "As a winter storm brought biting cold and wet snow to the South, visitors to the New Hampshire castle bundled up to explore its twists and turns Friday.",
      "Julia Jones of Gloucester, Massachusetts, said she travels to northern New Hampshire several times a year but had not experienced the ice castles until her opening-day visit.",
      "\u201cI've never seen anything like this before,\u201d she said. \u201cHonestly I didn't think it was gonna be this big.\u201d",
      "Jessica Sullivan, of Fairhaven, Massachusetts, also was surprised, and not just by the frozen environment. Her boyfriend, Brian Jacques, proposed to her during their visit.",
      "\u201cIt's a beautiful place,\u201d said Jacques, who got the \u201cyes\u201d he was hoping for. \u201cI definitely thought, this is the time and place to do it.\u201d",
      "By day the walls and other structures shine with a pale blue hue. After darkness falls, lights embedded within the ice glow pink, purple and green.",
      "\u201cOnce you enter into an ice castle, you're transitioning into something that's totally immersive and unlike something that most guests have ever seen,\u201d Henningsen said. \u201cI think it inspires people.\u201d"

      "Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs knows she is outnumbered this legislative session as Republicans expanded their statehouse majorities in the last election",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs knows she is outnumbered this legislative session, with Republicans having expanded their majorities in the statehouse after the last election.",
      "But the first-term governor sees room for bipartisan compromise as she looks to advance policies that have long been stymied under the GOP-controlled Legislature.",
      "While President-elect Donald Trump swept the battleground state, Hobbs noted in a recent interview with The Associated Press that Arizona voters also elected Democrat Ruben Gallego to the U.S. Senate, sending the message that they want their political leaders to work across the aisle to solve the thorniest of issues.",
      "\u201cThe issues we\u2019re facing \u2014 affordability for families, water security, protecting our border and keeping communities safe \u2014 those are not Republican or Democratic issues,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re just Arizona issues that our elected leaders, myself included, need to work together to solve.\u201d",
      "Hobbs, who will be up for reelection next year, is expected to outline her priorities when she addresses lawmakers at the start of the session Monday.",
      "Here's a look at key policy areas:",
      "It was just two weeks after the November election when Hobbs visited the Arizona-Mexico border and vowed to work with Trump\u2019s administration on issues like stopping fentanyl trafficking. But she also acknowledged some families are worried about the president-elect's deportation threats.",
      "While not wanting to speculate, Hobbs says Arizona will focus its limited law enforcement resources on keeping violent criminals off the streets, regardless of their immigration status.",
      "Arizona voters last year approved a measure empowering local police to arrest people suspected of illegally crossing the border, so it\u2019s unclear what new restrictions on immigration Republicans might push beyond ensuring adequate funding for law enforcement.",
      "Hobbs will look to pressure lawmakers again to plug regulatory holes to protect groundwater sources. Her calls last year to update the state's water laws failed to win legislative approval, leaving her administration to take executive action in December to curb unchecked pumping in one rural area.",
      "This time around, Hobbs is optimistic she can reach a deal with lawmakers on revamping groundwater regulations. In the absence of a pact, Hobbs says she won\u2019t hesitate to act unilaterally.",
      "The stakes are high as Arizona has grappled with long-term drought and needs to come up with a plan by the end of 2026 to manage its dwindling share of water from the over-tapped Colorado River.",
      "Reining in Arizona's school voucher program remains on Hobbs' wish list.",
      "The program, which started in 2011 for disabled children and expanded to all students in 2022, lets parents subsidize private-school tuition and other educational costs with public money.",
      "Hobbs and fellow Democrats have criticized the program, saying it contributes to a drain on the state's coffers. Republican lawmakers have championed the program as a cornerstone of the school choice movement. The budget approved by lawmakers last year after weeks of negotiations with Hobbs' office included only a small cut in spending for the program.",
      "Unlike last year, the state isn\u2019t facing a budget crunch. The latest revenue projection for the next fiscal year is up $231 million compared to the forecast last summer, according to legislative analysts.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden spoke Sunday with relatives of three Americans the U.S. government is looking to bring home from Afghanistan, but it was unclear from the call if a deal to bring them back that is now on the table could be completed before the he leaves office next week.",
      "Biden's call with family members of Ryan Corbett, George Glezmann and Mahmoud Habibi took place in the waning days of his administration as officials try to negotiate a deal that could bring them home in exchange for Muhammad Rahim, one of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo Bay.",
      "Corbett, who had lived in Afghanistan with his family at the time of the 2021 collapse of the U.S.-backed government, was abducted by the Taliban in August 2022 while on a business trip and Glezmann, an airline mechanic from Atlanta, was taken by the Taliban's intelligence services in December 2022 while traveling through the country.",
      "Officials believe the Taliban is still holding both men as well as Habibi, an Afghan American businessman who worked as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecommunications company and also went missing in 2022. The FBI has said that Habibi and his driver were taken along with 29 other employees of the company, but that all except for Habibi and other person have since been freed.",
      "The Taliban has denied that it has Habibi, complicating the talks with the U.S. government.",
      "On the call Sunday, Biden told the families that his administration would not trade Rahim, who has been held at Guantanamo since 2008, unless the Taliban releases Habibi, according to a statement from Habibi's brother, Ahmad Habibi.",
      "\u201cPresident Biden was very clear in telling us that he would not trade Rahim if the Taliban do not let my brother go,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe said he would not leave him behind. My family is very grateful that he is standing up for my brother.\u201d",
      "Ryan Fayhee, a lawyer acting on behalf of Corbett's relatives, said the family was grateful to Biden for the call but also implored him to act on the deal.",
      "\u201cA deal is now on the table and the decision to accept it \u2014 as imperfect as it may be \u2014 resides exclusively with the President,\u201d Fayhee said in a statement. \u201cHard decisions make great Presidents, and we hope and believe that President Biden will not let perfection be the enemy of the good when American lives are at stake.\u201d",
      "If a deal is not done before Jan. 20, it would fall to the incoming Trump administration to pick up negotiations, though it's unclear if officials would take a different approach when it comes to releasing a Guantanamo detainee the U.S. government has deemed a danger.",
      "Just 15 men remain at Guantanamo, down from a peak of nearly 800 under former President George W. Bush.",
      "Rahim is one of just three remaining detainees never charged but also never deemed safe for the U.S. to even consider transferring to other countries, as it has done with hundreds of other Muslim detainees brought to Guantanamo but never charged.",
      "The U.S. has described Rahim as a direct adviser, courier and operative for Osama bin Laden and other senior al-Qaida figures and a continuing threat to U.S. national security, despite never charging him or otherwise formally making public any evidence against Rahim in his 17 years at Guantanamo.",
      "Successive U.S. administrations have kept Rahim under wraps to a degree remarkable even for the military-run detention at Guantanamo.",
      "His attorney, James Connell, told a U.N. human rights commission recently that Rahim was being \u201csystematically silenced\u201d by the U.S. Connell claimed to the same panel that a U.S. official had told him \u201cevery word Rahim utters on any topic is classified on the basis of national security.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration in September 2022 swapped a convicted Taliban drug lord imprisoned in the U.S. for an American civilian contractor who'd been detained by the Taliban for more than two years.",

      "A father-daughter team in the Los Angeles area are staying in their home behind the fire barricades and taking inventory of destroyed properties",
      "As the fire roared down a hillside toward their Altadena home, Vanessa Prata and her parents hurried to pack their car. They focused on saving irreplaceable items, like family photographs and a baby doll from Vanessa's childhood.",
      "But they didn't leave.",
      "Instead, the Pratas have remained in their family home of 27 years, which is somehow still standing amid widespread devastation from the Los Angeles wildfires, even as homes just over a block away burned. And as residents who did flee are kept away by police or military barricades, Prata and her dad have taken it upon themselves to check on their neighbors' homes.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re sitting in these shelters. They\u2019re not sure whether their house survived or didn\u2019t survive,\u201d Prata said. \u201cOnce you know what the situation is, you have an ability to regroup and see what you\u2019re going to do moving forward.\u201d",
      "The fires raging around Los Angeles have consumed an area larger than San Francisco. Tens of thousands of people are under evacuation orders. Since the fires first began Tuesday, they have burned more than 12,000 structures, a term that includes homes, apartment buildings, businesses, outbuildings and some vehicles, and killed at least 24 people. The White House said Saturday that the Department of Defense is making its nearby bases available for emergency shelter, including more than 1,000 available beds.",
      "Prata, a 25-year-old nursing student, had stopped at a hardware store on her way home from dinner Tuesday night when she saw the flames approaching the home she shares with her parents, two cats and a dog. She called her dad, then rushed home as many other people headed the other direction to evacuate.",
      "At the house, the Pratas frantically packed, in the dark once the power went out. But Vanessa's father, Aluizio Prata, who teaches electrical and computer engineering at the University of Southern California, didn't want to go. He didn't think the fire would reach them, but if it did, he wanted to stay and help fight it.",
      "They spent much of the night at a home up the street, carrying buckets of water, spraying the yard with a hose and stomping out embers before they spread in the powerful wind gusts.",
      "As the toll from the wildfires became clear, Vanessa Prata saw many people doing what they could to help those who lost their homes. They were donating food, clothing, household goods and pet supplies. Taco trucks from Los Angeles were offering free meals.",
      "Prata remained home, with her family occasionally running a borrowed generator to check the news and keep the freezer cold. She wanted to help, too. But there was little she could do from behind the barricade. If she left her neighborhood, she wouldn't be allowed back.",
      "So on Friday morning, Prata posted to an Altadena community group on Facebook, offering the one thing she could think of that would help.",
      "\u201cWe are more than happy to drive around and take a picture for any person who would like to see their home or, God forbid, what is left of their home,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The requests came pouring in \u2014 as many as 45 by Saturday morning. She and her dad set out on Friday, checking addresses written in a small notebook. They slowly make their way past fallen trees, downed wires and the husks of burned out cars.",
      "Of more than two dozen homes they visited Friday and Saturday, fewer than half were still standing. At the end of a cul-de-sac, reached only after getting out of the car and walking past fallen trees and utility poles, the ruins of one home were still smoldering. One person whose house burned sent her a photo of what it had looked like before the fire.",
      "\u201cThose are devastating, when you get to the person\u2019s house and it\u2019s gone and you know that you\u2019re the one who\u2019s going to break the news,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at the burnt ashes and then they send (a photo of) the house, how beautiful it was prior. And it\u2019s, there\u2019s no, there\u2019s no words. You just say, you know, \u2018I\u2019m sorry. I wish there was more that I could do for you.\u2019\u201d",
      "But her training as a nurse made her a good candidate for that work, she said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not new to people crying, people passing away in front of me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have an ability to be able to handle it.\u201d",
      "And she is gratified to be part of the community effort. So many volunteers showed up to help at nearby donation centers Saturday that some were being turned away.",
      "\u201cEveryone is pitching in and doing what they can,\u201d Prata said. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelmingly beautiful to see.\u201d",

      "Even before powerful winds fueled fires that have scorched more than 10,000 homes and other structures across Los Angeles County since Tuesday, the region\u2019s urban trees were already in trouble",
      "LOS ANGELES -- People across Los Angeles have worked for years to increase the number of trees that shade the pavement, provide a respite for people and even clean some air pollution. They've confronted increasing drought, bad tree-trimming and objections from some neighbors who resent the leaves and sap. Now they wonder what January's fires have done to their efforts.",
      "Bryan Vejar, associate director of community forestry for TreePeople, an environmental nonprofit that works to expand tree equity across Los Angeles, said city arborists have shown him \u201csobering\u201d photographs of large trees knocked onto homes and parkways from the same powerful winds that sent fires out of control. Other images show scorched tree canopies.",
      "The Santa Ana winds damaged trees in TreePeople\u2019s primary focus areas of South Los Angeles, Watts and Inglewood, historically underserved neighborhoods with less shade.",
      "The air is still so bad that field crews cannot yet go out and work safely. When they do, he said, they expect to to find young trees snapped, broken or dried out.",
      "New trees are vulnerable, and volunteers often have to go out and water them for the first few years.",
      "\u201cEvents like this can greatly increase our mortality rates,\u201d Vejar said.",
      "Past fires and extreme winds have torn off many limbs and taken down trees, especially ones planted in narrow strips of land where there isn't room for much soil, Vejar said.",
      "When it\u2019s safe to conduct field assessments, urban tree experts will go out to inspect, re-stake and retie trees toppled by winds, and remove and replace those that were lost.",
      "Replanting trees in burned neighborhoods is harder now because of climate change, said Will Berleson, a professor at USC\u2019s Department of Earth Sciences and researcher with the university\u2019s Urban Trees Initiative. Even though many of the city\u2019s mature trees might only be 30 or 40 years old, they \u201cstarted growing at times when it was not as hot and didn\u2019t have these kinds of wet and dry fluctuations that we seem to be seeing now,\u201d he said.",
      "Some experts see tree losses as an opportunity to continue teaching Los Angeles residents about the place they live and what plants are the best fit, not necessarily the iconic ones of Hollywood movies. They would like to replace nonnative species like palms \u2014 which are more closely related to grasses \u2014 with trees that provide shade and can withstand extreme heat and drought.",
      "Aaron Thomas, director of urban forestry at the environmental nonprofit North East Trees, said trees such as the coast live oak are a good option. They are native to the region and are fire resilient \u2014 in fact, they need to burn to reproduce, he said.",
      "Thomas, who grew up in Altadena, has family members who lost homes to the Eaton Fire. His brother\u2019s home burned, but the five coast live oaks in his backyard survived.",
      "For him it's another reminder that cities need to think about how we rebuild in general and how we reforest communities with native flora: \u201cThat\u2019s what we need to do.\u201d",
      "But planting trees with climate-resilient features such as large canopies isn't always easy, and cities must consider community input when deciding what to plant. Trees that provide a lot of shade can make it difficult for drivers to see around corners, for instance. Where space is at a premium, sometimes there\u2019s just not enough room above or below ground to plant them.",
      "Berleson added that it will take a long time for neighborhoods to look like what they did before the fires.",
      "Trees provide myriad benefits. They clean the air and improve mental health. They capture stormwater runoff and replenish groundwater. And during heat waves that are getting hotter and deadlier, shade trees cool the air and urban surfaces.",
      "Vejar said his group knows there will be setbacks, but that is the reality we're living in.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s climate change. It\u2019s water restrictions. It\u2019s extreme weather events,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so in the face of this, all we can do is continue to build and rebuild and steward our urban forests in such a way that makes it more resilient in the face of these extreme weather events.\u201d",

      "Firefighters scrambled to make further progress against wildfires that have killed at least 24 people in the Los Angeles area as forecasters again warned of dangerous weather with the return of strong winds this week",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Firefighters scrambled Sunday to make further progress against wildfires that have destroyed thousands of homes and killed 24 people in the Los Angeles area as forecasters again warned of dangerous weather with the return of strong winds this week. At least 16 people were missing, and authorities said that number was expected to rise.",
      "The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for severe fire conditions through Wednesday, with sustained winds of 50 mph (80 kph) and gusts in the mountains reaching 70 mph (113 kph). The most dangerous day will be Tuesday, said weather service meteorologist Rich Thompson.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to have really strong gusty Santa Ana winds, a very dry atmosphere and still very dry brush, so we still have some very critical fire weather conditions out there,\u201d Thompson said at a community meeting Saturday night.",
      "Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony C. Marrone said 70 additional water trucks arrived to help firefighters fend off flames spread by renewed gusts. \u201cWe are prepared for the upcoming wind event,\u201d Marrone said. Fire retardant dropped by aircraft Sunday will act as a barrier along hillsides, officials said.",
      "Fierce Santa Anas have been largely blamed for turning the wildfires sparked last week into infernos that leveled entire neighborhoods around the city where there has been no significant rainfall in more than eight months.",
      "Twelve people were missing within the Eaton Fire zone and four were missing from the Palisades Fire, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said. Luna added that \u201cdozens\u201d more reports might have come in Sunday morning and investigators were reconciling whether some of the missing might be among the dead. There are no children among those reported missing, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, the death toll rose to 24 over the weekend. Eight of the deaths were attributed to the Palisades Fire and 16 resulted from the Eaton Fire, the Los Angeles County coroner\u2019s office said in a statement Sunday evening.",
      "Officials said they expected that figure to increase as teams with cadaver dogs conduct systematic grid searches in leveled neighborhoods. Authorities have established a center where people can report the missing.",
      "Officials also were building an online database to allow evacuated residents to see if their homes were damaged or destroyed. In the meantime, LA city Fire Chief Kristin Crowley urged people to stay away from scorched neighborhoods.",
      "\u201cThere are still active fires that are burning within the Palisades area, making it extremely, extremely dangerous for the public,\" Crowley said at a Sunday morning briefing. \u201cThere\u2019s no power, there\u2019s no water, there\u2019s broken gas lines, and we have unstable structures.\u201d",
      "Officials warned the ash can contain lead, arsenic, asbestos and other harmful materials.",
      "About 150,000 people in Los Angeles County remained under evacuation orders, with more than 700 residents taking refuge in nine shelters, Luna said. Officials said most of the orders in the Palisades area were unlikely to be lifted before the red flag warnings expire Wednesday evening.",
      "\u201cPlease rest assured that first thing Thursday we will begin talking about repopulation,\u201d Marrone said.",
      "By Sunday morning, Cal Fire reported the Palisades, Eaton, Kenneth and Hurst fires had consumed more than 62 square miles (160 square kilometers), an area larger than San Francisco. The Palisades Fire was 11% contained and containment on the Eaton Fire reached 27%. Those two blazes accounted for 59 square miles (nearly 153 square kilometers).",
      "Crews from California and nine other states are part of the ongoing response that includes nearly 1,400 fire engines, 84 aircraft and more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from Mexico.",
      "Minimal growth was expected Sunday for the Eaton Fire \u201cwith continued smoldering and creeping\u201d of flames, an LA County Fire Department incident report said. Most evacuation orders for the area have been lifted.",
      "After a fierce battle Saturday, firefighters managed to fight back flames in Mandeville Canyon, home to Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities near Pacific Palisades not far from the coast, where swooping helicopters dumped water as the blaze charged downhill.",
      "The fire ran through chaparral-covered hillsides and also briefly threatened to jump over Interstate 405 and into densely populated areas in the Hollywood Hills and San Fernando Valley.",
      "Looting continues to be a concern, with authorities reporting more arrests as the devastation grows. Michael Lorenz, a captain with the Los Angeles Police Department, said seven people have been arrested in recent days, with two suspects \u201cposing as firefighters coming and in and out of houses.\u201d",
      "Asked exactly how many looters have been arrested, Lorenz said he couldn\u2019t give a precise number but that officers were detaining about 10 people a day. California National Guard troops arrived Friday to help guard properties.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom posted on X Saturday that \u201cCalifornia will NOT allow for looting.\u201d",
      "The fires that began Tuesday just north of downtown LA have burned more than 12,000 structures.",
      "No cause has been determined for the largest fires and early estimates indicate the wildfires could be the nation's costliest ever. A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion.",
      "In an interview that aired Sunday on NBC, Gov. Gavin Newsom said the fires could end up being the worst natural disaster in U.S. history.",
      "\u201cI think it will be in terms of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the scale and scope,\u201d he said.",
      "Along with crews from other states and Mexico, hundreds of inmates from California\u2019s prison system were also helping firefighting efforts. Nearly 950 incarcerated firefighters were dispatched \u201cto cut fire lines and remove fuel to slow fire spread,\u201d according to an update from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",
      "Though the state has long relied on prison labor to fight fires, the practice is controversial as the inmates are paid little for dangerous and difficult work. Inmates are paid up to roughly $10.24 each day, with additional money for 24-hour shifts, according to the corrections department.",
      "Volunteers overflowed donation centers and some had to be turned away at locations including the Santa Anita Park horse racing track, where people who lost their homes sifted through stacks of donated shirts, blankets and other household goods.",
      "Altadena resident Jose Luis Godinez said three homes occupied by more than a dozen of his family members were destroyed.",
      "\u201cEverything is gone,\u201d he said, speaking in Spanish. \"All my family lived in those three houses and now we have nothing.\u201d",
      "Newsom issued an executive order Sunday aimed at fast-tracking the rebuilding of destroyed property by suspending some environmental regulations and ensuring that property tax assessments are not increased.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to let people know that we have their back,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t walk away because we want you to come back, rebuild, and rebuild with higher quality building standards, more modern standards. We want to make sure that the associated costs with that are not disproportionate, especially in a middle-class community like this.\u201d",
      "The White House said as of Sunday more than 24,000 people have registered for federal assistance made available by President Joe Biden's major disaster declaration last Wednesday.",
      "LA Mayor Karen Bass said Sunday that she has spoken with members of the incoming presidential administration and said she expects Donald Trump will come visit the devastated region.",
      "Bass faces a critical test of her leadership during the city's greatest crisis in decades, but allegations of leadership failures, political blame and investigations have begun.",
      "Newsom on Friday ordered state officials to determine why a 117 million-gallon (440 million-liter) reservoir was out of service and some hydrants had run dry.",
      "Crowley, the LA fire chief, said city leadership failed her department by not providing enough money for firefighting. She also criticized the lack of water.",

      "The wildfires tearing through Los Angeles have taken lives and thousands of homes",
      "For Irina Contreras, a program manager for Los Angeles County\u2019s Department of Arts and Culture, outdoor education was a refuge for both her and her daughter during the pandemic.",
      "Now, much of that refuge has been burned in the raging wildfires around Los Angeles.",
      "Her 7-year-old daughter, Ceiba, hikes with a kid\u2019s adventure group called Hawks and attended Matilija, a bilingual forest school for preschool and kindergarten. Rain or shine, she and her friends would spend their days climbing, jumping, hiking, and swimming in places like Eaton Canyon Nature Area, a 190-acre (77-hectare) preserve near Altadena, now destroyed by fire.",
      "Ceiba learned to ask plants for permission before taking samples to glue into her nature journal. Once, her group discovered a hidden path that led behind a waterfall. Ceiba couldn't stop talking about it for days.",
      "For parents like Contreras, the wildfires have been devastating not just because of the loss of life and thousands of homes. They are mourning natural and educational areas that served as sanctuaries and learning spaces for local families, especially in the years since the pandemic. The fires have torn through natural areas that served every type of educational setting: public and private schools, nature-based preschools, homeschool groups, summer camps and more.",
      "They have burned school buildings, too, including Odyssey Charter School in Altadena, which Miguel Orde\u00f1ana's children attend.",
      "\u201cThe community has been devastated by the fire,\u201d said Orde\u00f1ana, senior manager of community science at the Natural History Museum. \u201cIt\u2019s been a challenge to carefully share that news with my children and help them work through their emotions. A lot of their friends lost their homes. And we don\u2019t know the impact to school staff, like their teachers, but a lot of them live in that area as well and have lost their homes.\u201d",
      "Some areas untouched by fire were inaccessible because of poor air quality. Griffith Park, home of the Hollywood sign, had not been affected by the end of the week but it's not clear when the air quality there will be good enough to resume outdoor programs, said Orde\u00f1ana, who was the first to capture on camera a late puma in the nearby area that gained fame under the name P-22.",
      "Orde\u00f1ana said his family was able to connect with some other families from Odyssey Charter School for pizza and an indoor playdate, but he is uncertain what the days will look like for them with school closures already extending through next week.",
      "All schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation\u2019s second largest, were closed Friday because of heavy smoke and ash over the city. Classes will not resume until conditions improve, officials said. Pasadena Unified School District also closed schools and several of its campuses sustained damage, including Eliot Arts Magnet Middle School.",
      "The California Department of Education released a statement Wednesday saying 335 schools from Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura, and San Diego counties were closed. It was unclear how many would be closed Monday.",
      "During the pandemic, Contreras felt like she was stuck on a screen. She devoted much of her energy to working, writing and organizing, but her daughter\u2019s outdoor education helped her better understand the value of stepping away from the grind.",
      "Contreras feels confident the outdoor programs will return, although it\u2019s unclear when it will be safe for people to hike around areas like Eaton Canyon.",
      "\u201cThe nature center is gone,\u201d Richard Smart, superintendent of the Eaton Canyon Natural Area in Pasadena, said Thursday. \u201cThe wildflowers, the shrubs are gone.\u201d The park hosted dozens of school field trips a year and Smart estimates more than a thousand students visited yearly.",
      "\u201cTeachers liked it because it was also free, it was local, it was nearby. And it was a place to see nature \u2014 wild nature but also in a friendly, safe environment,\u201d he said.",
      "Only a few exterior walls of the Eaton Canyon Nature Center were left standing, he said.",
      "\u201cFor many of the local school districts, we truly were in their backyard, and now they won\u2019t be able to use it for the foreseeable future,\u201d he said. \u201cThe park is such a touchstone for people in the community, and so to lose that is just, devastating is not even the right word. It feels indescribable.\u201d",
      "Many parents and teachers are likely wondering what to do and where to take their children as fires continue to burn across Los Angeles, said Lila Higgins, a senior manager for community science at the Natural History Museum and author of \u201cWild L.A,\u201d a field trip and nature guidebook.",
      "A certified forest therapy guide, Higgins says time in nature lowers heart rates, lowers blood pressure and helps children with attention deficit disorder feel more calm and relaxed.",
      "\u201cFor children\u2019s cognitive development, time in nature and time spent connecting with nature is so important,\" she said. Outdoor spaces also can help children learn how to develop relationships through connections with animals, understand orientation through space by following trails and map-reading and understand human impact on wildlife.",
      "\u201cA lot of the places that we\u2019re talking about are really popular with homeschoolers, but they also are a destination for some field trips, certainly places like Eaton Canyon,\" said Greg Pauly, co-author of \u201cWild L.A.\u201d and director of the Urban Nature Research Center at the museum. \"I do think it\u2019s safe to say that people are going to continue to be interacting with those landscapes and it will hopefully still be a field trip destination in the future. But it\u2019s certainly going to be a while before that happens.\"",
      "\u201cThis is the reality of modern Southern California,\" he said. \u201cFire changes the landscape and people\u2019s lives shockingly often.\u201d",

      "As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, many elected officials in Republican and Democratic states are preparing to either aid or oppose his policies",
      "Do you live in a red state, a blue state, or one where Republicans and Democrats share power?",
      "Your answer might provide the best indicator of what to expect from your governor and state lawmakers as President-elect Donald Trump takes office and legislatures convene.",
      "In many cases, political party identification has come to define public policy, percolating from the nation\u2019s capital down to the 50 statehouses.",
      "Many Republican state officials are aligning with Trump's policies by pledging to help him crack down on illegal immigration, for example. Some Democratic state officials are mounting a resistance movement, looking for ways to shield their states from potential federal policies restricting abortion and transgender rights, among other things. Some prominent Democratic governors, meanwhile, have taken a more conciliatory approach in an effort to forge a working relationship with the new administration.",
      "Here's a look at what to expect in some policy areas:",
      "Governors and lawmakers in red states are lining up behind Trump's pledge to crack down on illegal immigration and deport many who are living in the U.S. illegally. A joint statement from 26 Republican governors said they \u201cstand ready to utilize every tool at our disposal \u2014 whether through state law enforcement or the National Guard \u2014 to support President Trump in this vital mission.\u201d",
      "Republican lawmakers in a growing number of states are proposing to give local law officers the power to arrest people who entered the country illegally, mirroring a recent Texas law that has been placed on hold while courts consider whether it unconstitutionally usurps federal authority. One bill in Missouri would offer a $1,000 reward to informants who tip off authorities about people in the country illegally and allow private bounty hunters to find and detain them.",
      "Governors in some blue states are taking a wait-and-see approach to Trump's immigration plans, willing to cooperate on deporting people who commit crimes but not in using the National Guard for widespread roundups of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Other Democratic-led jurisdictions are bracing for a showdown. The California Legislature has convened a special session to erect shields against Trump's policies on immigration and other issues.",
      "Most U.S. abortions are carried out using drugs rather than through surgical procedures, and that is where the current abortion fight is focused.",
      "At least four states \u2014 Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire and Tennessee \u2014 have bills introduced aimed at banning pills. None take the same approach as Louisiana, which last year classified the drugs as controlled dangerous substances.",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing a New York doctor, claiming she wrongly prescribed via telehealth and sent pills to a Texas woman, even though a New York law aims to protect such prescriptions.",
      "And the Republican attorneys general of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are in court trying to roll back federal approvals of one of the pills usually used in abortion.",
      "Several efforts to expand the use of public money to pay for kids to attend private school suffered high-profile defeats in the November elections, including in Nebraska, Kentucky and Colorado.",
      "But Trump\u2019s victory is seen as a boon for such efforts, which in recent years have exploded in popularity. A dozen states, almost all red, have programs allowing any student to apply for government funding for private education, including at religious schools.",
      "With Trump in office, states could see more incentives such as block grants or tax benefits to adopt or expand models like vouchers, which subsidize private school tuition for families. Texas, for example, is expected to see momentum on the school choice front, with a number of voucher proponents winning seats in the Legislature.",
      "Many conservative states also are pushing to bring Christianity into public K-12 education through moves such as requiring schools to teach the Bible and post the Ten Commandments. Trump has promised to promote prayer and Bible reading in schools, with current courts more amenable to religion in the public sphere, including schools.",
      "In Texas, officials in November approved a curriculum that intertwines language arts with biblical lessons and the state education superintendent in Oklahoma has sought to require Bible-related lessons.",
      "Efforts to end diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives are expected to expand in Republican-led states under Trump, who has vowed to get rid of perceived \u201cwokeness\u201d in education. More higher education institutions may join the ranks of those already dismantling diversity offices in states such as Florida, Kentucky, North Carolina, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska and Texas.",
      "Attorneys general and legislatures in red states also are likely to put pressure on the private sector to pare back DEI initiatives. A Tennessee law provides one model, forbidding financial institutions from considering a customer\u2019s participation in \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion training.\u201d",
      "Republican lawmakers are expected to keep pushing for restrictions on the rights of transgender people, particularly transgender minors.",
      "More than 30 such bills have been proposed in Texas. Although Texas and other states have bans on gender-affirming care for transgender minors, there are calls to go further, such as barring Medicaid and other state-funded government programs from spending on gender-affirming care for people of any age.",
      "In his campaign last year, Trump leaned into attacks on transgender rights, suggesting a looming shift in federal policy.",
      "The future of some of the measures could rest on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling expected this year on whether Tennessee had the right to ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states already have laws banning or limiting gender-affirming care for minors and participation in women\u2019s and girls sports for transgender women and girls. Several also dictate which school restrooms transgender people may use.",
      "With an incoming presidential administration that has indicated fluoride and vaccines might be in its crosshairs, lawmakers in a few states have filed bills that would end fluoridation programs and further restrict COVID-19 mandates.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary-nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer with no medical or public health degrees, has called fluoride an \u201cindustrial waste\u201d and said in a Nov. 2 post on X that the Trump administration would \u201cadvise all U.S. water systems\u201d to stop putting fluoride in the water. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century because it prevents tooth decay.",
      "Arkansas lawmakers have filed bills to repeal a statewide fluoridation program and allow local public water systems to hold elections so residents can decide whether to put fluoride in the water. Montana also has a proposed bill to \u201d ban the use of fluoride,\u201d though the full text of the bill isn\u2019t available yet.",
      "Vaccination laws and mandates are still in play in state governments, too. Alabama may consider changing its vaccination laws to require parental consent for any vaccine to be given to a minor age 14 or older; currently, children that age can decide whether they want medical services. Wyoming has a bill that would impose a civil penalty of up to $5,000 on a business or entity that gets state or federal money if found to discriminate based on whether someone is wearing a mask, has had a COVID-19 vaccination or has been tested for COVID-19.",
      "It\u2019s not clear whether these or other bills will get consideration.",

      "Three years later, the mood between Crowley and City Hall has changed.",
      "The wildfire in Pacific Palisades that has burned more than 5,000 structures to become the most destructive in city history has put leaders on the defensive and led Crowley to engage in a public spat with Mayor Karen Bass over resources even as the battle against flames continues across the Los Angeles area.",
      "Crowley publicly criticized the city Friday for budget cuts that she said have made it harder for firefighters to do their jobs at a time when they are seeing more calls. She also cast blame on the city for water running out Tuesday when about 20% of the hydrants tapped to fight the Palisades fire went dry.",
      "\u201cI'm not a politician, I\u2019m a public servant. It\u2019s my job as the fire chief for Los Angeles city fire dept to make sure our firefighters have exactly what they need to do their jobs,\u201d she told CNN.",
      "Her comments and perceived falling-out with Bass prompted so much speculation about her job security that the union issued a statement Friday assuring rank-and-file members that she had not been fired.",
      "The following day the mayor sought to tamp down the tension.",
      "\u201cLet me be clear about something: The fire chief and I are focused on fighting these fires and saving lives, and any differences that we might have will be worked out in private,\u201d Bass said at a news conference. \u201cBut right now our first and most important obligation to Angelenos is to get through this crisis.\u201d",
      "This followed several days of Crowley getting swept into the national political fray over diversity, equity and inclusion policies that conservatives believe have gone too far in American institutions. Crowley, who is openly gay and the city\u2019s first female fire chief, has made diversifying the overwhelmingly male department a priority.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing (was) largely preventable,\u201d talk show host Megyn Kelly said on her show. \u201cLA\u2019s fire chief has made not filling the fire hydrants top priority, but diversity.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no evidence that Crowley\u2019s efforts to diversify the department have hampered the fight. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is in charge of providing water for the hydrants, and its leaders have said they were overwhelmed by the intense demand on a municipal system not designed to fight wildfires, particularly as firefighting aircraft was grounded. Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered an investigation into what happened, and Crowley herself added to the criticism.",
      "\u201cWhen a firefighter comes up to a hydrant, we expect there's going to be water,\u201d she said during a local news interview.",
      "Philadelphia Managing Director Adam K. Thiel, who previously served as that city\u2019s fire commissioner, suggested that people reserve judgment until the fires can be investigated. He noted that firefighters cannot control the weather, a key factor in battling wildfires.",
      "\u201cFirefighting, to a regular person, probably appears to be a relatively simple process of putting water on a fire,\u201d said Thiel, who knows Crowley and praised her experience. \u201cIn reality every firefighting operation, in any environment, is inherently volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous.\u201d",
      "Former Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti appointed Crowley to the job amid complaints about a frat house culture in the department that was sometimes hostile to women and minorities. Several lawsuits alleged hazing and harassment, and federal investigators found evidence of discrimination.",
      "At the time Crowley was sworn in, women accounted for just 3.5 percent of the uniformed membership, a figure that\u2019s not unusual for a department. A survey found that half the uniformed women in the department \u2014 along with 40% of Blacks, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders \u2014 felt harassment was a problem.",
      "Crowley, whose wife is a retired firefighter, told the Los Angeles Times in 2022 that she planned to ensure all of employees \u201ccome to work and feel safe and feel heard.\u201d",
      "Two years later, she was facing budget cuts that she warned could hamper the department's ability to respond to emergencies, including wildfires. She highlighted the elimination of civilian positions and $7 million in overtime pay.",
      "The reduction in overtime has limited the department\u2019s ability to prepare and train for \u201clarge scale emergencies,\u201d such as wildfires and earthquakes, Crowley said, and programs like air operations. The department has also lost mechanics, leading to delays in repairing the vehicle fleet, she said.",
      "Other city officials say the department's budget was later boosted, but it's unclear how much of that went to firefighting resources. Bass has said the department has the resources needed to do its job and she will address specifics once the crisis subsides.",
      "Crowley, who grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, came to firefighting after what she called \u201ca really unique journey.\u201d",
      "A high school and college athlete, she studied biology at Saint Mary\u2019s College in Notre Dame, Indiana, with plans to become an orthopedic surgeon. Two weeks after graduation, she moved to California.",
      "A stint as a paramedic changed her career path. She did an internship with the fire department and was hooked.",
      "\u201cThat was it,\u201d she told WBAY-TV in Green Bay in March 2022. \u201cWithin a few seconds of me entering into the fire station, it was just such a wonderful connection to what I had being a student-athlete for the majority of my life, and I tell you, it was a perfect fit.\u201d",
      "Crowley has now been with the department for a quarter century, serving in nearly every role, including fire marshal, engineer and battalion chief. Garcetti had described Crowley as not only a trailblazer but the most qualified person.",
      "\u201cThe protection of our city first and foremost has to go to the human being who is best prepared to lead. But let me be clear, that is Kristin Crowley,\u201d he said.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A Florida state agency is suing a company owned by the family of U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, saying the company overcharged the state by nearly $5.8 million for work done during the pandemic and won't give the money back.",
      "The lawsuit comes at the same time that a congressional ethics investigation concluded the South Florida Democrat may have violated U.S. House rules and federal law with her campaign activities and how she has used her congressional office. The House Ethics Committee hasn't acted on the report.",
      "The lawsuit was filed Dec. 30 in state court in Tallahassee by the Florida Division of Emergency Management. The agency claims that it made a series of overpayments to Trinity Healthcare Services, based in Miramar, after hiring Trinity in 2021 to register people for COVID-19 vaccinations. The agency says it discovered the problem after a single $5 million overpayment drew attention.",
      "\u201cTrinity took advantage of the state of emergency the entire country was encountering due to the COVID-19 pandemic and knowingly processed an invoice more than 100 times its typical invoice size,\" the suit says.",
      "Lawyer Gabriel Imperato, who represents the company, declined to comment on the lawsuit when contacted by the Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale.",
      "Cherfilus-McCormick was the CEO of Trinity at the time. She was elected to Congress in 2022 in the 20th District representing parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties in a special election after Rep. Alcee Hastings died in 2021. Cherfilus-McCormick won the primary in the heavily Democratic district by five votes. She was reelected without opposition in November.",
      "In a report from the Office of Congressional Ethics released on Jan. 2, the agency found that Cherfilus-McCormick's income in 2021 was more than $6 million higher than in 2020, driven by nearly $5.75 million in consulting and profit-sharing fees received from Trinity Healthcare Services. The House Ethics Committee hasn't acted on the report.",
      "During the 2021-2022 campaign cycle, Cherfilus-McCormick reported loaning her campaign millions of dollars.",
      "The ethics report found that there was reason to believe that Cherfilus-McCormick made nearly $270,000 in unreported payments to a Florida state political action committee in 2021 and 2022 for campaign work. The report found that Cherfilus-McCormick may have also improperly accepted in-kind contributions.",
      "The report also found that Mark Goodrich, whom the report described as Cherfilus-McCormick's campaign manager, improperly produced videos and mailers that Cherfilus-McCormick sent out using her congressional office.",
      "Cherfilus-McCormick has said the report doesn't mean she has done anything wrong."

      "After he was found in contempt twice in one week, Rudy Giuliani faces another treacherous week ahead at a trial to determine whether his Florida condominium and three World Series rings must be turned over to two Georgia election workers",
      "NEW YORK -- After he was found in contempt twice in one week, Rudy Giuliani faces another potentially treacherous week ahead at a trial to determine whether his Florida condominium and three World Series rings must be turned over to two Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation award against him.",
      "The former New York City mayor was found in contempt on Friday by a Washington judge for repeating false claims that the workers corruptly counted votes in the 2020 presidential election. Last Monday, a New York judge found him in contempt for failing to adequately turn over evidence about his assets.",
      "On Thursday, Giuliani, 80, faces trial in New York over whether he can keep his Palm Beach, Florida, condominium, which he asserts he established as his permanent residence a year ago, and whether he must turn over three World Series rings that he says he gave to his son in 2018.",
      "Judge Lewis J. Liman, who will preside over the juryless trial in Manhattan federal court, is the same jurist who found Giuliani in contempt last Monday.",
      "With his contempt order, Liman made rulings setting Giuliani back in the upcoming trial. He said Giuliani cannot offer testimony about texts or emails to show that he moved his residence to Florida since he failed to turn over any texts or emails as part of the pretrial exchange of evidence between lawyers.",
      "Liman said he can also make adverse inferences about \u201cgaps\u201d in evidence resulting from Giuliani\u2019s failure to turn over materials, including by rejecting any claims that Giuliani changed his professional services, such as doctors and lawyers, to individuals practicing in Florida after Jan. 1, 2024.",
      "Giuliani has conceded that he sometimes did not turn over everything requested in the case because he believed what was being sought was overly broad, inappropriate or even a \u201ctrap\u201d set by lawyers for the plaintiffs.",
      "A request for comment Saturday was sent to a spokesperson for the former private attorney to President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "At a November hearing, Giuliani said he was \u201cnot impoverished,\u201d but his assets were tied up because of multiple legal proceedings he faces in several states.",
      "Liman also issued an order several days ago asking all sides to describe whether the World Series rings Giuliani purchased from the New York Yankees should be stored with the court for safekeeping until it can be decided who will get them.",
      "Lawyers for Andrew Giuliani said the rings are safely located in the bedroom closet of his New York City residence in a doorman building.",
      "The judge raised the possibility of the court keeping the rings after Giuliani testified last Monday that he doesn't know what happened to a valuable signed Joe DiMaggio baseball jersey after he last saw it at his Manhattan apartment about four months ago.",
      "Following the testimony, lawyers for the election workers submitted written arguments to refute the claims that Giuliani gave the rings to his son in 2018. They noted, for instance, that Giuliani's bankruptcy submission in 2023 listed the rings among his property.",
      "The Florida property and World Series rings are the primary assets still in dispute from a portfolio of Giuliani assets that was estimated to exceed $10 million. The Palm Beach condominium is believed to be worth more than $3 million.",
      "He has already given up assets including a New York City apartment worth about $5 million, a 1980 Mercedes once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall and numerous luxury watches and other belongings.",
      "The Georgia election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss, won the defamation judgment against Giuliani after saying his lies about the 2020 presidential election being stolen led to death threats that made them fear for their lives."

      "Market jitters over the past week have increased concerns over the government's economic strategy.",

      "Some experts say investors are reacting to the re-election of former US President Donald Trump and his talk of tariffs.",
      "There is concern this will lead to inflation being more persistent than previously thought, and therefore interest rates will not come down as quickly as expected, both in the US and elsewhere.",
      "Strong US jobs data released on Friday added to expectations that US rates will stay higher for longer, and this has helped to strengthen the value of the dollar against other currencies.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence presents a \"vast potential\" for rejuvenating UK public services, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said on Monday.",
      "In a speech setting out the government's plans to use AI across the UK to boost growth and deliver services more efficiently, Sir Keir said the government had a responsibility to make AI \"work for working people\".",
      "The AI Opportunities Action Plan is backed by leading tech firms, some of which have committed \u00a314bn towards various projects, creating 13,250 jobs, the government said.",
      "But the government faces questions over how much time and money will be needed to make its vision a reality, amid concerns over borrowing costs and the falling value of the pound.",
      "The plan includes proposals for growth zones where development will be focused, and suggests the technology will be used to help tackle issues such as potholes.",
      "While estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) support the claim that AI could increase productivity, it also says the changes may come gradually.",
      "The government tasked AI adviser Matt Clifford with creating a UK action plan for supporting the growth of artificial intelligence and its use in public services.",
      "He came back with 50 recommendations which are now being implemented.",
      "Among these is for the UK to invest in a new supercomputer to boost computing power - marking a change in strategy after the Labour government ditched the previous government's plans for a supercomputer at Edinburgh University.",
      "Sir Keir said AI \"will drive incredible change\" in the country and \"has the potential to transform the lives of working people\".",
      "\"We're going to make AI work for everyone in our country,\" he added, saying the \"battle for the jobs of tomorrow is happening today\".",
      "Sir Keir said the UK would become one of the AI \"superpowers\" - mirroring former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's drive to boost the UK sector so it could rival that of the US and China.",
      "At the time, many of Sunak's proposals were geared towards mitigating future risks of highly powerful AI systems.",
      "In October 2023, he said AI could enable faster, easier production of chemical and biological weapons, or be used by terrorist groups to spread disinformation.",
      "He added that in a worst-case scenario, society could lose control over AI.",
      "His government's emphasis on \"safety\" seems largely absent in this new plan  - instead focusing on maximising opportunities, growth and innovation.",
      "The pivot away from the previous narrative of caution and safety suggests the government has decided the UK should attempt to compete in the AI arms race, currently lead by major global players including the US and China.",
      "However, building data centres and boosting the nation's computing power will not happen overnight.",
      "This means the government is unlikely to see the end results of this major project ahead of the next general election - when Labour will have to convince voters that it was still the right decision, at a time when public finances remain stretched.",
      "Professor Dame Wendy Hall said the proposals were \"ambitious\", but necessary to help the UK keep up with the pace of development.",
      "\"It's an ambitious plan but there's a lot of upfront investment,\" she told BBC Radio Four's Today programme.",

      "AI will be used by the public sector to enable its workers to spend less time doing admin and more time delivering services.Several \"AI Growth Zones\" around the UK will be created, involving big building projects and new jobs.AI will be fed through cameras around the country to inspect roads and spot potholes that need fixing Teachers and small business owners were highlighted as two groups that could start using AI for things like faster planning and record-keeping.AI is already being used in UK hospitals for important tasks such as diagnosing cancer more quickly and it will continue to be used to support the NHS.",

      "While the push towards AI is seen as way of cutting down on public spending, Mak accused Labour of undermining this goal with its economic policies.",
      "\"Labour's economic mismanagement and uninspiring plan will mean Britain is left behind,\" he said.",
      "Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle told the BBC there was no reason why the UK could not create tech companies on the same scale as Google, Amazon, and Apple.",

      "He highlighted DeepMind, which created technology enabling computers to play video and board games, as an example of a former British-born company that was now US-owned.",
      "It was founded by three University College London students before its acquisition by Google.",
      "Tim Flagg, chief operating officer of UKAI - a trade body representing British AI businesses - said the proposals take a \"narrow view\" of the sector's contributors and focus too much on big tech.",
      "\"AI innovation spans industries, from small enterprises to non-tech sectors, all driving the new industrial revolution,\" he said.",
      "\"It's time the government recognised this broader definition and tapped into the full potential of AI across the UK.\"",
      "What is AI and how does it work?",
      "Is AI the answer for better government services?",
      "AI 'not perfect'",

    "summary": "Should more AI be used to help GPs with consultations and administrative work?",
    "story": [
      "This is the fifth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "The difficulty of getting an appointment with a GP is a familiar gripe in the UK.",
      "Even when an appointment is secured, the rising workload faced by doctors means those meetings can be shorter than either the doctor or patient would like.",
      "But Dr Deepali Misra-Sharp, a GP partner in Birmingham, has found that AI has alleviated a chunk of the administration from her job, meaning she can focus more on patients.",
      "Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference.",
      "\u201cUsually when I\u2019m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.\u201d",
      "She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her \u201ctwo to three minutes per consultation, if not more\u201d. She reels off other benefits: \u201cIt reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.\"",
      "With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure.",
      "A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015, according to the British Medical Association (BMA).",
      "Could AI be the solution to help GP\u2019s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout?",
      "Some research suggests it could. A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time.",
      "Meanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.",
      "One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.",
      "Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.",
      "\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.",
      "\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.",
      "\u201cI imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It\u2019s giving that colleague advice.\u201d",
      "He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. \u201cIt could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?\u201d",
      "But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?",
      "Mr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.",
      "\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d",
      "Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.",
      "\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.",
      "The AI is trained on published medical research papers.",
      "\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d",
      "She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.",
      "An AI report published by the BMA this year found that \u201cAI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency\u201d.",
      "In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.",
      "\"Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.\u201d",
      "How AI uncovers new ways to tackle difficult diseases",
      "AI is trained to spot warning signs in blood tests",
      "Could AI help prevent diabetes-related sight loss?",
      "Why 'digital twins' could speed up drug discovery",
      "Alison Dennis, partner and co-head of law firm Taylor Wessing's international life sciences team, warns that GPs need to tread carefully when using AI.",
      "\"There is the very high risk of generative AI tools not providing full and complete, or correct diagnoses or treatment pathways, and even giving wrong diagnoses or treatment pathways i.e. producing hallucinations or basing outputs on clinically incorrect training data,\u201d says Ms Dennis.",
      "\u201cAI tools that have been trained on reliable data sets and then fully validated for clinical use \u2013 which will almost certainly be a specific clinical use, are more suitable in clinical practice.\u201d",
      "She says specialist medical products must be regulated and receive some form of official accreditation.",
      "\u201cThe NHS would also want to ensure that all data that is inputted into the tool is retained securely within the NHS system infrastructure, and is not absorbed for further use by the provider of the tool as training data without the appropriate GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] safeguards in place.\"",
      "For now, for GPs like Misra-Sharp, it has transformed their work. \u201cIt has made me go back to enjoying my consultations again instead of feeling time pressured.\u201d"

    "summary": "Workers making clothes for the fast fashion giant tell the BBC they labour for up to 75 hours a week.",
    "story": [
      "The hum of sewing machines is a constant in parts of Guangzhou, a thriving port on the Pearl River in southern China.",
      "It rattles through the open windows of factories from morning until late at night, as they finish the t-shirts, shorts, blouses, pants and swimwear that will be shipped to fill wardrobes in more than 150 countries.",
      "This is the sound of Panyu, the neighbourhood known as the \"Shein village\", a warren of factories that power the world's largest fast fashion retailer.",
      "\"If there are 31 days in a month, I will work 31 days,\" one worker told the BBC.",
      "Most said they only have one day off a month.",
      "The BBC spent several days here: we visited 10 factories, spoke to four owners and more than 20 workers. We also spent time at labour markets and textile suppliers.",
      "We found that the beating heart of this empire is a workforce sitting behind sewing machines for around 75 hours a week in contravention of Chinese labour laws.",
      "These hours are not unusual in Guangzhou, an industrial hub for rural workers in search of a higher income; or in China, which has long been the world's unrivalled factory.",
      "But they add to a growing list of questions about Shein, once a little-known Chinese-founded company that has become a global behemoth in just over five years.",
      "Still privately-owned, it was valued at about \u00a354bn ($66bn) in a fundraising round in 2023. It is now eyeing a potential listing on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "Its meteoric rise, however, has been dogged with controversy about its treatment of workers and allegations of forced labour.",
      "Last year it admitted to finding children working in its factories in China.",
      "The company declined to be interviewed but told the BBC in a statement that \"Shein is committed to ensuring the fair and dignified treatment of all workers within our supply chain\" and is investing tens of millions of dollars in strengthening governance and compliance.",
      "It added: \"We strive to set the highest standards for pay and we require that all supply chain partners adhere to our code of conduct. Furthermore, Shein works with auditors to ensure compliance.\"",
      "Shein's success lies in volume - the inventory online runs into the hundreds of thousands - and deep discounts: \u00a310 dresses, \u00a36 sweaters, prices that hover below \u00a38 on average.",
      "Revenue has soared, outstripping the likes of H&M, Zara and the UK's Primark. The cut-price sales are driven by places like the Shein village, home to some 5,000 factories, most of them Shein suppliers.",
      "The buildings have been hollowed out to make way for sewing machines, rolls of fabric and bags brimming with cloth scraps. The doors to their basements are always open for the seemingly endless cycle of deliveries and collections.",
      "As the day passes, the shelves fill up with warehouse-bound, clear plastic bags labelled with a now-distinctive five-letter noun.",
      "But even past 22:00, the sewing machines - and the people hunched over them - don't stop as more fabric arrives, in trucks so full that bolts of colour sometimes tumble onto the factory floor.",
      "\"We usually work, 10, 11 or 12 hours a day,\" says a 49-year-old woman from Jiangxi unwilling to give her name. \"On Sundays we work around three hours less.\"",
      "She is in an alleyway, where a dozen people are huddled around a row of bulletin boards.",
      "They are reading the job ads on the board, while examining the stitching on a pair of chinos draped over it.",
      "This is Shein's supply chain. The factories are contracted to make clothes on order - some small, some big. If the chinos are a hit, orders will ramp up and so must production. Factories then hire temporary workers to meet the demand their permanent staff cannot fulfil.",
      "The migrant worker from Jiangxi is looking for a short-term contract - and the chinos are an option.",
      "\"We earn so little. The cost of living is now so high,\" she says, adding that she hopes to make enough to send back to her two children who are living with their grandparents.",
      "\"We get paid per piece,\" she explains. \"It depends how difficult the item is. Something simple like a t-shirt is one-two yuan [less than a dollar] per piece and I can make around a dozen in an hour.\"",
      "Examining the stitching on the chinos is crucial for making that decision. All around her, workers are calculating how much they will get paid to make each piece of clothing and how many they can make in an hour.",
      "The alleys of Panyu function as labour markets, filling up in the mornings as workers and scooters rush past the breakfast dumpling cart, the cups of steaming soybean milk and the hopeful farmer selling chicken and duck eggs.",
      "Standard working hours appear to be from 08:00 to well past 22:00, the BBC found.",
      "This is consistent with a report from the Swiss advocacy group Public Eye, which was based on interviews with 13 textile workers at factories producing clothes for Shein.",
      "They found that a number of staff were working excessive overtime. It noted the basic wage without overtime was 2,400 yuan (\u00a3265; $327) - below the 6,512 yuan the Asia Floor Wage Alliance says is needed for a \"living wage\". But the workers we spoke to managed to earn anywhere between 4,000 and 10,000 yuan a month.",
      "\"These hours are not unusual, but it's clear that it's illegal and it violates basic human rights,\" said David Hachfield from the group. \"It's an extreme form of exploitation and this needs to be visible.\"",
      "The average working week should not exceed 44 hours, according to Chinese labour laws, which also state that employers should ensure workers have at least one rest day a week. If an employer wants to extend these hours, it should be for special reasons.",
      "While Shein's headquarters are now in Singapore, there is no denying the majority of its products are made in China.",
      "And Shein's success has drawn the attention of Washington, which is increasingly wary of Chinese firms.",
      "In June, Donald Trump's pick for US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, said he had  \"grave ethics concerns\" about Shein's \"deep ties to the People's Republic of China\": \"Slave labour, sweatshops, and trade tricks are the dirty secrets behind Shein's success,\" he wrote.",
      "Not everyone would agree with Rubio's choice of words to describe the conditions at Shein's suppliers. But rights groups say that the long working hours, which have become a way of life for many in Guangzhou, are unfair and exploitative.",
      "The machines dictate the rhythm of the day.",
      "They pause for lunch and dinner when the workers, metal plates and chopsticks in hand, file into the canteen to buy food. If there is no more space to sit, they stand in the street.",
      "\"I've been working in these factories for more than 40 years,\" said one woman who spent just 20 minutes eating her meal. This was just another day for her.",
      "Inside, the factories we visit are not cramped. There is enough light and industrial-sized fans have been brought in to keep workers cool. Huge posters urge staff to report underage workers - likely a response to finding two cases of child labour in the supply chain last year.",
      "The BBC understands that the company is keeping a closer eye on its suppliers ahead of plans to go public on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "\"This is about their reputation,\" says Sheng Lu, a professor in Fashion and Apparel Studies at the University of Delaware. \"If Shein can successfully achieve an IPO then it means they are recognised as a decent company. But if they are to keep the confidence of investors, they have to take some responsibility.\"",
      "One of the biggest challenges Shein faces is accusations that it sources cotton from China's Xinjiang region.",
      "Once touted as among the world's best fabric, Xinjiang's cotton has fallen out of favour after allegations that it is produced using forced labour by people from the Muslim Uyghur minority - a charge that Beijing has consistently denied.",
      "The only way to get around this criticism is to be more transparent, Prof Sheng says.",
      "\"Unless you fully release your factory list, unless you make your supply chain more transparent to the public, then I think it's going to be very challenging for Shein.\"",
      "A major advantage, he adds, is that Shein's supply chain is in China: \"Very few countries have a complete supply chain. China has this - and nobody can compete.\"",
      "Aspiring rivals like Vietnam and Bangladesh import raw materials from China to make clothes. But Chinese factories rely entirely on local sources for everything, from fabric to zippers and buttons. So it's easy to make a variety of garments, and they are able to do it quickly.",
      "That especially works for Shein whose algorithm determines orders. If shoppers repeatedly click on a certain dress, or spend longer looking at a wool sweater, the firm knows to ask factories to make more - and fast.",

      "On Saturday, Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life at 14 after seeing harmful content online, said the UK was \"going backwards\" on the issue.",
      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",
      "The Conservative government had originally included in the legislation plans to compel social media companies to remove some \"legal-but-harmful\" content, such as posts promoting eating disorders.",
      "However the proposal triggered a backlash from critics, including the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who were concerned it could lead to censorship.",

      "The plan was dropped for adult social media users and instead companies were required to give users more control to filter out content they did not want to see. The law still expects companies to protect children from legal-but-harmful content.",

      "He accused Zuckerberg of moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\" and \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to\".",
      "Earlier this week, Zuckerberg said Meta would be getting rid of fact checkers, and instead adopt a system \u2013 already introduced by X - of allowing users to add \"community notes\" to social media posts they deemed to be untrue.",
      "This marked a change from Meta's previous approach, introduced in 2016, whereby third party moderators would check posts on Facebook and Instagram that appeared to be false or misleading.",
      "Content flagged as inaccurate would be moved lower in users' feeds and accompanied by labels offering viewers more information on the subject.",
      "Defending the new system, Zuckerberg said moderators were \"too politically biased\" and it was \"time to get back to our roots around free expression\".",
      "The step comes as Meta seeks to improve relations with incoming US President Donald Trump who has previously accused the company of censoring right-wing voices.",

      "Asked about the change, Kyle said the announcement was \"an American statement for American service users\" adding: \"There is one thing that has not changed and that is the law of this land.\"",
      "\"If you come and operate in this country you abide by the law, and the law says illegal content must be taken down,\" he said.",
      "Rules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force later this year, compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide.",
      "The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography, material promoting self-harm, bullying and content encouraging dangerous stunts.",
      "Platforms will be expected to adopt \"age assurance technologies\" to prevent children from seeing harmful content.",
      "The law also requires companies to take action against illegal, state-sponsored disinformation. If their services are likely to be accessed by children they should also take steps to protect users against misinformation."

      "Government borrowing costs have hit their highest level in 16 years and the pound has fallen to a 14-month low against the dollar.",
      "She has gone on a planned trip to China amid accusations from opposition parties that she is leaving at a moment of economic peril.",
      "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is accompanying her on the trip. The 12-hour flight to Beijing is probably the length of the meeting she might have wanted to have with him.",
      "So how serious are the recent movements on the markets and what could happen as a result?",
      "Budget plans need to be tweaked",
      "While the markets stabilised from Thursday lunchtime, the move against UK government debt is already enough to cause a problem for the chancellor's Budget maths.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament. The Treasury has said these fiscal rules, set out in the Budget, are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "At times over the past week the markets have looked pretty fragile for Britain, with both government borrowing costs going up and sterling falling back at the same time. That is a key marker.",
      "While it's true that the overall direction for the markets over the past month has been set by an assessment of the inflationary consequences of President-elect Trump's trade and economic policies, the UK has been getting some special attention in addition.",
      "It risks being tarred with both the inflationary stickiness of the US, and the stagnant growth of the eurozone - the worst of both worlds.",
      "That said, it is important to be precise about the extent of the problem. The extra cost of servicing the national debt at these interest rates would be several billion pounds a year - i.e. material enough to require some sort of correction in the Budget maths, but doable, and the clear message this week is that \"it will be done\".",
      "No impact on mortgages so far",
      "The impact on budgetary maths is real, but the wider impact that might be expected - of higher borrowing costs for companies and for households - has not yet materialised.",
      "The mortgage market has yet to see an increase in rates for fixed-term mortgages, as occurred rapidly in the panic after the 2022 mini-Budget. There is a curious calm.",
      "One explanation lies in what is not happening. This time last year the major lenders greatly discounted mortgages in a battle for market share ahead of the key moments for house buying. This has not happened this year, and may yet have a consequence in the property market.",
      "The Bank of England has indicated it will continue with interest rate cuts this year. The markets think there may be far fewer than previously expected, perhaps only one, leaving base interest rates at 4.5%.",
      "Many economists say this is the wrong call, and believe rates will be cut multiple times. There's quite a lot of uncertainty here, and the key Bank of England committee is split. The Bank's words will be very carefully watched.",
      "More positively for the economy, despite a lot of rhetoric from retailers, many have delivered strong results and have not lowered their profits expectations. Are consumers a bit more robust than had been assumed, and could this drive some growth in 2025?",

      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Growth strategy needs a reboot",
      "The problem of servicing higher interest payments on the national debt increases the likelihood of the Treasury making plans for an adjustment, based on a squeeze on spending. A \u00a310bn cut will hurt, but with a majority of 170 MPs in the House of Commons, and an ongoing spending review already in train, it can be done.",
      "In these circumstances, with the credible threat of a global trade war, for example, it should be noted that Rachel Reeves' new fiscal rules do have an escape hatch.",
      "In the event of \"an emergency or a significant negative economic shock to the economy\" the chancellor may \"temporarily suspend the fiscal mandate\".",
      "While a global trade war could qualify, it would be difficult optics to suspend a \"non-negotiable\" and \"iron-clad\" set of rules before they had really bitten. The rules have not yet formally passed into law yet either, and remain a \"draft\" until the Commons votes to approve them.",
      "It seems very unlikely that this route will be taken unless there is a very clear economic shock in the coming weeks.",
      "The bigger point here is what matters in the markets, which is whether the UK is pursuing a credible set of policies, a convincing overall strategy.",
      "Labour's focus on stability at all costs was understandable after the humiliation of Liz Truss's mini-Budget. But \"stability\" is not a growth strategy.",
      "Pursuing green growth by borrowing for long-term capital investment is a potential strategy, and it underpinned \"Bidenomics\" in the US. The incoming government embraced the rhetoric of US policy under the outgoing president, without the same firepower. \"Bidenomics without the money\", you might say.",

      "China has been accused of subjecting members of the Uighur, a mainly Muslim ethnic minority, to forced labour. In December 2020, research seen by the BBC showed that up to half a million people were being forced to pick cotton in Xinjiang, but Beijing has denied any rights abuses.",
      "The allegations have led to some big fashion brands, including H&M, Nike, Burberry and Adidas, removing products using Xinjiang cotton, which has led to a backlash in China, and boycotts of the companies.",
      "In his letter to the LSE, Byrne, a Labour MP, said: \"The committee was profoundly concerned at the lack of candid and open answers to some extremely simple, basic questions about the integrity of Shein's supply chain.",

      "The government said it was \"confident the UK has enough natural gas supplies to make it through the winter\".",
      "Hydrogen push",
      "Gas inventory levels have come under pressure from the cold weather conditions and the end of Russian gas pipeline supplies through Ukraine at the end of last month.",
      "The UK has relatively little capacity to store gas, but has more than it did compared with a few years ago.",
      "About half of the capacity it has is at Centrica's Rough facility off the coast of East Yorkshire.",
      "This was closed in 2017, but then partly reopened in October 2022 following the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "There is also LNG storage at three terminals, and other smaller facilities across the country.",
      "If the UK needed more gas, traders would have access to EU stocks, provided they paid the right price.",
      "Centrica wants to invest \u00a32bn in the Rough facility, so it can use it to store more gas, then hydrogen as the UK starts to burn less natural gas to meet green targets.",

      "Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.",
      "Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.",
      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",
      "\"That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,\" says Dr Meier. The next \u2013 and \"even bigger milestone\" \u2013 will be when they start to come out the other end.",
      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",
      "Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.",
      "To help to do that, last year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.",
      "It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.",
      "It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.",
      "Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.",
      "When that happens, says Dr Gibson, \"it'll be obvious to the world that this is the way to go\"."

    "published": "Thu, 09 Jan 2025 01:29:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's planned tariffs are expected to greatly impact international trade in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation, interest rates and tariffs mean 2025 is shaping up to be an intriguing year for the global economy. One in which growth is expected to remain at a \"stable yet underwhelming\" 3.2%, according to the International Monetary Fund. So what might that mean for all of us?",
      "Exactly a week before Christmas there was a welcome gift for millions of American borrowers - a third interest rate cut in a row.",
      "However, stock markets fell sharply because the world's most powerful central banker, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, made clear they shouldn't expect as many further cuts in 2025 as they might have hoped for, as the battle against inflation continues.",
      "\"From here, it's a new phase, and we're going to be cautious about further cuts,\" he said.",
      "In recent years, the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine have led to sharp price rises around the world, and although prices are still increasing the pace has slowed markedly.",
      "Despite that, November saw inflation push up in the US, eurozone and UK to to 2.7%, 2.2% and 2.6% respectively. It highlights the difficulties many central banks face in the so-called \"last mile\" of their battle against inflation. Their target is 2%, and it might be easier to achieve if economies are growing.",
      "However, the biggest difficulty for global growth \"is uncertainty, and the uncertainty is coming from what may come out of the US under Trump 2.0\", says Luis Oganes, who is head of global macro research at investment bank JP Morgan.",
      "Since Donald Trump won November's election he's continued to threaten new tariffs against key US trading partners, China, Canada and Mexico.",
      "\"The US is going into a more isolationist policy stance, raising tariffs, trying to provide more effective protection to US manufacturing,\" says Mr Oganes.",
      "\"And even though that is going to support US growth, at least in the short term, certainly it's going to hurt many countries that rely on trade with the US.\"",
      "New tariffs \"could be particularly devastating\" for Mexico and Canada, but also be \"harmful\" to the US, according to Maurice Obstfeld, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and a previous economic advisor to President Obama.",
      "He cites car manufacturing as an example of an industry that \"depends on a supply chain that is spread across the three countries. If you disrupt that supply chain, you have massive disruptions in the auto market\".",
      "That has the potential to push up prices, reduce demand for products, and hurt company profits, which could in turn drag down investment levels, he explains.",
      "Mr Obstfeld, who is now with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, adds: \"Introducing these types of tariffs into a world that is heavily dependent on trade could be harmful to growth, could throw the world into recession.\"",
      "The tariffs threats have also played a role in forcing the resignation of Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "Even though the majority of what the US and China sell each other is already subject to tariffs from Donald Trump's first term in office, the threat of new tariffs is a key challenge for the world's second-biggest economy in the year ahead.",
      "In his new year address President Xi Jinping acknowledged the \"challenges of uncertainties in the external environment\", but said the economy was on \"an upward trajectory\".",
      "Exports of cheap goods from its factories are crucial to China's economy. A drop off in demand because tariffs push prices up would compound the many domestic challenges, including weak consumer spending and business investment, that the government is trying to tackle.",
      "Those efforts are helping, according to the World Bank, which at the end of December increased its forecast for China's growth from 4.1% to 4.5% in 2025.",
      "Beijing has yet to set a growth target for 2025, but thinks it's on course for 5% last year.",
      "\"Addressing challenges in the property sector, strengthening social safety nets, and improving local government finances will be essential to unlocking a sustained recovery,\" according to the World Bank's country director for China, Mara Warwick.",
      "Those domestic struggles mean the Chinese government is \"more welcoming\" of foreign investment, according to Michael Hart, who is president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.",
      "Tensions between the US and China, and tariffs have grown under the Biden presidency, meaning some companies have looked to move production elsewhere.",
      "However, Mr Hart points out that \"it took 30 to 40 years for China to emerge as such a strong supplier manufacturer\", and whilst \"companies have tried to mitigate some of those risks... no one's prepared now to completely replace China.\"",
      "One industry that is likely to continue to be at the heart of global trade battles is electric vehicles. More than 10 million were made in China last year, and that dominance led the US, Canada and European Union (EU) to impose tariffs on them.",
      "Beijing says they're unfair, and is challenging them at the World Trade Organization.",
      "However, it's the prospect of Donald Trump imposing tariffs that is concerning the EU.",
      "\"Restrictions on trade, protectionist measures, are not conducive to growth, and ultimately have an impact on inflation that is largely uncertain,\" the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said last month. \"[But] in the short term, it's probably net inflationary.\"",
      "Germany and France are the traditional engines of Europe's economic growth. But their poor performance amid political instability over the past year means that, despite a recent uptick in growth, the eurozone risks losing momentum in the year ahead.",
      "That is, unless consumers spend more and businesses increase their investments.",
      "In the UK higher prices could also come as a result of tax and wage increases, according to one survey.",
      "One barrier to cutting eurozone interest rates is that domestic inflation, which focuses on the prices of items that are less prone to influence from external factors, remains at 4.2%. That's more than double the overall inflation target of 2%, and strong wage pressure has been a barrier getting it down further.",
      "It's been similar in the US according to Sander van 't Noordende, the chief executive of Randstad, the world's biggest recruitment firm.",
      "\"In the US, for instance, [wage inflation] is still going to be around 4% in 2024. In some Western European countries, it's even higher than that.",
      "\"I think there's two factors there. There's the talent scarcity, but there's also, of course, the inflation and people demanding to get more for the work they do.\"",
      "Mr van 't Noordende adds that many companies are passing those extra costs on to their customers, which is adding upward pressure to general inflation.",
      "A slowdown in the global jobs market reflects a lack of \"dynamism\" from companies and economic growth is key to reversing that, he says.",
      "\"If the economy is doing well, businesses are growing, they start hiring. People see interesting opportunities, and you just start seeing people moving around\".",
      "One person starting a new role in 2025 is Donald Trump, and a raft of economic plans including tax cuts and deregulation could help the US economy to continue to thrive.",
      "Whilst much won't be revealed before he's back in the White House on 20 January,  \"everything points to continued US exceptionalism at the expense of the rest of the world,\" says JP Morgan's Mr Oganes.",
      "He's hopeful that inflation and interest rates can continue to come down around the world, but warns that \"a lot of it will depend on what are the policies that get deployed, particularly from the US.\"",

      "The five-piece are currently engaged in a fierce dispute with Ador, the entertainment company that formed their band in 2022.",
      "Last November, the group claimed their contracts were invalid, due to what they alleged was a pattern of bullying, harassment and subterfuge at the company. Ador, which denied the allegations, sued to have their contracts upheld.",
      "The company is now accusing NewJeans of trying to sign independent deals without its approval, and has taken further legal action in Seoul, South Korea.",
      "\"This decision was made to prevent confusion and potential harm to third parties, including advertisers,\" Ador explained in a statement.",

      "In 2023, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world. Last year, they picked up a nomination for best group at the MTV Awards.",
      "But their relationship with Ador soured after its parent company Hybe allegedly  forced out their mentor, Min Hee-Jin.",

      "They subsequently filed court papers seeking a legal separation from the agency, but the case has yet to be heard.",
      "Ador argues that the band's contract, which runs until 2027, should be upheld.",
      "The label has already finalised a schedule for the quintet's next 12 months, which includes releasing a new album and hosting fan meetings, amongst other activities.",
      "However, the band members have continued to assert their independence, creating a new Instagram account under the name \"jeanzforfree\", where they have been hosting regular live-streams with fans.",

      "The popular groups TVXQ and Fifty Fifty have both taken their labels to court - but the cases have had mixed results, and both bands have seen their line-ups change as a result.",

    "story": [
      "Sir Elton John's career-spanning greatest hits collection, Diamonds, has reached number one - after 374 weeks on the charts.",
      "Featuring signature songs like Tiny Dancer, I'm Still Standing and Rocket Man, the 51-track collection has given the star his ninth number one album, at the age of 77.",
      "\"I'm so excited and thrilled that Diamonds is the number one album in the UK this week,\" he said. \"What a great start to the new year. I could not be happier.\"",
      "Originally released in 2017, Diamonds has been a permanent fixture on the charts ever since. It received a sales boost last week after being re-released as a super deluxe edition on Blu-ray, cassette and diamond-effect vinyl.",
      "There has also been a surge in the star's streaming numbers, thanks to the Disney+ documentary Never Too Late, which premiered last month.",
      "Featuring previously unseen footage, it traces the star's journey from jobbing session musician to global superstar, as well as his struggles with addiction, becoming a father and the conclusion of his farewell tour in 2023.",
      "Co-directed by his husband David Furnish, the film was included on the Bafta longlist for best documentary last week.",
      "Diamonds was originally released in 2017 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Sir Elton's songwriting partnership with Bernie Taupin.",
      "The double album has subsequently sold more than 1.5 million copies in the UK, but never managed to climb higher than number two in the charts.",
      "Its ascent to number one was aided by a quiet week for new releases, with no new music entering the Top 10.",
      "According to the Official Charts Company, Diamonds has also spent more consecutive weeks inside Top 40 than any other album in chart history.",
      "Sir Elton's previous number one albums span six decades, starting with 1973's Don't Shoot Me I'm Only The Piano Player. His first greatest hits album topped the charts a year later.",
      "Diamonds isn't the only long-running hits compilation to take up permanent residence in the Top 100.",
      "Highlights, by Canadian star The Weeknd, was the second biggest-selling album of 2024, three years after its debut.",
      "Meanwhile Abba's Gold and Queen's Greatest Hits have both spent more than 1,000 weeks on the album chart.",
      "All of them benefit from the way music streaming is incorporated into the chart calculations - with plays of individual tracks all counting towards the album's overall sales total.",
      "Elsewhere in this week's chart, Sabrina Carpenter's Short N' Sweet takes the number two spot, and SZA's SOS is holding steady at number three.",
      "Gracie Abrams' bittersweet ballad That's So True tops the singles chart for a seventh non-consecutive week, followed by Ros\u00e9 and Bruno Mars with APT at two, and British singer Lola Young with Messy at number three.",

      "Frayne told the audience he started his career performing street magic in City Park, where the opening ceremony was held, and that his home city was \"going to make its mark on the world\" in 2025.",
      "Organisers said about 10,000 people turned out to watch the show, which took place in temperatures of -3C (26.6F).",
      "Bradford is the fourth UK City of Culture, a title that is awarded every four years.",
      "The scheme is designed to boost the chosen city's visitor numbers, economies and reputations, and Bradford's year has received \u00a315m government funding.",
      "Other events will include the Turner Prize, a national drawing project inspired by Bradford-born artist David Hockney, and an exhibition about the parallels between boxing and calligraphy.",
      "Frayne said headlining Friday's opening ceremony \"means more than I could ever put into words\".",
      "\"To be in a place where there's a massive stage put right in the centre for people to come and share in some amazement, that's a dream come true, it genuinely is,\" he told BBC News beforehand.",
      "\"I'm super proud to be from Bradford. It wasn't necessarily the easiest place to grow up... so to be a small, tiny part of this [celebration], it's just incredible.\"",
      "The opening show, titled Rise, involved a cast of 200 including 10-year-old rapper Cruzy T plus poets, musicians and dancers alongside Frayne, with a theme of warts-and-all pride, unity, diversity and overcoming adversity.",
      "On the two stages, scaffold towers formed stacks of boxes containing the performers, as slogans and visuals of the city and its people were projected onto the front.",
      "Projections were also used to transform the towers into Frayne's childhood home, with a young actor playing Frayne as a boy before the real magician enlisted the crowd to take part in a series of tricks.",

      "She hopes this year will give pride to Bradfordians, bring in more investment and show a new side to the city.",
      "\"There's particular press and a particular image of Bradford, which isn't true,\" she said.",
      "\"Every city in the UK has flashpoints, has challenges, and you need to give places space and time in order to navigate and come through them,\" she said.",
      "\"We are more than one flashpoint, we are more than one moment in time, we are more than our challenges - we are also our opportunities.\"",

      "It reopened this week after 18 months and is staging an exhibition of a selection of Hockney's video and photography works. Meanwhile, the Hockney-inspired drawing project will run throughout the year.",
      "Other highlights will include a tribute to Bradford playwright Andrea Dunbar, a season of films by working-class northern women, the installation of a new 15m (50ft) sculpture in the city centre, and an exhibition of striking surrealist photos by Ethiopian photographer Aida Muluneh.",
      "That exhibition will then tour to Cardiff, Belfast and Glasgow, the first time a City of Culture event has travelled to all four nations of the UK.",
      "Gulzar said winning the City of Culture title had also been instrumental in attracting a new Brit School, which has trained stars including Adele and Tom Holland. It is expected to open in 2027.",
      "However, the title has not worked its magic on everything in Bradford's cultural scene.",
      "The former Bradford Odeon, next to the site of Friday's launch event, had been due to reopen as a music venue for the City of Culture year after a \u00a350m refurbishment.",

    "story": [
      "The government has announced plans to cap the price of resale tickets in a clamp-down on ticket touts who bulk buy tickets and then resell them for huge profits.",
      "The cap would apply to tickets in the live events industry including sport, music, comedy and theatre.",
      "It was one of the government's election promises, after complaints from fans and concert-goers about the massively inflated cost of some resale tickets.",
      "A public consultation will now be launched to consider the cap and how much it will be - anywhere from the ticket's face value or up to 30% on top of the original price.",
      "Separately, the government is also putting out a call for evidence on dynamic pricing, which is where the price of tickets rise at times of high demand.",

      "Ministers are also proposing limiting the number of tickets that resellers can sell, to the maximum they are allowed to purchase in the original ticket sale.",
      "They also want to create new legal obligations for ticket resale websites and apps to oversee the accuracy of information they provide to fans - with Trading Standards and the Competition and Marketing Authority responsible for enforcement.",
      "Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said: \"We are taking action to strengthen consumer protections, stop fans getting ripped off and ensure money spent on tickets goes back into our incredible live events sector, instead of into the pockets of greedy touts.\"",
      "She told BBC Breakfast on Friday: \"This has been going on for years, it's been fleecing fans, and we say time is up for ticket touts, enough is enough.",
      "\"I believe that music belongs to fans, and that fans make the music industry what it is... Fans want to buy tickets but they can't, because I don't know anyone in this country that can afford \u00a31,000... for a ticket.\"",
      "She added: \"Touts are distorting the market because what they're doing is taking those tickets away from fans, inflating the prices and selling them on, so they are denying the fans the price that the ticket company has set and the band want to sell the tickets for, and instead all of that money is pouring into [the touts'] pockets.\"",
      "Alongside the consultation, ministers have launched a call for evidence into dynamic pricing - which is says is often used to sell unsold tickets with lower prices but has meant some customers have been caught out paying higher prices for high-demand events.",

      "\"We support proposals to introduce an industry-wide resale price cap. We also urge the government to crack down on bots and ban speculative ticket sales.\"",

      "\"That is why we made recommendations to the previous government to tackle illegal bulk-buying, stop speculative selling and hold platforms accountable for inaccurate ticket information.\"",
      "She said they \"welcome this fresh opportunity to bring in the stronger protections consumers need in this area\".",

      "It pointed to other countries - such as Ireland which banned ticket touting in 2021 - saying it shows \"how legislation to prevent the resale of tickets for profit can massively curb the illegal and anti-consumer practices of online ticket touts and offshore resale platforms. The UK simply needs to follow their example\"."

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:59:47 GMT",
    "summary": "As Love Island All Stars returns, we find out if reality stars can still have a lucrative social media career.",
    "story": [
      "The cast of this year's Love Island All Stars, a spin-off featuring former contestants, has been described as \"dating royalty\" by its makers.",
      "More than half of the 12 islanders heading to the South African villa were finalists on their respective series, while 2022 winner Ekin-Su C\u00fclc\u00fclo\u011flu is also rumoured to be entering later on.",
      "Appearing on Love Island was once seen as a route to independent fame and success.",
      "But could the return of names from some of the show\u2019s most popular series be a sign that the once-profitable pipeline from Islander to influencer or TV star is coming to an end?",
      "Becoming an influencer is a well-worn career path for those leaving Love Island, and past contestants have been paid by brands to sell everything from cosmetics to cars to social media users.",
      "Perhaps the highest achiever in this role has been 2019 series runner-up Molly-Mae Hague, who went on to work as a creative director for fast fashion brand Pretty Little Thing, and has recently launched her own fashion company.",
      "But Molly-Mae appeared on Love Island at the peak of its popularity. The episode in which she and Tommy Fury lost out to winners Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea is still the show's most watched ever, attracting over six million viewers.",
      "Hitting these heights isn't possible for every former cast member, something more recent contestant Tanyel Revan believes aspiring influencers need to be aware of.",
      "\"One thing about this industry that people have to remember is that if you don't maintain it 24/7, which is very hard because it is a bit of a fake lifestyle, you can easily be forgotten,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"I think a lot of influencers go back on All Stars because they need to keep up and have that boost,\" she adds.",
      "Tanyel, 28, appeared on a winter series of the show in 2023, when interest was still high (its final was watched by over a million people), but not at the levels Molly-Mae experienced in 2019.",
      "The hairdresser says while she has earned some \"extra income\" from social media influencing, the haircare company she started before entering the villa is what gives her \"stability\".",
      "\"I am a businesswoman who has got my own salon,\" Tanyel adds.",
      "'It's very saturated'",
      "A lot has changed since Love Island first aired in its current form in 2015. More than 300 people have now appeared on the UK edition of the show - being an ex-Islander is no longer an exclusive club.",
      "For a while, finalists enjoyed rumoured six-figure brand deals with fast fashion companies and sponsored Instagram posts that could earn them thousands.",
      "But according to social media expert and co-founder of Sloane House Marketing, Bryleigh Flack, the appetite for this type of content no longer exists.",
      "\"The way we digest content is completely different to how we did even five years ago,\" she says.",
      "\"There are so many adverts, not even just influencer ads but when you are scrolling, even through your friends' [Instagram] stories, you're hit with them, it's very saturated,\" she says.",
      "Bryleigh says big-brand partnerships used to be the best way to make money, but \"appealing to the masses\" is no longer the best strategy for influencers, thanks to newer platforms like TikTok, which use a different algorithm to choose content for users.",
      "She says there is a new type of content creator in 2025 - the \"micro influencer\" - who may not have loads of followers, but has a really engaged and specific audience.",
      "These creators \"really hone in on their audience and know them\", she adds. \"For example, mums with young families or girls that love to go out every weekend, they're completely different people so trying to market to them both won't work.\"",
      "'Just being good looking is not going to get you much'",
      "Billy Brown, who appeared on series eight of Love Island in 2022, says many of the people he was on the show with saw it as an easy route to becoming an influencer.",
      "\"I know a lot of people who came out, quit their job and thought that's it now, but it's not.",
      "\"You can earn a lot of money from that show but if you don't do well, it's not the case,\" says the 25-year-old, who entered the main villa after impressing fellow contestant Tasha Ghouri in second villa Casa Amor.",
      "Billy, who owns businesses in construction and property development, says that days after leaving the show, he was \"getting up at half four in the morning [for work] and then going to a movie premiere at night\".",
      "\"I didn't let it get to my head, I think I was one of the only people who could say 'look, it's not all glitz and glam',\" he adds.",
      "Billy has maintained a social media presence in the years since, featuring content on his construction work alongside more lifestyle and sports-focused material.",
      "He says he still earns some money from influencing but thinks that's due to his personality, rather than his follower count, a relatively modest 115,000. In contrast, Molly-Mae has over eight million.",
      "\"People [who go on the show] need to focus on what they like, instead of just being known for being on Love Island.",
      "\"You have to have something about you, just being good looking is not going to get you much,\" he adds.",
      "'People would do adverts for every single company'",
      "Love Island's cultural relevance has become a topic of conversation in recent years due to falling viewing figures.",
      "At the show's peak in 2019, it achieved an average of nearly six million viewers, with more recent series in 2023 and 2024 attracting around one to two million.",
      "With the reality TV dating genre's recent boost from Netflix shows such as Love is Blind, The Ultimatum and Too Hot to Handle, audiences now have more options than ever at their disposal.",
      "Jake Lee, who runs Alpha Talent Group, represents stars from across sport, entertainment and social media.",
      "He manages boxer Tommy Fury and sports presenter Mac Griffiths (known as Michael on Love Island), who both appeared on the aforementioned 2019 series of the show.",
      "\"People would come off a show and do adverts for every single company, because these companies would want to take advantage of the quick exposure they could get,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"But four or five months down the line you'd be harming your own career, because you'd used your platform the wrong way and there'd be no credibility there,\" he adds.",
      "Jake says more recent reality TV contestants have learnt a lot from the mistakes of their predecessors, who were leaving shows with no real strategy.",
      "\"My biggest piece of advice is to go in with your eyes wide open,\" he cautions.",

      "Pop star Chappell Roan has won BBC Radio 1's Sound of 2025 \u2013 the station's annual poll to identify music's biggest rising stars.",
      "Her win caps a wild 12 months in which she rocketed from relative obscurity to the top of the charts, thanks to her colourful, 80s-influenced brand of synth-pop.",
      "She was named winner by a panel of more than 180 musicians and experts, including Sir Elton John, Dua Lipa and Sound of 2014 winner Sam Smith.",
      "Jack Saunders, who hosts Radio 1's New Music show, said: \"No one deserves this accolade more than Chappell Roan. She was the most exciting artist of the last 12 months and is now set to be the artist of the next 12 months.\"",
      "An exclusive interview with the singer will be published by Radio 1 and BBC News in the coming weeks.",
      "The 26-year-old has had a long path to success.",
      "Born Kayleigh Amstutz, she was brought up in the conservative city of Willard, Missouri, where she attended church three times a week and was taught that being gay was a sin.",
      "She signed her first record deal in 2017, based on the strength of a song she had uploaded to YouTube called Die Young.",
      "Cast as a singer-songwriter in mould of Lorde and Lana Del Rey, she failed to make much of an impact, and was dropped by her label during the pandemic.",
      "But by that stage, she had already recorded a song that would become her calling card.",
      "Titled Pink Pony Club, it was inspired by a visit to an LA gay club, and helped her define a new sound - camp, liberated and packed with singalong choruses.",
      "The experience also spawned her campy stage persona, which she has described as a \"larger-than-life, drag queen version of myself\".",
      "After finding a new record label, she released her debut album, The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess, in September 2023.",
      "A slow-burning success, it only sold a few thousand copies in its first week of release. But word began to spread - and when she played California's Coachella Festival last April, the crowd that turned up for her mid-afternoon set was huge.",
      "More importantly, the show was broadcast on YouTube - going viral after Roan  leaned into the TV cameras and declared: \"I'm your favourite artist's favourite artist.\" The performance has subsequently been watched more than a million times.",
      "Around the same time, she released a stand-alone single called Good Luck, Babe, that talked about her experience of falling in love with her best friend.",
      "\"It's a pop song with a sad element to it,\" she told BBC News last year.",
      "\"It's very common in queer relationships, when someone is still coming to terms with their queerness, [that] they'll kiss 100 boys to 'stop the feeling', as the song says.",
      "\"And it's like, 'Sure, OK. Your time will come.'\"",
      "The single eventually reached number two in the UK charts, and The Rise And Fall Of The Midwest Princess became a number one album after it was re-released on vinyl last summer.",
      "Since then, Roan has been nominated for six Grammy awards, including album of the year, and won best new artist at the Billboard Music Awards in December.",
      "She has also experienced the downside of her sudden fame, and spoke out about the \"creepy behaviour\" of certain fans who \"yelled\" and \"harassed\" her at private moments; and who had approached her family and friends.",

      "General manager Paul Sarel said it was a \"lovely surprise\" and reminder of how \"some of the most famous bands in the world all squeezed on to this tiny space\".",
      "\"When we posted on social media, we had so many people who said they remembered playing on that stage or seeing some of the most famous bands play on that small area,\" he added.",
      "The New Adelphi opened in the Victorian house in October 1984, but the old stage \u2013 which also hosted bands such as Pulp and The Housemartins \u2013 dates from a time when the venue was home to a social club.",

      "\"That carpet's seen some history,\" Mr Sarel said.",
      "\"It had lots of holes in it. It was stuck down with Sellotape in some places, it was right down to the boards in other places. So we were desperate to make it look a bit better and get something in place for the next 20 years.\"",
      "Staff members and musicians signed their names and left messages on the stage before a new carpet was laid over the top.",

      "\"Fifteen minutes before the gig, I made the horrific mistake of reading the wall backstage,\" he says.",
      "\"They'd put up the names of everyone who'd played there before us. So it was like, 'OK, Beyonc\u00e9 played here, and Jay-Z and Stormzy and Madonna\u2026 And now it's Ezra Collective's turn'.\"",

      "\"There's a lot of things in the world that don't feel real enough, but music shouldn't be one of them.\"",

      "Nearly 400,000 private prescriptions for ADHD medication were issued last year as patients sought to bypass lengthy NHS waiting lists, with people spending millions of pounds on treatment.",
      "Figures obtained by the BBC show the number of prescriptions for drugs rose from 28,439 in 2018-19 to 397,552 in 2023-24.",
      "One family from West Yorkshire said they had chosen to re-mortgage their home to meet the costs, with research suggesting backlogs for ADHD assessments could take up to eight years to clear in some parts of the UK.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said it was working to \"bring waiting lists under control\", adding that the NHS had recently launched an \"ADHD taskforce\" to help tackle the delays.",
      "ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is a condition that affects people's behaviour - making it harder to concentrate and manage time.",
      "Acting impulsively and taking risks can also be an issue and it is also associated with   serious mental health illnesses such as depression and anxiety.",
      "According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, between 3-4% of adults in the UK have ADHD, while the global prevalence of the condition among children is estimated to be about 5%.",
      "Last year a BBC investigation found more than 196,000 adults were on NHS waiting lists seeking a diagnosis, with many areas of the UK recording waiting times of at least eight years.",
      "Among those to have taken action to side-step the lengthy wait are Jannine and Chris from Halifax.",
      "The couple were told it could take up to two years before their children, Oliver, 13, and Sophie, eight, would be seen by the NHS in West Yorkshire.",
      "\"Oliver's ADHD was debilitating,\" said Jannine.",
      "\"For both children, ADHD manifested itself through anxiety, being unable to focus on their education, and emotional dysregulation.",
      "\"Oliver couldn't face going to school because of the anxiety. Sophie, especially on a Monday, would come home just completely burnt out. We were just banging our heads against the wall with the NHS.\"",

      "Figures obtained by the BBC via a Freedom of Information request to the NHS Business Services Authority show that in 2023-24 the equivalent of 525,000 packets of controlled ADHD medication were prescribed privately to an estimated 30,000 patients.",
      "The most commonly prescribed drug, methylphenidate, can cost private patients between \u00a315 and \u00a350 per month. Whilst lisdexamfetamine and dexamfetamine can cost patients between \u00a350 and \u00a3130 per month.",
      "Some families though say the cost of private medication is simply unaffordable.",
      "\"We would not have been able to afford the monthly cost,\" said Jenny Barker from Pontefract, who has been trying to get her 21-year-old daughter Nicole an NHS prescription for ADHD drugs for the past seven years.",
      "\"If we'd gone private and I'm honest it probably would have meant we'd have had to go down the route of going to food banks, because we'd have had to make cuts to other areas of the household budget,\" she said.",

      "Graham, also from West Yorkshire, said he had been paying less than \u00a3100 a month for his ADHD medication since going private four months ago after being diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, which left him unable to work.",

    "summary": "We meet some of the first NHS patients, as expert says funding everyone eligible would \"bankrupt\" the service.",
    "story": [
      "Ray, 62 from south London, became one of the first patients to receive the weight-loss jab Wegovy on the NHS last year and has lost 14kg (just over two stone) in five months.",
      "BBC Panorama joined him as he was prescribed his first dose at London's Guy's Hospital, where he was told he would probably need to take the drug all his life to prevent him regaining weight. He said he felt \"blessed\" to be given the drug.",
      "But the NHS spending watchdog NICE has ruled that each patient can only receive Wegovy for two years. And only a tiny proportion of the eligible 3.4 million patients in England are getting access to the drugs.",
      "Prof Naveed Sattar, who leads the UK government's Obesity Healthcare Goals programme, says if everyone eligible was given the drug right away \"it would simply bankrupt the NHS\".",
      "Being overweight is now the norm and nearly one in three adults in England is obese - double the rate of just 30 years ago.",
      "Obesity can be very bad for your health, and treating the complications from it is estimated to cost the NHS across the UK more than \u00a311bn a year.",
      "Wegovy and another drug called Mounjaro can help patients lose about 15 to 20% of their bodyweight, according to trials.",
      "That sort of weight loss can have a dramatic impact on health, and greatly reduce a patient's risk of many conditions, from diabetes to cancer, joint problems and heart disease.",
      "BBC Panorama has been given exclusive access to the weight management service at London's Guy's Hospital, which has begun rolling out Wegovy to a small group of patients who meet the criteria - a body mass index (BMI) of more than 35 and at least one weight-related health complication.",
      "They include care home worker Ray, who weighed 148kg or 23 stone when he began taking Wegovy in July 2024. He has struggled with his weight all his life.",
      "Ray needs two operations, but doctors have said he needs to lose weight first.",
      "With so many patients meeting the criteria, the hospital is prioritising those like Ray who need surgery or who have multiple weight-related health complications.",
      "Here, not only is Ray given the drug, which is taken via weekly injection under the skin, but he gets face-to-face support from doctors and dietitians - advice not always given to those buying the drug privately online.",
      "They stress the jabs do not do all the work and it is important that patients change their lifestyle, and eat healthier food and smaller portions.",
      "Ray is joined at the appointment by one of his daughters, Sophie, who says it would be \"amazing\" if he could reach his goal of losing three stone: \"I wouldn't recognise him. It would be like I have a brand new dad.\"",
      "For now, the drug is available on the NHS in England via these specialist services, mostly in hospitals.",
      "But the chances of getting the drug are low.",
      "Out of more than 130,000 patients eligible for weight-loss drugs in south-east London, the Guy's clinic reckons it can only see about 3,000.",
      "The weight-loss jab that most people know is Ozempic. It has been in huge demand and popularised by celebrities, from Elon Musk to Sharon Osbourne. In fact, it is meant to be for type 2 diabetes.",
      "Wegovy contains the same ingredient, semaglutide, but in different dosages.",
      "Semaglutide mimics a gut hormone that sends signals to our brain telling us we are full. It also slows the transit of food through the stomach.",
      "In trials, patients on Wegovy lost an average of 15% body weight, when combined with lifestyle and dietary advice.",
      "Experts warn the drugs should only be taken under proper medical supervision, because like all medicines they come with side effects, which not all patients can cope with.",
      "These are mostly gastro-intestinal - such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation - but there are potentially serious complications including inflammation of the pancreas.",
      "To help them cope with the side effects, patients are started on a low dose of the weight-loss jabs, and it is gradually increased, month by month.",
      "Ray is doing well on the drug, eating smaller portions, and after five months there is a visible difference.",
      "At his appointment at Guy's just before Christmas, he weighs 134kg, a weight loss of 14kg or just over two stone.",
      "He is delighted. \"I can't believe the amount of weight I've lost. Every time my daughters see me they say I'm shrinking. It's been a really good journey.\"",
      "Ray says he feels \"lucky\" to have had access to the drug via the NHS, especially now he is a granddad to Willow.",
      "Ray says despite putting many new holes in his belt, his trousers are so loose they are falling off him.",
      "Prof Barbara McGowan, an expert in obesity and diabetes, who runs the weight management service at Guy's is delighted with the progress of patients such as Ray.",
      "She says most clinicians hope that NICE's two-year limit will be removed \"because obesity is a chronic disease and we need to manage it long-term\".",
      "That may not be such an issue now that a second, even more effective drug has been approved by NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence).",
      "Mounjaro has been dubbed the \"King Kong\" of weight-loss jabs as in a key trial, patients lost an average of 21% of bodyweight over eight months.",
      "Unlike Wegovy, no restriction has been put on how long NHS patients can stay on the drug.",
      "But the NHS is going to roll out the drug over 12 years because of concerns it could overwhelm services.",
      "Over the next three years it is estimated just 220,000 people in England will benefit, out of 3.4 million who are eligible.",
      "Prof Sattar, from Glasgow University, says it is a simple matter of economics: \"The cost of the drugs is still at a level where we cannot afford to treat several million people within the UK with these drugs. It would simply bankrupt the NHS.\"",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?The Briefing Room: Will new weight loss drugs save or bankrupt the NHS?",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "The Briefing Room: Will new weight loss drugs save or bankrupt the NHS?",
      "He estimates it costs the NHS about \u00a33,000 a year to give a patient either Mounjaro or Wegovy.",
      "So if everyone eligible in England received them right now, that would be about \u00a310bn annually - half the entire NHS drugs budget.",
      "Jean, who is 62, hopes Mounjaro will help her to get her weight and health back on track. She shows me a picture of herself on her phone from a decade before, when she was visibly far lighter and healthier.",
      "\"I was a fitness fanatic. I went to the gym practically every day. I don't know what happened, why I fell off the wagon.\"",
      "She believes her relationship with food is \"terrible\". \"I have a lot of food noise and I tend to act on it,\" she says, using a term coined to describe cravings and preoccupation with food.",
      "Jean is eligible for Mounjaro because she has type 2 diabetes and has been injecting insulin for five years.",
      "She is worried about side effects, which are similar to those for Wegovy, but will be carefully monitored at a diabetes clinic in south London linked to Guy's.",
      "Mounjaro helps stabilise blood-sugar levels and boost the body's natural production of insulin.",
      "After just five weeks on the drug, Jean is able to stop her insulin. She is delighted: \"I think it's Mounjaro, and willpower as well - I have to give myself some credit.\u202f I think the drug silences the food noise and I'm not constantly sitting around thinking about what I'm going to eat.\"",
      "After two months on the drug, Jean is back in the gym, and has lost more than 3kg (half a stone).",
      "She is disappointed in her weight loss, but determined to shed more pounds as her Mounjaro dose is increased.",
      "But Jean and the other patients getting Wegovy and Mounjaro on the NHS are the minority.",
      "Prof Sattar reckons more than nine in 10 patients currently on weight-loss drugs in the UK are paying for them privately.",
      "He points out that obesity rates are highest in areas of social deprivation.",
      "\"The people perhaps who stand to benefit the most, who are less affluent and from more deprived communities, are simply not able to afford this drug. It's not fair. It's just a reality of the economics of the situation.\"",
      "But Prof Sattar told me that rising obesity levels could also eventually \"bankrupt\" the NHS.",
      "With smoking levels continuing to fall, he now regards excess weight and obesity as the \"major driver, bar none, of long-term multiple health conditions\".",
      "Both he and Prof McGowan believe that weight-loss jabs have an important role to play and could eventually bring some wider savings.",
      "Prof McGowan says Ray is a good example: \"We treat a lot of the complications associated with obesity. Ray has pre-diabetes. We're hoping to go into remission and therefore prevent all the complications associated with that progressive disease.",
      "\"He might need joint surgery but achieving weight loss can prevent a lot of complications and ultimately save the NHS a lot of money.\"",
      "Prof Sattar says in 10 years there could be 20 weight-loss drugs on the market, including some in tablet form. As more effective and cheaper drugs become available, they could produce savings for the NHS, he says.",
      "The UK government also thinks weight-loss drugs could eventually bring wider economic benefits.",
      "A five-year trial in Manchester will look at the wider impact of Mounjaro beyond the individual health benefits, including whether it helps some people struggling with obesity to get back into work.",
      "The drugs are not a magic bullet for obesity, but after decades of expanding waistlines, they offer hope to millions.",
      "For now, though, the health service doesn't have the resources to treat all those eligible. It means - for years to come - only a minority like Ray will get access on the NHS. The rest will have to pay - or go without.",

    "summary": "An outbreak of the flu-like virus in China is causing concern, but experts say a Covid-like pandemic is unlikely.",
    "story": [
      "A surge in cases of the flu-like human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China has raised fears of another Covid-style pandemic.",
      "Images of hospitals overrun with masked patients have circulated widely on social media, but health experts say HMPV is not like Covid, and point out it has been around for many years.",
      "They say China and other countries are simply experiencing the seasonal increase in HMPV typically seen in winter.",
      "What is HMPV, what are the symptoms, and how does it spread?",
      "First identified in the Netherlands in 2001, HMPV spreads through direct contact between people, or when someone touches a contaminated surface.",
      "The virus leads to a mild upper respiratory tract infection for most people.",
      "It is usually almost indistinguishable from flu.",
      "Symptoms for most people include a cough, a fever and blocked nose.",
      "The very young, including children under two, are most vulnerable to the virus.",
      "It also poses a greater risk to those with weakened immune systems, including the elderly and those with advanced cancer, according to Hsu Li Yang, an infectious diseases specialist in Singapore.",
      "If infected, a \"small but significant proportion\" of immunocompromised people can develop more severe disease where the lungs are affected, with wheezing, breathlessness and symptoms of croup.",
      "\"Many will require hospital care, with a smaller proportion at risk of dying from the infection,\" Dr Hsu said.",
      "Why are HMPV cases rising in China?",
      "Like many respiratory infections, HMPV is most active during late winter and spring.",
      "This is because viruses survive better in the cold, and can pass more easily from one person to another as people spend more time indoors with closed windows.",
      "In northern China, the current HMPV spike coincides with low temperatures that are expected to last until March.",
      "Many other countries in the northern hemisphere - including the US - are also experiencing a growth in rates of HMPV, said Jacqueline Stephens, an epidemiologist at Flinders University in Australia.",
      "\"While this is concerning, the increased prevalence is likely the normal seasonal increase seen in winter,\" she said.",

      "It said Chinese authorities have confirmed that the health care system is not overwhelmed and there have been no emergency declarations or responses to date.",
      "Is HMPV spreading in the UK?",
      "The incidence of HMPV in the UK has risen steadily since October 2024.",
      "The UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA)  does not publish the number of cases recorded.",
      "However its latest data shows the percentage of people testing positive for the disease rose sharply in the third week of December and remained at that higher level the following week.",
      "But the UKHSA says this is completely in line with normal seasonal trends, and the level of the disease being seen in GP surgeries and hospitals is as expected.",
      "Is there any chance of another Covid-like pandemic?",
      "Fears of a Covid-style pandemic are overblown, experts say, noting that such events are typically caused by new viruses, which is not the case with HMPV.",
      "The disease is already globally present and has been around for decades. This means people across the world have \"some degree of existing immunity due to previous exposure\", Dr Hsu said.",
      "\"Almost every child will have at least one infection with HMPV by their fifth birthday and we can expect to go onto to have multiple reinfections throughout life,\" said Paul Hunter, a medical professor at University of East Anglia in England.",

      "Strong US jobs data released on Friday added to expectations that US rates will stay higher for longer, and this has helped to strengthen the value of the dollar against other currencies.",

    "story": [
      "UK laws on internet safety are \"very uneven\" and \"unsatisfactory\", Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has said, following calls from campaigners to tighten the rules.",
      "On Saturday, Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life at 14 after seeing harmful content online, said the UK was \"going backwards\" on the issue.",
      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",
      "The Conservative government had originally included in the legislation plans to compel social media companies to remove some \"legal-but-harmful\" content, such as posts promoting eating disorders.",
      "However the proposal triggered a backlash from critics, including the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who were concerned it could lead to censorship.",
      "In July 2022, Badenoch, who was not then a minister, said the bill was in \"no fit state to become law\" adding: \"We should not be legislating for hurt feelings.\"",
      "Another Conservative MP, David Davis, said it risked \"the biggest accidental curtailment of free speech in modern history\".",
      "The plan was dropped for adult social media users and instead companies were required to give users more control to filter out content they did not want to see. The law still expects companies to protect children from legal-but-harmful content.",
      "Kyle said the section on legal-but-harmful content had been taken out of the bill adding: \"So I inherited a landscape where we have a very uneven, unsatisfactory legislative settlement.\"",
      "He did not commit to making changes to the current legislation but said he was \"very open-minded\" on the subject.",
      "He also said the act contained some \"very good powers\" he was using to \"assertively\" tackle new safety concerns and that in the coming months ministers would get the powers to make sure online platforms were providing age-appropriate content.",
      "Companies that did not comply with the law would face \"very strident\" sanctions, he said.",

      "He said Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Meta which owns Facebook and Instagram, and Elon Musk, owner of the social media site X, were \"at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry\".",
      "He accused Zuckerberg of moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\" and \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to\".",
      "Earlier this week, Zuckerberg said Meta would be getting rid of fact checkers, and instead adopt a system \u2013 already introduced by X - of allowing users to add \"community notes\" to social media posts they deemed to be untrue.",
      "This marked a change from Meta's previous approach, introduced in 2016, whereby third party moderators would check posts on Facebook and Instagram that appeared to be false or misleading.",
      "Content flagged as inaccurate would be moved lower in users' feeds and accompanied by labels offering viewers more information on the subject.",
      "Defending the new system, Zuckerberg said moderators were \"too politically biased\" and it was \"time to get back to our roots around free expression\".",
      "The step comes as Meta seeks to improve relations with incoming US President Donald Trump who has previously accused the company of censoring right-wing voices.",
      "Zuckerberg said the change - which only applies in the US - would mean content moderators would \"catch less bad stuff\" but would also reduce the number of \"innocent\" posts being removed.",
      "Responding to Russell's criticism, a Meta spokesperson told the BBC there was \"no change to how we treat content that encourages suicide, self-injury, and eating disorders\" and said the company would \"continue to use our automated systems to scan for that high-severity content\".",
      "Asked about the change, Kyle said the announcement was \"an American statement for American service users\" adding: \"There is one thing that has not changed and that is the law of this land.\"",
      "\"If you come and operate in this country you abide by the law, and the law says illegal content must be taken down,\" he said.",
      "Rules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force later this year, compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide.",
      "The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography, material promoting self-harm, bullying and content encouraging dangerous stunts.",
      "Platforms will be expected to adopt \"age assurance technologies\" to prevent children from seeing harmful content.",
      "The law also requires companies to take action against illegal, state-sponsored disinformation. If their services are likely to be accessed by children they should also take steps to protect users against misinformation."

      "Safety campaigners believe there are significant loopholes in Ofcom's code on illegal content, including a lack of specific rules on live streaming or content that promotes suicide and self-harm. And the new codes of practice, which are still being worked on, won't apply to private messaging.",
      "An Ofcom spokesperson said: \"We recognise the profound pain caused by harmful content online, and our deepest sympathies remain with Ian Russell and all those who have suffered unimaginable loss.\" They said the voices of victims \"will continue to be at the heart of our work\".",
      "The spokesperson added that tech firms are required to assess the risks of illegal harms on their platforms by 16 March, and after that companies would need measures to reduce the risk of illegal content appearing and to remove it quickly when it appears.",

      "In his letter, Mr Russell also says Elon Musk, who is the boss of X, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg are part of a \"wholesale recalibration\" of the online world, moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\".",
      "\"In this bonfire of digital ethics and online safety features, all of us will lose, but our children lose the most,\" he writes.",
      "And in an exclusive interview, Mr Russell told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that Meta's platforms, Facebook and Instagram, were turning \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to and therefore more children will be exposed to in the future\".",
      "\"And by turning the platforms backwards away from safety, Mark Zuckerberg has changed the game fundamentally and shown that the platforms aren't really here to play safe, they're here to make money,\" he said. Zuckerberg announced this week that Meta was abandoning the use of independent fact checkers on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told the BBC that there was \"no change to how we treat content that encourages suicide, self-injury, and eating disorders\" and that the company would \"continue to use our automated systems to scan for that high-severity content\".",
      "\"We want young people to have safe and age-appropriate experiences on our apps - this has not changed,\" they said.",
      "Mr Russell called on the government to both bolster the Online Safety Act and to introduce extra legislation designed to tackle what he describes as \"the reckless behaviours of social media leadership\".",
      "He also said that he thought there was \"no real movement\" within government. \"The online safety push has stagnated,\" he said. \"In fact, we're probably heading backwards because the tech platforms have changed the way they're playing the game.\"",
      "He said he was sure Sir Keir \"is a father who protects his children from online dangers as much as any individual can\".",
      "\"But as a prime minister, he needs to really back online safety and move forward so that the UK is the safest place in the world to be online,\" he added.",
      "A No 10 spokesperson said Sir Keir was thankful for Mr Russell's letter: \"Ian Russell, alongside many other families and parents, has shown immense bravery through the most tragic of circumstances to campaign for children's online safety. We are grateful for all their contributions and will continue to work with them to get this right.",
      "\"This government is committed to ensuring online safety for children. Social media platforms must step up to their responsibilities and take robust action to protect children from seeing harmful content on their sites.\"",
      "Mr Russell's daughter Molly took her own life in November 2017 after being exposed to a stream of dark, depressing content on Pinterest and Instagram. He has been campaigning for online safety measures since his daughter's death.",
      "You can read his letter in full at the bottom of this story.",
      "Ian Russell's voice hard for Starmer to ignore",
      "No one watching or listening to Mr Russell over the years could deny his passion for change or his deep knowledge of the dark world that Molly was caught up in. Along with other bereaved parents we have met in the past couple of years - including Esther Ghey, Judy Thomas, and Mariano Janin - he has told his family's story with huge dignity, and for a simple reason: he doesn't want anyone else to go through the pain.",
      "He's become a prominent campaigner on an issue that is important to millions of parents and young people around the country. His voice is hard for the government to ignore.",
      "But creating and then imposing rules on the online world is difficult for politicians for many reasons.",
      "The Online Safety Act weathered many controversies and took years to put together. On one side were campaigners concerned about providing protection, on the other, fierce lobbying from the tech companies against straying into censorship or invading people's privacy.",
      "Ofcom was picked to police the rules and could theoretically be incredibly tough, threatening fines of millions of pounds or even prison for those companies that break them. But the new codes of practice are not yet fully in force.",
      "But campaigners like Mr Russell believe it's already obvious the rules fall short. The Internet Watch Foundation boss, Derek Ray-Hill, also told us: \"Unless Ofcom is more ambitious in its interpretation of the Act, so many of the things the legislation makes possible will remain frustratingly out of reach.\"",
      "There is a sense in Whitehall of \"wait and see\". Ministers have acknowledged that as technology advances, extra laws might be required. The Home Office is expected in the next couple of weeks to outline new offences to tackle child abuse online. But the government is also nervous about making rules so tight that tech companies feel unwelcome.",
      "This weekend we'll be joined by the Technology Secretary Peter Kyle, who is determined to make the UK a good place for big tech companies to do business, to help the economy grow. From Sunday onwards he will spell out how artificial intelligence can speed up government business and improve our public services \u2013 this government, like Rishi Sunak's, believes AI can boost the UK's sagging productivity.",
      "But the advance of those technologies bring risks, and tricky decisions for ministers.",
      "Warnings that advanced AI could wipe out thousands of jobs; concerns over deepfake video in pornography, child abuse, or misinformation. Even Paul McCartney and Kate Bush have got the government in their sights as they campaign to try to protect artists' work being used without payment by giant AI platforms, upending decades of copyright law.",
      "Multiple sources familiar with government discussions on child safety and other aspects of this massive quandary say they are concerned the Department of Science and Technology (DSIT) is not paying enough attention to the possible downsides.",
      "A government source said some discussions about protecting people online had been \"spicy\". \"This is a form of harm. It's normal for departments like Home Office and Department of Health to be constantly reviewing what's going on to keep up with safety \u2013 [DSIT] is not yet used to having to doing the same.\"",
      "A source at DSIT said the department had already acknowledged there might have to be more legislation in future but highlighted the fact that the Ofcom codes aren't yet completed or in force.",
      "And a spokesperson said: \"Bereaved parents have suffered the most unimaginable loss, and we are prepared to use every lever at our disposal to improve online safety for children.",
      "\"Changes coming into force through the Online Safety Act will ensure platforms have to act to protect children from harmful online content, with Ofcom ready to enforce these new laws from March. They have our complete backing to use the full range of their powers to root harmful material from the internet, and we expect platforms to be acting now to prepare for these changes.\"",
      "These aren't new arguments. But Musk's trolling of the UK government and Zuckerberg's flex away from fact checking have shifted the ground on which the conversations are taking place.",
      "Ministers have to consider what's right for the economy as well as protecting the public. And they might not want to admit it, but no politician wants to pick a fight with billionaires with massive social media megaphones - or indeed be seen to curtail our liberties or privacy without good reason. Arguably that is why measures like the Online Safety Act took so long to introduce in the first place.",
      "The palpable fear from campaigners like Mr Russell is that just as technology has been speeding up, hard-fought moves to put safety first have been slowing down.",

      "The letter in full",
      "Dear Prime Minister,",
      "Six months ago, you were elected on a platform that promised an end to short-term sticking plaster solutions. I am writing to you as a bereaved father and online safety campaigner because it is evident that urgent action is required to protect young people from the horrors they are routinely exposed to online.",
      "It's now over seven years since the death of my youngest daughter Molly. More than ever before, I am convinced that strong and effective online safety regulation is the most powerful tool available to prevent the loss of ever more young lives at the hands of social media platforms whose indifference to children's safety is fundamentally baked into their commercial strategies, business models and products.",
      "However, in recent months it has become clear that progress towards online safety has stalled \u2013 and we are now going backwards. Regulation as it is currently designed is failing to deliver the protection that children and parents need, want and deserve. No one can credibly claim that Ofcom's implementation of the Online Safety Act is anything other than a disaster \u2013 a view not only shared widely by civil society but also increasingly privately shared across many parts of your Government.",
      "Ofcom's choices when implementing the Act have starkly highlighted intrinsic structural weaknesses with the legislative framework. We not only have a regulator which has fundamentally failed to grasp the urgency and scale of its mission, but a regulatory model that inherently and significantly constrains its ability to reduce preventable harms.",
      "While I understand that this is legislation you inherited and did not design, the reality is that unless you now commit to act decisively to fix the Online Safety Act, the streams of life-sucking content seen by children will soon become torrents: a digital disaster driven by the actions of tech firms, and being left unchallenged by a failing regulatory model. This preventable harm would be happening on your watch.",
      "At the same time as the UK's overdue regulation is falling badly short, the very industry being regulated is ominously changing. The Online Safety Act was developed around a premise that large tech firms would increasingly accept their responsibilities, and we would see safer social networks develop over time.",
      "However, this is a time when platforms readily say they will now 'catch less of the bad stuff'; allow underdeveloped AI to generate and spread disinformation; and promote targeted and polarising content leading to isolation and despair. We have now entered a different era, and we will need a different regulatory approach that can address it.",
      "Put simply, people like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry. We should be in absolutely no doubt that when Zuckerberg speaks about a 'cultural tipping point towards prioritizing speech', he is signalling a profound strategic shift away from fundamental safety measures towards a laissez-faire, anything goes model. In this bonfire of digital ethics and online safety features, all of us will lose, but our children lose the most.",
      "It's on that basis that I now encourage you to act swiftly and decisively to address this coming flood of preventable harm. In the immediate term, that means strengthening the existing framework. Beyond that, it means committing to substantially strengthened regulatory model \u2013 with primary legislation being introduced as soon as possible to enact its provisions.",
      "It is not just a new Online Safety Act that is required, but a wholesale re-imagining of the framework to ensure it is capable of responding to the threats of today and beyond. A new framework must be fundamentally oriented towards tackling the reckless behaviours of social media leadership \u2013 a goal which can best be achieved through establishing an overarching Duty of Care supported by a robust set of conduct-based rules to enforce it.",
      "A bolstered OSA must have harm reduction at its core. That means having a clear harm reduction duty on Ofcom, transparency and safety-by-design as integral components of the regulatory regime, and a regulatory design that puts victims at its core \u2013 a major failure of the current regime, where the asymmetry between the interests of victims and industry has if anything been substantially reinforced. The voices of those with lived experience must be heard clearly if big tech's powerful players are not to shout them down in this debate.",
      "Crucially, this must also mean an extension of the Duty of Candour to extend to tech firms. This vital measure stands to correct the historic injustices faced by so many victims, and the power of this measure to address the cultural issues driving harms in the tech sector \u2013 and the asymmetry between industry and victims which perpetuates further harm \u2013 would be considerable.",
      "Too many parents have lost hope that governments will deliver the online safety reform they urgently need. Among bereaved families, there is widespread dismay that successive governments have chosen to dither and delay when the consequences of inaction has been further lost lives.",
      "As Prime Minister and as a father, I implore you to act. You now have a profound opportunity, but also a great responsibility, to act clearly and decisively and to show to millions of parents across this country that meaningful change is on the way. It is time to decisively protect children and young adults from the perils of our online world.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 13:49:18 GMT",
    "summary": "The Conservatives and Reform UK are both demanding a fresh national investigation into the issue.",
    "story": [
      "A cabinet minister has rejected a call from Labour's Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham for a new national inquiry into grooming gangs, while leaving the door open for a future investigation.",
      "Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said she disagreed with Burnham's support for a fresh inquiry into historical child sexual abuse in areas including Oldham and Rochdale, in Greater Manchester.",
      "The Conservatives and Reform UK have both backed calls from tech billionaire Elon Musk for a new national investigation.",
      "But Labour ministers have said their priority is to implement the 2022 recommendations of a seven-year inquiry led by Professor Alexis Jay into child sexual abuse.",
      "Burnham backs 'limited' national abuse inquiry",
      "MPs vote against Tory call for new grooming gangs inquiry",
      "Musk's 'disinformation' endangering me, says Phillips",
      "On Wednesday, MPs voted against a Tory move to force a fresh national investigation.",
      "Burnham told BBC Radio Manchester he thought there was a case for a \"limited national inquiry that draws on reviews like the one that I commissioned, and the one we have seen in Rotherham, the one we have seen in Telford, to draw out some of these national issues and compel people to give evidence, who then may have charges to answer and be held to account\".",
      "Asked about this on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Nandy, MP for Wigan in Greater Manchester, said: \"I get the point that Andy's making.\"",
      "She said he was calling for a smaller inquiry into specific issues that the one he had instigated could not pick up.",
      "The culture secretary described it as \"astonishing\" that some Greater Manchester Police officers had refused to take part in that local inquiry and could not be compelled to do so.",
      "But, she added, she did not agree with Burnham, because the Jay inquiry, set up by Theresa May's government, had taken evidence from thousands of victims and addressed the issues he had raised.",
      "\"That inquiry found what every inquiry has found, that young girls weren't believed because they were young, they were female, and they were working-class, and that the systems that were supposed to protect them protected themselves instead of protecting those brave young victims,\" Nandy said.",
      "She denied the government was \"cross\" with Burnham, saying the whole point of devolution was \"that we want to make sure that people's views are heard from across the country\".",
      "Asked whether the government was ruling out another inquiry, Ms Nandy said: \"The reason I think that people have heard from us that there may at some point in the future be another inquiry is because child abuse by its very nature is hidden, it's secretive, and, at various points, I'm sure that more will come out about the scandals that we've heard.\"",
      "On Monday, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the government would begin implementing Prof Jay's call for mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse, with further details to be set out in the coming weeks.",
      "The prime minister has warned that launching a further inquiry could delay action on tackling child sexual abuse, though he noted there was no \"fixed view\" among survivors on whether one was needed.",
      "Victims want action, child abuse inquiry chair says",
      "Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?",
      "What is Starmer's record on prosecuting grooming gangs?",
      "On Wednesday, the Commons rejected a Conservative amendment to the government's Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which called for another national inquiry.",
      "The Tories accused Labour MPs of having \"turned a blind eye to justice\" for victims of grooming gangs.",
      "The bill, which includes measures aimed at protecting children and tougher rules around home-schooling, as well as changes to academies, would have been killed off if MPs had voted through the Tory amendment.",
      "Burnham said that while he supported a limited, new inquiry, MPs were right to vote down Conservative \"opportunism\".",
      "Labour peer and former deputy party leader Baroness [Harriet] Harman has also said issues raised by the grooming gangs scandal should be looked at in closer detail.",
      "\"Whether it's a task force, whether it's more action plans, whether it's a mini inquiry on this, this is something that we need to develop resilience in,\" she told Sky News.",
      "Ministers have suggested they are keeping an open mind about a future investigation if it becomes clear that survivors want one, along with the implementation of Prof Jay's recommendations.",
      "But Nandy said she had spoken to survivors who had given evidence to the Jay inquiry and had begun to lose faith in the process leading to concrete action.",
      "\"We can not possibly ask victims to go through that again when not one single one of those recommendations has been implemented.",
      "\"Our message to victims is we understand the time for action is long overdue and we are acting. The time for talking is over, the time for action is now,\" she said.",
      "However, she added the government was not ruling out a future inquiry \"because child abuse by its very nature is hidden, it's secretive, and, at various points, I'm sure that more will come out about the scandals that we've heard\".",
      "Prof Jay will answer questions from MPs on the cross-party Commons home affairs committee about the response to her inquiry's findings, on 21 January."

      "The UK has enough gas to meet winter demand, the network operator has said, after British Gas owner Centrica warned about \"concerningly low\" storage levels.",
      "Centrica, which owns the country's largest gas storage facility, said the UK had \"less than a week of gas demand in store\" due to colder-than-usual weather.",
      "But National Gas, which owns the UK gas network, said the UK gets its gas from \"a diverse range of sources\" and that storage \"remains healthy\".",
      "Energy analysts said even if gas storage did run low, the UK could buy in more from Europe and other countries.",
      "Centrica has said that UK gas storage facilities are currently about half-full.",
      "\"Plunging temperatures and high demand for gas-fired power stations have reduced UK winter gas storage to concerningly low levels,\" it said.",
      "\"Stubbornly high\" gas prices had made it \"more difficult to top up storage\", the company added.",
      "Parts of the UK are experiencing freezing conditions, with extremely low night-time temperatures forecast in some areas.",
      "Gas central heating is the most common way that households heat their homes. Around three in four households (74%) in England and Wales said it was their only central heating source in 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics.",
      "National Gas, which owns and operates nearly 5,000 miles of the UK's gas transmission system, said the \"overall picture across Great Britain's eight main gas storage sites remains healthy with average levels at just over 60% across the board\".",
      "It added it was \"well-placed to respond to demand this winter\".",
      "Energy prices rise with warnings of more pain to come",
      "Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, said that there are various gas pipelines running from Europe to the UK, and the country also gets shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG).",
      "Given household energy prices are currently capped until the end of March, any shortage would be very unlikely to affect consumer bills, he said.",
      "If there was a short-term spike in wholesale prices, this could affect some business customers, he said.",
      "However, the weather in the UK is forecast to become milder from Tuesday meaning a spike may not happen, he added.",
      "Wholesale prices are currently lower than they were at the beginning of the year.",
      "\"There does not appear to be a risk of a physical shortage in UK gas supply this winter,\" said Jack Sharples, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.",
      "As well as LNG, Dr Sharples said the UK still gets some gas from North Sea fields and there are pipelines running to the UK from Norway, the Netherlands and Belgium.",
      "The government said it was \"confident the UK has enough natural gas supplies to make it through the winter\".",
      "Hydrogen push",
      "Gas inventory levels have come under pressure from the cold weather conditions and the end of Russian gas pipeline supplies through Ukraine at the end of last month.",
      "The UK has relatively little capacity to store gas, but has more than it did compared with a few years ago.",
      "About half of the capacity it has is at Centrica's Rough facility off the coast of East Yorkshire.",
      "This was closed in 2017, but then partly reopened in October 2022 following the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "There is also LNG storage at three terminals, and other smaller facilities across the country.",
      "If the UK needed more gas, traders would have access to EU stocks, provided they paid the right price.",
      "Centrica wants to invest \u00a32bn in the Rough facility, so it can use it to store more gas, then hydrogen as the UK starts to burn less natural gas to meet green targets.",
      "It has been pushing the government to say hydrogen will be part of the UK energy mix in the future to justify that investment."

      "\"We had a very good meal,\" the foreign secretary said on Thursday. \"We had a long time to discuss the issues. He was an extremely gracious host, very affable, very warm indeed about our great country.\"",
      "And throughout a series of media interviews, briefings and a speech at the Foreign Office, Lammy talked up UK-US relations, even daring to speak of a \"special relationship\", a phrase largely avoided by diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "The UK and the US, he said, were \"required to work very closely together\" on global challenges.",
      "They include challenges such as the wars in Europe and the Middle East and what he called \"the growing problems in Sudan\". He cited the \"close cooperation\" between both countries on military and intelligence matters.",
      "But what was striking was how far the foreign secretary was willing to challenge Trump only days before his inauguration.",
      "The president-elect's refusal to rule out military action against Greenland was, Lammy said, an example of his \"destabilising\" rhetoric.",
      "His language was more measured than that of French and German politicians and he said Trump was focused on Arctic security - but he insisted such an attack by one member of Nato on another was \"simply not going to happen\".",
      "He said Trump was right to ask Europe to do more to defend itself but questioned his call for Nato members to spend 5% of their national income on defence, noting the US was itself spending only 3.38 %.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier in the day, Lammy had cast doubt on Trump's campaign promise of a quick ceasefire in Ukraine.",
      "\"I see no evidence that Putin wants to come to the table to negotiate,\" he said.",
      "\"I think the indications are, from what I've seen over the last few days, a slight pushback on this sense that somehow a deal will be achieved on 21 January, I think that's now unlikely. And we're hearing that actually the timetable's moved down somewhat towards Easter.\"",
      "Musk looms large over UK politics as MPs return for 2025",
      "How Elon Musk seized on baseless memo claim to fuel wave of misinformation",
      "Lammy played down the influence of Elon Musk, the wealthy ally of Trump who in recent days has personally attacked British ministers on X. He said the tech boss would have only a \"domestic portfolio\" in the new administration and his role had not come up in talks between British and Trump officials.",
      "The foreign secretary also emphasised the need to engage with China \u2013 on trade, climate, health and artificial intelligence - and urged the country \"not to throw in its lot\" with Russia. This position is at odds with that held by Trump allies who see China already as a key member of an anti-Western axis including Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "Lammy calls his approach to foreign policy \"progressive realism\". He said this means seeking progressive ends while accepting the world as it is.",
      "When applying this framework to Trump, he said he will be guided more by the president-elect's actions than his rhetoric. We shall learn in coming days how far the two remain apart.",
      "And as for that dinner with Trump last autumn, Lammy rarely mentions the fact the meal was almost the cause of a diplomatic upset.",
      "He and Sir Keir Starmer were presented with large plates of Guyanese chicken, somewhat to the dismay of the vegetarian prime minister.",
      "In the national interest, the foreign secretary was obliged to eat more chicken that night than he might have expected."

      "It has not been a good week for Chancellor Rachel Reeves.",
      "Government borrowing costs have hit their highest level in 16 years and the pound has fallen to a 14-month low against the dollar.",
      "She has gone on a planned trip to China amid accusations from opposition parties that she is leaving at a moment of economic peril.",
      "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is accompanying her on the trip. The 12-hour flight to Beijing is probably the length of the meeting she might have wanted to have with him.",
      "So how serious are the recent movements on the markets and what could happen as a result?",
      "Budget plans need to be tweaked",
      "While the markets stabilised from Thursday lunchtime, the move against UK government debt is already enough to cause a problem for the chancellor's Budget maths.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament. The Treasury has said these fiscal rules, set out in the Budget, are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "At times over the past week the markets have looked pretty fragile for Britain, with both government borrowing costs going up and sterling falling back at the same time. That is a key marker.",
      "While it's true that the overall direction for the markets over the past month has been set by an assessment of the inflationary consequences of President-elect Trump's trade and economic policies, the UK has been getting some special attention in addition.",
      "It risks being tarred with both the inflationary stickiness of the US, and the stagnant growth of the eurozone - the worst of both worlds.",
      "That said, it is important to be precise about the extent of the problem. The extra cost of servicing the national debt at these interest rates would be several billion pounds a year - i.e. material enough to require some sort of correction in the Budget maths, but doable, and the clear message this week is that \"it will be done\".",
      "No impact on mortgages so far",
      "The impact on budgetary maths is real, but the wider impact that might be expected - of higher borrowing costs for companies and for households - has not yet materialised.",
      "The mortgage market has yet to see an increase in rates for fixed-term mortgages, as occurred rapidly in the panic after the 2022 mini-Budget. There is a curious calm.",
      "One explanation lies in what is not happening. This time last year the major lenders greatly discounted mortgages in a battle for market share ahead of the key moments for house buying. This has not happened this year, and may yet have a consequence in the property market.",
      "The Bank of England has indicated it will continue with interest rate cuts this year. The markets think there may be far fewer than previously expected, perhaps only one, leaving base interest rates at 4.5%.",
      "Many economists say this is the wrong call, and believe rates will be cut multiple times. There's quite a lot of uncertainty here, and the key Bank of England committee is split. The Bank's words will be very carefully watched.",
      "More positively for the economy, despite a lot of rhetoric from retailers, many have delivered strong results and have not lowered their profits expectations. Are consumers a bit more robust than had been assumed, and could this drive some growth in 2025?",

      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Growth strategy needs a reboot",
      "The problem of servicing higher interest payments on the national debt increases the likelihood of the Treasury making plans for an adjustment, based on a squeeze on spending. A \u00a310bn cut will hurt, but with a majority of 170 MPs in the House of Commons, and an ongoing spending review already in train, it can be done.",
      "In these circumstances, with the credible threat of a global trade war, for example, it should be noted that Rachel Reeves' new fiscal rules do have an escape hatch.",
      "In the event of \"an emergency or a significant negative economic shock to the economy\" the chancellor may \"temporarily suspend the fiscal mandate\".",
      "While a global trade war could qualify, it would be difficult optics to suspend a \"non-negotiable\" and \"iron-clad\" set of rules before they had really bitten. The rules have not yet formally passed into law yet either, and remain a \"draft\" until the Commons votes to approve them.",
      "It seems very unlikely that this route will be taken unless there is a very clear economic shock in the coming weeks.",
      "The bigger point here is what matters in the markets, which is whether the UK is pursuing a credible set of policies, a convincing overall strategy.",
      "Labour's focus on stability at all costs was understandable after the humiliation of Liz Truss's mini-Budget. But \"stability\" is not a growth strategy.",
      "Pursuing green growth by borrowing for long-term capital investment is a potential strategy, and it underpinned \"Bidenomics\" in the US. The incoming government embraced the rhetoric of US policy under the outgoing president, without the same firepower. \"Bidenomics without the money\", you might say.",
      "But now the new Trump administration is jettisoning this approach, rightly or wrongly, and the markets are less convinced that such a strategy will pay for itself. It will cost more to fund such a strategy, and require harsher trade-offs than expected.",

      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged that all day-to-day spending should be  funded from taxes, not from borrowing.",
      "But if she needs more money to pay back higher borrowing costs, that uses up more tax revenue, leaving less money to spend on other things.",
      "Economists have warned that this could mean spending cuts which would affect public services, and tax rises that could hit people's pay or businesses' ability to grow and hire more people.",
      "The government has committed to having only one fiscal event a year, where it can raise taxes, and this is not expected until the autumn.",
      "So if higher borrowing costs persist, we may be more likely to see cuts to spending before that or at least lower spending increases than would otherwise happen.",
      "Some people may be wondering about the impact of higher gilt yields on the mortgage market, particularly after what happened after Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022.",
      "Although yields are higher now than they were then, they have been creeping up slowly over a period of months, whereas in 2022 they shot up over a couple of days.",
      "That speedy rise led to lenders quickly pulling deals while they tried to work out what interest rate to charge.",
      "Analysts and brokers say the current unease in the markets is having some effect on the pricing of mortgages. Many were expecting to see some falls in rates at the start of the year but instead lenders are holding off from cuts to see what happens.",

      "It did, however, approve 89% of planning applications for housing in the year to June 2024, considerably higher than the national rate of 71%.",
      "Portsmouth, on the south coast, also has a very stretching target. The local council is being asked to deliver 1,021 new homes per year, almost nine times the 120 it delivered on average over the most recent three years.",
      "Hastings has been tasked with a smaller total: 710. But this is still five times the 142 it has delivered on average in recent years.",
      "Portsmouth approved 74% of residential planning applications in the year to June 2024 and Hastings 75%.",
      "Councils were consulted on the targets last summer, with many expressing concerns they were \"unrealistic\", and the numbers were revised.",
      "Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, leader of Kensington and Chelsea, said it was \"out of touch to let algorithms set targets without understanding local context\".",
      "\"You only have to walk through the streets of our densely built borough to see how unachievable it would be to build 5,107 homes a year here; this borough is only 4.5 miles squared.\"",
      "She said there were two major sites in the borough that would provide 6,000 new homes in total.",
      "Councillor Darren Sanders, cabinet member for housing at Portsmouth City Council, said the target \"does not work\" because \"most of the city is an island\" with a dense population and \"important heritage and natural assets\".",
      "\"Portsmouth has approved more than 4,000 new homes in 2023 and 2024. Any lack of delivery is down to the rising cost of development,\" he said, \"not whether the council approves them.\"",
      "Sevenoaks councillor Julia Thornton said it was a \"top priority\" to protect greenbelt land, but added: \"We will have a duty to do everything possible to meet the government's new housing targets.\"",
      "Sir Keir's housing minister, Matthew Pennycook, has said if councils fail to deliver enough houses the government could intervene.",
      "\"The government can take a local plan off a local authority that is resisting putting one in place, and we are absolutely willing to do it, if we have evidence that [they] are refusing to comply,\" he told the BBC.",
      "The obstacles",
      "The government said it had \"inherited the worst housing crisis in living memory\" and \"all areas must play their part\".",
      "It has set out \"a major planning overhaul\u2026 unblocking barriers to building, and setting out targets for councils to ramp up housebuilding, so new homes are built where they are most needed.\"",
      "Most housing experts agree planning reform is necessary.",
      "Yet analysts say it is not the only obstacle.",
      "The construction industry has warned it is dealing with a chronic shortage of skilled workers.",
      "The Home Builders Federation has cited aging workers and Brexit as some of the factors behind shortages.",
      "The Construction Industry Training Board estimates the sector needs to attract the equivalent of 50,300 extra workers per year to meet the levels of work expected.",
      "There are also concerns about the availability of basic building materials including bricks and timber.",
      "The Construction Leadership Council has warned a shortage of these could hinder the government's ability to get near its target.",
      "Finally, many housing experts doubt private housebuilders are capable of delivering enough new homes each year to reach the targets.",
      "This is because private housebuilders have a commercial interest in not building so many new homes that their average price declines.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority concluded in February 2024  \"private developers produce houses at a rate at which they can be sold without needing to reduce their prices\".",
      "A sharp decline in residential planning permissions in England in the year to June 2024 - hitting a new record low - was due to a collapse in applications from private builders, not a decline in the share of applications being approved by local authorities.",
      "This collapse in applications probably reflected the impact of still-high mortgage interest rates and high house prices relative to average incomes, undermining the ability of people to afford newly built houses.",
      "That's why some argue meeting the government's targets will also require a major increase in Whitehall grants to not-for-profit local housing associations, enabling them to build tens of thousands of new social and affordable homes, mainly to be rented out, in the coming years.",
      "Interactive tool developed by Allison Shultes, Scott Jarvis and Steven Connor",
      "About the data",
      "Annual data on new homes for England comes from the government's \"net additional dwellings\" statistics.",
      "These figures are estimates of changes in the total number of homes in each area, taking account of new build homes and existing building conversions, minus any demolitions.",
      "The targets are the government's new \"local housing need\" calculations, released following a public consultation.",
      "Planning statistics are taken from quarterly data and combine applications decided for \"minor\" housing developments (fewer than 10 homes) and \"major\" schemes (10 homes or more).",
      "The planning data for England is at local authority level. Applications decided by special authorities, such as those in charge of national parks, are not included.",
      "We have included the latest data on new housebuilding \"completions\" by local authority area for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but the 1.5 million homes target applies only in England.",

He now admits that he had not seen any such circular himself, despite apparently stating its existence as fact.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, he told presenter Carolyn Quinn at the time:",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 00:51:45 GMT",
    "summary": "Nine in 10 new cars in the country are now battery-powered, and it aims to hit 100% later this year.",
    "story": [
      "Norway is the world leader when it comes to the take up of electric cars, which last year accounted for nine out of 10 new vehicles sold in the country. Can other nations learn from it?",
      "For more than 75 years Oslo-based car dealership Harald A M\u00f8ller has been importing Volkswagens, but early in 2024 it bid farewell to fossil fuel cars.",
      "Now all the passenger vehicles for sale in its showroom are electric (EV).",
      "\"We think it's wrong to advise a customer coming in here today to buy an ICE [internal combustion engine] car, because the future is electric,\" says chief executive Ulf Tore Hekneby, as he walks around the cars on display. \"Long-range, high-charging speed. It's hard to go back.\"",
      "On the streets of Norway's capital, Oslo, battery-powered cars aren't a novelty, they're the norm. Take a look around and you'll soon notice that almost every other car has an \"E\" for \"electric\" on its licence plate.",
      "The Nordic nation of 5.5 million people has adopted EVs faster than any other country, and is on the cusp of becoming the first to phase out the sale of new fossil fuel cars.",
      "Last year, the number of electric cars on Norway's roads outnumbered those powered by petrol for the first time. When diesel vehicles are included, electric cars account for almost a third of all on Norwegian roads.",
      "And 88.9% of new cars sold in the country last year were EVs, up from 82.4% in 2023, data from the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) showed.",
      "In some months sales of fully electric cars were as high as 98%, as new petrol or diesel car purchases almost fizzled out.",
      "By contrast, in the UK electric cars made up only 20% of new car registrations in 2024. Although this was a record high, and up from 16.5% in 2023.",
      "In the US, the figure was just 8% last year, up from 7.6%.",
      "Norway is undoubtedly an EV pioneer, but this electric revolution has been three decades in the making.",
      "\"It started already in the early 1990s,\" says Christina Bu, the secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association, as she took me for a spin around Oslo in an electric minivan.",
      "\"Little by little taxing petrol and diesel engine cars more, so they have become a lot more expensive to purchase, whereas electric cars have been exempted from taxes.\"",
      "The support for electric vehicles was first introduced to help two Norwegian manufacturers of early EVs, the Buddy (previously Kewet) and TH!NK City. While they went out of business, the incentives for greener vehicles remained.",
      "\"It's our goal to see that it's always a good and viable choice, to choose zero emission,\" says Norway's Deputy Transport Minister, Cecilie Knibe Kroglund.",
      "Even though it's a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\", starting at some point in 2025. A non-binding goal was set back in 2017, and that milestone now lies within reach.",
      "\"We are closing up on the target, and I think that we will reach that goal,\" adds Kroglund. \"I think we have already made the transition for passengers cars.\"",
      "Key to Norway's success has been long-term and predictable policies, she explains.",
      "Rather than banning combustion engine vehicles, the government has steered consumer choices. In addition to penalising fuel fossil vehicles with higher taxes and registration fees, VAT and import duties were scrapped for low-emission cars.",
      "A string of perks, like free parking, discounted road tolls and access to bus lanes, then followed.",
      "By comparison, the European Union plans to ban sales of new fossil-fuel cars by 2035, and the UK's current government wants to prohibit their sale in 2030.",
      "Petrol and diesel car sales are still permitted in Norway. But few are choosing to buy them.",
      "For many locals, like St\u00e5le Fyen, who bought his first EV 15 months ago, going electric made economic sense.",
      "\"With all the incentives we have in Norway, with no taxes on EVs, that was quite important to us money wise,\" he says while plugging in his car at a charging station in the capital.",
      "\"In the cold, the range is maybe 20% shorter, but still, with the expansive charging network we have here in Norway, that isn't a big issue really,\" Mr Fyen adds. \"You just have to change your mindset and charge when you can, not when you need to.\"",
      "Another driver, Merete Eggesb\u00f8, says that back in 2014 she was one of the first people in Norway to own a Tesla. \"I really wanted a car that didn't pollute. It gave me a better conscience driving.\"",
      "At Norwegian petrol stations many fuel pumps have been replaced by fast-charging points, and across Norway there are now more than 27,000 public chargers.",
      "This compares with 73,699 in the UK - a country 12 times bigger in terms of population.",
      "That means that, per 100,000 people, Norway has 447 chargers while the UK has just 89, according to a recent report.",
      "Tesla, VW and Toyota, were Norway's top-selling EV brands last year. Meanwhile, Chinese-owned marques - such as MG, BYD, Polestar and XPeng - now make up a combined 10% of the market, according to the Norwegian Road Federation.",
      "Norway, unlike the US and EU, has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EV imports.",
      "Ms Bu says there's \"not really any reason why other countries can not copy Norway\". However, she adds that it is \"all about doing it in a way that can work in each country or market\".",
      "Norwegians aren't more environmentally-minded than people elsewhere, she reckons. \"I don't think a green mindset has much to do with it. It has to do with strong policies, and people gradually understanding that driving an electric car is possible.\"",
      "Yet Norway is also a very wealthy nation, which thanks to its huge oil and gas exports, has a sovereign wealth fund worth more than $1.7tn (\u00a31.3tn). This means it can more easily afford big infrastructure-build projects, and absorb the loss of tax revenue from the sale of petrol and diesel cars and their fuel.",
      "The country also has an abundance of renewable hydro electricity, which accounts for 88% of its production capacity.",
      "\"A third of cars are now electric, and it will pass 50% in a few years,\" says Kjell Werner Johansen from the Norwegian Centre for Transport Research. \"I think the government accepts that a few new petrol or hybrid cars will still be on the market, but I don't know anybody who wants to buy a diesel car these days.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 04:13:08 GMT",
    "summary": "Last year was the world's warmest on record, bringing temperatures above a politically symbolic milestone.",
    "story": [
      "The planet has moved a major step closer to warming more than 1.5C, new data shows, despite world leaders vowing a decade ago they would try to avoid this.",
      "The European Copernicus climate service, one of the main global data providers, said on Friday that 2024 was the first calendar year to pass the symbolic threshold, as well as the world's hottest on record.",
      "This does not mean the international 1.5C target has been broken, because that refers to a long-term average over decades, but does bring us nearer to doing so as fossil fuel emissions continue to heat the atmosphere.",
      "Last week UN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described the recent run of temperature records as \"climate breakdown\".",
      "\"We must exit this road to ruin - and we have no time to lose,\" he said in his New Year message, calling for countries to slash emissions of planet-warming gases in 2025.",
      "Global average temperatures for 2024 were around 1.6C above those of the pre-industrial period - the time before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - according to Copernicus data.",
      "This breaks the record set in 2023 by just over 0.1C, and means the last 10 years are now the 10 warmest years on record.",
      "The Met Office, Nasa and other climate groups are due to release their own data later on Friday. All are expected to agree that 2024 was the warmest on record, although precise figures vary slightly.",
      "Last year's heat is predominantly due to humanity's emissions of planet-warming gases, such as carbon dioxide, which are still at record highs.",
      "Natural weather patterns such as El Ni\u00f1o - where surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean become unusually warm - played a smaller role.",
      "\"By far and away the largest contribution impacting our climate is greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere,\" Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, tells the BBC.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "The 1.5C figure has become a powerful symbol in international climate negotiations ever since it was agreed in Paris in 2015, with many of the most vulnerable countries considering it a matter of survival.",
      "The risks from climate change, such as intense heatwaves, rising sea-levels and loss of wildlife, would be much higher at 2C of warming than at 1.5C, according to a landmark UN report from 2018.",
      "Yet the world has been moving closer and closer to breaching the 1.5C barrier.",
      "\"When exactly we will cross the long-term 1.5C threshold is hard to predict, but we're obviously very close now,\" says Myles Allen of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, and an author of the UN report.",
      "The current trajectory would likely see the world pass 1.5C of long-term warming by the early 2030s. This would be politically significant, but it wouldn't mean game over for climate action.",
      "\"It's not like 1.49C is fine, and 1.51C is the apocalypse - every tenth of a degree matters and climate impacts get progressively worse the more warming we have,\" explains Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a research group in the US.",
      "Even fractions of a degree of global warming can bring more frequent and intense extreme weather, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall.",
      "In 2024, the world saw blistering temperatures in west Africa, prolonged drought in parts of South America, intense rainfall in central Europe and some particularly strong tropical storms hitting north America and south Asia.",
      "These events were just some of those made more intense by climate change over the last year, according to the World Weather Attribution group.",
      "Even this week, as the new figures are released, Los Angeles has been overwhelmed with destructive wildfires fuelled by high winds and a lack of rain.",
      "While there are many contributing factors to this week's events, experts say conditions conducive to fires in California are becoming more likely in a warming world.",
      "It wasn't only air temperatures that set new marks in 2024. The world's sea surface also reached a new daily high, while the total amount of moisture in the atmosphere reached record levels.",
      "That the world is breaking new records is not a surprise: 2024 was always expected to be hot, because of the effect of the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern - which ended around April last year - on top of human-caused warming.",
      "But the margin of several records in recent years has been less expected, with some scientists fearing it could represent an acceleration of warming.",
      "\"I think it's safe to say that both 2023 and 2024 temperatures surprised most climate scientists - we didn't think we'd be seeing a year above 1.5C this early,\" says Dr Hausfather.",
      "\"Since 2023 we've had around 0.2C of extra warming that we can't fully explain, on top of what we had expected from climate change and El Ni\u00f1o,\" agrees Helge G\u00f6\u00dfling, a climate physicist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.",
      "Various theories have been suggested to explain this 'extra' warmth, such as an apparent reduction in the low-level cloud cover that tends to cool the planet, and prolonged ocean heat following the end of El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "\"The question is whether this acceleration is something persistent linked to human activities that means we will have steeper warming in the future, or whether it is a part of natural variability,\" Dr G\u00f6\u00dfling adds.",
      "\"At the moment it's very hard to say.\"",
      "Despite this uncertainty, scientists stress that humans still have control over the future climate, and sharp reductions in emissions can lessen the consequences of warming.",
      "\"Even if 1.5 degrees is out the window, we still can probably limit warming to 1.6C, 1.7C or 1.8C this century,\" says Dr Hausfather.",
      "\"That's going to be far, far better than if we keep burning coal, oil and gas unabated and end up at 3C or 4C - it still really matters.\"",

      "\"I looked up in the sky to see if there was smoke. Nothing.",
      "\"I rushed to the road to check if there had been an accident. Also, nothing. That is when someone told me that something had fallen from the skies.\"",

      "\"We found a big piece of metal that was very red so we had to wait for it to cool before anyone could approach it,\" said Ann Kanuna, who told us she owns the land where the object fell.",
      "The giant ring took around two hours to cool down and turn grey \u2013 but it had already become a sensation with people arriving to look at it.",
      "The rest of that Monday afternoon - with few people working as it was the day before New Year's Eve - crowds came to view the giant metallic ring.",
      "It was like selfie central, with people coming to pose next to it and great debates about what it could be.",
      "The local authorities in Makueni county - which is around 115km (70 miles) south-east of the capital, Nairobi - were informed.",
      "The Kenya Space Agency (KSA) then heard about it and made arrangements to come and investigate the next day.",
      "But such was the object's fame that Mukuku villagers feared it would be stolen overnight.",
      "Together with local officers, some of them took it in turns to stand guard, lighting a fire nearby. They wanted to keep away potential scrap dealers and others wanting to make money out of the curiosity.",
      "It is said to weigh more than 500kg (1,102lb) - around the same as an adult horse - and is around 2.5m (8ft) in diameter, roughly the size of child's four-seater merry-go-round.",
      "With daylight came more onlookers on New Year's Eve - followed by the KSA team and the media.",
      "Mukuku had never seen such activity. When the object was carted away later that day by the KSA, the buzz gave way to concerns about what the villagers had had in their midst.",
      "The KSA said its preliminary assessments indicated the object was \"a separation ring\" from a space launch rocket.",
      "\"Such objects are usually designed to burn up as they re-enter the Earth's atmosphere or to fall over unoccupied areas, such as the oceans,\" its statement said the next day.",
      "No-one was injured when it had fallen but some in Mukuku began to complain that the impact of the crash had caused damage to nearby houses.",
      "Christine Kionga, who lives about a kilometre from the crash site, showed us cracks in the concrete of some of the buildings in her home compound. She said they had appeared after the crash.",

      "\"The government needs to find the owners of this object, and get compensation for those affected by it,\" Mukuku resident Benson Mutuku told the BBC.",
      "There were reports in the local media that some residents had begun to complain of feeling unwell after exposure to the metallic ring though there was no confirmation from those we spoke to when we visited - nor from the authorities or the KSA.",
      "Nonetheless Mr Mutuku said there were concerns about the long-term effects of possible space radiation.",
      "\"This is a space object and we have heard in other similar incidents that there have been effects of radiation affecting even future generations and there is that fear in this community.\"",
      "However tests run later by the Kenya Nuclear Regulatory Authority revealed that while the metal ring did have higher radiation levels than the area in which it was found, they were not at a level harmful to humans.",
      "Engineers from the KSA, which was established in 2017 to promote, co-ordinate and regulate space-related activities in the East African nation, are continuing to run other tests to find out more about the object.",
      "The KSA director general said it was lucky that no significant damage was done when the object hurtled to Earth.",
      "\"The ultimate responsibility for any damage or injury caused by that space object is on the state in whose jurisdiction that operator may have launched the object,\" Brigadier Hillary Kipkosgey told the BBC.",
      "According to the Outer Space Treaty, overseen by the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs, \"states shall be liable for damage caused by their space objects\".",
      "\"[The ring] is a common item in many rockets and many space objects so it difficult to attribute it to a specific rocket or space object but we have leads but as I said our investigations are not conclusive,\" Brigadier Kipkosgey said.",
      "The BBC showed pictures of the object to the UK Space Agency to get the thoughts of its experts.",
      "\"The most plausible object it could be is the upper stage separation ring from an Ariane rocket in 2008,\" its launch director, Matt Archer, said.",
      "\"The satellites are fine, but the actual rocket body has come through and de-orbited.\"",
      "The Ariane was Europe's main rocket launch vehicle, helping more than 230 satellites into orbit, before it was retired in 2023.",
      "It seems the separation ring may have been orbiting Earth for 16 years before making its unexpected appearance in Mukuku.",
      "This is not the first incident of space junk appearing in East Africa.",
      "Just over a year and a half ago some suspected space debris fell over several villages in western Uganda.",
      "And a few days ago, on 8 January, there were unconfirmed reports of what was believed to be space debris burning brightly in the skies above northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia.",
      "As the space industry grows, it is predicted that such incidents will become more frequent - and African governments may need to invest in ways to better detect this speeding space rubbish.",
      "Nasa estimates there are more than 6,000 tonnes of space debris in orbit at the moment.",
      "There are many different estimates about the chances of such junk hitting someone, but most are in the one-in-10,000 range.",
      "Such statistics are little comfort for Mukuku's residents, who cannot help thinking of what damage the ring could have caused had it landed in the centre of the village instead of on farmland.",

    "summary": "Leading tech firms are said to have committed \u00a314bn towards the project, which could create more than 13,000 jobs.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence presents a \"vast potential\" for rejuvenating UK public services, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said on Monday.",
      "In a speech setting out the government's plans to use AI across the UK to boost growth and deliver services more efficiently, Sir Keir said the government had a responsibility to make AI \"work for working people\".",
      "The AI Opportunities Action Plan is backed by leading tech firms, some of which have committed \u00a314bn towards various projects, creating 13,250 jobs, the government said.",
      "But the government faces questions over how much time and money will be needed to make its vision a reality, amid concerns over borrowing costs and the falling value of the pound.",
      "The plan includes proposals for growth zones where development will be focused, and suggests the technology will be used to help tackle issues such as potholes.",
      "While estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) support the claim that AI could increase productivity, it also says the changes may come gradually.",
      "The government tasked AI adviser Matt Clifford with creating a UK action plan for supporting the growth of artificial intelligence and its use in public services.",
      "He came back with 50 recommendations which are now being implemented.",
      "Among these is for the UK to invest in a new supercomputer to boost computing power - marking a change in strategy after the Labour government ditched the previous government's plans for a supercomputer at Edinburgh University.",
      "Sir Keir said AI \"will drive incredible change\" in the country and \"has the potential to transform the lives of working people\".",
      "\"We're going to make AI work for everyone in our country,\" he added, saying the \"battle for the jobs of tomorrow is happening today\".",
      "Sir Keir said the UK would become one of the AI \"superpowers\" - mirroring former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's drive to boost the UK sector so it could rival that of the US and China.",
      "At the time, many of Sunak's proposals were geared towards mitigating future risks of highly powerful AI systems.",
      "In October 2023, he said AI could enable faster, easier production of chemical and biological weapons, or be used by terrorist groups to spread disinformation.",
      "He added that in a worst-case scenario, society could lose control over AI.",
      "His government's emphasis on \"safety\" seems largely absent in this new plan  - instead focusing on maximising opportunities, growth and innovation.",
      "The pivot away from the previous narrative of caution and safety suggests the government has decided the UK should attempt to compete in the AI arms race, currently lead by major global players including the US and China.",
      "However, building data centres and boosting the nation's computing power will not happen overnight.",
      "This means the government is unlikely to see the end results of this major project ahead of the next general election - when Labour will have to convince voters that it was still the right decision, at a time when public finances remain stretched.",
      "Professor Dame Wendy Hall said the proposals were \"ambitious\", but necessary to help the UK keep up with the pace of development.",
      "\"It's an ambitious plan but there's a lot of upfront investment,\" she told BBC Radio Four's Today programme.",
      "\"It will take some time to see a return on that investment and they've got to be in it for the long-term.\"",
      "How the AI plan could affect you",
      "Among the government's proposals are:",
      "AI will be used by the public sector to enable its workers to spend less time doing admin and more time delivering services.Several \"AI Growth Zones\" around the UK will be created, involving big building projects and new jobs.AI will be fed through cameras around the country to inspect roads and spot potholes that need fixing Teachers and small business owners were highlighted as two groups that could start using AI for things like faster planning and record-keeping.AI is already being used in UK hospitals for important tasks such as diagnosing cancer more quickly and it will continue to be used to support the NHS.",

      "But shadow science secretary Alan Mak said Labour was \"delivering analogue government in a digital age\".",
      "While the push towards AI is seen as way of cutting down on public spending, Mak accused Labour of undermining this goal with its economic policies.",
      "\"Labour's economic mismanagement and uninspiring plan will mean Britain is left behind,\" he said.",
      "Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle told the BBC there was no reason why the UK could not create tech companies on the same scale as Google, Amazon, and Apple.",

      "He highlighted DeepMind, which created technology enabling computers to play video and board games, as an example of a former British-born company that was now US-owned.",
      "It was founded by three University College London students before its acquisition by Google.",
      "Tim Flagg, chief operating officer of UKAI - a trade body representing British AI businesses - said the proposals take a \"narrow view\" of the sector's contributors and focus too much on big tech.",
      "\"AI innovation spans industries, from small enterprises to non-tech sectors, all driving the new industrial revolution,\" he said.",
      "\"It's time the government recognised this broader definition and tapped into the full potential of AI across the UK.\"",
      "What is AI and how does it work?",
      "Is AI the answer for better government services?",
      "AI 'not perfect'",
      "There are continuing questions over the risks of introducing AI systems that can \"hallucinate\" or make things up, or discriminate against certain groups of people due to bias.",
      "Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said \"we're only at the foothills of this\" and AI was a developing technology.",
      "He said a government-developed AI teaching assistant had been used by about 30,000 teachers in England so far.",
      "\"It saves teachers about three-and-half hours a week - gives them their Sunday evening back, if you like, in terms of lesson preparation and classroom preparation,\" he told BBC Breakfast.",
      "McFadden said AI applications used by the health service can detect some cancers earlier which are not detectable by the human eye.",
      "However he acknowledged AI was \"not perfect\" after Apple faced calls to withdraw a controversial feature that generated inaccurate news alerts on its latest iPhones.",
      "\"We've got to have an eye on safety as well as opportunity,\" McFadden said.",

    "story": [
      "UK laws on internet safety are \"very uneven\" and \"unsatisfactory\", Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has said, following calls from campaigners to tighten the rules.",
      "On Saturday, Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life at 14 after seeing harmful content online, said the UK was \"going backwards\" on the issue.",
      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",
      "The Conservative government had originally included in the legislation plans to compel social media companies to remove some \"legal-but-harmful\" content, such as posts promoting eating disorders.",
      "However the proposal triggered a backlash from critics, including the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who were concerned it could lead to censorship.",
      "In July 2022, Badenoch, who was not then a minister, said the bill was in \"no fit state to become law\" adding: \"We should not be legislating for hurt feelings.\"",
      "Another Conservative MP, David Davis, said it risked \"the biggest accidental curtailment of free speech in modern history\".",
      "The plan was dropped for adult social media users and instead companies were required to give users more control to filter out content they did not want to see. The law still expects companies to protect children from legal-but-harmful content.",
      "Kyle said the section on legal-but-harmful content had been taken out of the bill adding: \"So I inherited a landscape where we have a very uneven, unsatisfactory legislative settlement.\"",
      "He did not commit to making changes to the current legislation but said he was \"very open-minded\" on the subject.",
      "He also said the act contained some \"very good powers\" he was using to \"assertively\" tackle new safety concerns and that in the coming months ministers would get the powers to make sure online platforms were providing age-appropriate content.",
      "Companies that did not comply with the law would face \"very strident\" sanctions, he said.",

      "He said Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Meta which owns Facebook and Instagram, and Elon Musk, owner of the social media site X, were \"at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry\".",
      "He accused Zuckerberg of moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\" and \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to\".",
      "Earlier this week, Zuckerberg said Meta would be getting rid of fact checkers, and instead adopt a system \u2013 already introduced by X - of allowing users to add \"community notes\" to social media posts they deemed to be untrue.",
      "This marked a change from Meta's previous approach, introduced in 2016, whereby third party moderators would check posts on Facebook and Instagram that appeared to be false or misleading.",
      "Content flagged as inaccurate would be moved lower in users' feeds and accompanied by labels offering viewers more information on the subject.",
      "Defending the new system, Zuckerberg said moderators were \"too politically biased\" and it was \"time to get back to our roots around free expression\".",
      "The step comes as Meta seeks to improve relations with incoming US President Donald Trump who has previously accused the company of censoring right-wing voices.",
      "Zuckerberg said the change - which only applies in the US - would mean content moderators would \"catch less bad stuff\" but would also reduce the number of \"innocent\" posts being removed.",
      "Responding to Russell's criticism, a Meta spokesperson told the BBC there was \"no change to how we treat content that encourages suicide, self-injury, and eating disorders\" and said the company would \"continue to use our automated systems to scan for that high-severity content\".",
      "Asked about the change, Kyle said the announcement was \"an American statement for American service users\" adding: \"There is one thing that has not changed and that is the law of this land.\"",
      "\"If you come and operate in this country you abide by the law, and the law says illegal content must be taken down,\" he said.",
      "Rules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force later this year, compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide.",
      "The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography, material promoting self-harm, bullying and content encouraging dangerous stunts.",
      "Platforms will be expected to adopt \"age assurance technologies\" to prevent children from seeing harmful content.",
      "The law also requires companies to take action against illegal, state-sponsored disinformation. If their services are likely to be accessed by children they should also take steps to protect users against misinformation."

      "She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her \u201ctwo to three minutes per consultation, if not more\u201d. She reels off other benefits: \u201cIt reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.\"",

      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",

      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",

      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",

    "summary": "Fabriccio and Luc\u00eda run the only fully equipped film lab in Central America",
    "story": [
      "\"It all started as a small passion project,\" says Fabriccio D\u00edaz, 28, who, together with his wife Luc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, 25, runs the only fully operational photo film development lab in Central America from their apartment in Guatemala City.",
      "\"Now we have over 60 clients a month and have developed over 800 rolls just this year,\" he adds.",
      "Arca Film Lab has been in high demand this year and is the only photo film development lab in Central America that develops every type of analogue photography film, which includes the rather complicated process of developing positives in a process known as E-6.",
      "Fabriccio, who studied cinematography, explains that the great inaccessibility of high-quality film development services in Central America gave him the first decisive push to learn how to develop his first film.",
      "\"When we started experimenting and developing film in our apartment, friends started asking us to develop film for them and it all just took off somehow,\" Luc\u00eda recalls.",
      "And so, the Arca Film Lab was born in September 2023 as a simple Instagram page offering film development services in Guatemala.",
      "The couple have taught themselves most of the skills needed to develop film by watching YouTube videos and by reaching out to other film labs internationally and asking for tips.",
      "\"We were surprised that so many people responded to our questions. A lot of the veterans in the photo development world helped us out by sharing their experiences and tricks. We are really grateful for that,\" says Fabriccio.",
      "Fabriccio and Luc\u00eda's love of photography is not confined to developing film, though. The couple also organise \"photo walks\" in which a group of people get together in Antigua, the old centre of Guatemala City, to take pictures and experiment with old analogue cameras.",
      "For young analogue photography enthusiasts like Iv\u00e1n Ortiz, 22, snapping photos with a camera which is older than he is gives him something modern cameras cannot compete with.",
      "\"It's like having nostalgia for a generation we were never a part of,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Iv\u00e1n says that older people do not always get the recent hype for old cameras and film. \"They just don't understand our perspective,\" he explains.",
      "\"We live in a world where everything is digital and fast. Through analogue photography, I have to make conscious decisions about my photos and focus solely on the act of photographing. And the best part of it is that you have something physical afterwards, and not just another data file,\" he adds.",
      "Having physical photos to hold is also something that Steven L\u00f3pez from the US highlights as an advantage of analogue photography.",
      "The 33-year-old is travelling through Central America to document the last traces of Mayan culture and always carries a 35mm analogue camera with him.",
      "\"Photography and especially analogue photography is just the best way to document and experience cultures. Every time I get back from travelling and get the developed film back it's like Christmas!\", he tells the BBC.",
      "The community of analogue photography enthusiasts in Central America may be growing quickly, but the challenges are greater than in other places.",
      "\"It is really hard to get analogue cameras here and it is even harder to get them in good condition,\" explains 26-year-old Ronald Ottoniel, who went on the photo walk to buy new rolls of film and turn in others to be developed.",
      "And there are other hurdles, too.",
      "Fabriccio and Luc\u00eda explain that the process of buying and importing the chemicals needed to develop positive film has been extremely complicated because the import of these chemicals is closely monitored by the state and requires special permits, which has made it a painstakingly long ordeal.",
      "\"Many other labs don't offer the E-6 processing just because it's so complicated to import the chemicals,\" says Fabriccio.",
      "Their business may be expanding, but Fabriccio and Luc\u00eda are determined to make sure it does not lose the personal touch and passion which inspired it in the first place.",
      "Luc\u00eda explains how sometimes clients \"put little sweets into the packages they send us and sometimes we send a handwritten note back\".",
      "\"It's important to us that this is not a mass-producing business, but that every client is [treated as] an individual,\" she adds.",
      "Around the world, photo labs use large machines that develop the film almost completely automatically, but in the humble apartment of Fabriccio and Luc\u00eda, the process is very much \"hands-on\".",
      "For colour and positive (E-6) film the temperature of the chemicals and the time the film is exposed to them has to be exact, otherwise, the entire film roll will turn out badly.",
      "\"The beginning was definitely not easy with this entire process, but after developing over 800 film rolls these processes come like second nature to us,\" recalls Fabriccio.",
      "\"But the first time we developed the positive films, the E-6 process, we were so nervous because we had invested so much in the chemicals and the roll. But when it came out well and we were able to see these lively colours of the positive film it's always very exciting,\" he adds.",
      "Another indispensable member of the Arca Film Lab is Toto, the four-month-old cat that is, according to Fabriccio and Luc\u00eda, in charge of quality control and roves around during the entire development process.",
      "The developed film rolls are then transferred from the kitchen to the bathroom, as it is the most dust-free space in the house.",
      "There they dry, to be later scanned in a high-resolution Nikon scanner, which Fabriccio says is the highest-resolution film scanner in Central America.",
      "Fabriccio and Luc\u00eda have now also expanded to El Salvador, where they regularly collect and sell film rolls.",
      "The young couple remains ambitious and in the future, they say they hope to establish a strong relationship with CineStill and Eastman Kodak andto expand to developing cine film rolls, which would include a complicated process known as ECN-2.",
      "\"It is my dream to revitalise the classical cinematography scene here in Central America! We have so much talent expertise and enthusiasm to offer the world. (...) with Arca Film Lab we have started a movement that we want to push further and further,\" says Fabriccio.",

      "Dressed in a black gown, Ms Nkom delivers her stark message in a measured voice that reflects years of thoughtful legal argument.",
      "According to the country's penal code, both men and women found guilty of homosexual sex can be sentenced to up to five years in prison and made to pay a fine. Members of the LGBT community also face being ostracized by their families and wider society.",
      "As a result, Ms Nkom has been viewed as a surrogate parent to some in her country who have been open about their sexuality with their family.",
      "The legal expert has children of her own, but hundreds, maybe thousands, of others look up to her as their protector following her work over more than two decades to defend those accused of homosexuality.",

      "But her journey to become one of Cameroon's most outspoken legal figures began well before that.",
      "In 1969, aged 24, she became the country's first black female lawyer, after studying in both France \u2013 the former colonial power - and Cameroon.",
      "She says she was encouraged to pursue her studies by her then boyfriend, who later became her husband.",
      "Her earlier legal work involved representing the less well-off and disadvantaged but it was a chance encounter in 2003 that led her to become involved in the fight to decriminalise homosexuality.",
      "She was at the public prosecutor's office in Douala when she observed a group of young people handcuffed in pairs, who did not have the courage to look up.",

      "This offended her sense of human rights and she was very clear that sexual minorities should be included among those whose rights were protected by the constitution.",
      "\"I decided to fight to ensure that this fundamental right of freedom was respected,\" Ms Nkom adds.",
      "She went on to found the Association for the Defence of Homosexuality (Adefho) in 2003.",
      "Since then she has been involved in dozens of cases. One of the most high-profile in recent years was her defence of transgender celebrity Shakiro and a friend, Patricia, in 2021.",
      "The two were arrested while eating in a restaurant and then charged with \"attempted homosexuality\".",
      "They were sentenced to five years for contravening the penal code and outraging public decency.",

      "Shakiro, along with Patricia, was later released pending an appeal and has since fled the country.",
      "Since then the situation for LGBT people has not improved. LGBT activist S\u00e9bastien, who runs a charity to support families with homosexual children, feels things have got worse recently.",
      "Last year, a song based on the popular mbol\u00e9 rhythm with a title and lyrics that encouraged people to target and kill homosexuals, was released. It is still being widely shared, and is regularly played in the trendiest places in the country's major cities.",
      "\"People attack us because of this song, which glorifies crime,\" says S\u00e9bastien.",
      "LGBT people have to hide their sexual identities but \"some people set traps to get close to us and attack us or report us to the police\", he says.",

      "The hum of sewing machines is a constant in parts of Guangzhou, a thriving port on the Pearl River in southern China.",
      "It rattles through the open windows of factories from morning until late at night, as they finish the t-shirts, shorts, blouses, pants and swimwear that will be shipped to fill wardrobes in more than 150 countries.",
      "This is the sound of Panyu, the neighbourhood known as the \"Shein village\", a warren of factories that power the world's largest fast fashion retailer.",
      "\"If there are 31 days in a month, I will work 31 days,\" one worker told the BBC.",
      "Most said they only have one day off a month.",
      "The BBC spent several days here: we visited 10 factories, spoke to four owners and more than 20 workers. We also spent time at labour markets and textile suppliers.",
      "We found that the beating heart of this empire is a workforce sitting behind sewing machines for around 75 hours a week in contravention of Chinese labour laws.",
      "These hours are not unusual in Guangzhou, an industrial hub for rural workers in search of a higher income; or in China, which has long been the world's unrivalled factory.",
      "But they add to a growing list of questions about Shein, once a little-known Chinese-founded company that has become a global behemoth in just over five years.",
      "Still privately-owned, it was valued at about \u00a354bn ($66bn) in a fundraising round in 2023. It is now eyeing a potential listing on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "Its meteoric rise, however, has been dogged with controversy about its treatment of workers and allegations of forced labour.",
      "Last year it admitted to finding children working in its factories in China.",
      "The company declined to be interviewed but told the BBC in a statement that \"Shein is committed to ensuring the fair and dignified treatment of all workers within our supply chain\" and is investing tens of millions of dollars in strengthening governance and compliance.",
      "It added: \"We strive to set the highest standards for pay and we require that all supply chain partners adhere to our code of conduct. Furthermore, Shein works with auditors to ensure compliance.\"",
      "Shein's success lies in volume - the inventory online runs into the hundreds of thousands - and deep discounts: \u00a310 dresses, \u00a36 sweaters, prices that hover below \u00a38 on average.",
      "Revenue has soared, outstripping the likes of H&M, Zara and the UK's Primark. The cut-price sales are driven by places like the Shein village, home to some 5,000 factories, most of them Shein suppliers.",
      "The buildings have been hollowed out to make way for sewing machines, rolls of fabric and bags brimming with cloth scraps. The doors to their basements are always open for the seemingly endless cycle of deliveries and collections.",
      "As the day passes, the shelves fill up with warehouse-bound, clear plastic bags labelled with a now-distinctive five-letter noun.",
      "But even past 22:00, the sewing machines - and the people hunched over them - don't stop as more fabric arrives, in trucks so full that bolts of colour sometimes tumble onto the factory floor.",
      "\"We usually work, 10, 11 or 12 hours a day,\" says a 49-year-old woman from Jiangxi unwilling to give her name. \"On Sundays we work around three hours less.\"",
      "She is in an alleyway, where a dozen people are huddled around a row of bulletin boards.",
      "They are reading the job ads on the board, while examining the stitching on a pair of chinos draped over it.",
      "This is Shein's supply chain. The factories are contracted to make clothes on order - some small, some big. If the chinos are a hit, orders will ramp up and so must production. Factories then hire temporary workers to meet the demand their permanent staff cannot fulfil.",
      "The migrant worker from Jiangxi is looking for a short-term contract - and the chinos are an option.",
      "\"We earn so little. The cost of living is now so high,\" she says, adding that she hopes to make enough to send back to her two children who are living with their grandparents.",
      "\"We get paid per piece,\" she explains. \"It depends how difficult the item is. Something simple like a t-shirt is one-two yuan [less than a dollar] per piece and I can make around a dozen in an hour.\"",
      "Examining the stitching on the chinos is crucial for making that decision. All around her, workers are calculating how much they will get paid to make each piece of clothing and how many they can make in an hour.",
      "The alleys of Panyu function as labour markets, filling up in the mornings as workers and scooters rush past the breakfast dumpling cart, the cups of steaming soybean milk and the hopeful farmer selling chicken and duck eggs.",
      "Standard working hours appear to be from 08:00 to well past 22:00, the BBC found.",
      "This is consistent with a report from the Swiss advocacy group Public Eye, which was based on interviews with 13 textile workers at factories producing clothes for Shein.",
      "They found that a number of staff were working excessive overtime. It noted the basic wage without overtime was 2,400 yuan (\u00a3265; $327) - below the 6,512 yuan the Asia Floor Wage Alliance says is needed for a \"living wage\". But the workers we spoke to managed to earn anywhere between 4,000 and 10,000 yuan a month.",
      "\"These hours are not unusual, but it's clear that it's illegal and it violates basic human rights,\" said David Hachfield from the group. \"It's an extreme form of exploitation and this needs to be visible.\"",
      "The average working week should not exceed 44 hours, according to Chinese labour laws, which also state that employers should ensure workers have at least one rest day a week. If an employer wants to extend these hours, it should be for special reasons.",
      "While Shein's headquarters are now in Singapore, there is no denying the majority of its products are made in China.",
      "And Shein's success has drawn the attention of Washington, which is increasingly wary of Chinese firms.",
      "In June, Donald Trump's pick for US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, said he had  \"grave ethics concerns\" about Shein's \"deep ties to the People's Republic of China\": \"Slave labour, sweatshops, and trade tricks are the dirty secrets behind Shein's success,\" he wrote.",
      "Not everyone would agree with Rubio's choice of words to describe the conditions at Shein's suppliers. But rights groups say that the long working hours, which have become a way of life for many in Guangzhou, are unfair and exploitative.",
      "The machines dictate the rhythm of the day.",
      "They pause for lunch and dinner when the workers, metal plates and chopsticks in hand, file into the canteen to buy food. If there is no more space to sit, they stand in the street.",
      "\"I've been working in these factories for more than 40 years,\" said one woman who spent just 20 minutes eating her meal. This was just another day for her.",
      "Inside, the factories we visit are not cramped. There is enough light and industrial-sized fans have been brought in to keep workers cool. Huge posters urge staff to report underage workers - likely a response to finding two cases of child labour in the supply chain last year.",
      "The BBC understands that the company is keeping a closer eye on its suppliers ahead of plans to go public on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "\"This is about their reputation,\" says Sheng Lu, a professor in Fashion and Apparel Studies at the University of Delaware. \"If Shein can successfully achieve an IPO then it means they are recognised as a decent company. But if they are to keep the confidence of investors, they have to take some responsibility.\"",
      "One of the biggest challenges Shein faces is accusations that it sources cotton from China's Xinjiang region.",
      "Once touted as among the world's best fabric, Xinjiang's cotton has fallen out of favour after allegations that it is produced using forced labour by people from the Muslim Uyghur minority - a charge that Beijing has consistently denied.",
      "The only way to get around this criticism is to be more transparent, Prof Sheng says.",
      "\"Unless you fully release your factory list, unless you make your supply chain more transparent to the public, then I think it's going to be very challenging for Shein.\"",
      "A major advantage, he adds, is that Shein's supply chain is in China: \"Very few countries have a complete supply chain. China has this - and nobody can compete.\"",
      "Aspiring rivals like Vietnam and Bangladesh import raw materials from China to make clothes. But Chinese factories rely entirely on local sources for everything, from fabric to zippers and buttons. So it's easy to make a variety of garments, and they are able to do it quickly.",
      "That especially works for Shein whose algorithm determines orders. If shoppers repeatedly click on a certain dress, or spend longer looking at a wool sweater, the firm knows to ask factories to make more - and fast.",
      "For workers in Guangzhou, this can be a challenge.",
      "\"Shein has its pros and cons,\" one factory owner told us. \"The good thing is the order is eventually big, but profit is low and it's fixed.\"",
      "Shein, given its size and influence, is a hard bargainer. So factory owners have to cut costs elsewhere, often resulting in lower staff wages.",
      "\"Before Shein, we produced and sold clothes on our own,\" said an owner of three factories. \"We could estimate the cost, decide the price  and calculate the profit. Now Shein controls the price, and you have to think about ways to reduce the cost.\"",
      "When orders peak, however, it's a bonanza. The company ships around one million packages a day on average, according to data from ShipMatrix, a logistics consultancy firm.",
      "\"Shein is a pillar of the fashion industry,\" said Guo Qing E, a Shein supplier.",
      "\"I started when Shein started. I witnessed its rise. To be honest, Shein is an awesome company in China. I think it will become stronger, because it pays on time. This is where it is most trustworthy.",
      "\"If payment for our goods is due on the 15th, no matter whether it's millions or tens of millions, the money will be paid on time.\"",
      "Shein, with its gruelling hours and sometimes lower wages, may not be a source of comfort to all its workers. But it is a source of pride for some.",
      "\"This is the contribution we Chinese people can make to the world,\" said a 33- year-old supervisor from Guangdong, who didn't want to give her name.",
      "It's dark outside and workers are filing back into factories after their dinner for the final stretch. She admits the hours are long, but \"we get on well with each other. We are like a family\".",
      "Hours later, after many workers head home for the night, the lights in several buildings stay on.",
      "Some people work until midnight, one factory owner told us. They want to earn more money, he said.",
      "After all, in London, Chicago, Singapore, Dubai and so many other places, someone is hunting for their next bargain.",

    "title": "Three things that could make a Gaza hostage deal more likely",
    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 14:13:36 GMT",
    "summary": "There is fresh anticipation about the talks after several shifts, both politically and on the ground.",
    "story": [
      "The outline of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal currently being discussed by Israel and Hamas at indirect talks in Doha has been on the table since May. So why is there fresh anticipation that it could work, after being frozen for eight months of the war?",
      "There are several things that have shifted - both politically and on the ground.",
      "The first is the election of Donald Trump as the next US president.",
      "He has threatened that \"all hell\" would break loose if the hostages were not released before he took office on 20 January.",
      "Hamas may well read that as a sign that even the flimsy brakes the Biden administration used to try and rein in the Israeli government would be lifted, though it is hard to imagine what that might mean for a territory already so shattered by 15 months of war.",
      "Israel too is feeling the pressure from the incoming president to end the conflict in Gaza, which threatens to interfere with Trump's hopes to secure a wider regional deal, and his desired image as a president who ends wars.",
      "Biden and Netanyahu discuss Gaza ceasefire talks as momentum builds",
      "Biden and Netanyahu discuss Gaza ceasefire talks as momentum builds",
      "On the other hand, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces continued pressure from his far-right coalition allies to continue the war.",
      "But Trump could also be an asset for him in persuading his allies to swallow the deal and stay in the government; the new US president and the man he picked as Israeli ambassador are seen as supportive of Israel's settlements in the occupied West Bank, which Israel's far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has said he wants to annex.",
      "But after a meeting with the prime minister last night, Smotrich appeared unconvinced, writing on social media that the current deal was \"a catastrophe\" for Israel's national security and that he would not support it.",
      "Some in Israel, though, believe that both Smotrich and his far-right ally, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, see their current role in Israel's government as their best chance to cement control over the West Bank, especially with Trump returning to the White House, and that they are unlikely to follow through with their threats to quit.",
      "The second thing that has shifted is growing pressure on Netanyahu from his own military establishment.",
      "Key figures are widely reported to have challenged him repeatedly on the dwindling military goals in continuing the war, after the killing of the top Hamas leadership, and the decimation of Gaza.",
      "Last week, 10 Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza, shining a fresh spotlight on the costs of the war to Israel, and on the perennial question of whether the \"total victory\" over Hamas that Netanyahu has promised is achievable.",
      "Some analysts now suggest that Hamas is rebuilding faster than Israel is defeating it, and therefore Israel needs to reconsider its strategy.",
      "And there's a third - regional - shift playing into the shift in expectations here too: the weakening and erosion of Hamas allies in Iran's \"Axis of Resistance\", from Hezbollah in Lebanon to Bashar al-Assad in Syria, along with killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza.",
      "For all these reasons, now is seen as the best chance in months to bridge the gaps between Israel and Hamas and bring an end to the war.",
      "What has not shifted in the eight months since they were last negotiating are the gaps between them.",
      "Key among them is a direct conflict between the key concern of Hamas, which wants to end the war, and that of Israel, which wants to keep the door open to resuming the conflict, whether for political or military reasons.",
      "The deal, as outlined by President Joe Biden in May, is divided into three phases, with a permanent ceasefire only coming into effect in phase two.",
      "Success now will likely depend on whether guarantees can be found to allay Hamas fears that Israel will pull out of the deal after the first phase of hostage releases.",
      "Questions over how to administer territory that Israel pulls back from are also unclear at this stage.",
      "But the web of diplomacy criss-crossing the region over the past week, and the fact that Netanyahu has sent the heads of Israel's security agencies to the talks in Doha, along with a key political adviser, are encouraging signs.",
      "So too is the departure for Doha of the Palestinian detainee co-ordinator, Qadoura Fares.",
      "The deal is not yet done - and talks have fallen apart before.",
      "This old deal is fuelling fresh hopes partly because negotiations are taking place in a new regional context, with growing pressures both internally and from key allies abroad.",
      "Gaza war death toll could be significantly higher, researchers say",
      "Hamas lists 34 hostages it may free under ceasefire"

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 00:12:42 GMT",
    "summary": "The 46th president had his accomplishments - but for now these are partly overshadowed by certain missteps",
    "story": [
      "Standing at a lectern at Washington's National Cathedral last Thursday, Joe Biden delivered the eulogy for former President Jimmy Carter while three other former presidents \u2013 Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama \u2013 and the once and future president, Donald Trump, looked on.",
      "Each spectating president had achieved the validation of the American people (re-election to a second term) that has eluded Biden. And as Biden, whose term comes to an end next week, paid tribute to Carter, a fellow one-term president, it was hard not to draw other parallels too.",
      "\"Many think he was from a bygone era, but in reality, he saw well into the future,\" Biden said of Carter. He went on to note Carter's accomplishments in advancing civil rights, his work on peace and nuclear non-proliferation, and his efforts to protect the environment.",
      "Earlier in the week, however, Biden was making the case for his own legacy and how history should judge him.",
      "\"I hope that history says that I came in and I had a plan how to restore the economy and reestablish America's leadership in the world,\" he said in a television interview. \"And I hope it records that I did it with honesty and integrity; that I said what was on my mind.\"",
      "Whether that happens is subject to vigorous discussion - but he exits the White House with his approval ratings near their lowest mark of his presidency. Only 39% have a positive view, according to the latest Gallup survey, down from 57% at the start of his term.",
      "Next week, the man he defeated in 2020 returns to power, marking what must feel to him like a dour end to a presidency.",
      "Biden had his accomplishments \u2013 adroitly shepherding complex investment and infrastructure legislation through Congress despite narrow majorities, strengthening and expanding Nato, and appointing a remarkable number of diverse judges to the federal bench  \u2013 but at least for now, that is overshadowed.",
      "His current place in history is as the Democratic interregnum between the two Trump presidential terms. A blip, rather than a pivot.",
      "\"He'd like his legacy to be that he rescued us from Trump,\" says author and Democratic strategist Susan Estrich. \"But sadly, for him, his legacy is Trump again. He is the bridge from Trump One to Trump Two.\"",
      "It didn't have to be this way. Biden and his team were buffeted by events \u2013 some within his control and some outside it. Many of the most damaging developments were entirely predictable, however \u2013 and, in fact, predicted - yet the president and his administration appeared to be caught flat-footed.",
      "For that, they paid a high price.",
      "From Kabul chaos to early 'missteps'",
      "Biden's first misstep as president came half a world away, in the chaos that unfolded during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021.",
      "The exit had been negotiated during the final months of the Trump administration, but Biden backed it \u2013 despite warnings from some of his military advisors.",
      "Those dire predictions proved prophetic, as Kabul descended into panic and unrest.",
      "By the end of that month, Biden's Gallup approval rating had dipped below 50% for the first time \u2013 a mark it would never again reach.",
      "On the domestic front, the situation for the president was equally inauspicious. By summer, US inflation had surpassed 5% for the first time in 30 years.",
      "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that she believed the spike was \"transitory\". Biden called it \"temporary\". Some outside the administration, most notably Obama's economy adviser Larry Summers, thought otherwise.",
      "By the time inflation reached its peak a year later, at 9.1% in June 2022, Yellen and Biden had admitted they miscalculated.",
      "Americans did not forget or forgive, however. And although the monthly inflation numbers had dropped below 3% by summer 2024, unemployment remained low, economic growth was steady and the US had outperformed the world's other industrialised nations, voters continued to have a pessimistic view of the economy.",
      "Other issues followed this pattern: The Biden administration was slow to respond to the post-Covid spike in undocumented migration at the US-Mexico border.",
      "And it was seemingly caught off-guard by the disruptive impact the Republican-backed programme of relocating migrants to Democratic-run northern cities would have on government services far from the border.",
      "Shortages in Covid tests and infant formula, a dramatic increase in the price of eggs, the end of Roe v Wade abortion protections, and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza \u2013 for every seemingly unanticipated fire the Biden administration addressed, two new ones would emerge.",
      "The challenges were, in fact, daunting \u2013 ones that felled incumbent leaders in democracies around the world.",
      "But for Biden and the Democrats, hoping to prove that they were a competent and effective counterpoint not just to Trump but to global authoritarian regimes, the stakes were high.",
      "'Elderly man with a poor memory'",
      "Amid all of this, responses from the administration were sometimes glaringly off-key. When asked during a television interview about raising oil production in America to reduce gas prices, in November 2021, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm responded with a laugh.",
      "\"That is hilarious,\" she said. \"Would that I had the magic wand.\"",
      "Biden \u2013 once regarded as a gifted communicator and orator - appeared less able to connect with the American people. Signs of his advancing years were also showing.",
      "\"Watching Biden speak, I'm like, oh my God, this is a different person,\" said a senior White House official who served in the early years of the Biden administration and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "\"Maybe it's simply that when you're there every day, you don't see it.\"",
      "A report by Robert Hur, a special counsel appointed to investigate Biden's handling of classified documents, referred to the president as an \"elderly man with a poor memory\", setting off a round of hand-wringing among Democrats.",
      "Biden's interactions with the media were curtailed, and his public appearances tightly scripted. His verbal miscues and stumbles became fodder for Republican attacks. But Biden pressed on, determined to seek and win a second term in office.",
      "Biden's people: His inner circle",
      "During his presidency, Biden surrounded himself with veterans of government service. His secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had been one of his top foreign policy advisors since his days in the Senate. Merrick Garland, a distinguished appellate court judge and Barack Obama's ill-fated 2016 pick for the Supreme Court, was tabbed for attorney general. Yellen, his pick for treasury, had previously chaired the Federal Reserve.",
      "Within the White House, Biden chose Ron Klain \u2013 who had worked in Democratic presidential administrations for decades \u2013 as his chief of staff. Mike Donilon, another Biden veteran, served as a senior advisor.",
      "The team was particularly successful at managing the narrow majorities in the House and the Senate, notching early legislative victories even in the face of unified Republican resistance and reluctance from centrists in his own party.",
      "Biden's \"American Rescue Plan\", which passed just two months after he took office, included nearly $2 trillion in new government spending. It expanded healthcare subsidies, and funded the distribution of Covid vaccines and a payment programme that cut child poverty in half, to 5%.",
      "Later that year, Democrats and some Republicans joined to pass an infrastructure investment bill, which included $1tn in new spending on transportation, clean energy, water, broadband and other construction programmes.",
      "Others followed, marking a legislative agenda that few first-term presidents in the modern era could match \u2013 but it came with what some critics see as a fatal flaw.",
      "Brent Cebul, an associate professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania, argues that Biden's efforts were too focused on shifting policies that take years to translate into economic benefits for average American workers.",
      "\"I think that the time horizon associated with those big pieces of legislation was way out of sync with the exigencies of the presidential election,\" he said.",
      "Biden would have been better served finding ways to bring the tangible benefits to voters more quickly \u2013 a sentiment Biden himself expressed during a recent newspaper interview.",
      "'Infighting and frustration' from within",
      "His team also proved less able when success was measured not in laws enacted but in the daily messaging battle against a political opposition that was growing increasingly assertive.",
      "A senior Biden official said that the White House team was more decisive early on in his presidency.",
      "\"As things started to become a grind and you lose that sense of getting big things done, it can give way to infighting and frustration,\" they admitted, adding that it was their sense that the circle around Biden became more insular as the pressure built.",
      "After a two-year respite, his political opponents launched investigations, held hearings (into the Afghanistan withdrawal, the Biden family's business dealings and more) and, in September 2023, formally initiated a presidential impeachment inquiry. All the while, Biden's public approval languished in the low 40s.",
      "Biden's presidency should be seen in two halves, says Mr Cebul. The first was more accomplished. The second was less focused.",
      "\"Biden's sense that the US was macro-economically doing quite well led him and his advisors to take their eyes off the ball when many, many Americans were still very much hurting.\"",
      "A beleaguered election campaign",
      "On 25 April, 2023, Biden made his presidential bid official in a campaign video warning that Trump \"extremists\" were threatening America.",
      "Over the following months, there would be more warnings of the danger Trump posed to American democracy. He would tout his economic plan \u2013 embracing the label \"Bidenomics\" - and point to how inflation was dropping while the economy was still growing.",
      "I travelled with Biden on a June 2023 trip to Chicago, where he held a reception for deep-pocketed donors and gave a speech on the economy in an historic downtown post office.",
      "\"Bidenomics is about the future,\" he said.\"Bidenomics is just another way of saying: Restore the American dream.\"",
      "Mr Cebul believes that was a bad move.",
      "\"For him to then spend most of the spring and the early summer basically talking about how he's the most successful economic president in modern history, it was just so discordant,\" he said.",
      "\"Not only was the message out of sync, he was also just a terrible messenger.\"",
      "In Chicago, as in many of his speeches, Biden's delivery was at times halting. His words sometimes mumbled and his syntax mangled.",
      "Through it all, however, Biden was telling aides that he believed he was the man best positioned to defeat Trump \u2013 that he had done it once, and he would do it again. And those aides vigorously pushed back whenever anyone questioned Biden's abilities.",
      "\"I'm not a young guy, that's no secret,\" Biden said in a campaign advert. \"But here's the deal: I understand how to get things done for the American people.\"",
      "Hamas, Hunter and final hurdles",
      "In the autumn, Biden confronted yet another crisis - following the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel, he quickly cautioned Israel not to overreact or overreach in its response to the bloodshed.",
      "As with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the president turned his attention to world affairs. But unlike Ukraine, during which Biden assembled a unified western coalition against the invasion, the continued US support of Israel eroded enthusiasm and support for Biden in some quarters at home.",
      "At the same time, Biden was confronting his son Hunter's growing legal troubles \u2013 a June trial and conviction on gun charges and, perhaps more concerning for the president, an indictment on tax-related violations that involved Hunter's foreign business dealings.",
      "The airing of family discord and pain was, at the very least, a distraction and an emotional drain on the president. His ultimate decision to pardon his son, made after November's election, was condemned by many, including some allies.",
      "Ultimately, Biden's presidential bid \u2013 and his presidency \u2013 came crashing down in late June on a stage in Atlanta during a debate with Trump. His confused and at times incomprehensible performance dealt his campaign a mortal blow that seemingly confirmed Republican attacks \u2013 and Democratic fears \u2013 about his advancing age.",
      "But eventually, after Trump defiantly responded to a failed assassination attempt and held a boisterous, unified national party convention in mid-July, Biden dropped out of the race.",
      "Trump's victory over Kamala Harris, Biden's hand-picked successor, ensured that the final electoral judgement on Biden's half-century political career would be one of rejection and defeat.",
      "What would Biden's legacy have been if he had simply stepped aside  \u2013 \"passed the torch\" in his words \u2013 without seeking a second term? No video campaign launch. No grasping for campaign messages or Trump debate disaster. Instead, a robust race for the Democratic nomination with Biden floating above it all.",
      "\"We should have had primaries,\" argues Ms Estrich. \"His successor would have had time to make the case.\"",
      "In the end, Biden's age and Trump's enduring appeal were the fires that his administration could never put out, and the ones that ultimately consumed his presidency.",
      "In exactly one week, Trump will take the oath of office and will likely set about dismantling much of what Biden accomplished over the past four years. How effective he is at doing this will go a long way towards determining Biden's lasting legacy.",
      "A few weeks ago, I asked Attorney General Garland how he thought history would judge Biden and this administration.",
      "\"I'll leave that to the historians,\" he replied.",
      "That, in the end, is all Biden has left.",

    "title": "'I got death threats when men thought I put feminist gesture in video game'",
    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:06:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Young male gamers in South Korea thought it resembled a gesture used to poke fun at the size of men\u2019s penises.",
    "story": [
      "It was late at night, and Darim's animation studio had just finished designing a new look for a character in one of South Korea's most popular video games, MapleStory.",
      "Darim was proud of her work. So, sitting alone on the floor of her small studio apartment, she posted the trailer on social media. Almost immediately, she was flooded with thousands of abusive messages, including death and rape threats.",
      "Young male gamers had taken issue with a single frame in the trailer, in which the female character could be seen holding her thumb and forefinger close together.",
      "They thought it resembled a hand gesture used by a radical online feminist community almost a decade ago to poke fun at the size of Korean men's penises.",
      "\"There were insults I'd never heard before, they were disgusting and inhumane,\" said Darim, which is not her real name. One read: \"You've just sabotaged your job.\"",
      "Messages then started piling into Darim's studio and the game developer claiming she was a feminist and demanding she be fired. Within hours, the company pulled the promotional video.",
      "Darim had become the latest victim in a series of vicious online witch hunts, in which men in South Korea attack women they suspect of having feminist views. They bombard them with abuse and try to get them sacked.",
      "This is part of a growing backlash to feminism, in which feminists have been branded man-haters who deserve to be punished. The witch hunts are having a chilling effect on women, with many now scared to admit they are feminists.",
      "This is forcing the movement underground, in a country where gender discrimination is still deeply entrenched. South Korea has the largest gender pay gap in the OECD, a group of the world's rich countries.",
      "The hunts are often spearheaded by young male video gamers, and target women who work in the industry, like Darim, though recently they have spread to other professions.",
      "They look for anything that resembles what they term the 'finger-pinching gesture' and use it as proof that men-hating women are surreptitiously mocking them.",
      "Once they spot a supposed sign, the hunt begins. \"They decide that a dark, evil feminist is hiding in the company, and her life should be ruined,\" explained Minsung Kim, a 22-year-old male gamer who, concerned by these witch hunts, set up an organisation to support the victims.",
      "The witch hunters track down all female employees at the company in question, and trawl their social media accounts, searching for any evidence of feminism. Way back on Darim's timeline, they found an 'offending' post.",
      "Darim in fact had nothing to do with the disputed part of the animation, but her studio was rattled by the torrent of abuse \u2013 especially after Nexon, the gaming company, suddenly removed all the studio's artwork from their roster and issued an apology to customers.",
      "\"My company and CEO were in a panic,\" said Darim. \"I thought I was going to be fired, and I'd never be able to work in animation again.\"",
      "Then Minsung's organisation stepped in. They urged her studio to ignore the gamers and offered to pay Darim's legal fees so she could report the abuse. \"We said these demands will never end, you need to nip this in the bud now,\" he said. The studio listened, and Darim kept her job.",
      "But similar witch hunts have worked, in the gaming industry and beyond, and they are becoming more frequent. In one case, a young illustrator lost her job after a handful of disgruntled gamers stormed the company's office demanding she be removed.",
      "And it is not just Korean companies that have capitulated. Last year, the international car maker Renault suspended one of its female employees after she was accused of making the finger-pinching gesture while moving her hands in a promotional presentation.",
      "\"These anti-feminists are getting more organised; their playbook is getting more specific,\" said Minsung. \"By taking a hand gesture that everyone makes and turning it into a scarlet letter they can brand literally anyone an evil feminist,\" he said.",
      "Because the companies are folding to these baseless accusations, the instigators of these hunts have become emboldened, he said. \"They are confident now that when you accuse someone of feminism, you can ruin their career.\"",
      "Minsung knows, because not long ago he was one of these men. He used to belong to the anti-feminist forums. \"We are exposed to the uncensored internet unimaginably young,\" he said, having joined the forums aged nine.",
      "It was only when Minsung traded video games for playing real-life games, including Dungeons and Dragons, that he met women, and his views shifted. He became, in his words, an \"ardent feminist\".",
      "In South Korea, women commonly suffer discrimination and misogyny both at work and at home. But as they have fought to improve their rights, many young men have started to believe they are the ones being discriminated against.",
      "The backlash began in the mid-2010s, following a surge of feminist activism. During this time, women took to the streets in protest at sexual violence and the widespread use of hidden cameras that secretly film women using toilets and changing rooms - around 5,000 to 6,000 cases are reported annually.",
      "\"Young men saw women becoming vocal and were threatened by their rise,\" said Myungji Yang, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawai'i Manoa, who has interviewed dozens of young Korean men. \"They learn about feminism from online forums, which carry the most radical caricature of feminists,\" she said. \"This has given them a distorted idea of what feminism is.\"",
      "One of their grievances is the 18-month military service men must complete. Once they leave the military they often \"feel entitled\" to a good job, said Hyun Mee Kim, a professor of cultural anthropology at Yonsei University in Seoul, who studies feminism.",
      "As more women have entered the workforce, and jobs have become harder to get, some men feel their opportunities are being unfairly taken away.",
      "These feelings have been validated by South Korea's now disgraced and suspended President, Yoon Suk Yeol, who came to power in 2022 on an anti-feminist platform, claiming gender discrimination no longer existed, and has since tried to dismantle the government's gender equality ministry.",
      "More surprising than these views themselves, is that the men who hold them have such power over major companies.",
      "Editing out fingers",
      "I travelled to Pangyo, the Silicon Valley of South Korea, to meet a woman who has worked in the gaming industry for 20 years. After Darim's case, her company started to edit all its games, removing the fingers from characters' hands, turning them into fists, to avoid complaints.",
      "\"It's exhausting and frustrating\" to work like this, she said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \"The idea that a hand gesture can be seen as an attack on men is absurd and companies should be ignoring it.\"",
      "When I asked why they were not, she told me that many developers share the gamers' anti-feminist views. \"For all those outside yelling, there are those on the inside who also believe things are bad.\"",
      "Then there is the financial cost. The men threaten to boycott the games unless the companies act.",
      "\"The gaming companies think the anti-feminists are the largest source of their revenue,\" said Minsung. After Darim's company, Studio Ppuri, was targeted, it said it lost nearly two thirds of its contracts with gaming companies.",
      "Studio Ppuri, did not respond to our questions, but both Nexon, the game developer, and Renault Korea told us they stood against all forms of discrimination and prejudice.",
      "There is evidence the authorities are also capitulating to the anti-feminists' demands. When Darim reported her abuse to the police, they refused to take her case.",
      "They said because the finger-pinching gesture was taboo, it was \"logical\" that she, as a feminist, had been attacked. \"I was astonished,\" she said. \"Why would the authorities not protect me?\"",
      "Following outrage from feminist organisations, the police backtracked and are now investigating. In a statement, Seocho district police told the BBC their initial decision to close the case had been \"insufficient\" and they were \"making all efforts to identify the suspects\".",
      "The case left Darim's lawyer, Yu-kyung Beom, dumbfounded. \"If you want to say that you're a feminist in South Korea, you have to be very brave or insane,\" she said.",
      "Beaten up for having short hair",
      "In November 2023, the violence spilled offline and into real life. A young woman, who we are calling Jigu, was working alone in a convenience store late at night, when a man walked in and started attacking her.",
      "\"He said 'hey, you're a feminist, right? You look like a feminist with your short hair',\" Jigu told me as she apprehensively recounted the night. The man pushed her to the ground and started kicking her. \"I kept going in and out of consciousness. I thought I could die.\"",
      "Jigu did not consider herself a feminist. She just liked having short hair and thought it suited her. The attack has left her with permanent injuries. Her left ear is damaged, and she wears a hearing aid.",
      "\"I feel like I've become a completely different person,\" she said. \"I don't smile as much. Some days it is agony just to stay alive, the memory of that day is still so clear.\"",
      "Her assailant was sent to prison for three years, and for the first time a South Korean court ruled this was a misogynistically motivated crime: in effect, that Jigu had been attacked for looking like a feminist.",
      "During the attack, the man said he belonged to an extreme anti-feminist group, New Men's Solidarity. Its leader, In-kyu Bae, has called on men to confront feminists. So, one evening, as he held a live-streaming event in Gangnam, a flashy neighbourhood in Seoul, I went to try to talk to him.",
      "\"I'm here to tell you these feminists are staining the country with hatred,\" he shouted from the roof of a black van kitted out with loudspeakers.",
      "\"That psychopath [who attacked Jigu] was not a member of our group. We don't have members, we are a YouTube channel,\" he told me as he simultaneously broadcast to thousands of subscribers. A small group of young men who had come to watch in person were cheering along.",
      "\"We've never encouraged anyone to use violence. In fact, the violent ones are the feminist groups. They're shaming men's genitals,\" he added.",
      "Last year, Mr Bae and several of his supporters were convicted of defaming and insulting a feminist activist after harassing her for more than two years.",
      "Anti-feminist views have become so widespread that Yuri Kim, the director of Korea Women's Trade Union, recently established a committee to track cases of what she describes as \"feminism censorship\". She found that some women have been questioned about their stance on feminism in job interviews, while at work women commonly face comments like \"all feminists need to die\".",
      "According to Prof Kim, the feminism academic, men are using now feminist threats in the office as a way to harass and control their female colleagues - it is their way of saying 'we are watching you; you should behave yourself'.",
      "Such harassment is proving effective. Last year, a pair of scholars coined the phrase \"quiet feminism\", to describe the impact of what they say is a \"pervasive everyday backlash\".",
      "Gowoon Jung and Minyoung Moon found that although women held feminist beliefs they did not feel safe disclosing them in public. Women I spoke to said they were even afraid to cut their hair short, while others said feminism had become so synonymous with hating men they did not associate with the cause.",
      "A 2024 IPSOS poll of 31 countries found only 24% of women in South Korea defined themselves as feminist, compared to an average of 45%, and down from 33% in 2019.",
      "Prof Kim worries the consequences will be severe. By being forced to conceal their feminist values, she argues women are being stripped of their ability to fight against gender inequality, which penetrates workplaces, politics and public life.",
      "Feminists are now busy brainstorming ways to put an end to the witch hunts. One clear answer is legal change. In South Korea there is no blanket anti-discrimination law to protect women and prevent them being fired for their views.",
      "It has been repeatedly blocked by politicians, largely because it would support gay and transgender people, with anti-feminists, and even some trans-exclusionary feminists, now lobbying against it.",
      "Minsung believes the only way to strip the witch hunters of their powers is for the companies and the authorities to stand up to them. They make up a small fraction of men in South Korea, they just have loud voices and a bizarrely oversized influence, he argues.",
      "Since her attack, Jigu now proudly calls herself a feminist. \"I want to reach out to other victims like me, and if even one woman has the strength to grab my hand, I want to help.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:23:24 GMT",
    "summary": "A businessman was shot dead in India 100 years ago. Then, a sensational tale unfolded.",
    "story": [
      "It looked like an ordinary murder.",
      "One hundred years ago on this day - 12 January 1925 - a group of men attacked a couple on a car ride in a upmarket suburb in Bombay (now Mumbai) in colonial India, shooting the man dead and slashing the woman's face.",
      "But the story that unfolded brought global spotlight on the case, while its complexity put the country's then British rulers in a spot of bother, and eventually forced an Indian king to abdicate.",
      "Newspapers and magazines described the murder as \"perhaps the most sensational crime committed in British India\", and it became \"the talk of the city\" during the investigation and subsequent trial.",
      "The victim, Abdul Kadir Bawla, 25, was an influential textile businessman and the city's youngest municipal official. His female companion, Mumtaz Begum, 22, was a courtesan on the run from the harem of a princely state and had been staying with Bawla for the last few months.",
      "On the evening of the murder, Bawla and Mumtaz Begum were in the car with three others, driving in Malabar Hill, an affluent area along the shore of the Arabian Sea. Cars were a rarity in India at the time, and only the rich owned them.",
      "Suddenly, another car overtook them. Before they could react, it collided with theirs, forcing them to stop, according to intelligence and newspaper reports.",
      "The attackers showered expletives on Bawla and shouted \"get the lady out\", Mumtaz Begum later told the Bombay High Court.",
      "They then shot Bawla, who died a few hours later.",
      "A group of British soldiers, who had inadvertently taken a wrong turn on their way back from a golf game, heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene.",
      "They managed to catch one of the culprits, but one officer suffered gunshot wounds when an attacker opened fire at them.",
      "Before fleeing, the remaining attackers made two attempts to snatch the injured Mumtaz Begum from the British officers, who were trying to rush her to the hospital.",
      "The newspapers suggested that attackers' aim was likely abducting Mumtaz Begum, as Bawla - whom she had met while performing in Mumbai a few months earlier and had been living with since - had earlier received several threats for sheltering her.",
      "The Illustrated Weekly of India promised readers exclusive photographs of Mumtaz Begum, while the police planned to issue a daily bulletin to the press, Marathi newspaper Navakal reported.",
      "Even Bollywood found the case compelling enough to adapt it into a silent murder thriller within months.",
      "\"The case went beyond the usual murder mystery as it involved a rich and young tycoon, a slighted king, and a beautiful woman,\" says Dhaval Kulkarni, author of The Bawla Murder Case: Love, Lust and Crime in Colonial India.",
      "The attackers' footprints, as speculated in the media, led investigators to the influential princely state of Indore, which was a British ally. Mumtaz Begum, a Muslim, had lived in the harem of its Hindu king, Maharaja Tukoji Rao Holkar III.",
      "Mumtaz Begum was famed for her beauty. \"In her own class, it was said, Mumtaz was without a peer,\" KL Gauba wrote in his 1945 book, Famous Trials for Love and Murder.",
      "But the Maharaja's (king's) attempts to control her - preventing her from seeing her family alone and keeping her under constant surveillance - soured their relationship, says Kulkarni.",
      "\"I was kept under surveillance. I was allowed to see visitors and my relations but somebody always accompanied me,\" Mumtaz Begum testified in the court.",
      "In Indore, she gave birth to a baby girl, who died soon after.",
      "\"After my child was born, I was unwilling to stay at Indore. I was unwilling because the nurses killed the female child that was born,\" Mumtaz Begum told the court.",
      "Within months, she escaped to the northern Indian city of Amritsar, her mother's place of birth, but troubles followed.",
      "She was watched there too. Mumtaz Begum's stepfather told the court that the Maharaja wept and begged her to return. But she refused and moved to Bombay, where the surveillance continued.",
      "The trial confirmed what media had speculated following the murder: representatives of the Maharaja had indeed threatened Bawla with dire consequences if he continued to shelter Mumtaz Begum, but he had ignored the warnings.",
      "Following a lead given by Shafi Ahmed, the only attacker captured at the scene, the Bombay police arrested seven men from Indore.",
      "The investigation revealed links to the Maharaja that were hard to ignore. Most of the arrested men were employed by the Indore princely state, had applied for leave around the same time and were in Bombay at the time of the crime.",
      "The murder put the British government in a tough spot. Though it happened in Bombay, the investigation clearly showed the plot was planned in Indore, which had strong ties to the British.",
      "Terming it \"the most awkward affair\" for the British government, The New Statesman wrote that if it were a minor state, \"there would be no particular cause for anxiety\".",
      "\"But Indore has been a powerful feudatory of the Raj,\" it said.",
      "The British government initially tried to keep mum about the murder's Indore connection in public. But in private, it discussed the issue with much alarm, communication between the governments of Bombay and British India shows.",
      "Bombay police commissioner Patrick Kelly told the British government that all evidence \"points at present to a conspiracy hatched in Indore or by instigation from Indore to abduct Mumtaj [sic] through hired desperadoes\".",
      "The government faced pressure from different sides. Bawla's community of wealthy Memons, a Muslim community with roots in modern-day Gujarat, raised the issue with the government. His fellow municipal officials mourned his death, saying, \"there surely must be something more behind the scene\".",
      "Indian lawmakers demanded answers in the upper house of British India's legislature and the case was even discussed in the British House of Commons.",
      "Rohidas Narayan Dusar, a former police officer, writes in his book on the murder that the investigators were under pressure to go slow, but that then police commissioner Kelly threatened to resign.",
      "The case drew top lawyers for both the defence and the prosecution when it reached the Bombay High Court.",
      "One of them was Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who would later become the founding father of Pakistan after India's partition in 1947. Jinnah defended Anandrao Gangaram Phanse, one of the accused and a top general with the Indore army. Jinnah managed to save his client from the death penalty.",
      "The court sentenced three men to death and three to life imprisonment, but it stopped short of holding the Maharaja accountable.",
      "Justice LC Crump, who led the trial, noted, however, that \"there were persons behind them [assailants] whom we cannot precisely indicate\".",
      "\"But where an attempt is made to kidnap a woman, who was for 10 years the mistress of the Maharaja of Indore, it is not in the least unreasonable to look to Indore as the quarter from which this attack may have emanated,\" the judge remarked.",
      "The case's prominence meant the British government had to act quickly against the Maharaja. They gave him a choice: face a commission of inquiry or abdicate, according to documents presented to parliament in India.",
      "The Maharaja chose to quit.",
      "\"I abdicate my throne in favour of my son on the understanding that no further inquiry into my alleged connection with the Malabar Hill Tragedy will be made,\" he wrote to the British government.",
      "After abdicating, the Maharaja stirred more controversy by insisting on marrying an American woman against the will of his family and community. Eventually, she converted to Hinduism and they wed, according to a British home department report.",
      "Meanwhile, Mumtaz Begum received offers from Hollywood and later moved to the US to try her luck there. She faded into obscurity after that."

    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 08:39:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The BBC investigates possible scenarios for the huge Arctic territory's future as the US president-elect talks about taking control of it.",
    "story": [
      "In recent weeks, US President-elect Donald Trump has shown renewed interest in taking control of Greenland, a largely autonomous territory of Denmark in the Arctic and the world's largest island.",
      "He first indicated an intention to buy Greenland in 2019, during his first term as president, but this week he went further, refusing to rule out economic or military force to take control of it.",
      "Danish and European officials have responded negatively, saying Greenland is not for sale and its territorial integrity must be preserved.",
      "So how could this unusual situation play out, with two Nato allies at odds over a huge territory which is 80% covered with ice but has considerable untapped mineral wealth?",
      "And how could the aspirations for independence among Greenland's population of 56,000, under Danish control for 300 years, affect the final outcome?",
      "Here we look at four possible scenarios for Greenland's future.",
      "Trump loses interest, nothing happens",
      "There is some speculation that Trump's move is just bluster, a move to get Denmark to boost Greenland's security in the face of the threat of both Russia and China seeking influence in the region.",
      "Last month, Denmark announced a new $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) military package for the Arctic. It had been prepared before Trump's remarks but the announcement just hours after them was described by the Danish defence minister as an \"irony of fate\".",
      "\"What was important in what Trump said was that Denmark has to fulfil its obligations in the Arctic or it's got to let the US do it,\" says Elisabet Svane, chief political correspondent for Politiken newspaper.",
      "Marc Jacobsen, associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, believes that this is a case of Trump \"positioning himself before entering office\" while Greenland is using the occasion to gain more international authority, as an important step towards independence.",
      "So even if Trump were to lose further interest in Greenland now, which Professor Jacobsen thinks is the most likely scenario, he has certainly put the spotlight on the issue.",
      "But independence for Greenland has been on the agenda for many years, and some say the debate could even go in the opposite direction.",

      "Greenland votes for independence, seeks closer ties with US",
      "There is a general consensus in Greenland that independence will happen eventually, and also that if Greenland votes for it, Denmark will accept and ratify it.",
      "However, it is also unlikely that Greenland would vote for independence unless its people are given guarantees that they can keep the subsidies they currently get from Denmark to pay for things like healthcare and the welfare system.",

      "One possible next step is a free association - something like the US currently has with Pacific states the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau.",
      "Denmark has previously opposed this status both for Greenland and for the Faroe Islands, but according to Dr Gad, current Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is not categorically against it.",
      "\"Danish understanding of the Greenland historical experience is way better than it was 20 years ago,\" he says, with Denmark accepting colonial responsibility.",
      "The recent discussions \"might persuade [Frederiksen] to say - better to keep Denmark in the Arctic, keep some kind of connection to Greenland, even if it's a looser one\", he adds.",
      "But even if Greenland is able to get rid of Denmark, it has become clear in recent years that it can't get rid of the US. The Americans never really left after taking control of the island in World War Two, and see it as vital for their security.",
      "An agreement in 1951 affirmed Denmark's basic sovereignty of the island but, in effect, gave the US whatever it wanted.",
      "Dr Gad said that Greenland officials had been in contact with the last two US administrations about Washington's role.",

      "Danes struggle with response to Trump Greenland threat",
      "Russia keeping close eye on Trump's claim to Greenland",

      "There has been speculation that Trump's economic rhetoric is potentially the biggest threat to Denmark - with the US drastically increasing tariffs on Danish, or even EU, goods, forcing Denmark into concessions of some kind over Greenland.",
      "Professor Jacobsen says Danish governments have been preparing for that, and not just because of the Arctic territory.",
      "Trump has been threatening universal 10% tariffs on all US imports which could, among other things, significantly disrupt European growth, and some Danish and other European companies are now considering setting up manufacturing bases in the US.",
      "Possible options for raising tariffs include by invoking the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), Benjamin Cote of international law firm Pillsbury told the website MarketWatch.",
      "One of the main Danish industries potentially affected by this is pharmaceuticals. The US receives products such as hearing aids and most of its insulin from Denmark, as well as the diabetes drug Ozempic, made by the Danish company Novo Nordisk.",
      "Analysts say the hike in prices that would result from these measures would not find favour with the US public.",
      "Trump invades Greenland",
      "The \"nuclear option\" seems far-fetched, but with Trump failing to rule out military action it has to be considered.",

    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 01:12:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Meet the woman who has found an innovative way to simply accessing much-needed aid in war-torn Lebanon.",
    "story": [
      "Last autumn Hania Zataari, a mechanical engineer who works for Lebanon's Ministry of Industry put her skills to use as war in the country raged on. Hailing from Sidon, South Lebanon, she created a chatbot on WhatsApp that simplified access to much-needed aid.",
      "\"They lost their houses, their savings, their work, everything they had built,\" Hania says, referring to those forced from their homes by war.",
      "On 23 September, Israel dramatically escalated its offensive against the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, with which it had been fighting a spiralling conflict since Hezbollah attacked Israel in October 2023.",
      "According to the Lebanese government, at least 492 people were killed in one of Lebanon's deadliest days of conflict in almost 20 years.",
      "Thousands of families fled to Sidon after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) hit what it said was 1,600 Hezbollah strongholds inside Lebanon.",
      "Hania says many displaced people sought shelter in schools and other public buildings, but many others who fled their homes were forced to rent elsewhere or stay with members of their family.",
      "It is these people who weren't directly receiving support from the government that she wanted to help. Drawing on her programming skills, Hania created the \"aidbot\" to narrow the gap between the demand and supply of aid.",
      "The aidbot is a chatbot - a type of AI system designed to communicate with its users online - that links to WhatsApp. It is programmed to ask simple questions about the types of aid people require along with their names and locations.",
      "This information is then recorded onto a Google spreadsheet which Hania and her team of unpaid volunteers, made up of friends and family, access to distribute aid such as food, blankets, mattresses, medicine and clothes.",
      "Hania used her spare time to build the bot using the website Callbell.eu, which is commonly used by businesses to engage with customers on Meta's platforms such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook messenger.",
      "She explains that the bot, which is still being used today, makes distributing aid more efficient as it cuts down the amount of time she spends responding to requests for aid over WhatsApp.",
      "\"I'm not really interested in knowing their names. I just need to know where they are so I can manage the delivery,\" she says.",
      "Take, for example, a request for baby formula. Hania says the bot will ask for the age of the baby and the quantity needed so that she and her team can provide it.",
      "The project, she says, is funded by donations coming from Lebanese people living abroad. She's created a publicly available dashboard to record what the project has spent money on and how much aid she and her team have distributed.",
      "At the time of writing they have delivered 78 food parcels to families of 5 or 10 people, 900 mattresses, and 323 blankets across Sidon and other parts of Lebanon.",
      "Last October, 47 year-old Khaldoun Abbas and his family fled their homes in Najjarieh after they received calls from the IDF urging them to leave for their own safety.",
      "Seventeen people, ranging in age from nine to 78, slept under one roof in a rented three bed apartment in Sidon.",
      "Khaldoun says he, his wife and their children, as well as his brother's family slept on mattresses they requested using the aidbot in the hallway of the flat. They also requested blankets, food and cleaning detergents.",
      "Unlike his neighbours, he's not been able to return to his home. It was destroyed in a confirmed Israeli strike 11 days later. The IDF told the BBC it \"struck a terror infrastructure\".",
      "When we put this allegation to Khaldoun, he denied having any connection to Hezbollah or any other party.",
      "What is Hezbollah and why is Israel attacking Lebanon?",
      "Israel-Hezbollah conflict in maps: Ceasefire in effect in Lebanon",
      "Lebanon's financial crisis explained",
      "\"This isn't the first time Sidon has opened its doors to displaced people,\" Hania explains, referring to the wave of people who have arrived in the city.",
      "Sidon has a long-standing reputation for taking in internally displaced people driven from their homes along the Lebanon-Israel border.",
      "The most recent conflict began in October 2023 after the war between Israel and Hamas spilled over into Lebanon when Hezbollah, Hamas' ally, fired rockets into Israel in support of Gaza.",
      "The Lebanese healthy ministry says nearly 4,000 people have been killed and over a million have been displaced. The ministry does not say how many of these are civilians or combatants.",
      "In Israel around 60,000 people have been evacuated from Northern Israel and authorities say more than 80 soldiers and 47 civilians have been killed.",
      "Last November a ceasefire was agreed between Israel and Lebanon. Despite some skirmishes it has largely been upheld. But people on the ground say the provision of aid has not improved.",
      "International NGO Islamic Relief told the BBC that the \"conflict, destruction, and evacuation orders have fuelled ongoing displacement in Lebanon which has made it difficult to assess and address the needs of the population amid the changing situation.\"",
      "But it is not just the war that is hindering aid distribution.",
      "Bilal Merie, a volunteer working with Hania says many of the problems they face are due to the \"high demand but short supply\" of aid.",
      "He puts it down to the deep economic turmoil that has gripped the country since 2019, meaning the Lebanese government has had to rely heavily on funding from creditors and aid organisations for goods.",
      "But even NGOs are feeling the crunch. Unicef Lebanon says that with only 20% of the funding they need, it \"continues to face an enormous funding gap,\" meaning the charity is unable to support families when they need it most.",
      "In a country overrun with financial woes and by war, could this aidbot make a tangible difference?",
      "It is the first time researcher John Bryant from the think tank Overseas Development Institute has heard of a chatbot being used in such a way in the humanitarian sector.",
      "He says the cultural context in which it is being used is commendable. That is, with knowledge of \"the channels people are using to talk to each other and meeting them in their own language\".",
      "However he is unsure of its scalability, as what works in Lebanon cannot easily be replicated in other parts of the world.",
      "\"What tech offers a lot of the time is a standard cookie cutter approach.",
      "\"It's the local designers, the local translators, the trusted human interlocutors and elements within that system that elevate digital tools into something useful,\" he says.",
      "The aidbot might not be able to offer the solution to all Lebanon's problems, but to the families using it, it has made life a little easier.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 03:03:06 GMT",
    "summary": "India\u2019s six losses in eight Tests raise doubts over Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, and their red-ball future.",
    "story": [
      "Indian cricket fans are still reeling from the team's crushing 1-3 defeat in the five-match Test series against Australia.",
      "Once dominant in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, with historic victories over the mighty Australians over the past decade, the tourists fell short, exposing vulnerabilities in a side long thought invincible.",
      "The series highlighted glaring issues - Indian batters struggled, and Jasprit Bumrah was the lone bowler to trouble Australia.",
      "The loss not only cost India the coveted Border-Gavaskar Trophy but also denied them a spot in the World Test Championship (WTC) final, breaking their streak of back-to-back appearances in 2021 and 2023, where they lost to New Zealand and Australia respectively.",
      "India's recent form is troubling - they have lost six of their last eight Tests, including a shocking 0-3 home whitewash against New Zealand.",
      "The defeats have raised questions about the team's depth, the future of key players like captain Rohit Sharma and former skipper Virat Kohli, and their ability to rebuild.",
      "With a team in transition and stalwarts fading, Indian Test cricket faces pressing challenges to sustain its legacy in a rapidly evolving landscape.",
      "India's next red-ball challenge is a five-Test series in England starting July. England's conditions, known for dramatic shifts even within a session, will test players' technique, skills and adaptability to the limit.",
      "India hasn't won a series in England since 2007, with only two prior victories (1971, 1986), highlighting the daunting task ahead. Adding to the pressure, recent failures against New Zealand and Australia leave selectors grappling with tough decisions on player selection and team combinations for this critical campaign.",
      "The biggest headache for selectors is the form of batting stalwarts Sharma and Kohli after dismal outings in Australia and earlier against New Zealand.",
      "Sharma managed just 31 runs in three Tests in Australia, with his poor form seeing him dropping himself for the final game. Kohli fared slightly better with 190 runs in nine innings, but 100 runs of his total came in one knock. His dismissals followed a pattern - caught in the slips or behind the stumps - pointing to a glaring technical flaw or mental fatigue under pressure.",
      "Since January 2024, Sharma has managed just 619 runs in 16 Tests with one century. Kohli's numbers are worse over time - averaging 32 in Tests since 2020 with only two centuries.",
      "Once a late-blooming Test opener and blazing match-winner, Sharma now struggles to find his ideal batting position. Meanwhile, Kohli's surreal decline - after a decade of dominance and swagger- has left cricket's former titan in an extended slump.",
      "From Sunil Gavaskar to Sachin Tendulkar to Kohli, the baton of Indian batting greatness has passed seamlessly. But a worthy successor to Kohli remains elusive.",
      "KL Rahul has the class but lacks the hunger for consistent big scores. Rishabh Pant is a thrilling maverick, equally capable of winning or losing a match. Shubman Gill, touted as the next Big Thing, has struggled overseas despite his undeniable pedigree and needs careful nurturing.",
      "Punjab's young left-hander Abhishek Sharma, mentored by Yuvraj Singh, is highly rated, while Nitish Kumar Reddy impressed on debut in Australia with his fearless performances in tough situations.",
      "Yashasvi Jaiswal, India's top Test run-scorer in Australia this series, has been the standout among young batsmen. With panache, patience, technical assurance, and explosive strokes, he looks poised to become Kohli's successor as the team's talisman.",
      "India's talent pool is brimming across departments. Jasprit Bumrah, with his 32-wicket haul against Australia, has cemented his status as a fast-bowling colossus. Backed by Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj, and a dozen promising quicks, India boasts a formidable pace arsenal for all formats.",
      "That said, Bumrah is a once-in-a-generation talent and needs careful workload management. Overburdening him, as in the Australia series, risks breakdowns that could impede the attack. Shami, after lengthy stints in rehab, also requires careful handling. Together, they form one of modern cricket's most formidable pace pairs.",
      "With Ravichandran Ashwin's sudden retirement and Ravindra Jadeja's lukewarm showing in Australia, India's spin depth looks thin. However, Washington Sundar has shown promise on home pitches, while young spinners Ravi Bishnoi and Tanush Kotian, who joined the squad mid-series in Australia, are knocking on the doors of Test cricket.",
      "Smarting from recent losses to New Zealand and Australia, the Indian cricket board  is moving swiftly to usher in a transition. Selectors have been directed to shortlist potential Test players from the second round of the domestic Ranji Trophy, resuming 23 January.",
      "All players, including Sharma and Kohli, are likely to be asked to play domestic cricket - a move that could help them regain form.",
      "Managing a team in transition poses complex challenges requiring patience, empathy, and clear vision. Knee-jerk reactions or external pressure could worsen the situation instead of providing solutions.",
      "Whether Sharma and Kohli can overcome their crisis remains to be seen, but India's wealth of talent should lift the current gloom surrounding Indian cricket.",
      "It's worth recalling that in 2011, after winning the ODI World Cup, India was whitewashed 4-0 in Test series against England and Australia. Cricket seemed to hit rock bottom.",
      "But, within months, a revival led by young talents like Kohli, Sharma, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Jadeja, Ashwin, and others saw India rise to become the world's top team across formats, holding that position for nearly a decade."

      "Introduction",
      "The first time it hit me that I had reached \"a certain age\" was while strolling through the streets of downtown New York with my daughters. They are, if I may be so bold, stunning girls. Rowan is a strawberry blonde with curves to die for; Grier is six feet tall, all legs, and towers over me. They're also funny, fiercely intelligent, thoughtful, and kind, though I guess those traits are less obvious to the casual observer.",
      "On this particular day, we were walking side by side, me in the middle, and it was impossible not to notice the admiring looks from various passersby. Over the years I've become used to being recognized on the street, but this time was different: the looks weren't cast in my direction, but at the two beauties by my side. I had every single feeling, all at once. What are you doing ogling my babies I will cut you but also aren't they gorgeous but also, wait, no one's gazing at me? When did that happen? Am I over? Protectiveness, pride, melancholy\u2014it all smacked me upside the head in one quintessential New York minute.",
      "There was also the time I was doing a photo shoot, and after a couple shots I took a peek at the monitor. \"I think there's some dust on the camera lens,\" I said to the photographer, pointing to a weird line on my cheek. His response was something to the effect of a pitying \"Awww, you're cute.\" There was no dust. That \"something\" was a wrinkle.",
      "I didn't have my first child until I was thirty-seven. I went through a hard time after I had Rowan, suffering from postpartum depression, which I wrote about in my first book, Down Came the Rain. But with the help of good medical professionals and the right medication, I felt like myself again, more or less, by her first birthday. I had Grier when I was forty, and the ensuing decade felt, in a word, playful. That was a brand-new feeling for me. I remember thinking in my forties, This isn't old at all! This is fun! Keep in mind, I'd been treated like an adult (and was expected to behave like one) since I was a kid. At forty, it was as though my biological age finally aligned with the age I'd felt for decades. I felt mature yet still playful. I was firing on all cylinders, and at the risk of sounding like Maria von Trapp, the world seemed full of possibilities. I felt like I was being primed for a moment when I could finally pat myself on the back and say \"You've earned it!\" if I chose to take a break. Plus, I'd arrived at a place of self-acceptance. I actually liked my body and no longer compared it to the runway models. (I never did runway and believed those girls were \"skinny,\" whereas I was considered \"athletic\"\u2014in my modeling days, a euphemism for \"not skinny.\") At forty, relieving myself of being compared to others felt like freedom. Mine was a body to be proud of. This body gave me babies! This body could dance! I had curves and was okay with that! It wasn't exactly \"I am woman, hear me roar,\" but I certainly felt like, \"I am woman, hear me more.\"",
      "And yet, as my forties progressed into my fifties, I began to notice that external perceptions didn't seem to match up with my internal sense of self. My industry no longer received me with the same enthusiasm I had come to expect. The vibe from casting agents and producers, but also my fans, was more: you need to stop time ... and maybe even reverse it. Case in point: at a routine dermatological appointment (to get a mole checked out), the doctor, unsolicited, waved his hand around my face and said, \"We could fix all that ...\"",
      "\"All what?\" I asked.",
      "\"You know, all the\"\u2014cue more hand waving\u2014\"you know.\"",
      "What the hell? Who asked for your opinion? I thought as I heard myself say, \"Thank you, but not yet.\"",
      "Maybe it took seeing myself through the eyes of other people to fully understand that, in fact, I was entering a new era of life. I mean, I was aware that some things were changing. I get tired now in a way I never did before. I literally can't read the fine print, and I hate it. I used to get mad at my mom for always misplacing her reading glasses, and now it's me saying \"Grier, honey, have you seen my readers?\" I like doing needlepoint and puzzles, which admittedly feels a bit geriatric. Am I in my mahjongg era?? I need 2.5s for these granny activities!",
      "And yes, sometimes I put on a pair of pants that once fit, and think, God, this used to be so much easier. Or I watch my kids, who can sleep until noon without stirring at the garbage trucks or sirens outside, and think, Ah, youth. There was a time when I could go to bed without taking a pill or being up for hours in the middle of the night, what was that like? And though these shockingly beautiful young women spend hours in front of the very mirrors I try to avoid, they still don't realize how fresh and perky and unaffected by gravity their bodies are\u2014just like we didn't at their age. (I mean, the butt and the boobs! How did I not appreciate that when I had it?) They complain that they hate their legs, whereas my knees are now practically lower than my calves. How is that even a thing? We are always chasing, never appreciating, and what runs through my mind is, Ugh, where is the justice?? Why are we forever criticizing ourselves and our bodies while seeking ridiculous perfection? Why do we never see how unique and special we are? And why, when we finally take the pressure off or count our blessings or just enjoy who we are, is it practically too late?",
      "But while I don't feel as invincible as I did in my youth, I also don't feel fifty-nine. When I was a kid, fifty-nine seemed so OLD, but it sure doesn't feel old to me now! When I say my age out loud, I know it may sound old to some people, but I truly don't feel, in any way, aged. Aging is a journey full of contradictions, especially in America. It's humbling and surprising and empowering and daunting and liberating. In plenty of cultures, older people are revered. In Korea, the sixtieth and seventieth birthdays are considered major life events, marked by parties and feasts. In Native American communities, elders are often referred to as \"wisdom-keepers\"\u2014they're considered community leaders. In India, elders have the final word in family disputes. In the Henchy-Shields household, on the other hand, this elder is constantly told, \"Mom, you just don't get it!\"",
      "In fact, a March 2023 cover story of the American Psychological Association's Monitor on Psychology described ageism in America as \"one of the last socially acceptable prejudices.\" Brands trip over themselves to capture the coveted eighteen-to-thirty-four demographic, even though surveys have found it's women over forty who have the most purchasing power: we have accumulated wealth, and we're making 85 percent of the household-buying decisions. The numbers for women over fifty are even more staggering: We control a net worth of $19 trillion, and spend 2.5 times that of the average person. Women in their forties and fifties are treated like we're invisible, even though we're one of the fastest-growing demographics in the country. (One in four Americans is a woman over forty.) We are ignored by brands, and when we are targeted, it's for wrinkle cream or menopause supplements. Talk about shortsighted.",
      "This notion of invisibility is so widespread, so pervasive, that it has become the namesake of a social phenomenon, aptly dubbed \"invisible woman syndrome.\" The gist? When we are no longer deemed sexy or able to contribute to society by birthing and raising young children, our value diminishes. We are overlooked, ignored, or worse, not seen at all.",
      "And the older we get, the more extreme it gets. An analysis of nearly eleven thousand ads featuring over twenty thousand people in 2021 and 2022 found that those featuring women over sixty years old amounted to a whopping 0.93 percent of all advertisements. You read that right: less than one percent of all advertisements feature women over sixty, even though the 2020 census found that one in six people in America is over sixty-five.",
      "According to a survey of women over forty by the advertising agency Fancy (which is specifically focused on marketing to a female audience), most women over forty feel that brands \"underestimate their spending power and intelligence while overestimating their preoccupation with appearance.\" We are, it turns out, more than just a demographic obsessed with looking younger. We embody vitality. We are smart and vibrant and powerful and ambitious. We are experienced, confident, capable, and complicated. We are running s**t.",
      "The truth is, I still can't quite get over that I'm using words like \"aging\" and \"elder\" in the same breath as I talk about myself and my friends. I'm not even sixty! I may not be playing the ing\u00e9nue or the girl next door or even the first love, but I'm not exactly the grandmother in Titanic.",
      "And yet, no one knows what to do with me. After all, Brooke Shields is not allowed to get old. The sixteen-year-old Calvin Klein model? Time magazine's face of the '80s? It's sacrilegious! I remember seeing a picture of what Marilyn Monroe would look like if she were still alive today, and it was truly impossible to wrap my head around. But she died looking like Marilyn Monroe. For me, as my body and face change in all the ways they should (don't get me started on my thinning, graying eyebrows), there is this sense of How dare you? That was never the plan, young lady! And, to be totally honest, there have been times when it's made me feel like a disappointment. Maybe you've felt this way, too\u2014maybe you were an athlete in your youth, singled out for your form and speed, and now you can still swim or run or play tennis or whatever, but not at the same level. You're still strong, but you had the audacity to grow older, to change, to slow down a bit, to not die young or stop aging entirely. You survived, and it should be celebrated, and yet there's a sense that you're not as valuable or exceptional as you once were, and therefore you're letting people down. And these reactions can cause us to feel disappointed in ourselves, too. I look back sometimes and feel like I've done something wrong because I no longer have the body or the face that I used to have. And yet, if I did anything drastic to hold on to my looks from my youth or to stop aging, I'd be judged or chastised for that, too.",
      "Generally speaking, at fifty-nine, I feel more confident than I ever have. I'm more comfortable in my skin and have stopped comparing myself to this ideal or worrying about that expectation. But I'll admit that even as I'm experiencing this newfound sense of satisfaction, I have to remind myself, sometimes daily, that I am good enough. The old negative tapes are lying in wait in the Walkman (remember those!?), ready for me to press play at any moment. But I also realize that if I don't wear makeup or the \"right-sized jeans and someone has a problem with it, that's on them. And yes, I continue to exercise and take care of my skin, but I think of it now as a privilege, because it makes me feel better. Do I sometimes wish that all my bits had remained higher and perkier? Or that I had the same skin that appeared on the cover of Life magazine in 1983? Of course I do! Who doesn't miss the gifts of youth? But this is a body\u2014and soul\u2014that has carried me through a lot, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I think I deserve some credit for this life well lived. We do all this work and get through hard times and suddenly you have a line on your face, and that one little wrinkle carries more weight than decades of accomplishments.",
      "I'll tell you, it took me a long time to have the guts to say that I deserved a bit more respect. Something began to shift in me around age forty. I started to own myself and my narrative in a new way. I'm not sure what it was that finally clicked, though becoming a mother probably had something to do with it. What I do know is that gaining that deeper sense of identity allowed me to speak up when others tried to diminish me. It's allowed me to look within and identify patterns and break cycles. It's allowed me to take on new risks and challenges. I know who I am and what I have to offer, and I've stopped hoping or trying to be different, or something that I'm not.",
      "Of course, as proud as I am of how far I've come ... there is still so much that I want to do. I want to pile into a camper with my daughters and my husband and take a cross-country road trip (although we'd probably end up killing each other, and the romance of the Porta Potti would surely wear off quickly). I want to learn to play an instrument. I want to get back to being fluent in French (it was my college major, after all). I want to travel to places I haven't been. The list goes on.",
      "All of this is doable, because there's a lot of freedom that comes with age. It's more fun to take a dance class when you can truly let yourself dance like no one is watching. It's more fun to go out with friends when you aren't worrying if you said the wrong thing or if people are talking about you behind your back. It's more fun to go to a restaurant alone when you realize that no one is wondering why you don't have a companion ... that no one is looking at you at all, because they're all dealing with their own s**t. And while, yes, my body is a little creakier than it once was, and it's not as easy to lose weight, the truth is I can still do almost everything I used to do. And the things I can't, well, I don't really want to. I don't want to surf ... I don't want to ski, unless it's somewhere sunny and the trail is long and relatively flat\u2014I just don't feel like exposing myself to freezing temperatures, fighting scary moguls, and navigating with the gear. But I don't feel limited. I'm happy that, at least for me, the moment for more intense, competitive activities has passed, and the moment for new emotional beginnings has arrived. I don't have to prove myself anymore. This is it. This is me! And if there is something I want to change, then I can make the decision to do so.",
      "What I've come to realize\u2014not only from my own lived experience but also from conversations with other women my age\u2014is that these \"later\" years are all about coming into your own and pivoting in the directions you've always wanted to go. You can finally live the life you intended to, because you no longer have to act in accordance with external timelines, something that is part and parcel of being a woman. I don't have to get married by this date or have kids by this age or get a certain job before that milestone. My time is my own.",
      "And yet\u2014 this newfound gift has come as a bit of a surprise. After all, the narrative we've been served for years is that it's all downhill for women after a certain age. As I hit my midfifties, I grew increasingly curious about the disconnect between how this age feels and how it's portrayed in our culture and society. I talked to other women my age who felt the same tension I did\u2014 both personally empowered and systemically dismissed. And this idea of being collectively ignored ... it irked me. I started connecting even more with women over forty, online and on social media, because I wanted to dig into what makes aging hard and what makes it great. What began as an online community to discuss health, aging, sexuality, relationships, and just plain living\u2014to dish about all those things you can't say to anyone except your closest girlfriends\u2014evolved into a hair-care brand, Commence, and a new business. So here I am, a first-time CEO in my fifties, inspired to start a business\u2014and write a book!\u2014all because of society's most uninspiring take on women my age.",
      "My first two memoirs, Down Came the Rain and There Was a Little Girl, were at their core about overcoming obstacles: first, postpartum depression, and second, losing my mom. But there is nothing to \"overcome\" about aging. That's the whole point! This time of our lives is something to enjoy and revel in, not something to merely survive. So if those books were about how I persevered through tough moments, this one is about how I took ownership and agency of a moment I'd been told would be tough, but really is rich and complex. But come on, life is complex. This book is about embracing an era that has been billed as an obstacle when, in reality, it's a stimulus. Yes, it has new and difficult challenges, but it doesn't have to be viewed as torture or a time to throw in the towel. I'm not trying to stave off this period, or deny it, or pretend I'm not in it. I'm taking the whole mess of it and reminding myself, and hopefully other women, that we have the elements we need to thrive. The story we've been told is, in a word, bulls**t. We are the narrators of our next chapters.",
      "For too long, women have talked about aging only in whispers and behind closed doors. Maybe it's because we've been embarrassed or ashamed. Maybe it's because we don't think anyone would want to hear what we have to say. These are understandable responses to our treatment by society, but they only serve to keep us isolated and disempowered. Recently, I had the pleasure of attending an intimate \"couch conversation\" with Gloria Steinem where she was talking about the challenges of being a woman today. The younger women in the room were eagerly asking her, \"But how can we fix it? How can we be a force for change?\" And she reminded us that \"every important movement started in a room like this\u2014in a basement, or a living room.\" When we step out from behind those closed doors and use our voices to talk about the misunderstandings, the underestimations, we're already starting to change them. Maybe even fix them.",
      "As far as I can tell, these decades in our lives are a time to be celebrated. Sure, there will be some hot flashes (been there!), but we can wear layers. (Or take hormones, which I have done, but more on that later.) I can tell you that the discomfort of those moments is far outweighed by the delight that comes from making intentional friendships, pursuing new interests, discovering our peak confidence, and giving ourselves permission to make changes to our lives.",
      "In 2023, my dear friend Ali Wentworth produced a documentary, Pretty Baby, about my life. Watching it, and seeing just how much I've been through, I couldn't help but feel proud. I'm not saying everyone should make a documentary about their lives, but I hope you can look back at how far you've come, how much life you've lived in order to get to this moment, and give yourself credit for the feat that it is. And then I hope it gives you the jump start you need to figure out how to enjoy this new stage of your life. Because the time is now! If there is something you want to change, now's the time to change it. If there's something you want to stop, now's the time to stop it. If there's something you want to do, now's the time to do it.",
      "Being relegated to the sidelines, as misguided as it is, also offers us more room to fully be ourselves. There's less pressure. We can push boundaries when we're moving through the world without the watchful eyes of, well, everyone. In Why We Can't Sleep: Women's New Midlife Crisis, author Ada Calhoun reconsiders all the so-called negatives of getting older. \"Could we see ... our newfound midlife invisibility as a source of power?\" she writes. \"There are great advantages to being underestimated. Two of the best reporters I know are women in their fifties. They look so friendly and nonthreatening, if you notice them at all. They can lurk in any room without usually wary people remembering to keep their guard up. Then they write devastating whistle-blowing articles. The world ignores middle-aged women at its peril.\"",
      "At fifty-nine, I'm the one making the calls in my life\u2014not my mother or the media or Hollywood or my family\u2014which is something I've never felt before. And this should be true for all of us. It doesn't matter what you've done, or what you think you've done (good or bad), or even what you always wanted to do. This is a new time. The same rules don't apply. Is that disorienting? Maybe, but I like to give it a different spin: We can make our own rules.",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 10:08:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Now nearly 60, the model and actress was recently elected president of Actors' Equity, and launched Commence, her beauty brand for women over 40. She's also written her fourth book, \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old,\"",
    "story": [
      "Last Sunday, Demi Moore accepted her first major acting award at the Golden Globes. Watching from home was Brooke Shields \"My kids'll be like, 'Oh, it's Golden Globe night. Get the bottle of wine for Mom! Get the tequila!'\" Shields laughed. \"It's so interesting, these award shows, right? They can be torturous if you sit there and you go like, Why am I not valid enough to get that, do that, whatever?\"",
      "I asked, \"You've felt that?\"",
      "\"I've felt it my entire life.\"",
      "It can be surprising to hear that a veteran actress like Shields yearns for acceptance. Turns out she's totally human. \"I was listening to Demi, 'We've weren't the ones that ever got awards.' Like, no. I got People's Choice Awards! The people loved me.\"",
      "\"So, you get the People's Choice Award, but you wanted the Emmy, the Oscar?\"",
      "\"You just wanted, like, to be part of the group, the cool kids,\" said Shields. \"That's where the little insecure girl comes out.\"",
      "At this point in her career of six decades, the comedienne has earned the right to laugh at herself.",
      "Currently 59, Shields said she feels 38. \"I definitely feel a youthfulness that I didn't feel in my younger years,\" she said.",
      "She started modeling while wearing diapers. Later, she turned heads wearing Calvin Klein jeans. Shields was expected to sell products and say her lines, all while looking gorgeous. She delivered.",
      "But as she approaches 60, she's found a cultural script she's powerfully rejecting.",
      "\"By the time you get to 50, they've just completely written you off,\" she said. \"You are out to pasture. Society says, 'Oh, if you're not the hot twenty-something at the bar, you're an old lady.' There's this whole demo in the middle that gets just overlooked.\"",
      "It's those overlooked women for whom Shields has written her fourth book: \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old\" (to be published Tuesday by Flatiron). \"When you are someone that has been noted for looking a certain way, by virtue of just growing older, you become a disappointment, in a way,\" she said. \"I've watched people get sort of personally affronted that I dare to be 60!\"",
      "\"And what do you say to them?\"",
      "\"I just sort of feel bad for them,\" Shields said. \"And I'm a part of the problem, because I was that symbol, you know, maybe unwittingly. But I didn't set out to do that.\"",
      "Nearly 44 years after being named the face of a decade, Shields hopes to be a voice for her generation \u2013 empowering women by sharing her personal and at times vulnerable experiences.",
      "In her book, she reveals that a doctor performed a surgery on her that she did not consent to. \"I was asked by my gynecologist if I experienced discomfort, and I said yes.\"",
      "In the late 2000s, Shields went to a surgeon to help reduce some labia discomfort. But after the operation, she says she found out he performed an extra procedure: an unwanted vaginal rejuvenation. \"He literally looked at me and said, like, 'I tightened you up a bit,'\" Shields said. \"And I was like, 'What?' And he just sort of was, like, boasting that he 'threw in a little bonus' for me. And I was in such shock that I just, I became numb. I didn't even know what to do.\"",
      "\"What did you say?\"",
      "\"I didn't say it, I didn't say a thing. because it sounded like he wanted me to thank him,\" Shields replied. \"I didn't say anything then, and this is the first time I've said anything.\"",
      "That so-called bonus surgery has had lasting side effects. The actress and model says sex can be painful.",
      "\"This was, you know, a long time ago. We didn't know what we could fight or complain. I finally had a life and kids, and it was like, 'Dear God, I don't want that kind of attention,'\" she said.",
      "So, why is she speaking out now? \"Because I have daughters. And there's no shame around it. And the more we have those conversations with them, conversations that I never had, the more progress I think we will have as women.\"",
      "Shields is looking to make progress in other ways, too. In May, she was elected president of Actors' Equity Association, the union representing 51,000 actors and stage managers around the country. As a five-time Broadway star, she felt a responsibility to give back to a community that's embraced her.",
      "She's already taken her fight to Washington for more funding and to change tax policy. \u00a0\"It's been a learning curve,\" she said. \"It's trial by fire. I'd never gone on the Hill and met with Congressmen and Senators. But you know, producers need to take care of the people that bleed for them on a daily basis.\"",
      "Besides being a union boss, Shields is now a CEO. She'd founded the beauty brand Commence, after hearing concerns from aging women about their hair. \"They have felt overlooked, and that's just the truth,\" she said. \"They're not being marketed to.\"",
      "Asked what the hardest part of being a CEO is, Shields replied, \"Money raising. Keeping the money flowing, because you have to put it right back into the company. And you know, nobody's getting salaries yet. Least I'm not!\" she laughed.",
      "Don't ask Brooke Shields if she's ready to slow down. Age has brought wisdom, and she's just getting started.",
      "\"I'm, you know, going to be 60 years old,\" she said. \"I'm still here. I feel like I'm at the beginning of a new, really exciting stage. The more confident you get \u2013 isn't it interesting \u2013 the more opportunity you get. And yet, you couldn't have arrived at said confidence without going through all the time to get here.\"",

    "title": "Wendell Pierce: An actor's journey",
    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:40:16 -0500",
    "summary": "With standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Death of a Salesman,\" and the CBS drama \"Elsbeth,\" the acclaimed actor talks about his childhood in New Orleans, training at New York's Juilliard School, and tackling the character of Willy Loman.",
    "story": [
      "It's been a few years since Wendell Pierce attended a drama class at the Juilliard School in Manhattan. Forty years, to be exact. \"I remember it well. High windows and gray floors!\" he laughed.",
      "He's said that nothing in his career gave him as much anxiety as training at Juilliard: \"Yes, the anxiety of, you know, am I doing the right thing? I'm going into an unknown world. Will I have what it takes to be just a working actor? And so, I was reminded looking in that class, it was very touching to see these young people at a point in the journey that I recall with fondness \u2013 and with a lot of anxiety, too! But I knew I was exactly where I wanted to be.\"",
      "And it's where he belongs. At 61, Pierce is among the most prolific and respected actors of his generation, with standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Treme,\" \"Suits,\" \"Selma,\" and now, the quirky CBS drama, \"Elsbeth.\" Later this year, he'll play editor-in-chief Perry White in the newest Superman movie. He'll also take on Othello at the Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington, D.C.",
      "No matter the part, Pierce brings his own humanity to it. He said, \"In every role, there's a little part of Wendell in it. At the end of the run, I turn the lights down low in the dressing room and I just see the silhouette in the mirror. And I have a good cry and say goodbye. Right? I say, 'Man, you taught me so much about myself. I've learned so much from you. I hope I see you again. And I know there'll be times where I will see you again.'\"",
      "That sense of self-discovery began in his hometown of New Orleans, and the historical Black neighborhood of Pontchatrain Park. \"It was like a Black Mayberry,\" he said. \"The first Black mayor came out of there, the first Black DA. Lawyers, doctors, postal workers, maintenance men. That was the community I grew up in. It was absolutely wonderful. And it was totally destroyed. We were destroyed by Katrina. We were part of the deepest flooding. And we brought it back, and now we're on the National Register of Historic Places.\"",
      "His mother, Althea, was a beloved schoolteacher. \"She taught everybody in the neighborhood. And I just remember how, everywhere I went, I knew that I had to live up to being her son,\" Pierce said.",
      "His father, Amos Pierce, Jr., was a World War II veteran. \"He was Army unit attached to the 3rd Marines in the invasion of Saipan. And after that, his unit received medals of commendation. And because he was there with the Black unit, the officer didn't believe him when he told him. He said, 'Listen, I think we received medals.' And it was a woman who said, 'Yeah, right. You? You didn't receive anything.'\"",
      "It would take 65 years for the injustice to be corrected. \"We gave him his medals on Veteran's Day 2010,\" Pierce said. \"I tell that story to say that he was a man who loved this country even when the country didn't love him back. And even after receiving the medals, there was a great pride. He didn't let the anger destroy him. And that was a great lesson.\"",
      "Pierce sees his own life as a series of lessons \u2013 and acting is part of that journey. He said, \"Every audition for me is an opening and closing night, where you get to perform: This is what I would do with this material. You do whatever you like from this point on. And then you leave the room.\"",
      "And he says his best work \u2013 be it as Detective Bunk Moreland on \"The Wire,\" or in Spike Lee's \"Malcolm X,\" comes from the writing. He said, \"The really good material is the thing that will define it, you know, and make it classic. Something that speaks to people across time and place no matter where you are, that's gonna speak to people years from now.\"",
      "A career highlight was in 2022, when Pierce became the first Black actor to play Willy Loman on Broadway, in Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman.\"",
      "Why does he think it took so long? \"The ignorance of biases and bigotry, and when people just don't have the ability to see others' humanity,\" Pierce said. \"And it's something that people are very conscious of at times, and then sometimes they're not very conscious of it.\"",
      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",
      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",
      "And it's Pierce's own compassion that draws people towards him, like Carrie Preston, his co-star on \"Elsbeth.\" She said, \"This kind of connection isn't always guaranteed. We've got it here. I'm grateful for it.\"",
      "And it's what his fellow Juilliard classmate Bradley Whitford recalled when he surprised Pierce with a message during our interview: \"Wendell, I miss you. I love you. I am so proud of you, not only for the great actor that you are and the dear friend, but what an amazing citizen you are. I love you!\"",
      "\"That's very special,\" said Pierce. \"Brad and I, we're part of a very special group here at Juilliard, our class. You know, when you go through the fire together, you're connected forever.\"",
      "Pierce has said he wants to make his mark. I asked, \"Do you think that you have? And what is that mark? What do you want to leave for people?\"",
      "\"I was afraid that I may not have the opportunity to leave my mark, that my best days were behind me,\" he replied. \"I had that fear, and I tapped into that fear when I did 'Death of a Salesman.' And while I still have the fear, now I have courage.",
      "\"I hope I can have an impact on someone else that way, the way they have an impact on me.\"",

    "summary": "Sam Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
    "story": [
      "Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as \"Soul Man\" and \"Hold On, I'm Comin,'\" has died. He was 89.",
      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \"call and response\" of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music's most enduring hits, which also included \"You Don't Know Like I Know,\" \"When Something is Wrong With My Baby\" and \"I Thank You.\"",
      "Most of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music's most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called \"Play it, Steve\" midway through \"Soul Man.\"",
      "Like many '60s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \"Soul Man\" hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \"Saturday Night Live\" stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \"Soul Men\" depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning that, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",
      "\"Two thousand dollars for my lifetime?\" Moore said then. \"If you're making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don't give me cornbread and tell me it's biscuits.\"",
      "Moore wrote the song \"Dole Man,\" modeled on \"Soul Man,\" for Republican Bob Dole's presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump's inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's campaign used the song \"Hold On, I'm Comin'.\"",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s but didn't meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label's Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band's troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",
      "He married his wife, Joyce, in 1982, and she helped him get treatment for his addiction which he credited with saving his life.",
      "\"I did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,\" during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.",
      "\"That's funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,\" he said. \"But you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I'm laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\"",
      "Moore kept recording and singing. He was a frequent performer at the Kennedy Center Honors and performed for presidents, including Obama.",
      "Moore is survived by his wife, Joyce, daughter, Michell, and two grandchildren.",

    "story": [
      "In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok could shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "\"Absent such relief, the Act will take effect on January 19, 2025,\" TikTok said in a Dec. 9 legal filing. \"That would shut down TikTok\u2014one of the Nation's most popular speech platforms \u2014 for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users on the eve of a presidential inauguration.\"",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \"political resolution\" and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\"Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\" lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention,\u00a0experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \"no one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\"",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \"concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\" TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Trump urges court to pause",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\"President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\" D. John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",
      "A decision could come within days.",
      "Editor's note: This story has been changed to clarify that TikTok could shut down on Jan. 19 if the Supreme Court rules against its request for a temporary injunction that would overturn or delay a law that could lead to a U.S. ban.",

    "summary": "More than 20 million egg-laying chickens in the U.S. died last quarter, federal data shows.",
    "story": [
      "More than 20 million egg-laying chickens in the U.S. died last quarter because of bird flu, data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows, marking the worst toll inflicted on America's egg supply since the outbreak began.",
      "The record number of chicken deaths, which includes those birds culled when infection is discovered in a flock, come as figures show egg prices have soared to the highest they have been in years, driven in large part by the virus.",
      "\"Unlike in past years, in 2024, all major production systems experienced significant losses including conventional caged, cage-free, and certified organic types,\" a USDA report said this month.",
      "Taxpayers will pick up the tab for the lost birds. To incentivize farmers to quickly report and stomp out the virus, a USDA program pays producers for the eggs and poultry they cull.",
      "Last year, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said it had spent $1.25 billion on payments to farmers since the outbreak started in 2022.",
      "Why are bird flu cases high right now in poultry?",
      "U.S. officials brace every winter for upticks in bird flu because migrating wild birds that spread the virus fly south during the colder months.",
      "It's also easier for the virus to spread in the winter. Heat and sunlight degrade the virus on surfaces, the USDA says.",
      "This winter has been different because a strain of the bird flu virus has spilled over into dairy herds too, leading to hundreds of infected herds.",
      "Authorities suspect the virus has been hitching a ride in droplets of contaminated raw milk. Those are ferried between farms by workers' clothing, equipment and animals shared between farms.",
      "California has been hit especially hard in recent months, forcing the state to declare a state of emergency to try to respond to the bird flu outbreak.",
      "This winter's surge of bird flu is from a different virus than the uptick of seasonal flu infections that also drives humans to emergency rooms every winter.",
      "While bird flu led to millions of dead poultry over the past year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied only 66 confirmed human cases in the U.S. from bird flu viruses.",
      "Most American cases of bird flu have been mild. A majority were farm workers who were infected after close contact with animals infected by a bird flu strain that spilled over into dairy cows in late 2023.",
      "Researchers think\u00a0this bird flu strain mutated to be milder to humans than other variants spreading in the wild. Those other strains usually cause more severe disease when they jump into humans.",
      "Can animals be vaccinated for bird flu?",
      "The USDA announced this week it is drawing up a new stockpile of poultry vaccines. That vaccine will target the D1.1 strain of the virus, which has been spreading in wild birds and was recently to blame for a fatal human case in Louisiana.",
      "But officials said it's unlikely the vaccine will be used. The Biden administration has been weighing the possibility of vaccinating poultry for bird flu for years.",
      "That is different from plans to potentially vaccinate cows for bird flu, which the USDA says appears \"more feasible and more likely to be successful\" in battling the virus. Seven potential vaccines are now being tested in field safety trials, the department said.",
      "One major hurdle has been the fear that vaccines will only hide the symptoms of the otherwise highly lethal disease in birds. That could result in export restrictions from countries afraid the virus could spread to them through poultry products.",
      "In 2023, the USDA banned imports of some products from Europe after authorities announced they would start vaccinating some poultry for bird flu.",
      "Spread of the virus through contaminated meat in the U.S. has already happened during this year's outbreak at least twice: raw pet food made from sick animals was linked to an outbreak that killed cats in California and Oregon.",
      "A Food and Drug Administration spokesperson told CBS News that the agency is now urging the animal food supply chain to take steps to curb the threat of the virus spreading, including heat treatment to kill off the virus and avoiding using infected animals.",
      "\"All recent detections of H5N1 in cats had these things in common: the infected cats ate wild birds, unpasteurized milk, raw poultry, and/or raw poultry pet food,\" the spokesperson said.",

      "Food and Drug Administration officials turned up dozens of violations at a McDonald's supplier linked to a deadly outbreak of E. coli that led to more than a hundred infections and a sweeping recall of onions used in the fast food chain's products, including its Quarter Pounder burgers.",
      "The violations, detailed in an inspection report released to CBS News in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, were seen during an inspection of a food production facility in Colorado run by Taylor Farms.",
      "Their findings amounted to the FDA issuing the McDonald's supplier a so-called Form 483, a list of citations over conditions inspectors worried could be \"injurious to health.\"",
      "That facility had been tasked with supplying \"slivered onions\" to McDonald's restaurants across a broad swath of states. Taylor Farms also produces a number of other products, including salads it sells in grocery stores as safe and ready to eat.",
      "For restaurants, Taylor Farms\u00a0bills its products\u00a0as a \"prep-less kitchen solution,\" allowing food service workers to skip the usual preparation steps they would need to use with ordinary produce that should be washed and cut before eating.",

      "\"Taylor Farms is confident in our best-in-class food safety processes, and in turn, the quality and safety of our products. As is common following an inspection, FDA issued observations of conditions that could be improved at one of our facilities,\" Taylor Farms said in a statement.",

    "summary": "Abortion bans enacted since Roe v. Wade was overturned may be driving Americans to leave restrictive states, researchers find.",
    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the majority of justices decided that the right to an abortion should be left up to individual states. Two years later, thousands of Americans in parts of the U.S. with strict abortion bans are deciding to leave those states, new research finds.",
      "Following the Dobbs decision, the 13 states with strict abortion bans, from Alabama to West Virginia, collectively lost a net 36,000 residents per quarter, meaning the difference between the number of people leaving the states versus those migrating in, according to the analysis from economists at Georgia Institute of Technology and The College of Wooster and published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The analysis, which is based on change-of-address data from the U.S. Postal Service, found that the state impact is larger among single-person households, which may suggest that younger people are moving out of abortion-banning states at a higher rate than families. That could be due to the greater challenges for families in trying to move, given the need to change schools or uproot careers for parents.",
      "A problem for states that ban abortion?",
      "While often framed as a cultural or religious issue, access to abortion also has far-reaching economic implications both for individuals and society at large. For instance, the financial toll on women without access to abortion services has been well documented, with the Turnaround Study finding that those denied the procedure had higher rates of financial problems and were more likely to rely on government aid like food stamps.",
      "The new research indicates that states with abortion bans could face long-term economic consequences if they lose significant numbers of residents \u2014 especially younger workers who are typically vital to a state's workforce.",
      "\"In terms of the implications for states' economies, our results suggest that employers in states with bans may face challenges in attracting and retaining workers, especially younger workers, which could impact economic growth and development,\" the researchers, Georgia Institute of Technology's Daniel L. Dench, Jason M. Lindo and Kelly Lifchez and The College of Wooster's Jancy Ling Liu, wrote in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The study didn't discern whether those moving out of states with abortion bans were men or women, or where they landed, including in states that have protected abortion. But the impact is significant enough that, over a five-year period, abortion-banning states could lose almost 1% of their population, the researchers said.",
      "Abortion bans and a weak safety net",
      "Separately, many of the states with strict abortion bans are failing to provide adequate safety nets, an analysis by the Associated Press found. These range from difficulty accessing programs such as food stamps to a lack of access to doctors due to maternal care deserts.",
      "Republican state leaders in Tennessee \u2014 one of the 13 states with a total abortion ban \u2014 argue that they are bolstering services for families. For instance, Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which enabled an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.",
      "But Tennessee fared poorly at enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, Medicaid, and in having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, according to an October study\u00a0published in the American Journal of Public Health. Other states with abortion bans, including Alabama, Georgia and Missouri, also ranked poorly on a number of measures, the analysis found.",
      "Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to obtain social services, according to a\u00a0survey\u00a0by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it's difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.",
      "\"People who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,\" said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the\u00a0study. But weakness in the safety net shows \"the hypocrisy of that argument.\"",
      "Meanwhile, many younger Americans are paying attention to a state's access to reproductive care. In a 2022 Axios poll, about 6 in 10 people 18- to 29-years-old said a state's abortion laws would sway their decision on where to live from \"somewhat\" to \"a lot.\"",
      "To be sure, there are many reasons why people opt to move out of a particular state, the Georgia Institute of Technology and College of Wooster researchers noted. \"And abortion-ban states are different from states protecting or maintaining abortion access in other ways besides their policies on abortion,\" they added.",
      "But a lack of access to reproductive choice, social services and medical care may make abortion-strict states less attractive to some residents, particularly young Americans, the study concluded.",

    "summary": "Lower immunity to the new GII.17 strain could be leading to more infections.",
    "story": [
      "A new strain of norovirus now makes up a majority of outbreaks nationwide, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new strain's emergence, found spreading throughout the country and on cruise ships, offers a possible explanation for the past month's steep wave of infections from the stomach bug.",
      "Scientists call this winter's dominant norovirus strain GII.17[P17]. Samples from patients in nearly 7 in 10 norovirus outbreaks have tested positive for the new strain so far this season, according to data from a network of public health laboratories called CaliciNet.",
      "\"It is too early to tell if this strain is associated with more severe norovirus disease but likely lower population immunity is the reason for the early surge of an otherwise seasonal increase of this virus,\" Jan Vinj\u00e9, head of the CDC's CaliciNet system, told CBS News in an email.",
      "All previous waves of norovirus in the U.S. since 2012 have been dominated by a different strain that scientists call GII.4, said Vinj\u00e9. This season, only around 7% of norovirus outbreaks have been linked to that GII.4 strain.",
      "Vinj\u00e9 said that the GII.17 strain is behind outbreaks \"everywhere\" across the country this season of the highly contagious virus, including on cruise ship outbreaks.",
      "The CDC tracked at least six norovirus outbreaks on vessels last month, marking the most reported in the month for over a decade.",
      "Norovirus is the most common cause of foodborne illness in the U.S. and almost always climbs around the country starting during the winter months.",
      "Many cases resolve on their own without needing to be tested or treated by doctors, making it impossible to know exactly how many Americans are sickened. However, virtually all data tracking the virus suggest norovirus is at peak levels throughout the country.",
      "Rates of positive norovirus tests from a different CDC network of laboratories have reached the highest weekly levels on record in years. Norovirus rates in figures from testing company BioFire Diagnostics are also now above previous seasonal peaks.",
      "In wastewater, samples collected by WastewaterSCAN have been \"high\" for norovirus across nearly all sites monitored by the firm across the country.",
      "While versions of GII.17 have been circulating for several decades, only in recent years has the strain driven large waves of infections. Some parts of Europe last year reported a \"sudden rise\" in GII.17. Japan and China reported their first waves from the strain after 2014.",
      "The CDC reported it had seen a rise in GII.17 cases last season, though it remained a minority of all norovirus outbreaks at the time in the U.S.",
      "Is GII.17 causing more or worse norovirus cases?",
      "Additional studies will also be needed to tease out whether GII.17 is leading to a difference in the severity of norovirus infections. Some previous changes to the virus have emerged without causing new or significantly worse symptoms.",
      "\"What we are seeing has happened before for noroviruses. Noroviruses are very diverse,\" said Marion Koopmans, head of the Erasmus MC Department of Viroscience.",
      "Koopmans, who oversees a global consortium of norovirus researchers, cautioned that data tracking norovirus cases still has gaps around the world. More studies are also needed to prove if there is an actual increase in illnesses being driven by the strain.",
      "\"There is insufficient surveillance (in my view) to really make the case that this is causing an increase in the number of cases, as we have a lot of norovirus infections each winter and the surveillance is rather patchy,\" said Koopmans.",
      "When the latest GII.4 strain, called the Sydney variant, emerged in 2012, initial data suggested it had driven an increase in outbreaks. The CDC later reported data from hospitals suggesting it had not actually led to significantly more or worse norovirus infections.",
      "\"Thus, the observed increase in outbreak activity during the 2012\u201313 season likely represents random seasonal and state variation rather than a direct result of the emergence of GII.4 Sydney,\" CDC scientists concluded at the time.",
      "Health officials in Wisconsin said earlier this month that they had seen a record-high number of norovirus outbreaks, but told CBS News they do not believe it is driving a major difference in symptoms or length of illness.",
      "\"It does not change any recommendations about prevention or spread. It just means we have a robust outbreak season and therefore an opportunity to really emphasize the importance of handwashing, staying home while sick and until at least 48 hours after recovery,\" said Elizabeth Goodsitt, spokesperson for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, in an email.",

    "title": "Does the tech industry really need so many workers on H-1B visas?",
    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:00:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk claims the U.S. needs a pipeline of foreign employees working on H-1B visas because the country lacks skilled engineers. Here's what the data shows.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk sparked fierce online debate recently when the billionaire said on social media that the U.S. lacks enough top engineers, pointing to immigration as the solution to what he characterized as a dearth of technical expertise.",
      "\"There is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America,\" Musk posted on his social media platform, X, comparing tech companies to a pro sports team scouting players. \"If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE.\"",
      "The claims are at the center of a divide between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, who tend to take a hard line against immigration, and technology entrepreneurs like Musk, who along with X runs exploration company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, both of which employ many foreign workers hired with H-1B visas.",
      "Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers.",
      "Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71.",
      "Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years.",
      "Companies with the most H-1B workers",
      "Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position.",
      "\"The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes,\" said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. \"If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor.\"",
      "Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages.",
      "Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills.",
      "In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract.",
      "These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said.",
      "\"Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs.\"",
      "A boost to innovation?",
      "Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One\u00a0study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers.",
      "The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed.",
      "\"Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters,\" said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, \"There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent.\"",
      "Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow.",
      "But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers.",
      "When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable.",
      "Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe.",
      "More firing than hiring",
      "Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023.",
      "The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform.",
      "How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed \"Buy American and Hire American,\" aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",
      "But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a \"great program.\" Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would \"go to war on this issue\" in one X post.",
      "\"I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas,\" Trump said. \"That's why we have them.\"",

      "Pacific Palisades, the Los Angeles neighborhood that's been devastated by the Palisades Fire, is emblematic of the insurance nightmare increasingly facing homeowners residing in regions prone to climate disasters.",
      "About 1,600 policies in Pacific Palisades were dropped by State Farm in July, California Department of Insurance spokesman Michael Soller said in an Thursday email to CBS MoneyWatch. An\u00a0analysis of insurance data by CBS San Francisco last year found that State Farm also dropped more than 2,000 policies in two other Los Angeles ZIP codes, which include the Brentwood, Calabasas, Hidden Hills and Monte Nido neighborhoods.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, State Farm said, \"Our No. 1 priority right now is the safety of our customers, agents and employees impacted by the fires and assisting our customers in the midst of this tragedy.\"",
      "State Farm's decision reflects a trend of private insurers, including\u00a0Allstate\u00a0and Farmers Insurance, of dropping California policies or halting underwriting, leaving homeowners with the choice of getting coverage through the insurer of last resort, the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, or FAIR Plan, or forgo insurance altogether. The FAIR Plan provides basic fire insurance coverage for properties in high-risk areas when traditional insurance companies will not.",
      "As a result, homeowners in Pacific Palisades had increasingly shifted to the FAIR Plan, with roughly 1,400 of the town's 9,000 homes covered by the plan in 2024, more than quadruple the number in 2020, according to data from the insurer. In other words, prior to the disaster, about 1 in 7 homeowners were reliant on the FAIR Plan.",
      "The Palisades Fire could become the costliest wildfire in history because of the number of buildings that have been destroyed and as the structures rank among the nation's most expensive homes, said Daniel Swain, a University of California Los Angeles climatologist, on a Wednesday webcast about the disaster. The neighborhood's 9,000 residential units have a median home value of $3.1 million,\u00a0according to real estate data firm ATTOM Data.",
      "While personally and financially devastating to homeowners, the Los Angeles fires \u2014 which include the Eaton Fire and several other wildfires \u2014 are likely to place added stress on the state's already fragile insurance market, experts and lawmakers say. It's an issue that extends beyond California, with similar issues facing homeowners in Florida, Louisiana and other states.",
      "\"We will be watching to see whether the collapse of a trembling home insurance market accelerates after this added shock,\" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, wrote on X Thursday. Whitehouse serves on the Senate Budget Committee, which last month issued a report\u00a0about climate change's impact on the insurance market.",
      "Rep. Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California whose district includes parts of Los Angeles, told CBS MoneyWatch she will soon re-introduce a bill called the Wildfire Insurance Coverage Study Act, which would require the Government Accountability Office to analyze the dangers posed by wildfires to communities, and how insurance companies are responding.",
      "\"It will help us determine what the best federal response is to these issues,\" Waters said. \"We have to know more about climate change,\" such as determining which areas or types of vegetation are more susceptible to wildfires, and the risk of building in those areas.",
      "She added that the higher risks are \"leaving homeowners and business owners and families without insurance coverage because some of the insurance companies are canceling; they are aren't writing any new insurance. People continue to pay higher prices for even less coverage.\"",
      "With the fires continuing to rage across the Los Angeles area, the estimated cost of the disaster is surging. The potential property damage and economic losses could amount to as much as $150 billion, according to a Thursday estimate from AccuWeather. That would make these wildfires by far the most destructive in U.S. history.",
      "In California, State Farm last year said it was discontinuing coverage for 72,000 houses and apartments in the state. Since 2019, more than 100,000 Californians have lost their insurance, according to a San Francisco Chronicle\u00a0analysis of insurance data.",
      "\"A full-scale financial crisis\"",
      "With climate disasters increasing in frequency, the insurance industry is grappling with a new calculus amid rising costs and risks. That's prompting some insurers to decide not to renew insurance policies in counties that are most at risk from climate risks \u2014 and it's not only within California and the other usual suspects, the Senate report found.",
      "\"The data confirm that it is climate change that is driving increasing non-renewal rates,\" it noted. \"Second, the data reveal that Florida, Louisiana, California, and Texas are not the only places experiencing spiking non-renewal rates and increasing premiums.\"",
      "Other regions facing rising non-renewal rates are Southern New England, the Carolinas, New Mexico and counties in the Northern Rockies, Oklahoma, and Hawaii, the report found.",
      "The issue isn't just local. \"This is predicted to cascade into plunging property values in communities where insurance becomes impossible to find or prohibitively expensive \u2014 a collapse in property values with the potential to trigger a full-scale financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008,\" the report stressed.",
      "\"Here's how it works: Climate change makes risk unpredictable; risk makes insurance unaffordable or unavailable; no insurance makes mortgages unavailable; without mortgages property values crash; cascading like 2008 into general economy,\" Whitehouse wrote Thursday on X.",
      "FAIR Plan",
      "Still, there's some potential for near-term relief. Homeowners in California could get help from a new state regulation, announced Monday, that will require insurers to offer coverage in wildfire-prone areas.",
      "The ultimate goal of the new rules is to get homeowners out of the FAIR Plan, California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara's office said. The average cost of insurance on the FAIR Plan is about $3,200, or more than double the typical homeowner's cost in California, according to Bankrate.",
      "The rule will require home insurers to offer coverage in high-risk areas, something the state has never done, Lara's office said in a statement. Insurers will have to start increasing their coverage by 5% every two years until they hit the equivalent of 85% of their market share. That means if an insurer writes 20 out of every 100 state policies, they'd need to write 17 in a high-risk area, Lara's office said.",
      "In exchange for increasing coverage, the state will let insurance companies pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers. Insurance companies typically buy reinsurance to avoid huge payouts in case of natural disasters or catastrophic loss. California is the only state that doesn't already allow the cost of reinsurance to be borne by policyholders, according to Lara's office.",
      "Opponents of the rule say that could hike premiums by 40% and doesn't require new policies to be written at a fast enough pace. The state did not provide a cost analysis for potential impact on consumers.",
      "\"Californians deserve a reliable insurance market that doesn't retreat from communities most vulnerable to wildfires and climate change,\" Lara said in a statement.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 08:13:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposal is raising concerns with the chip industry, with artificial intelligence leader Nvidia calling it \"misguided.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that would limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, part of an effort to preserve America's six- to 18-month advantage on AI over rivals such as China.",
      "Proposed Monday, the framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict in 120 countries the chips used for data centers and AI products. Mexico, Portugal, Israel and Switzerland are among the nations that could have limited access.",
      "Chip giant Nvidia on Monday called\u00a0the proposal \"misguided,\" and said that it \"threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\"",
      "On a call with reporters previewing the framework, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that it's \"critical\" to preserve America's leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips. The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.",
      "\"As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense,\" Raimondo said. The framework \"is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.\"",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.",
      "Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve U.S. companies' advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains.",
      "AI-enhanced technology is forecast to help fuel growth and boost corporate productivity, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling the tech developments a \"once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution\" in a recent research note.",
      "Risks to AI leadership?",
      "A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\"While we share the U.S. government's commitment to national and economic security, the rule's potential risks to U.S. global leadership in AI cannot be emphasized enough,\" said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group's senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry.",
      "One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.",
      "Nvidia bashes proposal",
      "Because the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration of President-elect Donald Trump could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips. This sets up a scenario in which Trump will have to balance economic interests with the need to keep the United States and its allies safe.",
      "Ned Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI's development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.",
      "\"While cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,\" he said. \"The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\"",
      "Under the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.",
      "Nations without restrictions",
      "The allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.",
      "Users outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the U.S.",
      "Institutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.",
      "Also, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.",

    "summary": "The first congestion pricing plan in the U.S. has begun, charging most drivers $9 a day to enter the lower half of Manhattan. The long-debated plan is projected to raise up to $800 million a year for the city's aging public transit system. Will it work?",
    "story": [
      "By some measures, New York City's traffic is more congested than it's ever been. Enter: Congestion pricing. Since last Sunday, during most hours, cars crossing into the lower half of Manhattan are charged nine dollars. There's a higher toll for trucks.",
      "Fourteen hundred cameras keep tabs on the roughly 150,000 commuters entering the zone by car.",
      "\"If we can just impact on a proportion of those people, we can make a difference and make it a much better place for everybody,\" said Janno Lieber, who heads the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs New York's sprawling subway, bus and commuter rail systems. \"We're wasting a ton of money, literally billions of dollars, according to our business leaders, having people stuck in traffic.\"",
      "The haul from congestion pricing will go largely to the MTA, to improve mass transit. According to Lieber, it will raise between $500 and $800 million a year.",
      "The pricing idea began in 1952, and gained traction in the early 2000s. But there've been a lot of bumps in the road. There were lawsuits and protests, for and against.",
      "New Jersey drivers were none too happy; they already pay more than $15 in bridge and tunnel tolls to get into the city.",
      "Singapore began congestion pricing in 1975, and Stockholm in 2006. But New York based its plan on London's, which rolled out in 2003.",
      "Opponents in New York say this is just a cash grab \u2013 another tax that will hurt mainly working people.",

      "\"Congestion Pricing\" passes in New York as other states consider the plan for themselves",
      "John McDonagh has driven a cab for more than 40 years. He's also a playwright and radio host, and is not a fan of the plan. \"It will not reduce congestion here,\" McDonagh said. \"The street designs of New York now, we have a bus lane on one side, we got a bike lane on the other, concrete barriers. So, 10 cars gives you congestion.\"",
      "But with the money going to improve public transport, that will help everybody, right?",
      "McDonagh replied, \"Oh, it does? We had a woman that was burned on the subway. We had people being pushed onto the tracks. There's robberies. And if you take the subway in New York, jumping the turnstile now is an Olympic sport.\"",
      "It's called turnstile jumping \u2013 or more politely, \"fare evasion\" \u2013 and the MTA projects it will lose $800 million a year because of it, around the same figure congestion pricing may bring in.",
      "And then there is fare evasion on buses. According to the MTA, 47 percent of riders aren't paying.",
      "\"The MTA has now installed cameras so that they can catch people,\" said Kathy Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, which mobilizes business leaders to help the city thrive. \"They are providing police, even the National Guard is in our system to make sure the people pay their fare.\"",
      "Wylde is a longtime advocate for congestion pricing, and has advice for other American cities: \"You have to explain the benefits clearly,\" she said. \"You have to have transit options in most cases. Otherwise, it's just another tax, because if somebody has no choice, they're gonna resist.",
      "\"The lesson from London [is], they put in 200 new bus routes before they turned on congestion pricing,\" Wylde said. \"And that was how they got the public to accept it. They had a choice.\"",
      "It's hard to tell how it's working in New York City after a week, but according to Wylde, \"We're very excited that, in just a few days of congestion pricing, we're seeing a significant reduction in traffic already.\"",
      "Yet, the battle may not be over in New York. Among its opponents: once and future president Donald Trump. Wylde isn't worried, though. \"President Trump has property in New York,\" she said. \"He, I'm sure, has been stuck in traffic more than a few times here.

    "story": [
      "Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, says he was not surprised that Donald Trump won the election: \"People were angry at whatever they called the state \u2013 the 'swamp.' Ineffective government. That people wanted kind of more pro-growth and pro-business policies, that they didn't want to be lectured to on social policies continuously. I think it's the lecturing part of it. It's social superiority, it's the 'My way or the highway.' I traveled all over the country; I felt it wherever I went.\"",
      "I asked, \"There's a sense of gloom out there about the economy. Do you understand that?\"",
      "\"I do understand it, 'cause I think there are a lot of legitimate concerns that Americans have. For example, ineffective government, they're angry about it. They're angry about immigration. There're people with legitimate issues.\"",
      "Despite lower unemployment, a calming of inflation, and a soaring stock marker, even he says he's \"cautiously pessimistic\" about the economy. And as head of the largest bank in America, it matters what Dimon has to say about things.",
      "Listen to him on Bitcoin, which he's referred to as \"a Ponzi scheme\" and \"as useless as a pet rock\": \"We are going to have some kind of digital currency at some point. I'm not against crypto. You know, Bitcoin itself has no intrinsic value. It's used heavily by sex traffickers, money launderers, ransomware. I just don't feel great about Bitcoin. I applaud your ability to wanna buy or sell it. Just like I think you have the right to smoke, but I don't think you should smoke!\"",
      "Since he took charge of the bank 20 years ago, the company has doubled its number of employees to 320,000, and grown its assets by nearly $3 trillion. Which probably would surprise his grandparents, who came to the U.S. from Greece with little money in the early 1900s.",
      "Dimon spent much of his childhood in an apartment building in a middle-class neighborhood in Queens, New York, sharing a room with his two brothers. Revisiting the street where he grew up, Dimon noted, \"I broke my arm on those monkey bars over there.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did you ever dream when you were growing up, in a million years that you'd be running one of the biggest banks in the world?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"My dad was a stockbroker. So, I was sometimes conscious of that part of the world. But I had never met a CEO until I was in college or something like that.\"",
      "He grew up to be one of most successful CEOs in the country, processing $10 trillion a day.",
      "His bank is thriving and healthy, but Dimon, now 68, has had two major health scares. The first was throat cancer a decade ago.",
      "He says it's in remission: \"But I know a little bit more,\" he said. \"People who have been told they have cancer know a little bit more than other people. That's staring you right in the face and it may actually happen. You become a little more deliberate, a little more thoughtful. You don't want to have regrets.\"",
      "He also had a heart scare in March 2020, at the beginning of COVID. \"My heart, I just, I mean, the pain was extraordinary. I thought I heard it rip. It was an aortic dissection. I had a tear in the aorta.\" He was told he might not make it.",
      "I asked, \"Going in for surgery, you know, at least you think in your mind, 'I've lived the life I should've lived so far'?\"",
      "\"Yeah. Not enough of it, but yeah,\" Dimon laughed.",
      "He woke up after seven or eight hours on the operating table: \"The doctor told me I was one of the only people he's ever seen wake up immediately after surgery like that. I waved at my kids, who had been sitting there the whole time. And then, I was back asleep in the ICU.",
      "\"Waking up in the ICU, I mean, like, when you're a man who's never had to rely on other people really, and all of a sudden you have tubes everywhere and you can't do anything yourself, and you know, you got tubes in your heart and tubes in your lungs and tubes down your jugular\u2026\"",
      "He was in the hospital for a week, back at work a month later, and soon traveling the world, which he does, he says, 40 percent of his time.",
      "We met him in the executive suite on the 43rd floor of the bank's Manhattan headquarters. From there, he can see where he grew up \u2013 and to the left, the nearly-twice-as-high, dazzling new JPMorgan headquarters going up next door, which he says will be taller than the Empire State Building.",
      "With all the big things he deals with, it's interesting that one of the things Dimon is most proud of is opening branches in lower-income and underserved communities around the country. Visiting one branch in Harlem, he noted, \"Mortgage documentation is really hard to do. So, in one of these community branches, a guy stood up and he said he finally bought a home that he'd lived in for 30 years. He said there's no way he could have gotten that mortgage if one of our mortgage loan officers didn't call him every day for months, taking him through it, making him feel comfortable, getting the forms. He got our homeowner's grant. And it works.\"",
      "This isn't a not-for-profit; these local branches make money for the bank.",
      "But what about the other end of the spectrum? Asked about the increasing wealth of the very rich and what might be \"out of whack\" with the system, Dimon replied, \"I think you have to be very careful to say, 'What's outta whack?' You want a healthy economy, and a really healthy economy lifts up all citizens. You want to help all Americans? Grow the economy. You can wail at the moon. That's not going to grow the economy. And if there are unfair things that created some of that wealth, they should be fixed.\"",
      "\"But I'm not hearing you say, 'There's something wrong here that there are these billionaires growing like poppy.' I mean, what is it? The tax laws?\"",
      "\"If I was king for a day, I would probably change a bunch of the tax laws, too, which I'm not gonna give you specifics on. It won't reduce it as much as you seem to think it should be reduced.\"",
      "\"No. But I'm interested that you're not saying, 'This is wrong. This is not working.'\"",
      "\"I think the wrong part is that the bottom 30% didn't do better, not that the top 0.1% did so well.\"",
      "\"Why not?\"",
      "\"They may be unrelated. What we need to do to fix it for everybody \u2026\"",
      "\"But you haven't said what's wrong at the other end?\"",
      "\"I don't know what's wrong at the other end,\" Dimon replied.",
      "Dimon himself is a billionaire. We asked him about the richest person in the world, Elon Musk. \"He's clearly an extraordinary talent,\" Dimon said. \"I mean, to look at Tesla and SpaceX, yeah, well, we should make government more efficient. Is this the way to do it? I don't know. Do I want them to succeed? Absolutely.\"",
      "\"But it's odd to have a man who's so wealthy, with so many important companies that matter to our economy and even to our national security, now sort of insinuating that he can influence right-wing politics in Europe. It doesn't sound right, does it?\"",
      "Dimon said, \"I'm not responsible for his behavior, so let him do it. But when you say it's odd, it's not that odd. It's been going on in this country for a long time. If you go back to Lindbergh, there's been more interfering in cross-Atlantic politics than you would think.\"",
      "\"Are you distressed by it?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"Take it in stride?\"",
      "\"Take it in stride.\"",
      "\"Somebody called him an oligarch, an American oligarch.\"",
      "\"Yeah, that's name-calling.\"",
      "Dimon has been in banking for more than 40 years, which leads to the inevitable question: When will he retire? \"Last time I was asked, I said, less than five years. But when you say retire, I'm not going to retire like that. I may write a book. I may teach. I may work with my kids, if they want. I would never pressure them to work with me.\"",
      "\"I didn't hear you say, 'I might become chairman and, you know, just give up the CEO part.'\"",
      "\"Oh, that's likely. That's likely to happen. Again, that is up to the board, not up to me. But if it makes sense, I may be chairing for a couple years.\"",
      "He says he does not know whom his successor might be. But one thing he does know: \"I love my job. I love what it does. I like our people. It motivates me. Like a lotta people, by Friday I'm exhausted. I want to go home, I want to have my martini and go to sleep! But I do love my job. I think it's great to have a purpose in life.

    "story": [
      "Mark Zuckerberg set the internet abuzz this week when the Meta CEO announced that the tech giant would no longer conduct independent fact-checking. The program, implemented in 2016, will be replaced with Meta's own version of Community Notes, a crowdsourced approach to reviewing online content employed by\u00a0 X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.",
      "So what exactly is Community Notes, and how does it work?",
      "How Community Notes works",
      "Meta hasn't released specifics about how it will empower users of Facebook, Instagram and other social platforms to monitor content, said Melissa Mahtani, executive producer at CBS News Confirmed.",
      "On X, Community Notes works by leaving fact-checking up to the community. Approved contributors call out content deemed false or misleading by attaching notes providing more context. Here's an example of a community note provided by X on its site:",
      "Becoming an approved contributor on X \"doesn't take much,\" Mahtani said. Any X user with an active phone number and who's been on the platform for at least six months with no violations is qualified to volunteer to be a contributor, she said. Contributors are protected by anonymity.",
      "When a post is deemed false or misleading by an approved contributor, the person will post a note that provides users with additional context. The note appears beneath the original post.",
      "Once a note is added by an approved contributor, it is still not visible to regular users on X. Before that happens, other approved contributors must vote on whether the note is helpful. This is where \"things get tricky\" said Mahtani.",
      "Is the note helpful?",
      "Once a note is added to a post on X, other approved contributors rate it on its utility.",
      "Explained Mahtani, \"Other contributors need to take a look at the sourcing, the accuracy of that note, and vote on whether or not it's helpful. If they vote that it's helpful \u2014 this is the tricky part \u2014 the company says that an algorithm takes a look at the ideological spectrum of all those contributors who voted. If they deem that those voters are diverse, it gets published.\"",
      "The algorithm decides",
      "According to X's website, the purpose of its so-called\u00a0bridging-based algorithm\u00a0is to \"identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives.\"",
      "In other words, if the algorithm finds that contributors who voted on a given note represent an ideologically diverse group, then the note becomes visible on the platform. But if the algorithm finds that the voting contributors are too uniform in their political views \u2014 a possible sign of bias \u2014 \"the public never sees it,\" Mahtani said.",
      "Problems with X's system of crowd-based fact-checking arise when a valid note calling out misinformation isn't rated as helpful by a diverse enough group of contributors to satisfy the algorithm, and is therefore never seen by readers. The speed at which a note is made public is also important, so that false or misleading information isn't given the opportunity to spread unchallenged.",
      "A report in October\u00a0by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate analyzed the Community Notes feature and found that accurate notes correcting false and misleading claims about the U.S. elections were not displayed on 209 out of a sample of 283 posts deemed misleading \u2014 or 74%.",

    "story": [
      "Employers added 256,000 jobs in December, blowing past economists' expectations and signaling that the job market remains resilient in the face of still-high borrowing rates and stickier-than-expected inflation.",
      "The economy was expected to add 153,000 jobs last month, according to economists polled by financial-data firm FactSet. The unemployment rate in December stepped down to 4.1%, lower than the forecast that the rate would remain steady at 4.2%.",
      "Hiring was strongest in the health care, government and social assistance industries, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday. Retail companies also added jobs last month, after a decline in November.",
      "The Jan. 10 jobs report marks the last monthly employment snapshot of the Biden administration, which inherited an economy scarred by the pandemic. When Biden was inaugurated in January 2021, the jobless rate stood at 6.4%, while inflation was about to soar to 40-year highs, kicking off a flurry of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve to tame price increases.",
      "Under the Fed's restrictive monetary policy, the economy has cooled, dampening inflation but also creating some cracks in the labor market. At the same time, the incoming Trump administration's policies, if enacted, are expected to be inflationary, prompting some economists to predict that the central bank may hold off on cutting rates at its January 29 meeting.",
      "Fewer Fed cuts?",
      "The robust jobs report may also ease pressure on the Fed to continue to cut rates, given the Fed Chair Jerome Powell had cited some earlier signs of weakness in the labor market as one reason why the central bank began cutting rates in September.",
      "\"The solid December employment report will solidify the Fed's intentions to proceed with the slower pace of interest rate cuts it signaled at its December meeting,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"Officials have been a bit disappointed at the uneven pace of progress in lowering inflation, and the data should ease any fears that keeping rates on hold will pose a significant risk to the labor market.\"",
      "The Fed in December trimmed its benchmark for a third straight month amid signs that the economy was gearing down. The central bank is now penciling in only two rate cuts in 2025, down from the four it had forecast in September when it last issued economic projections.",
      "Some economists think the Fed could lower borrowing costs one once in 2025, while others expect more cuts.",
      "\"Our own baseline continues to assume three rate cuts this year, one more than signaled by the Fed, with the first to come in March,\"Vanden Houten said. \"The December report increases the risk that the Fed will remain on hold in March and that we only see two cuts this year, particularly if policies on tariffs and immigration implemented by the incoming Trump administration are more inflationary than currently incorporated in our baseline.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",

    "summary": "Abortion bans enacted since Roe v. Wade was overturned may be driving Americans to leave restrictive states, researchers find.",
    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the majority of justices decided that the right to an abortion should be left up to individual states. Two years later, thousands of Americans in parts of the U.S. with strict abortion bans are deciding to leave those states, new research finds.",
      "Following the Dobbs decision, the 13 states with strict abortion bans, from Alabama to West Virginia, collectively lost a net 36,000 residents per quarter, meaning the difference between the number of people leaving the states versus those migrating in, according to the analysis from economists at Georgia Institute of Technology and The College of Wooster and published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The analysis, which is based on change-of-address data from the U.S. Postal Service, found that the state impact is larger among single-person households, which may suggest that younger people are moving out of abortion-banning states at a higher rate than families. That could be due to the greater challenges for families in trying to move, given the need to change schools or uproot careers for parents.",
      "A problem for states that ban abortion?",
      "While often framed as a cultural or religious issue, access to abortion also has far-reaching economic implications both for individuals and society at large. For instance, the financial toll on women without access to abortion services has been well documented, with the Turnaround Study finding that those denied the procedure had higher rates of financial problems and were more likely to rely on government aid like food stamps.",
      "The new research indicates that states with abortion bans could face long-term economic consequences if they lose significant numbers of residents \u2014 especially younger workers who are typically vital to a state's workforce.",
      "\"In terms of the implications for states' economies, our results suggest that employers in states with bans may face challenges in attracting and retaining workers, especially younger workers, which could impact economic growth and development,\" the researchers, Georgia Institute of Technology's Daniel L. Dench, Jason M. Lindo and Kelly Lifchez and The College of Wooster's Jancy Ling Liu, wrote in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The study didn't discern whether those moving out of states with abortion bans were men or women, or where they landed, including in states that have protected abortion. But the impact is significant enough that, over a five-year period, abortion-banning states could lose almost 1% of their population, the researchers said.",
      "Abortion bans and a weak safety net",
      "Separately, many of the states with strict abortion bans are failing to provide adequate safety nets, an analysis by the Associated Press found. These range from difficulty accessing programs such as food stamps to a lack of access to doctors due to maternal care deserts.",
      "Republican state leaders in Tennessee \u2014 one of the 13 states with a total abortion ban \u2014 argue that they are bolstering services for families. For instance, Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which enabled an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.",
      "But Tennessee fared poorly at enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, Medicaid, and in having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, according to an October study\u00a0published in the American Journal of Public Health. Other states with abortion bans, including Alabama, Georgia and Missouri, also ranked poorly on a number of measures, the analysis found.",
      "Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to obtain social services, according to a\u00a0survey\u00a0by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it's difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.",
      "\"People who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,\" said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the\u00a0study. But weakness in the safety net shows \"the hypocrisy of that argument.\"",
      "Meanwhile, many younger Americans are paying attention to a state's access to reproductive care. In a 2022 Axios poll, about 6 in 10 people 18- to 29-years-old said a state's abortion laws would sway their decision on where to live from \"somewhat\" to \"a lot.\"",
      "To be sure, there are many reasons why people opt to move out of a particular state, the Georgia Institute of Technology and College of Wooster researchers noted. \"And abortion-ban states are different from states protecting or maintaining abortion access in other ways besides their policies on abortion,\" they added.",
      "But a lack of access to reproductive choice, social services and medical care may make abortion-strict states less attractive to some residents, particularly young Americans, the study concluded.",

      "Many property owners hit with large and total losses learn the hard way that they are not fully insured. The issue is so common that United Policyholders has an entire section on its website devoted to underinsurance help. \"Many property owners have succeeded in getting the coverage they thought they had but didn't, but many have given up. Insurers count on you giving up,\" according to the nonprofit organization that advocates for policyholders of all types.",
      "Fires that damage but don't completely destroy one's home create their own insurance claim issues, according to United Policyholders. Things to watch out for include hidden damage from water, smoke, ash and mold. Air quality and ducts should also be considered. \"Repairs should return your property to a 'uniform and consistent appearance' even if that means replacing undamaged items such as roof tiles or carpeting,\" it stated.",
      "People living in seemingly unscathed residences alongside homes that burned down should still have their place inspected for possible structural and other damage from extreme heat, smoke or fire retardant. \"If your insurer refuses to conduct or pay for proper inspections, ask again in writing; politely remind them of their legal duty to thoroughly investigate all damage, including hidden damage. If a dispute arises, it's worth finding and paying for your own inspection by an independent reputable specialist,\" United Policyholders said.",
      "Smoke damage is a covered peril in most policies, with disputes often arising over cleaning or replacing exposed items.",
      "Extreme heat and smoke kills most plants and may contaminate soil. Keep your claim open for at least six months and file supplemental claims if necessary, as damaged plants may not die right away. Coverage for landscaping replacement is typically a set amount or percentage of your dwelling coverage. The losses are frequently only partially covered. \"Mature trees can be valued as high as $5,000 yet many policies contact a $500 per tree limit.\"",
      "Another thing to keep in mind: Unreimbursed losses can offset your tax obligations when you claim as a casualty loss deduction.",
      "If one believes they are being treated poorly by their insurance company, the California Department of Insurance has an online\u00a0form that homeowners can use to file complaints.",
      "Steps in preparing to evacuate",
      "For those told to evacuate due to the wildfires, do so immediately. For those preparing to evacuate, here are some tips from United Policyholders:",
      "1. Document your home and possessions. Take pictures or a video of each room and the outside of your house. Build as much of an inventory as time permits including furnishings, artwork, jewelry and appliances. \"After a traumatic loss, it's impossible to remember everything you had, so most people never collect their full insurance benefits,\" United Policyholders noted.",
      "2. Pack important documents:",

      "3. Start savings receipts. Wildfire evacuees can file for reimbursement for additional living expenses. Check the \"loss of use\" section of your policy. If your home is not damaged and your temporary living expenses are modest, keep in mind that filing a claim goes on your record and can hike your insurance costs.",

    "story": [
      "Billy Long, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the IRS, is facing questions about his qualifications to lead the tax agency from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts who serves on the Senate's Finance Committee.",
      "While serving as a representative, Long, a Republican from Missouri and a former auctioneer,\u00a0co-sponsored legislation\u00a0that aimed to wipe out much of the tax code. After leaving office, he served as a tax adviser to businesses seeking to employ a controversial tax credit, the Employee Retention Tax Credit, or ERTC.",
      "In her Jan. 9 letter to Long, Warren raises questions about Long's tax expertise as well as his promotion of the ERTC, which has been\u00a0flagged\u00a0by the IRS for its high rate of fraud. Unlike other recent IRS tax commissioners, Long doesn't have a depth of experience in the tax industry, nor does he have a degree in accounting or tax law.",
      "\"[Y]our lack of significant management or tax experience \u2014 and your promotion of credits that have been \"magnet[s] for fraud\" \u2014 raise serious questions about your qualifications to lead the IRS,\" Warren wrote in the letter, noting that the Senate Finance Committee will hold his confirmation hearing early this year.",
      "The Trump campaign and Long didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "In a 2023 podcast, Long talked about his work with a firm called Lifetime Advisors, where he helped promote the ERTC to businesses, although Warren's letter notes that the podcast appears to have been \"pulled down from multiple podcast platforms, including the Listen Notes website, Apple, Spotify and YouTube.\"",
      "In the podcast, which CBS MoneyWatch listened to in December before it was taken down, Long said qualifying for credit was difficult during its first iteration, but that he helped make it easier for businesses to be eligible while he was in Congress.",
      "\"We went from having to say COVID adversely affected your business definitely, to taking that away, and you don't have to prove that you had any downturn,\" he said. \"We're doing recoveries for folks that had their best two years ever during COVID.\"",
      "In the letter, Warren asks Long to provide information about his work with the ERTC, including whether any returns he had worked on claiming the credit have been challenged by the IRS. Among the senator's other queries are whether Long directed anyone to pull down the 2023 podcast, and how he earned the designation of \"certified tax & business adviser,\" a term that he has used to describe himself on his X profile.",
      "\"Although you bill yourself as a 'Certified Business and Tax Adviser,' this certification appears to only require a three-day training,\" Warren noted. \"There is no record of you on the IRS' database of tax return preparers \u2014 a searchable directory that lists individuals who hold credentials recognized by the IRS \u2014 nor do you appear in the Missouri Board of Accountancy database.\"",

      "East and Gulf Coast port operators late Wednesday struck an agreement with a dockworkers union, resolving a labor dispute that had\u00a0threatened to halt shipments\u00a0for a second time in three months.",
      "The two sides \u2014 the International Longshoremen's Association and the United States Maritime Alliance \u2014 announced in a joint statement Wednesday evening that they had reached a tentative deal on a new six-year contract that averts a strike that would have started Jan. 15.",
      "\"This agreement protects current ILA jobs and establishes a framework for implementing technologies that will create more jobs while modernizing East and Gulf coasts ports \u2013 making them safer and more efficient, and creating the capacity they need to keep our supply chains strong,\" the two parties said in their statement.",
      "Terms of the deal were not immediately disclosed.",
      "President Biden praised the agreement, saying in a statement Wednesday night that it \"shows that labor and management can come together to benefit workers and their employers.\"",
      "It comes after members of the ILA had ended a three-day walkout in October after reaching a tentative deal with the USMX that initially suspended the strike until Jan. 15. While resolving issues over pay, job security issues remained, with the union looking for guarantees that ports wouldn't use technology to replace workers.",
      "The ILA argued against using more automation at the ports, saying the USMX was looking to cut their labor costs and boost profits.",
      "For their part, port operators and shipping companies argued that the U.S. is falling behind automated ports like those in Dubai, Rotterdam and Singapore.",
      "The stakes were high for the U.S. economy. Ports on the East and Gulf coasts handle more than half the nation's traffic in shipping containers, the steel boxes at the center of world trade, which carry everything from smartphones to fresh fruit to automobiles.",
      "Under the existing contract with the Maritime Alliance, the highest-paid dockworkers making $39 an hour, or $81,000 a year. The top hourly wage would rise to more than $60 an hour under the deal tentatively struck in October.",
      "A 2019-2020 report by the Waterfront Commission, which oversees New York Harbor, found that a third of the longshoremen based there made $200,000 or more annually including overtime pay. That didn't include workers' share of royalties on the cargo that moves through the ports, payments that can come to thousands of dollars a year.",
      "The 10 largest U.S. ports all use some kind of automation technology to move cargo, according to a 2024 Government Accountability Office\u00a0report. These include automated gates, which let trucks and containers move through cargo terminals with limited worker interaction; so-called port community systems, which are digital platforms that automatically streamline logistics and supply-chain data; and technologies used in \"internet-of-things\" systems, such as RFID, GPS and cameras, to operate equipment and track containers.",
      "Only three domestic ports \u2014 Long Beach Container Terminal in Long Beach, Calif., and TraPac and APM Terminal Pier 400 in Los Angeles \u2014\u00a0are fully automated. At fully automated ports, both horizontal and vertical container movement is handled by machines. Other technologies put to use at\u00a0automated ports\u00a0include AI-powered sensors, so-called digital twins \u2014 or identical, digital\u00a0replicas\u00a0of ports \u2014 and blockchain to automate the recording of transactions and track container locations.",

    "summary": "Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed David Weiss to be special counsel, giving him expanded powers to continue his investigation of Hunter Biden.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department on Monday released the final report of special counsel David Weiss, the Trump-appointed federal prosecutor elevated to special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of President Biden.",
      "In the report, which Garland submitted to Congress on Monday, Weiss wrote that he stood by his decisions to prosecute the president's son on tax and gun charges after agreements with Hunter's legal team collapsed. And Weiss pushed back on Mr. Biden's criticism of the probe.",
      "Weiss led a yearslong investigation into Hunter Biden that ultimately led to a jury conviction on felony gun charges in Delaware federal court and a guilty plea to tax evasion charges in California. In December, the president pardoned his son and claimed the charges against Hunter Biden were \"raw politics,\" a comment that was met with bipartisan criticism.",
      "\"The President's statements unfairly impugn the integrity not only of Department of Justice personnel, but all of the public servants making these difficult decisions in good faith,\" Weiss wrote in his report. \"The President's characterizations are incorrect based on the facts in this case, and, on a more fundamental level, they are wrong.\"",
      "\"Calling those rulings into question and injecting partisanship into the independent administration of the law undermines the very foundation of what makes America's justice system fair and equitable,\" Weiss wrote. \"It erodes public confidence in an institution that is essential to preserving the rule of law.\"",
      "In the report, Weiss defended his charging decisions, which many Republicans in Congress alleged favored the president's son.",
      "\"I concluded that the Principles of Federal Prosecution were satisfied as to both the tax offenses and the gun offenses,\" Weiss wrote.",
      "In 2023, Hunter Biden was charged with lying on a gun application about his drug use and in a separate case, he faced three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanor offenses, including failure to file and pay his taxes, tax evasion and filing a false return.",
      "Prosecutors alleged he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in federal taxes while living an \"extravagant lifestyle.\"",
      "\"Not only were both cases proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but they resulted in a verdict lawfully rendered by a jury and an admission of guilt. In making my decisions, I remained impervious to political influence at all times,\" Weiss wrote.",
      "During the special counsel's probe, IRS agents who worked on the Hunter Biden tax case with Weiss' team came forward in an interview with CBS News to raise questions about what they alleged was special treatment in the probe of the president's son. The said that dating back to the Trump administration, they had repeatedly been prevented from taking steps in the IRS investigation that would have been considered routine in other cases.",
      "\"We have to make sure as a special agent for IRS Criminal Investigation that we treat every single person exactly the same,\" Gary Shapley, a 14-year veteran of the agency, told CBS News at the time. \"And that just simply didn't happen here.\"",
      "The Justice Department and Weiss denied that Hunter Biden received favorable treatment.",
      "In a letter to Garland included in the report, Hunter Biden's legal team pointed out its criticism of the probe and told the attorney general, \"you likely are aware of the arguments we have made about the initiation and conduct of the prosecutions against our client.\"",
      "\"These are not 'inconsequential' or 'technical' tax code violations,\" Weiss wrote. \"The prosecution of Mr. Biden was warranted given the nature and seriousness of his tax crimes.\"",
      "Answering criticism of the gun charges, Weiss argued, \"An analysis of Justice Department data from 2008 to 2017 shows that these charges are brought more frequently than over 90 percent of the other available firearm offenses.\"",
      "According to Garland's letter to Congress, Weiss submitted the report a few days ago, on Friday. The attorney general noted there had been no instances during the probe when Garland had to intervene because of policy violations.",
      "The report also detailed Weiss' investigation into a former FBI informant, Alexander Smirnov, who pleaded guilty earlier this year to lying to FBI agents and providing them a fake story about the Bidens. Smirnov was sentenced to six years in prison earlier this month.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 18:12:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Pete Hegseth must be approved by the GOP-led Senate Armed Services Committee before he can go before the full Senate for confirmation.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's surprising pick to lead the Pentagon \u2014 former Fox News personality Pete Hegseth \u2014 will have to publicly address scrutiny by Democrats over allegations from his past, controversial comments and his qualifications to run the largest government employer in the country during his confirmation hearing Tuesday.",
      "When Trump announced in November over social media his intention to nominate Hegseth, it caught nearly everyone off guard. Shortly afterward, reports surfaced of an alleged sexual assault, excessive drinking and financial mismanagement of veterans' organizations Hegseth ran. To control the damage and prove his mettle, Hegseth barnstormed the Capitol for meetings with mostly Republican senators.",
      "According to his lawyer, Hegseth paid a confidential settlement to the woman who accused him of sexual assault in 2017, though he denies committing the crime. Hegseth has also denied he mismanaged finances at veterans' organizations.",
      "Some Republicans who initially seemed to be less supportive of Hegseth's nomination after the reports surfaced have since rallied around him, and sources told CBS News last week that Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune has privately told Trump he believes Hegseth will have enough votes to get confirmed.",
      "Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso said when asked whether Hegseth has the votes to be confirmed that he \"certainly has the qualities that we need to lead the Pentagon.\" But Barrasso added that \"every senator gets to speak for themselves.\"",
      "\"The meetings have gone very well. Things are heading in the right direction. The hearings start Tuesday, and they're going to be consequential,\" Barraso said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"People will listen and make their own decision.\"",
      "Hegseth's attorney Tim Parlatore confirmed to CBS News that he met with the FBI for a background check interview \"a few weeks ago\" and the meeting lasted about two hours. Parlatore said in the interview with Hegseth, they \"went through everything,\" and Parlatore called it a \"very thorough investigation.\"",
      "Parlatore said the FBI \"interviewed a whole bunch of other people to follow up and corroborate. They pulled a bunch of records and just like we predicted in the beginning, the FBI background check would clear him, and you know, they found nothing remarkable.\"",
      "The FBI did not brief senators on its background check findings, according to a source familiar with the matter. In keeping with its customary practice, the FBI performed the check, and then passed the information along to the leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee.",
      "Because Republicans control the Senate, Hegseth can afford to lose three Republican votes, with Vice President-elect JD Vance breaking any tie in his capacity as president of the Senate. But first, the clearest path to advancing to the Senate floor is via a majority on the comittee. The committee has a one-seat Republican majority, so if all Democrats oppose him, it would only take one Republican to defect to complicate his nomination to the floor.",
      "Democrats on the committee have signaled they'll use their time during Tuesday's hearing to ask Hegseth about not only the allegations but also about his lack of senior leader experience.",
      "Hegseth served in the Army National Guard and deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay. He retired in 2021 at the rank of major.",
      "\"I want to ask him, what's the largest organization that you've ever run? How big a budget have you ever planned and executed?\" Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois told CBS News in an interview last week.",
      "\"I mean, the secretary of defense is going to be going to NATO and negotiating with allies and going to be managing 3 million personnel, going to be managing a budget of over $800 billion dollars,\" Duckworth said. \"Is he capable of doing that?\"",
      "If Hegseth is confirmed, he will replace Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who was a four-star general and commanded U.S. Forces in the Middle East before retiring from the Army in 2016. Other recent Secretaries of Defense were James Mattis, who was a retired four-star general in the Marines, and Mark Esper, who right before becoming Secretary of Defense was the Secretary of the Army \u2014 and both of whom served under Trump in his first term.",
      "Duckworth, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee and is an Iraq War combat veteran, said Hegseth has refused to meet with her and that the dates his team proposed would be after his confirmation hearing, instead of before.",
      "A transition official told CBS News that Hegseth's team intended to meet with the Democratic leadership of the Armed Services Committee before the committee's other Democrats. In this case, that meant meeting with Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member, which occurred on Jan. 8. Hegseth's team is working to schedule meetings with more senators before and after the confirmation hearing.",
      "Reed said in a statement after the meeting, \"Today's meeting did not relieve my concerns about Mr. Hegseth's lack of qualifications and raised more questions than answers.\"",
      "One Republican senator on the Armed Services Committee who has not yet voiced her support for Hegseth is Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa. Ernst, who served in the Army National Guard, has moved closer to supporting Hegseth after meeting with him. After her first meeting, she declined in a Fox News interview to say whether she would support him, though she did say she supported the vetting process.",
      "But after another meeting, she said in a statement that she had \"encouraging conversations\" with Hegseth. She added that as she supports \"Pete through this process, I look forward to a fair hearing based on truth, not anonymous sources.\"",
      "On \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, Barrasso called Ernst a \"warrior\" and a \"patriot\" and said she had met with Hegseth at least twice.",
      "\"She's going to ask additional questions at the hearing on Tuesday and ultimately make her decision,\" Barrasso said. \"With regard to the FBI report, reported today that the chairman and the ranking member of the committee have seen the report already.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren released a list of 72 questions she has for Hegseth covering the allegations and Hegseth's stances on issues like women should not be in combat roles and whether senior military officers, like Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen.

      "In a roughly 30-minute phone call Sunday afternoon, President Biden delivered difficult news to the families of three Americans held by the Taliban. He did not have a deal with the Taliban to free their loved ones from captivity, despite what U.S. officials described to CBS News as a significant offer the U.S. had extended in Doha days earlier. The U.S. considers Ryan Corbett and George Glezmann to be wrongfully detained by the Taliban, and describes Mahmood Habibi, who holds dual American and Afghan citizenship, as \"unjustly held\" since 2022.",
      "Ahmad Shah Habibi, the brother of Mahmood Habibi, told CBS News that during the conversation, Mr. Biden clarified that he would not agree to the Taliban's demand that the U.S. release Muhammed Rahim al Afghani, a detainee at Guantanamo Bay, unless the Taliban, now the government of Afghanistan, also releases Mahmood. An NSC spokesman declined to respond to a CBS inquiry about that specific claim.",
      "Mahmood Habibi disappeared in Afghanistan in 2022, and the Taliban denied abducting him. In a public notice posted by the FBI in August 2024, the agency said it \"believed\" that Habibi was taken by Taliban military or security forces and \"has not been heard from since his disappearance.\" The FBI said in its notice that Habibi was working as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecom company when he disappeared.",
      "The Taliban still say they do not have Habibi in custody.",
      "\"No, we don't have him,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told CBS News Monday.",
      "Asked whether Mahmoud had disappeared in Afghanistan, Mujahid said, \"It's not clear either, because we didn't know him before.\"",
      "Ahmad Habibi told CBS News, \"My family has every confidence that my brother is alive. There are things that neither we nor the U.S. government can say publicly, but Mahmood's case is different from the other two Americans.\"",
      "\"We know the other families are desperate to get their loved ones home and I told the president we want them home, too,\" Ahmad Habibi added. \"But anyone speculating that my brother is dead is just feeding into Taliban claims. We are grateful that President Biden committed to not leave Mahmood behind,\" and he said that national security adviser Jake Sullivan had also made similar assurances.",

      "\"He was very kind and empathetic, but what I heard him say is he's not bringing Ryan home, and that was just devastating,\" Anna Corbett said. She blasted Mr. Biden for refusing to agree to the Taliban's terms for a deal. \"It is not being taken and it is incredibly crushing to our family.\"",
      "She has launched a public campaign in recent days to urge the incoming administration to press for her husband's release, and she traveled to President-elect Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago residence in hopes of making an in-person plea to Trump. Neither Mr. Biden nor Trump have met with her yet.",
      "Anna Corbett did tell Fox News that Trump sent incoming national security adviser and current Florida Rep. Mike Waltz to meet with her. She said he spent more than an hour listening to her family's story. She expressed frustration that it took more than a year to get a similar meeting with the current national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.",
      "The Taliban have been demanding that the U.S. release Muhammed Rahim al-Afghani, who is being held in indefinite law-of-war detention at Guantanamo Bay. A source familiar with his case said the U.S. intelligence community and Pentagon oppose Rahim's release and could not guarantee that he no longer represented a threat to the U.S. However, the president could waive that if he determined it were in the U.S. interest to finalize a prisoner swap.",
      "Rahim was captured in Pakistan in 2007 by the CIA and was the last detainee sent to the Guantanamo prison facility by the Bush administration in 2008. He has never been charged with war crimes, but the periodic review board has deemed his continued detention a national security necessity. His 2016 intelligence profile describes him as a courier for al Qaeda.",
      "In its statement acknowledging the phone call, the White House also noted that Mr. Biden had been able to bring home U.S. citizens who had been detained before the U.S. exit from Afghanistan in 2021. Corbett, Glezmann and Habibi were detained after traveling to Afghanistan following the Taliban's return to power. That ascendance of the Taliban followed a diplomatic deal negotiated by the Trump administration for U.S. troops to withdraw and a surprisingly strong Taliban military offensive that caught the Biden administration off guard, leading to a hasty and chaotic U.S. evacuation. Unwilling to remain without U.S. troops, NATO forces also pulled out.",
      "The U.S. does not officially recognize the Taliban, with its horrific human rights record, as the legitimate government of Afghanistan but has been in contact with its leaders through U.S. agencies as well as via the Qatari government. Last weekend in Doha, Special Presidential Envoy Roger Carstens and NSC official Jen Daskal pressed for a deal with the Taliban to free the Americans.",
      "A U.S. official described the Doha meetings as unsuccessful but declined to detail which other individuals the Biden administration was willing to offer to the Taliban as part of a potential trade. The White House described the Biden efforts as continuing through the end of his term.",
      "Mr. Biden has dedicated much of his career to foreign policy, and that portion of his legacy is extremely important to him. In a speech Monday at the State Department, the president will describe the chaotic U.S. exit from Afghanistan, arguably his biggest foreign policy failure, as having successfully ended America's longest war.",

      "\"We had hoped to have the hearing later this week. It looks like it's going to be the following week,\" Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican and the Senate majority whip, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The delay comes as many of Trump's other picks are set to appear before committees this week, ahead of his inauguration on Jan. 20. Before a confirmation vote in the Senate, Gabbard must appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which must receive paperwork for nominees at least a week before the scheduled hearing.",
      "Gabbard served in the Army National Guard and represented Hawaii in the House as a Democrat from 2013 to 2021.

    "story": [
      "With a world at war in Ukraine, the Middle East and Sudan, President Biden argued in a speech at the State Department Monday that his administration has strengthened partnerships around the world, bettered the United States' position on the global stage and weakened key adversaries.",
      "When Mr. Biden took office four years ago, he sought to reassure global allies and reestablish foreign treaties from which the Trump administration had withdrawn. The president reestablished strong relationships with leaders of NATO countries in the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and reentered the Paris climate agreement. But world leaders have been preparing for significant changes with President-elect Donald Trump's impending inauguration.",
      "\"I come here to the State Department to report to the American people on the progress we've made in the last four years, in our foreign policy, in our presidency,\" Mr. Biden said. \"I've said many times, we are at an inflection point. The post Cold-War era is over. A new era has begun. In these four years, we faced crises, we've been tested, we've come through those tests, stronger in my view, than we entered those tests. This is a fierce competition underway. The future of the global economy, technology, human values and so much else. Right now, in my view, thanks to our administration, the United States is winning the world-wide competition.\"",
      "Specifically, the president made the case that the United States' partnerships and transnational institutions are significantly stronger than they were before he took office, a key claim of his presidency.",
      "\"Today, I can report to the American people, our alliances are stronger than they've been in decades,\" he said. \"NATO is more capable than it's ever been. And many more of our allies are paying their fair share.\"",
      "But the president also sought to make the case that the United States' \"adversaries are weaker than they were when we came into this job four years ago.\"",
      "Specifically, Mr. Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin has \"failed\" to subjugate Ukraine and weaken NATO. The president touted his work to rally the world around Ukraine, another central piece of his foreign policy.",
      "\"As I saw it, when Putin launched his invasion, I had two jobs \u2014 one to rally the world to defend Ukraine, and the other is to avoid war between two nuclear powers,\" Mr. Biden said. \"We did both those things. Today, Ukraine is still a free, independent country, with a potential, a potential for a bright future.\"",
      "He also argued that Iran is weaker than it's been in \"decades,\" saying Iran's main proxy Hezbollah is \"badly wounded\" and Iran's economy is in \"desperate straits.\"",
      "Something that has remained elusive for the Biden administration is the freeing of the hostages Hamas captured in Israel, which has been a top priority for the president and his aides. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said before Mr. Biden's speech on Monday the parties are \"close to a deal and it can get done this week,\" but also said he couldn't make a promise or a prediction.",
      "In his speech, the president briefly mentioned the soldiers who died during the chaotic and deadly withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, while emphasizing that he has been the president to end United States' involvement in its longest war.",
      "\"We grieve all 2,461 Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice in the longest war in American history,\" he said. \"And I grieve those brave service members whose lives were lost during the withdrawal.\"",
      "Thirteen U.S. service members\u00a0died in an attack\u00a0outside of the Kabul airport amid the evacuation as the Taliban took over control of the country faster than the U.S. expected.",
      "Mr. Biden also laid out the challenges ahead for the incoming Trump administration, which will have to deal with a chaotic Middle East, Russia's nearly three-year war on Ukraine and a tenuous situation in the Red Sea.",
      "\"Make no mistake, there are serious challenges the United States must continue to deal with, in Ukraine, in the Middle East, in the Indo-Pacific,\" he said. \"Must keep the pressure on the Houthis who are attacking ships in the Red Sea, launching missiles at Israel, and firing at American forces. Must deter North Korea as they rattle their saber and draw closer to Russia. And new challenges will certainly emerge in the months and years ahead.\"",
      "\"But even \u2014 but even so, it's clear,\" he continued. \"My administration is leaving the next administration with a very strong hand to play. And we're leaving an America with more friends and stronger alliances, whose adversaries are weaker and under pressure. An America that once again is leading, uniting countries, setting the agenda, bringing others together behind our plans and visions.\"",
      "The president recently told USA Today that he had helped reset ties that had frayed during the Trump administration, saying he had managed an \"inflection point\" in history. He credited his long history in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with helping him \"navigate some of the fundamental changes taking place, whether it's in Europe, in Latin America, in the Middle East, in the Far East.\"",
      "\"The only advantage of being an old guy is that I've known every major world leader for a long time,\" he told USA Today's Susan Page. \"And so I had a perspective on each of them and their interests.\"",
      "Jake Sullivan said the president will argue \"America is winning that contest for the future.\"",
      "In his first foreign policy speech as president, in 2021, Mr. Biden aimed to tie foreign and domestic policy interests by arguing for a foreign policy for the middle class. The focus was meant to be on China and repairing alliances but was disrupted by crises in Ukraine and the Middle East.",
      "\"The United States is in a worse geopolitical position today than it was four years ago,\" says Stephen Wertheim, historian and senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"The United States is immersed in a massive war on the European continent with serious escalation risks; it's back to bombing the Middle East with no end in sight; and it has entered into a full-spectrum strategic rivalry with China.\"",
      "A look at the major foreign policy issues of his presidency:",
      "Ukraine, Russia and NATO",
      "Mr. Biden has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine, becoming the first president to go to a conflict zone where U.S. troops were not involved and directing over $183 billion dollars in military aid since Russia's invasion in 2021. He played a key role in getting NATO to spend more on collective defense.",
      "Yet the fierce battle continues on the frontlines with no clear plan for a peace deal. Washington deferred to Kyiv on when and how negotiations should take place with the tagline \"nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\"",
      "The administration was criticized early in the conflict for holding back on sending the most lethal weapons and later by some Republicans for spending too much money on Ukraine aid.",
      "Mr. Biden is expected to argue that his policies have ensured the survival of Ukraine as an independent state and thwarted Putin's ambitions, a senior administration official tells CBS News.",
      "Israel-Hamas war",
      "After Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed over 1,200 civilians, Mr. Biden made it clear that Israel has the right to defend itself with his administration sending over billions of dollars worth of military assistance.",
      "As Israel launched a war on Gaza that has killed more than 45,000 people according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry and led to a humanitarian crisis, the administration did not change its stance.",
      "In April 2023, Mr. Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanhayu that future U.S. support of his country was dependent on Israel protecting civilians and aid workers in Gaza.",
      "\"Biden willingly threw away his leverage by immediately pledging military support for Israel; then he criticized the Israeli government's decisions from the self-imposed sidelines,\" Wertheim said.",
      "The State Department informed Congress earlier this month of a planned $8 billion weapons transfer to Israel. Ceasefire negotiations are still underway between Israel and Hamas as pressure mounts for a deal to be reached prior to Trump's inauguration on January 20.",
      "Chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal",
      "The most glaring foreign policy failure was the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "Mr. Biden had promised to end America's longest war and assured Americans that the Afghan military was capable of holding off a Taliban takeover. Instead the Taliban expanded its control of territory across the country more quickly than the U.S. expected and seized Kabul as the Afghan government collapsed. The U.S. hastily evacuated about 125,000 people, including 6,000 Americans, over the course of its frenzied withdrawal, but dozens of Afghans and 13 U.S. service members were\u00a0killed in a suicide bombing\u00a0outside Hamid Karzai airport in Kabul as thousands sought to flee the country.",
      "U.S. citizens and Afghan allies who supported American troops throughout the war were left behind. Thousands feared retribution from the Taliban and felt abandoned by an American government that had promised to take care of them.",
      "Images of Afghans clinging onto military planes in hopes of escape, and U.S. military weapons left behind and paraded about by the Taliban became emblematic of the missteps leading up to the evacuation.",
      "In the three years since the Taliban returned to power, al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have established a presence in the country, and\u00a0Afghan women and girls have been deprived of basic freedoms\u00a0they enjoyed during two decades of Western-backed government following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.",
      "China",
      "Trump began a trade war with China\u00a0and other countries during his first term, imposing tariffs that were aimed at deterring what he saw as unfair trade practices and to encourage American consumers and businesses to buy and sell more goods made at home. While the rhetoric changed under Mr Biden, he nonetheless continued the tariff policy. And as was the case during the Trump administration, both have viewed China as a security threat, not just an economic one.",
      "The Biden administration put safeguards in place to help protect industries like chip production from relying on China. Global alliances such as the Quad \u2014\u00a0 U.S., India, Japan and Australia \u2014\u00a0 and AUKUS \u2013 Australia, the U.S. and U.K. \u2013 made diplomatic and military headway in deterrence against China. And the Biden administration has also enhanced its military alliance with Japan.",
      "Mr. Biden was vice president when former President Barack Obama delivered his \"pivot to Asia\" speech. American policymakers have been attempting to shift foreign policy focus ever since, but there has been a world of distractions along the way.",
      "\"The United States cannot expect to prioritize China while remaining the leading military power in Europe and the Middle East. If the United States truly wants to prioritize China, it needs to pull back elsewhere,\"\u00a0 Wertheim said.",
      "Olivia Gazis and \n                                                  \n                                  Ahmad Mukhtar\n                  \n        contributed to this report."

      "A federal appeals court separately declined to stop the report's release after Cannon last week issued a temporary order precluding the Justice Department from making it public. Her order remains intact until 12 a.m. on Tuesday.",

      "Still, Cannon said there are outstanding legal issues over the Justice Department's proposed plan to give certain members of Congress access to the second volume of the report. The defense teams have argued against that limited release, writing that doing so could risk leaks.",
      "She set a hearing for Friday in her courtroom in Fort Pierce, Florida, to go over that proposal.",
      "Cannon wrote that the release of the report's second volume, even on a limited basis, \"risks irreversibly and substantially impairing the legal rights of defendants in this criminal proceeding. The court is not willing to make that gamble on the basis of generalized interest by members of Congress, at least not without full briefing and a hearing on the subject.\"",
      "She said the government has not \"presented any justification to support the suggestion\" that the second volume must be released to Congress now instead of \"after a reasonable period for an expedited hearing and judicial deliberation on the subject.\"",
      "Jack Smith's report",
      "Cannon's decision is the latest in a fast-moving legal battle over Smith's report that is playing out just days before Trump will be sworn in for a second term. Once the president-elect returns to the White House on Jan. 20, it's highly unlikely the special counsel's report will be publicly released.",
      "Smith resigned his position as special counsel last Friday, and Justice Department prosecutors are now overseeing all ongoing matters arising from his investigations. Smith's two investigations and prosecutions of Trump have since been dropped because of his victory in the November presidential election.",
      "As is required for special counsels, the special counsel drafted and submitted a final report to the attorney general last week. Garland has vowed to make public all special counsel reports completed while he is attorney general, and has so far followed through on that pledge, including after the investigation into President Biden's handling of classified documents.",
      "But Nauta and de Oliveira are fighting to keep the report shielded from the public. The two were charged for allegedly obstructing the investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents. While Cannon dismissed the case against them on the grounds the special counsel was unconstitutionally appointed, federal prosecutors are appealing her decision as it relates to Nauta and de Oliveira.",
      "Defense lawyers argued that disclosing the report to the public would unfairly prejudice potential future criminal proceedings against them. Defense attorneys simultaneously asked the 11th Circuit and Cannon last week to block the Justice Department from releasing the report.",
      "Cannon\u00a0temporarily stopped the report's release until the 11th Circuit resolved the issue. The appeals court then denied Nauta and de Oliveira's request to keep Smith's report under wraps, but Cannon's order remained in place.",
      "Federal prosecutors told the 11th Circuit that Garland would not release the portion of Smith's report that deals with the documents case while proceedings involving the two co-defendants are ongoing, but did plan to disclose the first volume involving the 2020 election case. They said he would make a redacted version of the second volume available for review only by top lawmakers on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and only if they agreed not to share information from it.",
      "\"This limited disclosure will further the public interest in keeping congressional leadership apprised of a significant matter within the department while safeguarding defendants' interests,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "The Justice Department further told the district court in a filing Sunday that \"without referencing defendants Nauta or De Oliveira, any conduct by them, any evidence against them, or the charges against them, Volume One does makes two references to the Classified Documents Case.\"",
      "Last week, Garland\u00a0informed lawmakers that Smith had finished his investigation and submitted the two-volume report. The attorney general reiterated his intent to make public the first volume \"in furtherance of the public interest in informing a co-equal branch and the public regarding this significant matter,\" but would not release the second volume \"to avoid any risk of prejudice\" to Nauta and de Oliveira.",
      "Though Trump is not a party before the 11th Circuit, his lawyers submitted a friend-of-the-court brief urging the 11th Circuit to block the release of Smith's report.",
      "The report, they claimed, is \"nothing less than another attempted political hit job which sole purpose is to disrupt the Presidential transition and undermine President Trump's exercise of executive power.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will not consider whether to quash lawsuits brought by Honolulu seeking billions of dollars from oil and gas companies for the damage caused by the effects of climate change, clearing the way for the cases to move forward.",
      "The legal battle pursued in Hawaii state court is similar to others filed against the nation's largest energy companies by state and local governments in their courts. The suits claim that the oil and gas industry engaged in a deceptive campaign and misled the public about the dangers of their fossil fuel products and the environmental impacts.",
      "A group of 15 energy companies asked the Supreme Court to review a decision from the Hawaii Supreme Court that allowed a lawsuit brought by the city and county of Honolulu, as well as its Board of Water Supply, to proceed. The suit was brought in Hawaii state court in March 2020, and Honolulu raised several claims under state law, including creating a public nuisance and failure to warn the public of the risks posed by their fossil fuel products.",
      "The city accused the oil and gas industry of contributing to global climate change, leading to flooding, erosion and more frequent and intense extreme weather events. These changes, they said, have led to property damage and a drop in tax revenue as a result of less tourism.",
      "The energy companies unsuccessfully sought to have the case moved to federal court, arguing that the claims raised by Honolulu under state law were overridden by federal law and the Clean Air Act. A state trial court denied their efforts to dismiss the case.",
      "The oil and gas industry has argued that greenhouse-gas emissions \"flow from billions of daily choices, over more than a century, by governments, companies and individuals about what types of fuels to use, and how to use them.\" Honolulu, the companies said, was seeking damages for the \"cumulative effect of worldwide emissions leading to global climate change.\"",
      "The Hawaii Supreme Court ultimately allowed the lawsuit to proceed. The state's highest court determined that the Clean Air Act displaced federal common law governing suits seeking damages for interstate pollution. It also rejected the oil companies' argument that Honolulu was seeking to regulate emissions through its lawsuit, finding that the city instead wanted to challenge the promotion and sale of fossil fuel products \"without warning and abetted by a sophisticated disinformation campaign.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs' state tort law claims do not seek to regulate emissions, and there is thus no 'actual conflict' between Hawaii tort law and the [Clean Air Act],\" the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled. \"These claims potentially regulate marketing conduct while the CAA regulates pollution.\"",
      "The oil companies asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the ruling from the Hawaii high court and urged it to stop Honolulu's lawsuit from going forward. Regulation of interstate pollution is a federal area governed by federal law, lawyers for the energy industry argued.",
      "\"Rarely does a case of such extraordinary importance to one of the nation's most vital industries come before this court,\" lawyers for the companies said in a filing. \"Energy companies that produce, sell, and market fossil fuels are facing numerous lawsuits in state courts across the nation seeking billions of dollars in damages for injuries allegedly caused by global climate change.\"",
      "The oil and gas companies argued the case raises a \"recurring question of extraordinary importance to the energy industry,\" and one they urged the Supreme Court to address.",
      "\"In these cases, state and local governments are attempting to assert control over the nation's energy policies by holding energy companies liable for worldwide conduct in ways that starkly conflict with the policies and priorities of the federal government,\" they said. \"That flouts this court's precedents and basic principles of federalism, and the court should put a stop to it.\"",
      "Lawyers for Honolulu said in a filing that the case seeks to hold the oil and gas industry accountable under Hawaii law for \"deliberately concealing and misrepresenting the climate-change impacts of their fossil-fuel products.\"",
      "Its lawsuit, the city continued, does not interfere with the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions. Honolulu's legal team accused the oil and gas companies of pushing a theory in the case that \"improperly attempts to cloak the former federal common law of interstate pollution in constitutional garb, with no foundation in the Constitution's text or history.\"",
      "The Supreme Court in June asked the Biden administration to weigh in on the cases and whether it should step into the dispute. In a filing submitted to the Supreme Court before the transfer of presidential power, the Biden administration urged the justices to turn away the appeals, in part because it said it is too soon for them to intervene.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 08:13:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposal is raising concerns with the chip industry, with artificial intelligence leader Nvidia calling it \"misguided.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that would limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, part of an effort to preserve America's six- to 18-month advantage on AI over rivals such as China.",
      "Proposed Monday, the framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict in 120 countries the chips used for data centers and AI products. Mexico, Portugal, Israel and Switzerland are among the nations that could have limited access.",
      "Chip giant Nvidia on Monday called\u00a0the proposal \"misguided,\" and said that it \"threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\"",
      "On a call with reporters previewing the framework, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that it's \"critical\" to preserve America's leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips. The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.",
      "\"As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense,\" Raimondo said. The framework \"is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.\"",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.",
      "Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve U.S. companies' advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains.",
      "AI-enhanced technology is forecast to help fuel growth and boost corporate productivity, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling the tech developments a \"once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution\" in a recent research note.",
      "Risks to AI leadership?",
      "A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\"While we share the U.S. government's commitment to national and economic security, the rule's potential risks to U.S. global leadership in AI cannot be emphasized enough,\" said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group's senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry.",
      "One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.",
      "Nvidia bashes proposal",
      "Because the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration of President-elect Donald Trump could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips. This sets up a scenario in which Trump will have to balance economic interests with the need to keep the United States and its allies safe.",
      "Ned Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI's development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.",
      "\"While cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,\" he said. \"The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\"",
      "Under the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.",
      "Nations without restrictions",
      "The allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.",
      "Users outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the U.S.",
      "Institutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.",
      "Also, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.",

    "story": [
      "Under President Biden, enrollment in Medicaid hit a record high and the uninsured rate reached a record low.",
      "Donald Trump's return\u00a0to the White House \u2014 along with a GOP-controlled Senate and House of Representatives \u2014 is expected to change that.",
      "Republicans in Washington say they plan to use funding cuts and regulatory changes to dramatically shrink Medicaid, the nearly $900-billion-a-year government health insurance program that, along with the related Children's Health Insurance Program, serves about 79 million mostly low-income or disabled Americans.",
      "The proposals include rolling back the Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid, which over the last 11 years added about 20 million low-income adults to its rolls. Trump has said he wants to drastically cut government spending, which may be necessary for Republicans to extend 2017 tax cuts that expire at the end of this year.",
      "Trump made little mention of Medicaid during the 2024 campaign. The first Trump administration approved work requirements in several states, though only Arkansas implemented theirs before a federal judge said it violated the law. The first Trump administration also sought to block grant funding to states.",
      "House Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, told KFF Health News that Medicaid and other federal entitlement programs need major changes to help cut the federal debt. \"Without them, we will watch this country sadly enter into fiscal collapse.\"",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a member of the Budget Committee, said Congress needs to explore cutting federal spending on Medicaid.",
      "\"You need wholesale reform on the health care front, which can include undoing a lot of the damage being done by the ACA and Obamacare,\" Roy said. \"Frankly, we could end up providing better service if we do it the right way.\"",
      "Advocates for poor people fear GOP funding cuts will leave more Americans without insurance, making it harder for them to get care.",
      "\"Medicaid is an obvious target for huge cuts,\" said Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families. \"An existential fight about Medicaid's future likely lies ahead.\"",
      "Medicaid, which turns 60 in July, is nearing the end of a disruptive period, after COVID pandemic-era coverage protections expired in 2023 and all enrollees had to prove they still qualified. More than 25 million people lost coverage over the 18 months after the \"unwinding\" began, though it has not notably increased the number of people without insurance, according to the latest census data.",
      "The unwinding's disruptions could pale in comparison to what happens in the next four years, said Matt Salo, former executive director and founder of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. \"What we are going to see is an even bigger seismic shift in who Medicaid covers and how it operates,\" he said.",
      "But Salo said any efforts to shrink the program will face pushback.",
      "\"A lot of powerful entities \u2014 state governments, managed-care organizations, long-term care providers, and everyone under the sun who wants to do well by doing good \u2014 wants to see Medicaid work efficiently and be adequately funded,\" he said. \"And they will be highly motivated to push back on something they see as draconian cuts, because it could affect their business model.\"",
      "The GOP is looking at several tactics to reduce the size of Medicaid:",
      "Shifting to block grants. Switching to annual block grants could lower federal funding for states to operate the program while giving states more discretion over how to spend the money. Currently, the government matches a certain percentage of state spending each year with no cap. Republican presidents since Ronald Reagan have sought to block-grant Medicaid with no success. Arrington said he favors ending the open-ended federal funding to states and replacing it with a set annual amount based on how many people each state has in the program.Cutting ACA Medicaid funding. The ACA provided financing to cover, through Medicaid, Americans with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or $20,783 for an individual last year. The federal government pays 90% of the cost for adults covered through the law's Medicaid expansion, which 40 states and Washington, D.C., have adopted. The GOP may try to lower that funding to the same match rate the feds pay states for everyone else in the program, which averages about 60%. \"We should absolutely note that we are subsidizing the healthy, able-bodied Medicaid expansion population at a higher rate than we do the poorest and sickest among us, which was the original intent of the program,\" Arrington said. \"That's not right.\"Lowering federal matching funds. Since Medicaid began, the federal match rate has been based on the relative wealth of a state's population, with poorer states receiving a higher rate and no state receiving less than a 50% match. Ten states get the base rate \u2014 all but two are Democratic-run states, including New York and California. The GOP may seek to cut the base rate to 40% or less.Adding work requirements. During the first Trump term, federal courts ruled that Medicaid law doesn't allow coverage to be conditioned on enrollees' working or seeking jobs. But the GOP may try again. \"If we can get strict work requirements on able-bodied adults, that can be a huge cost savings by itself,\" Rep. Tom McClintock, R-California, told KFF Health News. Because most Medicaid enrollees already work, go to school or serve as caregivers, critics say such a requirement would simply add red tape to obtaining coverage, with little impact on employment.Placing enrollment hurdles. About 10 states offer some populations what's called continuous eligibility, whereby people stay enrolled for years without having to renew their coverage. That policy's been shown to prevent enrollees from falling out of the program for short periods because of hardships or paperwork problems, which can lead to surprise medical bills and debt. The Trump administration could seek to repeal waivers that allow states to grant multiyear continuous eligibility, which would require people in those states to reapply for coverage annually.",

      "Cutting ACA Medicaid funding. The ACA provided financing to cover, through Medicaid, Americans with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or $20,783 for an individual last year. The federal government pays 90% of the cost for adults covered through the law's Medicaid expansion, which 40 states and Washington, D.C., have adopted. The GOP may try to lower that funding to the same match rate the feds pay states for everyone else in the program, which averages about 60%. \"We should absolutely note that we are subsidizing the healthy, able-bodied Medicaid expansion population at a higher rate than we do the poorest and sickest among us, which was the original intent of the program,\" Arrington said. \"That's not right.\"",
      "Lowering federal matching funds. Since Medicaid began, the federal match rate has been based on the relative wealth of a state's population, with poorer states receiving a higher rate and no state receiving less than a 50% match. Ten states get the base rate \u2014 all but two are Democratic-run states, including New York and California. The GOP may seek to cut the base rate to 40% or less.",
      "Adding work requirements. During the first Trump term, federal courts ruled that Medicaid law doesn't allow coverage to be conditioned on enrollees' working or seeking jobs. But the GOP may try again. \"If we can get strict work requirements on able-bodied adults, that can be a huge cost savings by itself,\" Rep. Tom McClintock, R-California, told KFF Health News. Because most Medicaid enrollees already work, go to school or serve as caregivers, critics say such a requirement would simply add red tape to obtaining coverage, with little impact on employment.",
      "Placing enrollment hurdles. About 10 states offer some populations what's called continuous eligibility, whereby people stay enrolled for years without having to renew their coverage. That policy's been shown to prevent enrollees from falling out of the program for short periods because of hardships or paperwork problems, which can lead to surprise medical bills and debt. The Trump administration could seek to repeal waivers that allow states to grant multiyear continuous eligibility, which would require people in those states to reapply for coverage annually.",
      "If the GOP's plans to shrink Medicaid are realized, Democrats and health experts say, low-income people forced to buy private insurance would face challenges paying monthly premiums and the large copayments and deductibles common to commercial plans that typically don't exist in Medicaid.",
      "The Paragon Health Institute, a leading conservative think tank run by former Trump adviser Brian Blase, has issued reports saying the billions in extra money states took to expand Medicaid under the ACA has been a boon to private insurers that manage the program and relatively wealthier people it says shouldn't be enrolled.",
      "Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the conservative Cicero Institute, said he hopes the Trump administration holds states accountable for overpaying providers and enrolling people in Medicaid who are not eligible. Conservatives have cited CMS reports saying states improperly pay Medicaid providers billions of dollars a year, though the federal government notes that is mostly due to lack of documentation.",
      "He said the GOP will look to scale back Medicaid to its \"traditional\" populations of children, pregnant women and people with disabilities. \"We need to rebalance the program that most people think is underperforming,\" he said. Most Americans, including large majorities of both Republicans and Democrats, view the program favorably, according to polls.",

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Jan. 12, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Naples, Florida and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has a new documentary airing on PBS, \"Coming to America.\" It examines how nine remarkable American immigrants have shaped our country's history. Welcome to \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "FORMER SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH: Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In this documentary, you tell the stories of these individuals who immigrated to the US, and they were very successful, people like Albert Einstein. You know, when you look at Einstein and you look at Henry Kissinger, they were refugees to this country. Donald Trump set refugee admissions at very low levels first term. He's talking about blocking refugee admissions this term. Is that a mistake?",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: Well, I think, I think we're going through a period of, frankly, reacting to an extraordinarily disastrous immigration policy. So you're going to have some twists and turns. In the long run, we do want to have an ability to allow legitimate refugees to come here. We also, and part of the reason Calista and I made this documentary for PBS, is- we really believe strongly that legal immigrants are a major contribution to America's success and to its exceptional nature. And we want to make sure that, you know, as many Americans favor legal immigration as opposed to illegal immigration\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Right.",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: It's very important to distinguish the two, and we want to strongly communicate that legal immigration in a variety of forms, refugees is one, and another is various work permits. But we want people to be able to come to America if they do so legally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said immigrants inhabit the very soul of what it is to be an American. When you say legitimate refugees, what do you mean?",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: Well, I think people can- can stand up and say, I've now decided I'm a refugee. I feel threatened. The question is, is that true or not? Are they really threatened\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Claim asylum, you mean?",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: \u2013or is that just their way of getting into the United States? To claim asylum, I think there's a big- there's a big difference between somebody who genuinely faces a potential loss of life or freedom and somebody who simply wants to come to America and decides to claim that status",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Economic migrants, there. Let me ask you, someone else you feature in here, Zalmay Khalilzad. Very prominent Afghan American who brokered Trump's deal with the Taliban to exit Afghanistan. As you know, with that chaotic exit, there were tens of thousands of Afghans scattered, some of them still separated from their families. Many of them worked for the U.S. government. Should Mr. Trump extend the legal process of this program and bring those Afghans here, and would you ask Congress to raise the current cap they have on the number of them coming?",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: You know, I think the Afghan refugees who actively fought on the side of Americans, saved American lives, tried to help win against the Taliban- I think they deserve an unusual level of support and treatment. And I worked all during the period of President Biden's insanely disastrous withdrawal. I tried to work with various people and did podcasts with people who were trying to get folks out of Afghanistan who should legitimately have been helped by the U.S. government. So, when somebody is totally your ally- and this happened with the Vietnamese and the Vietnamese War, when somebody is totally your ally and they risk their lives side by side with you, you shouldn't abandon them. That's a pretty straightforward rule.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things that Biden administration blamed the Trump administration for was the difficulty in making those fast arrangements to bring those Afghans here, and that's a story for another day, but the person they put their finger on as making it more difficult is Stephen Miller, who is now the top policy adviser to Mr. Trump. He did add new requirements to visas, other things that made it harder to legally come here. Have you spoken to him about some of your concerns?",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: No, I know Stephen very well. Look, Stephen was responding to a disastrous level of immigration that's not sustainable. And I think that's- I think virtually every American agrees you can't have an open border. You can't have Venezuelan gangs, for example, or El Salvadorian gangs. I mean, there are a lot of good reasons, and you're going to get some overreaction, but it's an overreaction, frankly, caused by people like President Biden, who were totally irresponsible in allowing people into this country by the millions in a way that was totally illegal. It was outside the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay- Pardon me, I don't know if our viewers heard that there was an alarm that went off here, so it interrupted some of- of what you said there. Donald Trump has chosen your wife, Callista, who helped make this documentary with you, to be the next ambassador to Switzerland. Are you advising the President-elect in any capacity right now?",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: Well, I chat with him, and I certainly chat with members of the team. I've had a long experience as a Republican activist\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Okay\u2013",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: \u2013On some things, like getting through the tax cut bill\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Alright, Speaker\u2013",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: \u2013I work with everybody in the House, Senate and the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, former Speaker, I should say. Thank you for your time. We'll be right back.",

      "SEN. MARK KELLY: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It- it's going to be a very busy week in the Senate. Before I get to those confirmation hearings, I want to follow up on what the FBI director told our Scott Pelley there in describing some of the Chinese hacking and what incoming National Security Advisor Mike Waltz called \"cyber time bombs\" throughout U.S. infrastructure. What needs to happen? What do the consequences need to be for China, having done this and remaining in our infrastructure?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, we've got to be strong in standing up to them and- and ex- explaining to them, and in some cases, I think consequences need to be serious. There are things that we can do, we have the tools. But I would say, even beyond that, we've got to figure out a way to get them off of the infrastructure. With regards to the telecom system, multiple companies, you know, Chinese cyber software are currently on those systems, and we're working to try to fix this. Some of this is going to require that the- the telecom companies upgrade their infrastructure. That could be costly. We're currently working with them to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's pretty incredible that this espionage happened in the first place, and expelling them is so hard to do. I want to also ask you about another Chinese question, and that has to do with Tiktok, because the attorney for the company said they will go dark next Sunday, unless the Supreme Court intervenes and stops this national security law from taking effect, or delays it, as Mr. Trump has asked the court to do. What do you think is going to happen here?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, based on the oral argument in the case two days ago, it looks like the Supreme Court- I mean, I don't really want to speculate, but it- it does look like they're going to uphold the law that we passed. So- I think on the 19th, so one day before- before the inauguration, you know, Tiktok on our systems, on our servers, becomes something that's now been banned by Congress. So I imagine there's going to be a disruption in the service here, you know, starting on the 19th. I know this is controversial. I know there are folks out there that earn a living, you know, on Tiktok, but it has a national security risk to it. You know, one is the data, one of the risks. The thing that I'm more concerned about is their ability to manipulate the- the population of the United States, especially in time of a conflict. So it was the right decision. I voted for it. And it looks like the Supreme Court is going to uphold the legislation that we passed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll track that story. I want to follow up on something Senator Barrasso brought up, which was the Laken Riley Act. You say you support this. It's a bill that would require federal authorities to detain undocumented immigrants charged with theft related crimes, rather than releasing them on parole. This bill was introduced last congress, didn't go anywhere. Was it wrong for Democrats not to take it up? Was it election year politics that made Democrats concerned about bringing it forward?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, in the last year, we've been working with Republicans on bipartisan border security legislation with the hope of getting that passed and then moving on to comprehensive immigration reform. I think we could do that. I think there's a lot of, you know, there's- you know, there's an effort, I think, that's going to continue. You know, right now, this is certainly bipartisan. I voted for cloture on the, you know, motion to start talking about it. And ultimately I'll vote\u2014",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "But do you regret not doing that, taking that position earlier?",
      "SEN. KELLY: \u2014to- to pass it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If Democrats were more muscular on this issue\u2014",
      "SEN: KELLY: Well\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014which was such a live issue during the campaign?",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, I mean, the Laken Riley Act is very specific. I mean, it does one specific thing. We were working on something that was much more comprehensive, money for Border Patrol agents, and hiring, and infrastructure, policy changes. And policy changes, you know, you really have to do in a bipartisan way. We can't do that through the reconciliation process you were talking about. So there is- you know, I think there's- there's going to be an effort ongoing. This is bipartisan. You're right, we didn't do this a year ago, you know, maybe we should have. But we were working on bipartisan border security legislation. We weren't able to get that across the finish line. I hope we can do that in this Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to two of the- two of the picks here. You sit on the Armed Services Committee. Typically, only the ranking and chairs of the committees get to see the FBI background check on a nominee. But as you know, many senators are asking for more information on Pete Hegseth, here. Do you have any information from the ranking member of the committee, from Senator Reed, that you will get access or get any information from that FBI background check?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Margaret, let me just start by saying, there is not a job that's more serious and more critical to our national security than Secretary of Defense, and we need a qualified individual in that job, and he just does not seem to have the qualifications. And then on top of that, you look at his personal conduct, especially when he was managing Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans of America. You know, these two organizations were financially- financially mismanaged. There was reports of being into- intoxicated on the job, and creating an environment, you know, where there was, you know, some issues with, you know, sexual harassment. So I think it's in the nominee, Mr. Hegseth's, best interest if he wants to be confirmed for this job, for us to have all the information. You know, the information from these organizations, but also the FBI background check. Right now, as you say, the chairman and the ranking member are going to get it. That's an agreement with the White House, but there has been exceptions made in the past for certain nominees. This, clearly, because it is bipartisan, like a bi- you know, across the aisle, folks want to see the FBI background check. I think we should get an opportunity to take a look at it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, the New York Times is reporting that your- that the ranking member had been briefed as of Friday. Are- you're saying no information has been shared?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, do you think it will be before Tuesday\u2014",
      "SEN. KELLY: Not yet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014when the hearing\u2014",
      "SEN. KELLY: I don't know. I think\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.",
      "SEN. KELLY: \u2014you know, we will have an opportunity, you know- I'll talk to the ranking member, and I also talked to the chairman about this, about his nomination in general. Moreso, the discussion I had with Roger Wicker was about just meeting with Mr. Hegseth. We've reached out to him multiple times. Have not been able to schedule a meeting in my office. And he's not meeting with any other Democrats on the committee other than the ranking member. More information is better. If- if he wants to be confirmed to this job, I think it's in our best interest to have everything put out on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're on the Intelligence Committee. Former Democrat Tulsi Gabbard, she is controversial as well. Republican Senator Capito was on FOX today and said when she privately met with Tulsi Gabbard, she pressed her on that 2017 trip to Syria that came in the wake of a chemical weapons attack carried out by dictator Bashar Al-Assad against civilians. Gabbard told her, she said, that she didn't even know she was going to Syria, that she intended to go to Lebanon on the scheduled visit and ended up in Syria. Is that a credible answer?",
      "SEN. KELLY: I talked to Congresswoman Gabbard this week, met with her in my office. We talked about the trip to Syria. She didn't tell me that part. I mean, I think it's kind of unusual that you wind up in one place, it wasn't part of the plan. But what concerns me more, especially about that trip, is, it was common knowledge that Assad was gassing the civilian population, using chemical weapons against the population, multiple times. And she didn't argue about those, but she took the time and the effort to make a case that there were two cases, and she used, you know, experts that were not critical- credible to try to- try to prove that he was not using chemical weapons in those two instances. And I have a hard time understanding why you would want to do that, to use your political capital to try to prove something when there are multiple cases. And you know, on top of that, when you look at- you know, what's- what- in- in Russia with misinformation, she does seem to have a predilection for- for misinformation\u2014.",

      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a busy week ahead in the Senate, but before I get to that business, I do want to ask you about these fires in California. Do you expect that Congress will have to provide an additional aid package, and if so, when?",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: What we're seeing is heartbreaking, its horrible, affecting people, old and young, rich and poor. Everyone in the Wyoming National Guard is there on the scene, helping with manpower as well as equipment. When you see what's being shown on television, in addition to the tragedy on the ground, you're also seeing gross mismanagement in California by elected officials, and it's heartbreaking to hear the fire chief say that they've diverted all of this money away from the fire department to be used for social programs when they were already stretched too thin. So yes, I expect there's going to be hearings, there's going to be requests of Congress. There can't be a blank check on this, however, because people want to make sure that as rebuilding occurs, as things go on in California, they have to be resilient, so that these sorts of things can't happen again. And the policies of the liberal administration out there, I believe have made these fires worse.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect, though, that Congress and Republicans will still help these Americans in need, even if they don't like their local politics in the party?",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: I expect that there will be strings attached to money that is ultimately approved, and it has to do with being ready the next time, because this was a gross failure this time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, let me move on to what's happening this week. Because you are the whip. You are the vote counter. You are watching very closely what these hearings for these picks made by Donald Trump will be like. Starting Tuesday, 13 of the picks are going to be up for questioning. Leader Thune told us last Sunday, he suspects a lot we'll get through, but we'll see about all of them. Which nominees are you certain will be confirmed by January 20?",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: Well, let's start with- we were elected- Republicans are now in the House, the Senate and the White House, because Americans wanted safety and prosperity. So you're right, the rubber hits the road this week with all of these hearings on the cabinet, and then when President Trump takes office next Monday, there is going to be shock and awe with executive orders. A blizzard of executive orders on the economy, as well as on the border. So, when we met with President Trump, just- earlier this past week, what President Trump said the number one goal for the Senate needs to be to get his team in place. I've met with just about all of them. I support every one of these nominees. As the whip, my job is to make sure they get across the finish line. Get on the job, and President Trump deserves a team early. Chuck Schumer said he wants to make fireworks at the hearings. If that happens, we are going to work around the clock, through the night, through weekends to make sure we get that cabinet confirmed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about some of those picks on the other side of this commercial break, and how many of them will sail through since you do have the Republican majority and enough votes to do this without democratic help. We'll talk about those specifics in a moment. Stay with us through this break.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation now with Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso. Senator, you are the whip. You count the votes. Does Pete Hegseth, the pick to run the Pentagon, have them?",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: Well, he certainly has the qualities that we need to lead the Pentagon. He knows about a fit, fighting force. He is very qualified, in my opinion. He has a record, a distinguished record, of service in the military. Every Senator gets to speak for themselves, and they will do that. The meetings have gone very well. Things are heading in the right direction. The hearings start Tuesday, and they're going to be consequential. People will listen and make their own decision. People have already had chances to ask questions, and they're going to continue to do so. I expect he's going to have quality answers to the questions that they ask.,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, your colleague, Senator Joni Ernst, who is a sexual assault survivor herself did say last month that she wanted the FBI to vet the claims against Mr. Hegseth that were made by an accuser who said that he raped her. He denies that that assault happened. He claims it was consensual sex, despite her filing of that police report. She also asked that the results be presented to the committee. Is that FBI vetting being shared with members of the Armed Services Committee?",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: Joni is a warrior. She is a patriot. I know she's had a chance to meet with the nominee at least twice, and advice and consent is about giving advice as well as asking consent. She's going to ask additional questions at the hearing on Tuesday and ultimately make her decision. With regard to the FBI report, reported today that the chairman and the ranking member of the committee have seen the report already. Traditionally, those reports do not get shared with the other members of the committee. That goes back four decades, back when John McCain was chairman of the committee, and I support the chairman in that decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's why it is so notable that such a prominent member and other senators are asking to see FBI vetting. Do you prefer that the details of that sexual assault be disclosed in a public hearing, or would you support that those private investigative details be shared with members at the discretion of the chairman?",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: Well, the chairman is going to make that decision, and I support the chairman. I also support Pete Hegseth. If you take a look at the current nominee, compared to who has been in the Pentagon the last four years, where they had a woke military, where recruitment went down, morale went down. I think Pete is going to be terrific in terms of recruitment, in terms of morale, in terms of returning America to a fighting force, which is what the American people really want. They want to make sure if our military is called upon. They are ready to go, that they are ready to fight, and that with intimidating power.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Just to correct myself alleged sexual assault. So let me ask you about another nominee, or nominee to be one to run the intelligence community and oversee all the agencies. It appears the only member of Mr. Trump's national security team that doesn't have a real scheduled hearing is Tulsi Gabbard. Is it the FBI background check that's holding things up, or is it the ethics disclosure that's a problem?",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: I support Tulsi Gabbard. She is amazing in that she has been a member of Congress and a combat veteran, a decorated combat veteran for work under fire in Iraq. You're right. It's a paperwork problem right now with the Office of Government Ethics. We had hoped to have the hearing later this week. It looks like it's going to be the following week, but she continues to have promotions in the military. She's a lieutenant colonel. She now has top level security clearances. She's the right person to keep America secure and safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She took the unusual measure of releasing a public statement reversing some past policy positions she'd taken when it came to surveillance. Are you concerned that you don't have enough Republicans who are willing to vote for her?",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: I'm not concerned at all about that. Senator, Tom Cotton, who is chairman of the Intelligence Committee, has met with her on numerous occasions. She will have a hearing. She has to raise her right hand, take an oath at the time, she will be telling the truth. And the issue that you just raised, which is foreign surveillance, she is now in the mind and the position that is consistent with the chairman of the committee and Republican members of the committee.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned shocking on day one of Mr. Trump's new term with executive orders. But some of this action is also going to require congressional help. This week, President Biden banned new offshore oil and gas drilling in 625 meters of the- of the ocean. Excuse me, miles. Are you going to reverse that in that first reconciliation bill that leader Thune told us about? Well,",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: Well, what President Biden just did by executive order, I expect that President Trump will eliminate with executive orders as well. In terms of the reconciliation bill, what we need: results. The results are what matter. We were sent here, and President Trump says he doesn't care if it's one bill, two bills, three bills. He wants the results as we are united, on securing the border, on bringing down costs for American citizens, across what- we want to make sure that tax cuts don't- don't expire. We want to make sure that the country is safe and strong. Those are the issues that the American people elected us to. That's what we're here to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to follow up there. Mr. Trump has said one big, beautiful bill is what he wants. It seems procedural, but we know from- from the Senate side, you would prefer two different reconciliation bills at two different times to tackle some of these big agenda items. When you hear that the Speaker of the House says it's got to be one because he can only get one thing through, doesn't that underscore just how difficult unified Republican leadership is actually going to be?",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: No results matter, and we're united with the results. And when President Trump met with us for a couple of hours, the senators this past week, he said, I don't care how many bills, we just want to get it done. There are urgent needs and I'd like to get addressed immediately. You take a look at what happened this week in the Senate. There was actually bipartisanship, because the first bill that we brought to the Senate floor, the Laken Riley bill, is about a wonderful young woman, 22, a nursing student in Georgia who was out for a jog. Brutally murdered by an illegal immigrant. Somebody who was a criminal in this country should have either been in jail or deported, but he was done- Neither of those were done under the Biden administration. We had bipartisan support now, even though Chuck Schumer blocked that bill last year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're going to talk about that with one of the Democratic senators who supported it later on in the program. Senator Barrasso, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: As we begin what's now day six of the catastrophic fires in Southern California, the situation is still extremely volatile and therefore still very dangerous. The death toll stands at 16, with 150,000 residents under evacuation orders.",
      "The long-term impact on Californians' health and damage done to the environment are incalculable. The cost to rebuild in California, which boasts the largest economy in America, are impossible to tally at this point.",
      "The causes for the individual fires are under investigation, but scientists say there's no question that climate change exacerbated the factors leading to these cataclysmic events.",
      "The two big fires, the coastal Palisades Fire and the inland Eaton Fires, are still raging and the National Weather Service has cited red flag wind warnings in the Southern California area through at least Wednesday.",
      "We begin with the very latest from our Jonathan Vigliotti.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "JONATHAN VIGLIOTTI (voice-over): More than 14,000 personnel from all over California, nine states, as well as Canada and Mexico, have mobilized to the bone-dry hills of Los Angeles, battling four active and sprawling wildfires menacing millions of people across the region.",
      "The massive Palisades Fire, the largest in the city, has grown to nearly 25,000 acres, destroying an estimated 75 percent of Pacific Palisades. Officials say that one-third of the eastern edge of Malibu has been destroyed too. The Palisades Fired now threatens nearby Brentwood and Encino, where additional evacuation orders have been issued.",
      "A brief break in the wind allowed aircraft to gain 11 percent containment Saturday as the region was bombarded with water and flame retarded. But planes were briefly grounded after drones were spotted in the airspace.",
      "In Altadena, the Eaton Fire has destroyed more than 14,000 acres and reduced thousands of homes to ash. That fire is now 27 percent contained. Officials say the rash of fires have burned through more than 40,000 acres and more than 12,000 structures have been destroyed, a city under siege.",
      "L.A. Mayor Karen Bass is now facing calls to resign from a growing number of people who say the city's response was inadequate.",
      "My question to you is, what explains this lack of preparation and rapid response?",
      "KAREN BASS (D-Mayor of Los Angeles, California): When we are safe, when lives have been saved and homes have been saved, we will absolutely do an evaluation.",
      "JONATHAN VIGLIOTTI: Her own fire chief has said budget cuts hampered firefighting efforts.",
      "KRISTIN CROWLEY (Los Angeles City, California, Fire Chief): We are screaming to be properly funded to make sure that our firefighters can do their jobs.",
      "JONATHAN VIGLIOTTI: The cause of the fires are still under investigation, and the National Guard is on scene to prevent looting and enforce a nightly curfew.",
      "(End VT)",
      "JONATHAN VIGLIOTTI: And red flag warnings are back in effect.",
      "Wind gusts could exceed 50 miles per hour. Meanwhile, officials are preemptively cutting power in some neighborhoods to prevent more fires from sparking, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jonathan Vigliotti reporting from Pacific Palisades, stay safe, and thank you.",
      "We turn now to FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "DEANNE CRISWELL (FEMA Administrator): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: These Santa Ana winds are forecast to continue into the next week, and that could fuel some of the blazes. What is your biggest area of concern right now?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: You know, with these winds coming back, and them issuing the red flag warnings, you know, these winds change the \u2013 the dynamics of this fire.",
      "And so I'm concerned for the safety of our firefighters, concerned for their ability continue to contain this fire. And I want people to make sure that they are listening closely to what local officials are saying, so they can stay safe and they can stay out of harm's way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know the winds themselves are rare for this particular time of year, but Los Angeles and the area, they have got a lot of experience with wildfires. They have a lot of regulation and a large firefighting force.",
      "Do you have a sense at this point why the area was so unprepared?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: I think that they were very prepared. This is something that they are very used to. They fight fires all the time.",
      "But they have never seen 100-mile-an-hour winds that are fueling the fire, and those winds and that weather condition is what really impacts, you know, where this fire is going to go, but, more importantly, how they're able to try to contain it in those first few hours and days.",
      "And because it was in such a populated area, it just makes it that much more challenging to be able to get in there and secure the perimeter, but as well try to save as many homes as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of the federal response and the support you're giving to local authorities, President Biden spoke a few times from the Oval Office this week, and he did mention the need to move power lines underground.",
      "Do you know, were the power lines a cause of any of these blazes?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: Yes, I don't have any information on the cause, and I think that's certainly going to be something that's going to be, you know, under investigation.",
      "But I think, when we think about moving the power lines underground, it's not just from the cause, but it's also, how do you keep the power on when we have these severe weather incidents? When you underground them, you create a more resilient community, and it can withstand the impacts of all of these different types of storms, whether it's fires or hurricanes. And we want to be able to keep these communities energized.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will that be a requirement for any federal support for the rebuild?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: It's not going to be a requirement for us unless it's part of their local code, right? And we want to be able to enforce the local codes that they have, and so we'll work closely with California, also using this as an opportunity.",
      "You know, even if it's not a requirement, is this something that they want to be able to do? We have additional ways that we can fund that through our programs as they begin the rebuilding.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The governor has indicated he's looking at a number of executive orders. If local environmental regulations are loosened here in order to help quickly rebuild, does that concern you at all? And will it make it more complicated for people to obtain insurance, which we already know is quite expensive and hard for many Californians to get?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: You know, the insurance piece is a real concern.",
      "We've, you know, heard the stories of so many people that have lost their insurance prior to this event. And that's the number one resource that families have to help with their rebuilding process.",
      "And so what I think we want to be able to do is, we want to be able to work with the governor's team to rebuild in a way that makes communities more resilient, that keeps insurance companies there, right, that we rebuild in a way that makes them stronger, and reducing the impact, so they want to stay in these communities, and they don't have to lose the insurance carriers.",
      "We have to be able to work together with the insurance industry to help find ways to \u2013 to keep this really valuable resource in place for so many families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But many of these policies were already canceled months ago, as we've been reporting.",
      "So, should the government, though, be in the business of stepping in and helping people rebuild if the private market has deemed these areas just too risky?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: You know, our programs really help jump- start the recovery process. But, without insurance, families are going to have to find other means to be able to rebuild.",
      "But, again, it's not necessarily just where you rebuild. It's going to be how. And we want to be able to do things that can encourage families to rebuild their homes in a way that make them more fire-resistant. You know, we have a lot of science and technology out there that shows ways that we can make these homes stronger and more resistant against these fires. That's really where we need to focus our efforts as we move into the rebuilding phase.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden said that 100 percent of the firefighting costs will be picked up for six months on the federal tab, but there is the separate issue of individual assistance to victims who lost their homes.",
      "We checked, and Congress set the maximum FEMA grant level at just short of $44,000. It's very expensive living in California. Does that need to be raised? Should Congress do that?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: So, again, our programs aren't designed to replace insurance. Our programs are designed to jump-start the recovery process.",
      "And we know that in \u2013 in many areas, not just California, that, you know, that is not going to be enough to rebuild a home, which is why insurance is so important. We'll work with other partners. And one of our greatest partners is the Small Business Administration that can do low-interest loans to these families to give them another resource to help rebuild.",
      "We'll also work with our nonprofit partners, philanthropic partners, bringing the whole society together, so we can work with each family to help them figure out the right tools that they're going to need and the decisions that they're going to have to make as they go down this recovery journey.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're describing a really costly enterprise here. I have seen estimates on damages that range from $60 billion to $130 billion. Do you have any ballpark figure at this point?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it would seem, according to President Biden, that Congress is going to have to do more.",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: Yes, I don't have any good estimates right now.",
      "And I think it's important to remember that these fires are still burning, which means damage is still happening. But the cost for this disaster, both from just the physical infrastructure, but also the economic losses, they're going to be significant. There's going to be other programs that congress can work through, like HUD's Community Development Block Grant for Disaster program, that can also help cover some of the things that FEMA's programs don't cover, or other parts of the insurance industry.",
      "There's a wide variety of different tools and resources that can be used that need to be authorized by Congress to really help this community on this road to recovery.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we appreciate you joining us today to get the message out.",
      "Administrator Criswell, good luck to you.",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: Yes, thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to California Democratic Congresswoman Judy Chu.",
      "Part of her district has been affected by the Eaton Fire, and she joins us from the Pasadena Convention Center, currently sheltering more than 500 local residents.",
      "Good morning to you, Congresswoman.",
      "I know 11 of these reported deaths were in your community. How are you, and do you know if the community is out of the danger zone at this point?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU (D-California): It is not out of the danger zone.",
      "We have another Santa Ana gust of winds that will happen Monday or Tuesday. They will be around 50 miles per hour. That is less than what caused this whole terrible catastrophe. Last week, the winds were between 80 to 100 miles per hour. Nonetheless, they could spread the fire.",
      "And I urge all residents to pay attention to the evacuation warnings and orders, and most of all to make sure that they are safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I understand that there were water pressure issues in the Altadena area. There was no local police or fire department. You all rely on the county for that kind of resource.",
      "Do you think, going forward, does this need to change? Have you talked to the governor?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU: We have been in touch with the governor.",
      "But what I want to do is to assure people that there is enough water. And, in fact, the fire department agencies have assured me that there is enough. But when the fires first happened, there was a combination of drastic winds and the fire. And, as a result, they were overwhelmed. This \u2013 this is not an ordinary incident.",
      "And many fire hydrants were going on at the same time, and also the electricity used to pump the water had been turned off, so that there would not spark anymore fires. So, that happened at that point, but I believe that we're in a good place right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I imagine a lot of the people in that shelter behind you are just wondering when they'll be able to go and see what's left of their neighborhoods.",
      "The state of California, as we understand it, put a moratorium Thursday on insurers dropping Californians from \u2013 from coverage. But it raises these questions of, are these communities going to be rebuilt and should they be rebuilt?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU: These communities have to be rebuilt.",
      "I have the beautiful areas of Altadena and Pasadena, and these were vibrant communities, diverse communities with so much historic value behind them. People love these areas. And we need to make sure that there are the resources possible for them to rebuild their homes, as well as the incredible small businesses that are here.",
      "So, this is why, after I took the tour of the devastated areas witness \u2013 with our FEMA administrator, I decided to arrange for a tour of our California congressmembers, which took place just yesterday, so that they could see the devastation for themselves. We need to make sure that Congress is ready to provide the help that's needed to rebuild these areas like Altadena and Pasadena.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of your Republican colleagues went on FOX, Congressman Warren Davidson, and said he'd oppose having an open checkbook approach to a place that, no matter how bad your policies are, would be crazy.",
      "He said it sounds like he wants strings attached to further aid. Have you talked to Republican leadership? Have you talked to Speaker Johnson yet about coming to California?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU: We are planning to invite Speaker Johnson, as well as President Trump, to come to this area and to witness the devastation for themselves.",
      "We have already been in touch with Republican congressmembers, and they have expressed that they are very open to coming and seeing what is going on. You know, these wildfires don't have any political affiliation. They don't belong to any political party.",
      "This devastation has affected thousands upon thousands of people who just ran out of their homes with nothing in their hands and are trying to rebuild. And they need help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in terms of that help, first, they have to figure out if their insurance covers anything. Then they can go to the federal government for help. But FEMA has a grant limit of $44,000.",
      "It's Congress that set that limit. Does that need to be raised? And are you hearing from your constituents that they are getting help, they're able to access these resources?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU: Well, first of all, I want to say that FEMA is opening a local assistance center on Tuesday, and anybody can walk in or call and get the assistance that they need.",
      "Actually, there are temporary locations too happening even today and tomorrow at the local libraries. FEMA is also here at this Pasadena Convention Center. And so there are many ways in which people can get help. They \u2013 of course, what we are encouraging everybody to do is to sign up on DisasterAssistance.gov immediately to get the process going.",
      "Of course, they will have to have their insurance information available.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will see if raising the amount of assistance or what changes to assistance are made in the coming weeks and months.",
      "Congresswoman Chu, thank you, and we wish you and your community the best of luck.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And if you at home want to help those affected by the wildfires, CBS is partnering with the American Red Cross, which is staffing evacuation centers and providing supplies to people forced out of their homes. To donate, go to RedCross.org/CBS.",
      "And we will be back in one minute with a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Tuesday, the Senate begins consideration of several of the president-elect's national security nominees.",
      "Our Scott Pelley sat down with outgoing FBI Director Christopher Wray for tonight's 60 Minutes and talked to him about the challenges facing the new national security team.",
      "Here's a preview of Scott's interview and one threat that's been of particular concern to Director Wray.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "CHRISTOPHER WRAY (FBI Director): China's cyber program is by far and away the world's largest, bigger than that of every major nation combined and has stolen more of Americans' personal and corporate data than that of every nation, big or small, combined.",
      "But even beyond the cyber theft, there's another part of the Chinese cyber threat that I think has not gotten the attention publicly that it, I think, desperately deserves. And that is Chinese government's prepositioning on American civilian critical infrastructure to lie in wait on those networks to be in a position to wreak havoc, and can inflict real-world harm at a time and place of their choosing.",
      "SCOTT PELLEY: The Chinese have already insinuated malware into critical American infrastructure?",
      "DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY: That's correct.",
      "SCOTT PELLEY: Like what?",
      "DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY: Things like water treatment plants. We're talking about transportation systems. We're talking about targeting of our energy sector, the electric grid, natural gas pipelines.",
      "And, recently, we have seen targeting of our telecommunications system.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you can see more from Scott Pelley's interview with Director Wray tonight on 60 Minutes at 7:00 p.m. Eastern.",
      "We turn now to the number two Republican in the Senate, Wyoming's John Barrasso. He joins us this morning from Casper, Wyoming.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO (R-Wyoming): Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a busy week ahead in the Senate.",
      "But, before I get to that business, I do want to ask you about these fires in California. Do you expect that Congress will have to provide an additional aid package? And, if so, when?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: What we're seeing is heartbreaking. It's horrible, affecting people, you know, old and young, rich and poor.",
      "Everyone in the Wyoming National Guard is there on the scene helping with manpower as well as equipment. When you see what's being shown on television, in addition to the tragedy on the ground, you're also seeing gross mismanagement in California by elected officials.",
      "And it's heartbreaking to hear the fire chief say that they've diverted all of this money away from the fire department to be used for social programs, when they were already stretched too thin. So, yes, I expect there's going to be hearings. There's going to be requests of Congress.",
      "There can't be a blank check on this, however, because people want to make sure that, as rebuilding occurs, as things go on in California, they have to be resilient, so that these sorts of things can't happen again. And the policies of the liberal administration out there, I believe, have made these fires worse.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect, though, that Congress and Republicans will still help these Americans in need, even if they don't like their local politics in the party?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: I expect that there will be strings attached to money that is ultimately approved, and it has to do with being ready the next time, because this was a gross failure this time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, let me move on to what's happening this week, because you are the whip. You are the vote-counter. You are watching very closely what these hearings for these picks made by Donald Trump will be like.",
      "Starting Tuesday, 13 of the picks are going to be up for questioning. Leader Thune told us last Sunday he suspects a lot we'll get through, but we'll see about all of them.",
      "Which nominees are you certain will be confirmed by January 20?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, let's start with, we were elected, Republicans are now in the House, the Senate and the White House because Americans wanted safety and prosperity.",
      "So you're right. The rubber hits the road this week with all of these hearings on the Cabinet. And then, when President Trump takes office next Monday, there is going to be shock and awe with executive orders, a blizzard of executive orders, on the economy, as well as on the border.",
      "So, when we met with President Trump just this \u2013 earlier this past week, what President Trump said, the number one goal for the Senate needs to be to get his team in place. I have met with just about all of them. I support every one of these nominees. As the whip, my job is to make sure they get across the finish line, get on the job.",
      "And President Trump deserves a team early. Chuck Schumer said he wants to make fireworks at the hearings. If that happens, we are going to work around the clock through the night through weekends to make sure we get that Cabinet confirmed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about some of those picks on the other side of this commercial break, and how many of them will sail through, since you do have the Republican majority and enough votes to do this without Democratic help.",
      "We'll talk about those specifics in a moment. Stay with us through this break.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Coming up in our next half-hour, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",
      "His new project is Journey to America, a PBS documentary profiling several famous immigrants and their contributions to America, like the late diplomat Henry Kissinger, who fled Germany in 1938.",

      "HENRY KISSINGER (Former U.S. Secretary of State): And the circumstances that I had known were a dictatorship that was persecuting people of my ethnic background.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk with the former speaker about that, politics, and get his thoughts on president-elect Trump's plans for immigration reform.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation, including the Senate Republican whip, John Barrasso, Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return to our conversation now with Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso.",
      "Senator, you are the whip. You count the votes. Does Pete Hegseth, the pick to run the Pentagon, have them?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY): Well, he certainly has the qualities that we need to lead the Pentagon. He knows about a fit fighting force. He is very qualified. In my opinion, he has a record - a distinguished record of service in the military.",
      "Every senator gets to speak for themselves, and they will do that. The meetings have gone very well. Things are heading in the right direction. The hearings start Tuesday, and they're going to be consequential. People will listen and make their own decision. People have already had chances to ask questions, and they're going to continue to do so. I expect he's going to have quality answers to the questions that they ask.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, your colleague, Senator Joni Ernst, who is a sexual assault survivor herself, did say last month that she wanted the FBI to vet the claims against Mr. Hegseth that were made by an accuser who said that he raped her. He denies that that assault happened. He claims it was consensual sex despite her filing of that police report.",
      "She also asked that the results be presented to the committee. Is that FBI vetting being shared with members of the Armed Services Committee?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, Joni is a warrior. She is a patriot. I know she's had a chance to meet with the nominee at least twice. And advise and consent is about giving advice, as well as asking consent. She's going to ask additional questions at the hearing on Tuesday. And she'll ultimately make her decision.",
      "With regard to the FBI report, it's reported today that the chairman and the ranking member of the committee have seen the report already. Traditionally, those reports do not get shared with the other members of the committee. That goes back four decades -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Back when, you know, John McCain was chairman of the committee. And I support the chairman in that decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's why it is so notable that such a prominent member and other senators are asking to see FBI vetting.",
      "Do you prefer that the details of that sexual assault be disclosed in a public hearing, or would you support that those private investigative details be shared with members at the discretion of the chairman?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, the chairman is going to make that decision, and I support the chairman. I also support Pete Hegseth.",
      "If you take a look at the current nominee compared to who's been in the Pentagon the last four years where they had a woke military, where recruitment went down, morale went down, I think Pete is going to be terrific in terms of recruitment, in terms of morale, in terms of returning America to a fighting force, which is what the American people really want. They want to make sure, if our military is called upon, they're ready to go, that they are ready to fight, and that with intimidating power.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Just to correct myself, alleged sexual assault.",
      "So, let me ask you about another nominee, or nominee to be. One to run the intelligence community and oversee all the agencies. It appears the only member of Mr. Trump's national security team that doesn't have a real scheduled hearing is Tulsi Gabbard. Is it the FBI background check that's holding things up, or is it the ethics disclosure that's a problem?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Yes, I support Tulsi Gabbard. She is amazing in that she has been a member of Congress and a combat veteran, a decorated combat veteran for work under fire in Iraq.",
      "You're right, it's a paperwork problem right now with the Office of Government Ethics. We had hoped to have the hearing later this week. It looks like it's going to be the following week. But she continues to have promotions in the military. She's a lieutenant colonel. She now has top- level security clearances. She is the right person to keep America secure and safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She took the unusual measure of releasing a public statement reversing some past policy positions she'd taken when it came to surveillance.",
      "Are you concerned that you don't have enough Republicans who are willing to vote for her?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: I'm not concerned at all about that. Senator Tom Cotton, who's chairman of the Intelligence Committee, has met with her on numerous occasions. She will have a hearing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: She has to raise her right hand, take an oath at the time. She will be telling the truth.",
      "And the issue that you just raised, which is foreign surveillance, she is now of the mind and the position that is consistent with the chairman of the committee and Republican members of the committee.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned shock and awe on day one of Mr. Trump's new term with executive orders, but some of this action is also going to require congressional help.",
      "This week, President Biden banned new offshore oil and gas drilling in 625 meters of the - of the ocean - excuse me, miles. Are you going to reverse that in the first reconciliation bill that Leader Thune told us about?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, what President Biden just did by executive order, I expect that President Trump will eliminate with executive orders as well.",
      "In terms of the reconciliation bill, we need results. The results are what matters. We were sent here - and President Trump says he doesn't care if it's one bill, two bills, three bills, he wants results that we are united, on securing the border, on bringing down costs for American citizens.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He wanted -",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: He - across what - we want to make sure that tax cuts don't - don't expire. We want to make sure that the country is safe and strong. Those are the issues that the American people elected us to do. That's what we're here to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to follow up there, Mr. Trump has said one big, beautiful bill is what he wants. It seems procedural, but we know from - from the Senate side you would prefer two different reconciliation bills at two different times to tackle some of these big agenda items.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Again -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When you hear that the speaker of the House says it's got to be one, because he can only get one thing through, doesn't that underscore just how difficult unified Republican leadership is actually going to be?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: No. Results matter. And we're united with the results.",
      "And when President Trump met with us for a couple of hours, the senators, this past week, he said, I don't care how many bills, we just want to get it done. There are urgent needs that I'd like to get addressed immediately.",
      "You - you take a look at what happened this week in the Senate. There was actually bipartisanship because the first bill that we brought to the Senate floor, the Laken Riley bill, was about a wonderful young woman, 22, a nursing student in Georgia who was out for a jog, brutally murdered by an illegal immigrant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Somebody who was a criminal in this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Should have either been in jail or deported. But he was done - neither of those were done under the Biden administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: We have bipartisan support now even though Chuck Schumer blocked the bill last year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're going to talk about that with one of the Democratic senators who supported it later on in the program.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Great.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Barrasso, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, who joins us from Tuscan, Arizona.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY (D-AZ): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's going to be a very busy week in the Senate.",
      "Before I get to those confirmation hearings, I want to follow up on what the FBI director told our Scott Pelley there in describing some of the Chinese hacking and what incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz called cyber time bombs throughout U.S. infrastructure.",
      "What needs to happen? What do the consequences need to be for China having done this and remaining in our infrastructure?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, we've got to be strong in standing up to them and explaining to them and, in some cases, I think, consequences need to be serious. There are things that we can do. We have the tools. But I would say, even beyond that, we've got to figure out a way to get them off of the infrastructure.",
      "With regards to the telecom system, multiple companies, you know, Chinese, cyber, software, are currently on those systems. And we're working to try to fix this. Some of this is going to require that the - the telecom companies upgrade their infrastructure that could be costly. We're currently working with them to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's pretty incredible that this espionage happened in the first place and expelling them is so hard to do.",
      "I want to also ask you about another Chinese question, and that has to do with TikTok, because the attorney for the company said they will go dark next Sunday unless the Supreme Court intervenes and stops this national security law from taking effect or delays it, as Mr. Trump has asked the court to do. What do you think is going to happen here?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, based on the oral argument in the case two days ago, it looks like the Supreme Court - I mean I don't really want to speculate, but it does look like they're going to uphold the law that we pass.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: So, I think on the 19th, so one day before - before the inauguration, you know, TikTok, on our systems, on our servers, become something that's now been banned by Congress. So, I imagine there's going to be a disruption in the service here, you know, starting on the 19th.",
      "I know this is controversial. I know there are folks out there that earn a living, you know, on TikTok. But it has a national security risk to it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: You know, one is the data. One of the risks. The thing that I'm more concerned about is their ability to manipulate the population of the United States, especially in time of a conflict.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: So, it was the right decision. I voted for it. And it looks like the Supreme Court is going to uphold the legislation that we passed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll track that story.",
      "I want to follow up on something Senator Barrasso brought up, which was the Laken Riley Act. You say you support this. It's a bill that would require federal authorities to detain undocumented immigrants charged with theft- related crimes rather than releasing them on parole. This bill was introduced last Congress. It didn't go anywhere. Was it wrong for Democrats not to take it up? Was it election year politics that made Democrats concerned about bringing it forward?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, in the last year we've been working with Republicans on bipartisan border security, legislation, with the hope of getting that passed, and then moving on to comprehensive immigration reform.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I think we could do that. I think there's a lot of - you know, there's - you know, there's an effort. I think that's going to continue. You know, right now, this is certainly bipartisan. I voted for cloture on the, you know, motion to start talking about it. And, ultimately, I'll vote to - to pass it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. But do you regret not doing that - taking that position earlier?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If Democrats were more muscular on this issue, which was such a live issue during the campaign.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, I mean, the Laken Riley Act is very specific.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I mean it does one specific thing. We were working on something that was much more comprehensive, money for border patrol agents and hiring and infrastructure, policy changes. And policy changes, you know, you really have to do in a bipartisan way. We can't do that through the reconciliation process you were talking about.",
      "So, there is - you know, I think there's - there's going to be an effort ongoing. This is bipartisan. You're right, we didn't do this a year ago. You know, maybe we should have. But we were working on bipartisan border security legislation. We weren't able to get that across the finish line. I hope we can do that in this Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to two of the - two of the picks here. You sit on the Armed Services Committee. Typically, only the ranking and chairs of the committees get to see the FBI background check on a nominee. But as you know, many senators are asking for more information on Pete Hegseth here.",
      "Do you have any information from the ranking member of the committee, from Senator Reid, that you will get access or get any information from that FBI background check?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Margaret, let me just start by saying, there is not a job that's more serious and more critical to our national security than secretary of defense. And we need a qualified individual in that job. And he just does not seem to have the qualifications.",
      "And then on top of that, you look at his personal conduct, especially when he was managing Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans of America. You know, these two organizations were financially mismanaged. There was reports of being intoxicated on the job and creating an environment, you know, where there was, you know, some issues with, you know, sexual harassment.",
      "So, I think it's in the nominee, Mr. Hegseth's best interests, if he wants to be confirmed for this job, for us to have all the information. You know, the information from these organizations, but also the FBI background check. Right now, as you say, the chairman and the ranking member are going to get it. That's an agreement with the White House.",
      "But there has been exceptions made in the past for certain nominees. This clearly - because it is bipartisan. Like a - you know, across the aisle, folks want to see the FBI background check. I think we should get an opportunity to take a look at it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "\"The New York Times\" is reporting that your - that the ranking member had been briefed as of Friday. Are - you're saying no information has been shared?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Do you think it will be before Tuesday when the hearing -",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Not yet. I don't know.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I think, you know, we will have an opportunity. You know, I'll talk to the ranking member. And I also talked to the chairman about this, about his nomination in general. More so the discussion I had with Roger Wicker was about just meeting with Mr. Hegseth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Y Es.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: We've reached out to him multiple times, have not been able to schedule a meeting in my office, and he's not meeting with any other Democrats on the committee other than the ranking member.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: More information is better. If - if he wants to be confirmed for this job -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I think it's in our best interest to have everything put out on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're on the Intelligence Committee. Former Democrat Tulsi Gabbard, she is controversial as well. Republican Senator Capito was on Fox today and said, when she privately met with Tulsi Gabbard, she pressed her on that 2017 trip to Syria that came in the wake of a chemical weapons attack carried out by dictator Bashar al Assad against civilians. Gabbard told her, she said, that she didn't even know she was going to Syria, that she intended to go to Lebanon on the scheduled visit and ended up in Syria. Is that a credible answer?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I talked to Congresswoman Gabbard this week, met with her in my office. We talked about the trip to Syria. She didn't tell me that part. I mean I think it's kind of unusual that you wind up in one place that wasn't part of the plan.",
      "But what concerns me more, especially about that trip, is, it was common knowledge that Assad was gassing the civilian population, using chemical weapons against the population multiple times. And she didn't argue about those. But she took the time and the effort to make a case that there were two cases. And she used, you know, experts that were not credible to try to - try to prove that he was not using chemical weapons in those two instances.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And I have a hard time understanding why you would want to do that, to use your political capital to try to prove something when there are multiple cases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And, you know, on top of that, when you look at, you know, what's - what, in Russia, with misinformation -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: She does seem to have a predilection for misinformation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well -",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And for not having -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll see.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Presenting a case that isn't strong and not listening to the intelligence community.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: My producer is yelling in my ear. I've got to go. Senator, I'm so sorry to cut you off.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: OK.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we will see when the hearing gets scheduled.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: All right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Naples, Florida, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has a new documentary airing on PBS \"Coming to America.\" It examines how nine remarkable American immigrants have shaped our country's history.",
      "Welcome to FACE THE NATION.",
      "NEWT GINGRICH (Former U.S. House Speaker): Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In this documentary, you tell the stories of these individuals who immigrated to the U.S. And they were very successful people, like Albert Einstein.",
      "You know, when you look at Einstein and you look at Henry Kissinger, they were refugees to this country. Donald Trump set refugee admissions at very low levels first term. He's talking about block refugee admissions this term. Is that a mistake?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: Well, I think - I think we're going through a period of, frankly, reacting to an extraordinarily disastrous immigration policy, so you're going to have some twists and turns. In the long run, we do want to have an ability to allow legitimate refugees to come here. We also, and part of the reason Callista and I made this documentary for PBS is, we really believe strongly that legal immigrants are a major contribution to America's success and to its exceptional nature. And we want to make sure that, you know, as many Americans favor legal immigration as oppose to illegal immigration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: It's very important to distinguish the two. And we want to strongly communicate that legal immigration in a variety of forms, refugees is one, another is various work permits, but we want people to be able to come to America if they do so legally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said immigrants inhabit the very soul of what it is to be an American. When you say legitimate refugees, what do you mean?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: Well, I think people can stand up and say, I have now decided I'm a refugee, I feel threatened. The question is, is it true or not? Are they really threatened? Or, in fact, is that just their way of getting into the United States?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Claim asylum, you mean?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: To claim asylum.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're -",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: I think there's a big - there's a big difference between somebody who genuinely faces a potential loss of life or freedom and somebody who simply wants to come to America and decides to claim that status.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Economic migrants there.",
      "Let me ask you, someone else you feature in here, Zalmay Khalilzad, a very prominent Afghan American who brokered Trump's deal with the Taliban to exit Afghanistan. As you know with that chaotic exit, there were tens of thousands of Afghans scattered, some of them still separated from their families. Many of them worked for the U.S. government.",
      "Should Mr. Trump extend the legal process of this program and bring those Afghans here? And would you ask Congress to raise the current cap they have on the number of them coming?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: You know, I think the Afghan refugees who actively fought on the side of Americans, saved American lives, tried to help win against the Taliban, I think they deserve an unusual level of support and treatment. And I worked all during the period of President Biden's insanely disastrous withdrawal. I tried to work with various people and did podcasts with people who were trying to get folks out of Afghanistan who should legitimately have been helped by the U.S. government.",
      "So, you know, when somebody's totally your ally, and this happened with the Vietnamese in the Vietnamese war. When somebody's totally your ally and they risk their lives side-by-side with you, you shouldn't abandon them. All right, that's a pretty straightforward rule.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things the Biden administration blamed the Trump administration for was the difficulty in making those fast arrangements to bring those Afghans here. And that's a story for another day. But the person they put their finger on as making it more difficult is Steven Miller, who is now the top policy adviser to Mr. Trump. He did add new requirements to visas, other things that made it harder to legally come here. Have you spoken to him about some of your concerns?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: No. I know Steven very well.",
      "Look, so Steven was responding to a disastrous level of immigration that's not sustainable. And I think that's - I think virtually every American agrees, you can't have an open border, you can't have Venezuelan gangs, for example, or El Salvadorans gangs. I mean there are a lot of good reasons. And you're going to get some overreaction, but it's an overreaction, frankly, caused by people like President Biden who were totally irresponsible in allowing people into this country by the millions in a way that was totally illegal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: I mean it was outside the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Pardon me, I don't know if our viewers heard that there was an alarm that went off here so it interrupted some of what you said there.",
      "Donald Trump has chosen your wife, Callista, who helped make this documentary with you, to be the next ambassador to Switzerland. Are you advising the president-elect in any capacity right now?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: Well, I chat with him and I certainly chat with members of the team. I've had a long experience as a Republican activist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: And on some things like getting through the tax cut bill, I work with everybody in the House, Senate and the White House.",

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Rep. Judy Chu, Democrat of California, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Jan. 12, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to California Democratic Congresswoman Judy Chu, part of her district has been affected by the Eaton fire, and she joins us from the Pasadena Convention Center, currently sheltering more than 500 local residents. Good morning to you, Congresswoman. I know 11 of these reported deaths were in your community. How are you and do you know if the community is out of the danger zone at this point?",
      "REP. JUDY CHU: It is not out of the danger zone. We have another Santa Ana gust of winds that will happen Monday or Tuesday. They will be around 50 miles per hour. That is less than what caused this whole terrible catastrophe. Last week, the winds were between 80 to 100 miles per hour, nonetheless, they could spread the fire. And I urge all residents to pay attention to the evacuation warnings and orders, and most of all, to make sure that they are safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I understand that there were water pressure issues in the Altadena area. There was no local police or fire department. You all rely on the county for that kind of resource. Do you think going forward, does this need to change? Have you talked to the governor?",
      "REP. JUDY CHU: We have been in touch with the governor, but what I want to do is to assure people that there is enough water, and in fact, the fire department agencies have assured me that there is enough, but when the fires first happened, there was a combination of drastic winds and the fire and as a result, they were overwhelmed. This-this is not an ordinary incident, and many fire hydrants were going on at the same time, and also the electricity used to pump the water had been turned off so that there would not spark anymore fire. So that happened at that point, but I believe that we're in a good place right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I imagine a lot of the people in that shelter behind you are just wondering when they'll be able to go and see what's left of their neighborhoods. The state of California, as we understand it, put a moratorium Thursday on insurers dropping Californians from- from coverage. But it raises these questions of, are these communities going to be rebuilt and should they be rebuilt?",
      "REP. JUDY CHU: These communities have to be rebuilt. I have the beautiful areas of Altadena and Pasadena, and these were vibrant communities, diverse communities with so much historic value behind them. People love these areas, and we need to make sure that there are the resources possible for them to rebuild their homes, as well as the incredible small businesses that are here. So this is why, after I took the tour of the devastated areas with-with our FEMA administrator, I decided to arrange for a tour of our California Congress members, which took place just yesterday, so that they could see the devastation for themselves. We need to make sure that Congress is ready to provide the help that's needed to rebuild these areas like Altadena and Pasadena.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of your Republican colleagues, went on Fox, Congressman Warren Davidson, and said he'd oppose having an open checkbook approach to a place that, no matter how bad your policies are, would be crazy. He said it sounds like he wants strings attached to further aid. Have you talked to Republican leadership? Have you talked to Speaker Johnson yet about coming to California?",
      "REP. JUDY CHU: We are planning to invite speaker Johnson as well as President Trump, to come to this area and to witness the devastation for themselves. We have already been in touch with Republican Congress members, and they have expressed that they are very open to coming and seeing what is going on. You know, these wildfires don't have any political affiliation. They don't belong to any political party. This devastation has affected 1000s upon 1000s of people who just ran out of their homes with nothing in their hands, and are trying to rebuild, and they need help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So in terms of that help, first, they have to figure out if their insurance covers anything, then they can go to the federal government for help. But FEMA has a grant. Limit of $44,000 it's Congress that set that limit. Does that need to be raised? And are you hearing from your constituents that they are getting help? They're able to access these resources?",
      "REP. JUDY CHU: Well, first of all, I want to say that FEMA is opening a local assistance center on Tuesday, and anybody can walk in or call and get the assistance that they need. Actually, there are temporary locations too, happening even today and tomorrow at the local libraries. FEMA is also here at this Pasadena Convention Center. And so there are many ways in which people can get help. They- of course, what we are encouraging everybody to do is to sign up on Disasterassistance.gov immediately to get the process going. Of course, they will have to have their insurance information available.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will see if raising the amount of assistance or what changes to assistance are made in the coming weeks and months. Congresswoman, Chu, thank you, and we wish you and your community the best of luck.",

      "Officials said the wildfires ripping through communities in Los Angeles in recent days have killed at least 16 people, destroyed more than 12,000 structures, and displaced thousands.

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 11:51:21 -0500",
    "summary": "FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell said that L.A. officials were \"very prepared\" for wildfire, noting that the area is prone to fires.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell said Sunday that L.A. officials were \"very prepared\" for devastating wildfires, noting that the area is prone to fires. But \"they have never seen 100-mile-an-hour winds that are fueling the fire,\" she said.",
      "\"Those winds and that weather condition is what really impacts, you know, where this fire is going to go, but more importantly, how they're able to try to contain it in those first few hours and days,\" Criswell said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Communities in Los Angeles have been engulfed in wildfires in recent days, which have killed at least 16 people, destroyed more than 12,000 structures, and displaced thousands, officials said. The high winds that fanned flames in recent days are expected to pick up again this week.",
      "The FEMA administrator said she doesn't have any information on the cause of the wildfires at this time, though she noted that will be investigated. She urged as the winds are expected to return, she wants people to \"make sure that they are listening closely to what local officials are saying\" to stay out of harm's way.",
      "When it comes to rebuilding, Criswell said insurance is a \"real concern,\" citing reports of Californians losing their coverage before the fires. She said insurance is the \"number one resource that families have to help with their rebuilding process.\"",
      "Criswell noted that FEMA programs are in place to \"help jump start the recovery process,\" not replace insurance. But she said without insurance, \"families are going to have to find other means to be able to rebuild.\"",
      "The maximum FEMA grant level is under $44,000. Criswell acknowledged that in many places, including California, the amount isn't enough to rebuild a home. She pledged that FEMA will work with its partners, including the Small Business Administration, which can provide low-interest loans to families, along with nonprofit and philanthropic partners to help affected families rebuild.",
      "The FEMA administrator also noted that \"it's not necessarily just where you rebuild, it's going to be how.\" Criswell said that the agency wants to encourage families to rebuild their homes to make them more fire resistant, noting that \"that's really where we need to focus our efforts as we move into the rebuilding phase.\"",
      "\"We want to be able to work with the governor's team to rebuild in a way that makes communities more resilient, that keeps insurance companies there,\" Criswell said. \"We have to be able to work together with the insurance industry to help find ways to keep this really valuable resource in place for so many families.\"",
      "As part of building more resilient communities, Criswell also encouraged moving power lines underground, which in addition to reducing the possibility of causing wildfires also allows officials to keep power on during severe weather events.",
      "Criswell didn't provide an overarching figure for the total cost of the damage in Los Angeles, noting that the fires are still burning and damage is still occurring. But she urged that there are other programs Congress can work through to cover some of the damage, saying there's \"a wide variety of different tools and resources\" lawmakers can authorize \"to really help this community on this road to recovery.\"",

    "story": [
      "Cicadas are set to return this year in the U.S., but their numbers are not expected to be as overwhelming as they were in the\u00a0spring of 2024, when multiple broods emerged simultaneously.",
      "Brood XIV, the second-largest group of periodical cicadas, known for their noisy mass emergence from the ground, is the only group of 17-year cicada that will emerge this spring, according to University of Connecticut researchers.",
      "Here's what we know about the cicadas in 2025:",
      "When will cicadas come back?",
      "For most of their lives, cicadas live underground, and then they emerge after a specific number of years once the soil reaches 64 degrees. Brood XIV emerges every 17 years.",
      "Though it's not known exactly when they will show up in 2025, they typically appear in May and last through June. During those weeks, the cicadas mature, mate and lay eggs before dying off, and then their offspring begin the cycle anew.",
      "Climate change is also affecting the timing of the insects' arrival. Last year, the cicadas' return started in Georgia nearly two weeks ahead of schedule.",
      "Where will Brood XIV cicadas emerge?",
      "Known as the \"Great(er) Eastern Brood,\" this group is historically found in areas of north Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee, southern Indiana and Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts.",
      "However, UConn researchers note that Brood XIV cicadas population are declining on Long Island and their distributions are shifting in southwestern Ohio and southeastern Indiana. The researchers said they will map and study the cicadas' 2025 emergence to address gaps in knowledge about the patterns.",
      "How many cicadas will there be in 2025?",
      "It's difficult to estimate the population of any insects, and cicadas are no exception.",
      "Hundreds of trillions, or even quadrillions, of cicadas were expected in 2024 when two massive broods emerged at the same time, UConn cicada expert John Cooley said.",
      "There will be fewer cicadas this spring, but more than a trillion of the insects could emerge. The number may sound extreme, but the cicadas won't all be at the same place at the same time.",

      "Genetically engineered mosquitoes with toxic semen could be a new weapon against tropical disease, Australian scientists said after trialing the novel pest control method.",
      "The \"toxic male technique\" aims to breed mosquitoes that express venomous proteins in their semen, killing off females after mating.",
      "Female mosquitoes are targeted because only they bite and drink blood, thereby spreading diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.",
      "Scientist Sam Beach from Australia's Macquarie University said the method \"could work as quickly as pesticides without also harming beneficial species.\"",
      "\"This innovative solution could transform how we manage pests, offering hope for healthier communities and a more sustainable future,\" Beach said.",
      "The first proof-of-concept trials used fruit flies, a common laboratory species favored for its short two-week life cycle.",
      "Female flies that bred with \"toxic\" males had a significantly reduced lifespan, the scientists found.",
      "Researcher Maciej Maselko said the team would now trial the method in mosquitoes.",
      "\"We still need to implement it in mosquitoes and conduct rigorous safety testing to ensure there are no risks to humans or other non-target species,\" he said.",
      "The mosquitoes would need to be genetically modified so they only expressed the toxic semen once they were released into the wild, the researchers said.",
      "This could be done through so-called \"conditional expression\" techniques, which use chemicals or other biological triggers to turn specific genes on or off at will.",
      "This would allow venomous males to successfully mate with females in lab conditions, producing enough viable offspring for the technique to be scaled up.",
      "Genetic engineering has been used for years to control populations of disease-spreading mosquitoes.",
      "Typically, these approaches slow reproduction by releasing hordes of male insects that are genetically modified to be sterile.",
      "Computer models showed techniques actively killing biting females could be far more effective, the research team said.",
      "The research was described in a paper published by peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications on Tuesday evening.",

      "While more than one successful test flight will be needed to demonstrate the reliability needed for launches of costly NASA probes, high-priority national security payloads and other commercial spacecraft, the New Glenn, nearly 10 years after Bezos announced the project, is expected to be a viable alternative.",
      "Mounted atop pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, the 321-foot-tall rocket is scheduled for blast off at 1 a.m. EST Monday, the opening of a three-hour window.

    "summary": "Elon Musk claims the U.S. needs a pipeline of foreign employees working on H-1B visas because the country lacks skilled engineers. Here's what the data shows.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk sparked fierce online debate recently when the billionaire said on social media that the U.S. lacks enough top engineers, pointing to immigration as the solution to what he characterized as a dearth of technical expertise.",
      "\"There is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America,\" Musk posted on his social media platform, X, comparing tech companies to a pro sports team scouting players. \"If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE.\"",
      "The claims are at the center of a divide between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, who tend to take a hard line against immigration, and technology entrepreneurs like Musk, who along with X runs exploration company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, both of which employ many foreign workers hired with H-1B visas.",
      "Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers.",
      "Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71.",
      "Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years.",
      "Companies with the most H-1B workers",
      "Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position.",
      "\"The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes,\" said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. \"If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor.\"",
      "Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages.",
      "Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills.",
      "In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract.",
      "These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said.",
      "\"Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs.\"",
      "A boost to innovation?",
      "Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One\u00a0study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers.",
      "The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed.",
      "\"Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters,\" said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, \"There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent.\"",
      "Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow.",
      "But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers.",
      "When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable.",
      "Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe.",
      "More firing than hiring",
      "Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023.",
      "The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform.",
      "How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed \"Buy American and Hire American,\" aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",
      "But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a \"great program.\" Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would \"go to war on this issue\" in one X post.",

      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.",
      "Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve U.S. companies' advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains.",
      "AI-enhanced technology is forecast to help fuel growth and boost corporate productivity, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling the tech developments a \"once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution\" in a recent research note.",
      "Risks to AI leadership?",
      "A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\"While we share the U.S. government's commitment to national and economic security, the rule's potential risks to U.S. global leadership in AI cannot be emphasized enough,\" said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group's senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry.",
      "One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.",
      "Nvidia bashes proposal",
      "Because the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration of President-elect Donald Trump could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips. This sets up a scenario in which Trump will have to balance economic interests with the need to keep the United States and its allies safe.",
      "Ned Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI's development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.",
      "\"While cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,\" he said. \"The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\"",
      "Under the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.",
      "Nations without restrictions",
      "The allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.",
      "Users outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the U.S.",
      "Institutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.",
      "Also, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.",

    "summary": "Meta shocked the tech world this week by moving to overhaul its approach to fact checking. Here's what the changes mean for social media users.",
    "story": [
      "Mark Zuckerberg set the internet abuzz this week when the Meta CEO announced that the tech giant would no longer conduct independent fact-checking. The program, implemented in 2016, will be replaced with Meta's own version of Community Notes, a crowdsourced approach to reviewing online content employed by\u00a0 X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.",
      "So what exactly is Community Notes, and how does it work?",
      "How Community Notes works",
      "Meta hasn't released specifics about how it will empower users of Facebook, Instagram and other social platforms to monitor content, said Melissa Mahtani, executive producer at CBS News Confirmed.",
      "On X, Community Notes works by leaving fact-checking up to the community. Approved contributors call out content deemed false or misleading by attaching notes providing more context. Here's an example of a community note provided by X on its site:",
      "Becoming an approved contributor on X \"doesn't take much,\" Mahtani said. Any X user with an active phone number and who's been on the platform for at least six months with no violations is qualified to volunteer to be a contributor, she said. Contributors are protected by anonymity.",
      "When a post is deemed false or misleading by an approved contributor, the person will post a note that provides users with additional context. The note appears beneath the original post.",
      "Once a note is added by an approved contributor, it is still not visible to regular users on X. Before that happens, other approved contributors must vote on whether the note is helpful. This is where \"things get tricky\" said Mahtani.",
      "Is the note helpful?",
      "Once a note is added to a post on X, other approved contributors rate it on its utility.",
      "Explained Mahtani, \"Other contributors need to take a look at the sourcing, the accuracy of that note, and vote on whether or not it's helpful. If they vote that it's helpful \u2014 this is the tricky part \u2014 the company says that an algorithm takes a look at the ideological spectrum of all those contributors who voted. If they deem that those voters are diverse, it gets published.\"",
      "The algorithm decides",
      "According to X's website, the purpose of its so-called\u00a0bridging-based algorithm\u00a0is to \"identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives.\"",
      "In other words, if the algorithm finds that contributors who voted on a given note represent an ideologically diverse group, then the note becomes visible on the platform. But if the algorithm finds that the voting contributors are too uniform in their political views \u2014 a possible sign of bias \u2014 \"the public never sees it,\" Mahtani said.",
      "Problems with X's system of crowd-based fact-checking arise when a valid note calling out misinformation isn't rated as helpful by a diverse enough group of contributors to satisfy the algorithm, and is therefore never seen by readers. The speed at which a note is made public is also important, so that false or misleading information isn't given the opportunity to spread unchallenged.",
      "A report in October\u00a0by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate analyzed the Community Notes feature and found that accurate notes correcting false and misleading claims about the U.S. elections were not displayed on 209 out of a sample of 283 posts deemed misleading \u2014 or 74%.",
      "More information on how X's Community Notes works can be found on X's Community Notes page.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",

      "In announcing the social media giant's decision to end fact-checking\u00a0in the U.S. on Facebook, Instagram and other Meta platforms, Zuckerberg said the move would \"dramatically reduce the amount of censorship on our platforms.\" In a Facebook post explaining the company's shift to a community-driven moderation approach, Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan also said that \"Too much harmless content gets censored, too many people find themselves wrongly locked up in 'Facebook jail'.\"",
      "As Meta abandons fact-checking, here's how to tell what's real online",
      "As Meta abandons fact-checking, here's how to tell what's real online",
      "But those running the nonpartisan entities behind Meta's third-party fact-checking efforts said they had nothing to do with whether a post was removed from a platform, noting that the company was the final arbiter of what content it published.",
      "\"Facts are not censorship. Fact-checkers never censored anything,\" Neil Brown, president of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, a nonprofit devoted to media literacy, said in a statement. Poynter's PolitiFact is among the entities that had teamed with Meta on fact-checking.",
      "Meta's official fact-check program launched in 2016 with a number of third-party partners.vFact-checked posts were labeled and then demoted, reducing their distribution. But the posts weren't removed outright, according to Meta. What does get removed are severe content violations like posts supporting terrorism or promoting child sexual exploitation.",
      "The sheer volume of content across Facebook, Instagram and other Meta apps means that most posts were not fact-checked. Further, fact checks were not allowed on politicians' posts.",

      "\"To my knowledge they didn't take anything down just because it was false \u2014 their takedowns were only with false information that could cause harm,\" Angie Holan, director of the International Fact-Checking Network, which also works with Meta, told CBS News. \"My goal is for an internet where people can go on and find information that's accurate and reliable and this is a step back, there's no other way to put it.\"",
      "\"Fact-checking journalism has never censored or removed posts; it's added information and context to controversial claims, and it's debunked hoax content and conspiracy theories,\" Holan added in a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted on social media.",
      "\"Nothing to do with free speech\"",
      "Among Meta's fact-check partners, Poynter's PolitiFact said it offered independent reviews and disclosed its sources, while Meta set the rules about what content was removed.",
      "\"This decision has nothing to do with free speech or censorship,\" Aaron Sharockman, executive director of PolitiFact and Poynter's vice president for sales and strategic partnerships,\u00a0posted\u00a0on social media.",
      "\"The decision to remove or penalize a post or account is made by Meta and Facebook, not fact checkers. They created the rules,\" he added.",
      "Lori Robertson, director of the nonpartisan website FactCheck.org, which also partnered with Meta, also refuted Zuckerberg's notion that fact-checking contributed to a suppression of opinion.",
      "\"Our work isn't about censorship. We provide accurate information to help social media users as they navigate their news feeds. We did not, and could not, remove content. Any decisions to do that were Meta's,\" she said.",
      "Another fact-checking outfit that works with Meta also questioned if shifting to a \"Community Notes\" model in which the technology giant relies on social media users to monitor posts, similar to the approach in use at Elon Musk's X platform (formerly known as Twitter), will reduce bias and improve the quality of content.",
      "\"In our experience and that of others, Community Notes on X are often slow to appear, sometimes downright inaccurate and unlikely to appear on controversial posts because of an inability to reach agreement or consensus among users,\" Maarten Schenk, co-founder and chief operating officer at Lead Stories, said in a post Tuesday on the fact-checking site. \"Ultimately, the truth doesn't care about consensus or agreement: the shape of the Earth stays the same even if social media users can't agree on it.\"",

      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday said the social media company is ending its fact-checking program and replacing it with a community-driven system similar to that of Elon Musk's X.",
      "Zuckerberg cited the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election as underlying the decision, calling it a \"cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech.\" Zuckerberg made the announcement in a video. \"We're going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X, starting in the U.S.\"",
      "The changes will impact Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram \u2014 which have billions of users \u2014 as well as Threads.",
      "The systems put in place to moderate its platforms make too many mistakes, Zuckerberg stated.",
      "Meta introduced its fact-checking program in\u00a02016\u00a0as part of an effort to curb misinformation. The initiative was launched in response to criticism over Facebook's role in spreading false claims during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A 2023\u00a0statement\u00a0from Meta said the fact-checking program had \"expanded to include nearly 100 organizations working in more than 60 languages globally.\"",
      "Community trust",
      "Meta does plan to continue to moderate content related to drugs, terrorism, child exploitation, frauds and scams, Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer and Clegg's successor, wrote in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on the Meta site. Facebook's trust and safety content moderation team is also moving from California to Texas and other U.S. locations, according to the note.",
      "Kaplan also said entrusting users to effectively moderate Meta's social media platforms should benefit its content.",
      "\"We've seen this approach work on X \u2014 where they empower their community to decide when posts are potentially misleading and need more context, and people across a diverse range of perspectives decide what sort of context is helpful for other users to see,\" he wrote. \"We think this could be a better way of achieving our original intention of providing people with information about what they're seeing \u2014 and one that's less prone to bias.\"",
      "Meta said it would roll out its Community Notes approach over the next two month and continue refining it over the rest of the year. That will include no longer demoting content that users have fact-checked and including what Kaplan called \"a much less obtrusive label\" pointing people to additional information.",
      "Preparing for Trump",
      "The announcement came a day after Meta\u00a0said\u00a0former Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White, a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, would join its board, and shortly after former UK deputy prime minister Nick Clegg\u00a0announced\u00a0he was stepping down as president of global affairs.",
      "Musk, a major supporter and financial backer of Trump during his presidential campaign, is thought to have the ear of the president-elect on issues ranging from how to slash federal spending to transportation policy.",
      "Since Trump's November victory at the polls over Kamala Harris, Meta and other major technology companies have also sought to engender goodwill with the incoming administration. In December, for example, Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund, while Zuckerberg dined with him at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Such gestures seemed aimed at repairing Meta's relations with Trump, which soured after Facebook banned him from Facebook following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021, when the company ruled that his posts on the platform had helped foster the violence that day.",
      "\"Meta is repositioning the company for the incoming Trump administration,\" Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at research firm Emarketer, said in an an email. \"The move will elate conservatives, who've often criticized Meta for censoring speech, but it will spook many liberals and advertisers, showing just how far Zuckerberg is willing to go to win Trump's approval.\"",

      "The Justice Department on Monday released the final report of special counsel David Weiss, the Trump-appointed federal prosecutor elevated to special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of President Biden.",
      "In the report, which Garland submitted to Congress on Monday, Weiss wrote that he stood by his decisions to prosecute the president's son on tax and gun charges after agreements with Hunter's legal team collapsed. And Weiss pushed back on Mr. Biden's criticism of the probe.",
      "Weiss led a yearslong investigation into Hunter Biden that ultimately led to a jury conviction on felony gun charges in Delaware federal court and a guilty plea to tax evasion charges in California. In December, the president pardoned his son and claimed the charges against Hunter Biden were \"raw politics,\" a comment that was met with bipartisan criticism.",
      "\"The President's statements unfairly impugn the integrity not only of Department of Justice personnel, but all of the public servants making these difficult decisions in good faith,\" Weiss wrote in his report. \"The President's characterizations are incorrect based on the facts in this case, and, on a more fundamental level, they are wrong.\"",
      "\"Calling those rulings into question and injecting partisanship into the independent administration of the law undermines the very foundation of what makes America's justice system fair and equitable,\" Weiss wrote. \"It erodes public confidence in an institution that is essential to preserving the rule of law.\"",
      "In the report, Weiss defended his charging decisions, which many Republicans in Congress alleged favored the president's son.",
      "\"I concluded that the Principles of Federal Prosecution were satisfied as to both the tax offenses and the gun offenses,\" Weiss wrote.",
      "In 2023, Hunter Biden was charged with lying on a gun application about his drug use and in a separate case, he faced three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanor offenses, including failure to file and pay his taxes, tax evasion and filing a false return.",
      "Prosecutors alleged he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in federal taxes while living an \"extravagant lifestyle.\"",
      "\"Not only were both cases proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but they resulted in a verdict lawfully rendered by a jury and an admission of guilt. In making my decisions, I remained impervious to political influence at all times,\" Weiss wrote.",
      "During the special counsel's probe, IRS agents who worked on the Hunter Biden tax case with Weiss' team came forward in an interview with CBS News to raise questions about what they alleged was special treatment in the probe of the president's son. The said that dating back to the Trump administration, they had repeatedly been prevented from taking steps in the IRS investigation that would have been considered routine in other cases.",
      "\"We have to make sure as a special agent for IRS Criminal Investigation that we treat every single person exactly the same,\" Gary Shapley, a 14-year veteran of the agency, told CBS News at the time. \"And that just simply didn't happen here.\"",
      "The Justice Department and Weiss denied that Hunter Biden received favorable treatment.",
      "In a letter to Garland included in the report, Hunter Biden's legal team pointed out its criticism of the probe and told the attorney general, \"you likely are aware of the arguments we have made about the initiation and conduct of the prosecutions against our client.\"",
      "\"These are not 'inconsequential' or 'technical' tax code violations,\" Weiss wrote. \"The prosecution of Mr. Biden was warranted given the nature and seriousness of his tax crimes.\"",
      "Answering criticism of the gun charges, Weiss argued, \"An analysis of Justice Department data from 2008 to 2017 shows that these charges are brought more frequently than over 90 percent of the other available firearm offenses.\"",
      "According to Garland's letter to Congress, Weiss submitted the report a few days ago, on Friday. The attorney general noted there had been no instances during the probe when Garland had to intervene because of policy violations.",
      "The report also detailed Weiss' investigation into a former FBI informant, Alexander Smirnov, who pleaded guilty earlier this year to lying to FBI agents and providing them a fake story about the Bidens. Smirnov was sentenced to six years in prison earlier this month.",

      "Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers.",
      "Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71.",
      "Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years.",
      "Companies with the most H-1B workers",
      "Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position.",
      "\"The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes,\" said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. \"If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor.\"",
      "Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages.",
      "Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills.",
      "In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract.",
      "These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said.",
      "\"Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs.\"",
      "A boost to innovation?",
      "Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One\u00a0study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers.",
      "The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed.",
      "\"Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters,\" said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, \"There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent.\"",
      "Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow.",
      "But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers.",
      "When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable.",
      "Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe.",
      "More firing than hiring",
      "Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023.",
      "The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform.",
      "How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed \"Buy American and Hire American,\" aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",
      "But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a \"great program.\" Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would \"go to war on this issue\" in one X post.",
      "\"I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas,\" Trump said. \"That's why we have them.\"",

    "story": [
      "More than 20 million egg-laying chickens in the U.S. died last quarter because of bird flu, data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows, marking the worst toll inflicted on America's egg supply since the outbreak began.",
      "The record number of chicken deaths, which includes those birds culled when infection is discovered in a flock, come as figures show egg prices have soared to the highest they have been in years, driven in large part by the virus.",
      "\"Unlike in past years, in 2024, all major production systems experienced significant losses including conventional caged, cage-free, and certified organic types,\" a USDA report said this month.",
      "Taxpayers will pick up the tab for the lost birds. To incentivize farmers to quickly report and stomp out the virus, a USDA program pays producers for the eggs and poultry they cull.",
      "Last year, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said it had spent $1.25 billion on payments to farmers since the outbreak started in 2022.",
      "Why are bird flu cases high right now in poultry?",
      "U.S. officials brace every winter for upticks in bird flu because migrating wild birds that spread the virus fly south during the colder months.",
      "It's also easier for the virus to spread in the winter. Heat and sunlight degrade the virus on surfaces, the USDA says.",
      "This winter has been different because a strain of the bird flu virus has spilled over into dairy herds too, leading to hundreds of infected herds.",
      "Authorities suspect the virus has been hitching a ride in droplets of contaminated raw milk. Those are ferried between farms by workers' clothing, equipment and animals shared between farms.",
      "California has been hit especially hard in recent months, forcing the state to declare a state of emergency to try to respond to the bird flu outbreak.",
      "This winter's surge of bird flu is from a different virus than the uptick of seasonal flu infections that also drives humans to emergency rooms every winter.",
      "While bird flu led to millions of dead poultry over the past year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied only 66 confirmed human cases in the U.S. from bird flu viruses.",
      "Most American cases of bird flu have been mild. A majority were farm workers who were infected after close contact with animals infected by a bird flu strain that spilled over into dairy cows in late 2023.",
      "Researchers think\u00a0this bird flu strain mutated to be milder to humans than other variants spreading in the wild. Those other strains usually cause more severe disease when they jump into humans.",
      "Can animals be vaccinated for bird flu?",
      "The USDA announced this week it is drawing up a new stockpile of poultry vaccines. That vaccine will target the D1.1 strain of the virus, which has been spreading in wild birds and was recently to blame for a fatal human case in Louisiana.",
      "But officials said it's unlikely the vaccine will be used. The Biden administration has been weighing the possibility of vaccinating poultry for bird flu for years.",
      "That is different from plans to potentially vaccinate cows for bird flu, which the USDA says appears \"more feasible and more likely to be successful\" in battling the virus. Seven potential vaccines are now being tested in field safety trials, the department said.",
      "One major hurdle has been the fear that vaccines will only hide the symptoms of the otherwise highly lethal disease in birds. That could result in export restrictions from countries afraid the virus could spread to them through poultry products.",
      "In 2023, the USDA banned imports of some products from Europe after authorities announced they would start vaccinating some poultry for bird flu.",
      "Spread of the virus through contaminated meat in the U.S. has already happened during this year's outbreak at least twice: raw pet food made from sick animals was linked to an outbreak that killed cats in California and Oregon.",
      "A Food and Drug Administration spokesperson told CBS News that the agency is now urging the animal food supply chain to take steps to curb the threat of the virus spreading, including heat treatment to kill off the virus and avoiding using infected animals.",
      "\"All recent detections of H5N1 in cats had these things in common: the infected cats ate wild birds, unpasteurized milk, raw poultry, and/or raw poultry pet food,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "story": [
      "As the Palisades and Eaton fires\u00a0continue to scorch Southern California, helpless spectators are raising questions about whether there are better ways to tame the flames. While some\u00a0fire hydrants in Los Angeles ran dry\u00a0amid the extreme wildfires, people wondered if firefighters could use salt water from the ocean instead of depleting fresh water sources.",
      "The short answer is yes, they can \u2014 but it's more complicated than simply going to the beach to transport water to the hillsides of L.A.",
      "Here are a few key factors to know about how seawater is being used for firefighting \u2014 and some of its limitations:",
      "Salt water's accessibility",
      "With over 60 aircraft, California has the largest civilian aviation fleet for firefighting in the world, according to Cal Fire. However, only a few of them are capable of scooping up water from the Pacific Ocean.",
      "So-called \"Super Scooper\" CL-415 aircraft were spotted doing so last week to help slow the spread the Palisades Fire while firefighters on the ground work to contain the blaze.",
      "These $25 million water-bombing aircraft are capable of hauling 14,000 pounds of water, according to aviation management software company WinAir.\u00a0 Unfortunately, one of the two planes had to be taken out of service temporarily after it was\u00a0damaged by an unauthorized drone.",
      "Strong Santa Ana winds also play a major role in why Super Scoopers and other firefighting aircraft are not always able fly on missions to drop water and fire retardants.",
      "\"Turbulence created over a fire is already incredible, and when you couple that with life-threatening destructive wind events, it makes flying nearly impossible,\" a Cal Fire spokesperson said in a video explainer. \"When winds are above 30 mph, fire retardant and water only end up a mist instead of a steady rain.\"",
      "Salt water is corrosive",
      "Some of the firefighting aircraft are only built to carry and disperse fire retardants, not water. And for those that carry water, salt water isn't often used because its salinity can damage equipment.",
      "Salt water would create similar issues for other firefighting systems. Fire hydrants and many other firefighting tools are made of metal, which is susceptible to rust when exposed to oxygen and water. Experts explain that\u00a0salt speeds up that corrosion process because it acts as an electrolyte that allows iron to lose electrons more easily.",
      "Salt water's long-term effect",
      "One more reason seawater is a last resort in fighting fires is because of its effect on the environment, according to experts.",
      "The long-term effect of seawater on trees and soil is yet to be fully understood, said Patrick Megonigal, an ecosystem ecologist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center.",
      "Megonigal, who has studied how historically salt-free coastal forests react to saltwater exposures, wrote in an article for The Conversation that dry conditions in Southern California may allow salt to linger in the soil, which some trees may not be able to tolerate.",
      "\"Our lab experiments suggest that salt was causing clay and other particles to disperse and move about in the soil. Such changes in soil chemistry and structure can persist for many years,\" he wrote.",
      "Does Los Angeles have enough water for fighting fires?",
      "With ocean water not being the best option to fight ongoing fires, the question remains whether there's enough water to battle the flames.",
      "Rep. Judy Chu, a Democrat who represents areas devastated by the L.A. wildfires, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that fire agencies have assured her there is \"enough water\" to continue fighting fires amid concerns over water pressure in the area.",
      "She said that when the fires first started, fanned by \"drastic winds,\" fire departments were overwhelmed.",
      "\"This is not an ordinary incident, and many fire hydrants were going on at the same time, and also the electricity used to pump the water had been turned off so that there would not spark anymore fire,\" Chu said. \"So that happened at that point, but I believe that we're in a good place right now.\"",

    "summary": "A federal judge on Monday cleared the way for the Justice Department to release one of the two volumes that make up special counsel Jack Smith's final report.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Monday cleared the way for the Justice Department to release one of the two volumes that make up special counsel Jack Smith's final report detailing his investigations into President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon declined a request from Walt Nauta, an aide to Trump, and Carlos de Oliveira, former property manager at Mar-a-Lago, to block the release of Smith's final report, writing \"the court sees an insufficient basis to grant emergency injunctive relief as to Volume I.\"",
      "A federal appeals court separately declined to stop the report's release after Cannon last week issued a temporary order precluding the Justice Department from making it public. Her order remains intact until 12 a.m. on Tuesday.",
      "Federal prosecutors have said in court filings that the first volume of Smith's report pertains to the investigation into Trump's alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election. The second involves allegations the president-elect held onto classified documents after the end of his first term in 2021.",
      "Attorney General Merrick Garland has said he will not publicly release the second part of the report, on the documents case, because proceedings involving Nauta and de Oliveira are ongoing. John Irving, an attorney for de Oliveira, declined to comment on Cannon's ruling.",
      "In her five-page decision, Cannon wrote that her \"authority to enforce\" rulings is \"confined\" to the classified documents case. The case involving the 2020 election was brought in Washington, D.C., and was overseen by a different judge.",
      "Still, Cannon said there are outstanding legal issues over the Justice Department's proposed plan to give certain members of Congress access to the second volume of the report. The defense teams have argued against that limited release, writing that doing so could risk leaks.",
      "She set a hearing for Friday in her courtroom in Fort Pierce, Florida, to go over that proposal.",
      "Cannon wrote that the release of the report's second volume, even on a limited basis, \"risks irreversibly and substantially impairing the legal rights of defendants in this criminal proceeding. The court is not willing to make that gamble on the basis of generalized interest by members of Congress, at least not without full briefing and a hearing on the subject.\"",
      "She said the government has not \"presented any justification to support the suggestion\" that the second volume must be released to Congress now instead of \"after a reasonable period for an expedited hearing and judicial deliberation on the subject.\"",
      "Jack Smith's report",
      "Cannon's decision is the latest in a fast-moving legal battle over Smith's report that is playing out just days before Trump will be sworn in for a second term. Once the president-elect returns to the White House on Jan. 20, it's highly unlikely the special counsel's report will be publicly released.",
      "Smith resigned his position as special counsel last Friday, and Justice Department prosecutors are now overseeing all ongoing matters arising from his investigations. Smith's two investigations and prosecutions of Trump have since been dropped because of his victory in the November presidential election.",
      "As is required for special counsels, the special counsel drafted and submitted a final report to the attorney general last week. Garland has vowed to make public all special counsel reports completed while he is attorney general, and has so far followed through on that pledge, including after the investigation into President Biden's handling of classified documents.",
      "But Nauta and de Oliveira are fighting to keep the report shielded from the public. The two were charged for allegedly obstructing the investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents. While Cannon dismissed the case against them on the grounds the special counsel was unconstitutionally appointed, federal prosecutors are appealing her decision as it relates to Nauta and de Oliveira.",
      "Defense lawyers argued that disclosing the report to the public would unfairly prejudice potential future criminal proceedings against them. Defense attorneys simultaneously asked the 11th Circuit and Cannon last week to block the Justice Department from releasing the report.",
      "Cannon\u00a0temporarily stopped the report's release until the 11th Circuit resolved the issue. The appeals court then denied Nauta and de Oliveira's request to keep Smith's report under wraps, but Cannon's order remained in place.",
      "Federal prosecutors told the 11th Circuit that Garland would not release the portion of Smith's report that deals with the documents case while proceedings involving the two co-defendants are ongoing, but did plan to disclose the first volume involving the 2020 election case. They said he would make a redacted version of the second volume available for review only by top lawmakers on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and only if they agreed not to share information from it.",
      "\"This limited disclosure will further the public interest in keeping congressional leadership apprised of a significant matter within the department while safeguarding defendants' interests,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "The Justice Department further told the district court in a filing Sunday that \"without referencing defendants Nauta or De Oliveira, any conduct by them, any evidence against them, or the charges against them, Volume One does makes two references to the Classified Documents Case.\"",
      "Last week, Garland\u00a0informed lawmakers that Smith had finished his investigation and submitted the two-volume report. The attorney general reiterated his intent to make public the first volume \"in furtherance of the public interest in informing a co-equal branch and the public regarding this significant matter,\" but would not release the second volume \"to avoid any risk of prejudice\" to Nauta and de Oliveira.",
      "Though Trump is not a party before the 11th Circuit, his lawyers submitted a friend-of-the-court brief urging the 11th Circuit to block the release of Smith's report.",
      "The report, they claimed, is \"nothing less than another attempted political hit job which sole purpose is to disrupt the Presidential transition and undermine President Trump's exercise of executive power.\"",

      "Davis says the rapid spread of false claims, combined with the rise of AI-generated content, has prompted officials to be more direct in confronting the falsehoods.",
      "\"In the past, the idea was to be above the mis- and disinformation, to not say anything because it would give it credibility,\" Davis said. \"That conversation has changed because of its prevalence and the quality that's now being generated.\"",
      "Davis said this approach is becoming more common. During Hurricanes Helene and Milton, agencies including FEMA, the American Red Cross, and local governments directed some resources to combat a surge of misinformation about the federal response.",
      "Davis said directly addressing rumors is especially crucial during times when people are making critical decisions about their safety.",
      "\"Officials can't just ignore it because there are real consequences,\" he said. \"The stakes are too high.\"",

      "\"The image quality is expected to be low, and often people are looking to confirm something they already believe,\" he said.",
      "One of the most common forms of misinformation continues to be footage taken out of context, including old videos presented as new or aspects of the video being misconstrued.",
      "One widely circulated claim during the California fires stemmed from a viral video that purported to show firefighters using women's handbags to extinguish flames. According to an LAFD spokesperson, the video actually depicted firefighters using standard canvas bags, a common tool for tackling small fires.",
      "With the cause of the California wildfires yet to be confirmed, online speculation has turned to what may have caused them.",
      "Conspiracy theories \u2014 like claims that directed energy weapons, or DEWs, ignited the flames \u2014 have resurfaced, fueled by misleading videos. Similar claims emerged and were debunked during the 2019 Australia fires and 2023 Maui fires.",

The suits claim that the oil and gas industry engaged in a deceptive campaign and misled the public about the dangers of their fossil fuel products and the environmental impacts.",
      "A group of 15 energy companies asked the Supreme Court to review a decision from the Hawaii Supreme Court that allowed a lawsuit brought by the city and county of Honolulu, as well as its Board of Water Supply, to proceed. The suit was brought in Hawaii state court in March 2020, and Honolulu raised several claims under state law, including creating a public nuisance and failure to warn the public of the risks posed by their fossil fuel products.",
      "The city accused the oil and gas industry of contributing to global climate change, leading to flooding, erosion and more frequent and intense extreme weather events. These changes, they said, have led to property damage and a drop in tax revenue as a result of less tourism.",
      "The energy companies unsuccessfully sought to have the case moved to federal court, arguing that the claims raised by Honolulu under state law were overridden by federal law and the Clean Air Act. A state trial court denied their efforts to dismiss the case.",
      "The oil and gas industry has argued that greenhouse-gas emissions \"flow from billions of daily choices, over more than a century, by governments, companies and individuals about what types of fuels to use, and how to use them.\" Honolulu, the companies said, was seeking damages for the \"cumulative effect of worldwide emissions leading to global climate change.\"",
      "The Hawaii Supreme Court ultimately allowed the lawsuit to proceed. The state's highest court determined that the Clean Air Act displaced federal common law governing suits seeking damages for interstate pollution. It also rejected the oil companies' argument that Honolulu was seeking to regulate emissions through its lawsuit, finding that the city instead wanted to challenge the promotion and sale of fossil fuel products \"without warning and abetted by a sophisticated disinformation campaign.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs' state tort law claims do not seek to regulate emissions, and there is thus no 'actual conflict' between Hawaii tort law and the [Clean Air Act],\" the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled. \"These claims potentially regulate marketing conduct while the CAA regulates pollution.\"",
      "The oil companies asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the ruling from the Hawaii high court and urged it to stop Honolulu's lawsuit from going forward. Regulation of interstate pollution is a federal area governed by federal law, lawyers for the energy industry argued.",
      "\"Rarely does a case of such extraordinary importance to one of the nation's most vital industries come before this court,\" lawyers for the companies said in a filing. \"Energy companies that produce, sell, and market fossil fuels are facing numerous lawsuits in state courts across the nation seeking billions of dollars in damages for injuries allegedly caused by global climate change.\"",
      "The oil and gas companies argued the case raises a \"recurring question of extraordinary importance to the energy industry,\" and one they urged the Supreme Court to address.",
      "\"In these cases, state and local governments are attempting to assert control over the nation's energy policies by holding energy companies liable for worldwide conduct in ways that starkly conflict with the policies and priorities of the federal government,\" they said. \"That flouts this court's precedents and basic principles of federalism, and the court should put a stop to it.\"",
      "Lawyers for Honolulu said in a filing that the case seeks to hold the oil and gas industry accountable under Hawaii law for \"deliberately concealing and misrepresenting the climate-change impacts of their fossil-fuel products.\"",
      "Its lawsuit, the city continued, does not interfere with the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions. Honolulu's legal team accused the oil and gas companies of pushing a theory in the case that \"improperly attempts to cloak the former federal common law of interstate pollution in constitutional garb, with no foundation in the Constitution's text or history.\"",
      "The Supreme Court in June asked the Biden administration to weigh in on the cases and whether it should step into the dispute. In a filing submitted to the Supreme Court before the transfer of presidential power, the Biden administration urged the justices to turn away the appeals, in part because it said it is too soon for them to intervene.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 08:13:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposal is raising concerns with the chip industry, with artificial intelligence leader Nvidia calling it \"misguided.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that would limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, part of an effort to preserve America's six- to 18-month advantage on AI over rivals such as China.",
      "Proposed Monday, the framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict in 120 countries the chips used for data centers and AI products. Mexico, Portugal, Israel and Switzerland are among the nations that could have limited access.",
      "Chip giant Nvidia on Monday called\u00a0the proposal \"misguided,\" and said that it \"threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\"",
      "On a call with reporters previewing the framework, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that it's \"critical\" to preserve America's leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips. The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.",
      "\"As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense,\" Raimondo said. The framework \"is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.\"",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.",
      "Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve U.S. companies' advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains.",
      "AI-enhanced technology is forecast to help fuel growth and boost corporate productivity, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling the tech developments a \"once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution\" in a recent research note.",
      "Risks to AI leadership?",
      "A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\"While we share the U.S. government's commitment to national and economic security, the rule's potential risks to U.S. global leadership in AI cannot be emphasized enough,\" said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group's senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry.",
      "One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.",
      "Nvidia bashes proposal",
      "Because the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration of President-elect Donald Trump could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips. This sets up a scenario in which Trump will have to balance economic interests with the need to keep the United States and its allies safe.",
      "Ned Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI's development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.",
      "\"While cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,\" he said. \"The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\"",
      "Under the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.",
      "Nations without restrictions",
      "The allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.",
      "Users outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the U.S.",
      "Institutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.",
      "Also, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.",

    "summary": "President Biden spoke by phone Sunday with the families of three Americans held by the Taliban, Ryan Corbett, George Glezmann and Mahmood Habibi.",
    "story": [
      "In a roughly 30-minute phone call Sunday afternoon, President Biden delivered difficult news to the families of three Americans held by the Taliban. He did not have a deal with the Taliban to free their loved ones from captivity, despite what U.S. officials described to CBS News as a significant offer the U.S. had extended in Doha days earlier. The U.S. considers Ryan Corbett and George Glezmann to be wrongfully detained by the Taliban, and describes Mahmood Habibi, who holds dual American and Afghan citizenship, as \"unjustly held\" since 2022.",
      "Ahmad Shah Habibi, the brother of Mahmood Habibi, told CBS News that during the conversation, Mr. Biden clarified that he would not agree to the Taliban's demand that the U.S. release Muhammed Rahim al Afghani, a detainee at Guantanamo Bay, unless the Taliban, now the government of Afghanistan, also releases Mahmood. An NSC spokesman declined to respond to a CBS inquiry about that specific claim.",
      "Mahmood Habibi disappeared in Afghanistan in 2022, and the Taliban denied abducting him. In a public notice posted by the FBI in August 2024, the agency said it \"believed\" that Habibi was taken by Taliban military or security forces and \"has not been heard from since his disappearance.\" The FBI said in its notice that Habibi was working as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecom company when he disappeared.",
      "The Taliban still say they do not have Habibi in custody.",
      "\"No, we don't have him,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told CBS News Monday.",
      "Asked whether Mahmoud had disappeared in Afghanistan, Mujahid said, \"It's not clear either, because we didn't know him before.\"",
      "Ahmad Habibi told CBS News, \"My family has every confidence that my brother is alive. There are things that neither we nor the U.S. government can say publicly, but Mahmood's case is different from the other two Americans.\"",
      "\"We know the other families are desperate to get their loved ones home and I told the president we want them home, too,\" Ahmad Habibi added. \"But anyone speculating that my brother is dead is just feeding into Taliban claims. We are grateful that President Biden committed to not leave Mahmood behind,\" and he said that national security adviser Jake Sullivan had also made similar assurances.",
      "The FBI declined to comment.",
      "Corbett, who is fluent in Pashto, was working for local nongovernmental organizations before starting a microloan and consulting business in Kabul when he was arrested with three associates \u2014 one German and two Afghans \u2014 during a business trip to northern Afghanistan in 2022.",
      "Glezmann is an Atlanta native who was detained while on a tourist visit in December 2022.",
      "The family of Ryan Corbett is publicly calling on Mr. Biden to consider a deal to bring him and Glezmann home.",
      "\"We hope that President Biden will have the courage to take the deal in front of him, given that the lives of several Americans rest on his shoulders,\" Erin Pelton, a spokesperson for the Corbett family, told CBS News.",
      "Corbett's wife, Anna Corbett, described the call with the president during an appearance on Fox News on Monday.",
      "\"He was very kind and empathetic, but what I heard him say is he's not bringing Ryan home, and that was just devastating,\" Anna Corbett said. She blasted Mr. Biden for refusing to agree to the Taliban's terms for a deal. \"It is not being taken and it is incredibly crushing to our family.\"",
      "She has launched a public campaign in recent days to urge the incoming administration to press for her husband's release, and she traveled to President-elect Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago residence in hopes of making an in-person plea to Trump. Neither Mr. Biden nor Trump have met with her yet.",
      "Anna Corbett did tell Fox News that Trump sent incoming national security adviser and current Florida Rep. Mike Waltz to meet with her. She said he spent more than an hour listening to her family's story. She expressed frustration that it took more than a year to get a similar meeting with the current national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.",
      "The Taliban have been demanding that the U.S. release Muhammed Rahim al-Afghani, who is being held in indefinite law-of-war detention at Guantanamo Bay. A source familiar with his case said the U.S. intelligence community and Pentagon oppose Rahim's release and could not guarantee that he no longer represented a threat to the U.S. However, the president could waive that if he determined it were in the U.S. interest to finalize a prisoner swap.",
      "Rahim was captured in Pakistan in 2007 by the CIA and was the last detainee sent to the Guantanamo prison facility by the Bush administration in 2008. He has never been charged with war crimes, but the periodic review board has deemed his continued detention a national security necessity. His 2016 intelligence profile describes him as a courier for al Qaeda.",
      "In its statement acknowledging the phone call, the White House also noted that Mr. Biden had been able to bring home U.S. citizens who had been detained before the U.S. exit from Afghanistan in 2021. Corbett, Glezmann and Habibi were detained after traveling to Afghanistan following the Taliban's return to power. That ascendance of the Taliban followed a diplomatic deal negotiated by the Trump administration for U.S. troops to withdraw and a surprisingly strong Taliban military offensive that caught the Biden administration off guard, leading to a hasty and chaotic U.S. evacuation. Unwilling to remain without U.S. troops, NATO forces also pulled out.",
      "The U.S. does not officially recognize the Taliban, with its horrific human rights record, as the legitimate government of Afghanistan but has been in contact with its leaders through U.S. agencies as well as via the Qatari government. Last weekend in Doha, Special Presidential Envoy Roger Carstens and NSC official Jen Daskal pressed for a deal with the Taliban to free the Americans.",
      "A U.S. official described the Doha meetings as unsuccessful but declined to detail which other individuals the Biden administration was willing to offer to the Taliban as part of a potential trade. The White House described the Biden efforts as continuing through the end of his term.",
      "Mr. Biden has dedicated much of his career to foreign policy, and that portion of his legacy is extremely important to him. In a speech Monday at the State Department, the president will describe the chaotic U.S. exit from Afghanistan, arguably his biggest foreign policy failure, as having successfully ended America's longest war.",

    "story": [
      "Officials in the U.S. and Israel said that Israel and Hamas were close to agreeing a ceasefire and hostage release deal on Monday, after midnight \"breakthrough\" negotiations.",
      "Qatar, which has been mediating, reportedly gave both Israel and Hamas a draft on Monday of a ceasefire agreement to end the war in Gaza, the Reuters news agency reported, citing an official familiar with the talks.",
      "\"I think the pressure is building for Hamas to come to yes, and I think Israel also has achieved a huge amount of its military objectives in Gaza, and therefore, they are in a position to be able to say 'yes,'\" U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.",
      "Sullivan said Israel and Hamas had been close to a deal before, and things had fallen through, but on Monday there was a \"general sense that this is moving in the right direction.\"",
      "\"The question is now, can we all collectively seize the moment and make this happen?\" Sullivan said.",
      "\"We are in advanced stages of negotiations,\" an Israeli political source told CBS News, saying a deal could be agreed in hours or days. \"There is progress in all components of the agreement formula.\"",
      "What has been happening with the Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks?",
      "Israel and Hamas have been holding indirect talks for more than a year aimed at ending the war in Gaza and returning scores of hostages in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.",
      "The Biden administration has been pushing for a deal before the end of his term and Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. On Sunday, President Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone about the ongoing negotiations. The White House said the two leaders discussed the deal based on the arrangement outlined by Mr. Biden last year.",
      "The deal presented to Israel and Hamas appears similar to that arrangement, according to a copy of the deal from mediator sources seen by CBS News and a senior Israeli official.",
      "The deal consists of three phases, according to the copy viewed by CBS News, each one to be negotiated as things progress.",
      "During the first phase, which would take place over a 42 days ceasefire period, Hamas would release 33 women and children hostages, as well as hostages over 50 years old. For each woman or child hostage returned to Israel, Israel would release 30 Palestinian women and children from its prisons. Hamas would release all hostages over 50 years of age, and Israel would release 30 Palestinian prisoners aged 50 or older.",
      "On the first day of that ceasefire, Hamas would release 3 hostages, according to the document viewed by CBS News. On the seventh day, Hamas would release 4 hostages. Thereafter, Hamas would release 3 hostages taken from Israel every seven days, starting with the living and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died.",
      "During the exchange of hostages and prisoners, there would be a complete ceasefire in Gaza to allow aid to enter, the draft viewed by CBS News said. International aid groups and the United Nations would resume operation in Gaza, and reconstruction of its infrastructure, like water, electricity and sewage systems, would begin. There would also be negotiations over the next phase of the deal.",
      "The second phase of the deal would involve the release of all the Israeli male hostages and the withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza, according to the document viewed by CBS News.",
      "The third phase, which would be partially negotiated during earlier phases, would include the exchange of bodies of deceased hostages and prisoners, the beginning of the reconstruction of Gaza, and the opening of its borders.",
      "Despite intense mediation by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, the talks have repeatedly stalled over several key issues including the details of the exchange, whether the ceasefire would be permanent and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.",
      "As each side has accused the other of backtracking, the war has ground on.",
      "Dozens of Palestinians have been killed each day in Israeli strikes, and most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are huddled in squalid tent camps, their neighborhoods in ruins. Humanitarian groups struggle to deliver desperately needed aid, and experts have warned of famine.",
      "In Israel, families of the hostages have held weekly rallies demanding a deal for their release, fearing their loved ones will die in the harsh conditions of their captivity the longer the fighting drags on.",
      "What have the main points of contention been in coming up with a ceasefire deal?",
      "Hamas and other groups are still holding around 100 hostages captured in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that ignited the war, in which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. The Israeli military has declared a third of the hostages dead but suspects that the true number could be around half.",
      "Hamas is demanding the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners, including senior militants convicted of orchestrating attacks that killed civilians. Israel is reluctant to free such prisoners, especially since one of the masterminds of the 2023 attack, the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by Israel in October, was a former prisoner released in such a deal.",
      "The two sides have exchanged lists of names, with Israel demanding more information about which hostages are alive to ensure they come out first.",
      "Hamas has said it won't release the remaining hostages without assurances that the war will end. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 46,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to local health authorities, who don't say how many of the dead were militants.",
      "Hamas likely fears that Israel will resume its offensive \u2014 and step up its intensity \u2014 once the hostages are out and the militants no longer have their most valuable bargaining chip.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to do just that. He has said Israel won't end the war until it has destroyed Hamas' military and governing abilities and ensured that the Palestinian militant group no longer poses a threat.",
      "The lack of trust goes both ways: Israelis fear that Hamas will drag out negotiations over the second phase of the deal, extending the ceasefire indefinitely while the hostages languish.",
      "Talks have almost collapsed over disagreements",
      "The talks nearly collapsed last summer when Netanyahu said Israel would maintain a lasting presence in the Philadelphi corridor, a strip of land along the Gaza-Egypt border.",
      "Israel says Hamas has long smuggled weapons into Gaza through tunnels beneath the corridor and that it must control the area to prevent Hamas from rebuilding. Egypt, a key mediator, says it blocked the tunnels years ago and is opposed to any Israeli presence on the Gaza side of its border.",
      "Israel has also demanded a mechanism for inspecting people returning to their homes in northern Gaza, from which around a million people fled following Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war. Their return is a key Hamas demand, the details of which are still being worked out.",
      "Israel says people returning to the north should be searched for weapons. That would probably require an Israeli presence in what's known as the Netzarim corridor, a strip of closed roads and military installations stretching from the border to the sea just south of Gaza City.",
      "The Palestinians are opposed to any permanent Israeli occupation, though Hamas has reportedly shown flexibility on the timetable of the Israeli withdrawal.",
      "Israel says Hamas can never again rule Gaza but has yet to endorse a realistic plan for an alternative government. With no internal rivals, Hamas has been able to quickly regroup after Israeli operations, even in the hardest-hit areas, and still controls much of the territory.",
      "The Biden administration has long pushed for a grand bargain in which a reformed Palestinian Authority would govern postwar Gaza with the support of Arab and Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, which would also take the historic step of forging ties with Israel.",
      "But Arab and Muslim leaders say they will only sign onto such plans if they include a pathway to a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank, Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem and Gaza, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "Israel's government is opposed to Palestinian statehood and has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza. Netanyahu says Israel will maintain open-ended security control while delegating governance to politically independent Palestinians. But none appear to have volunteered, and Hamas has threatened anyone who cooperates with Israel in running the territory.",
      "Hamas has said, however, that it's willing to relinquish control of Gaza to other Palestinians. Late last year, it agreed to an Egyptian-brokered plan for a group of independents to govern the territory under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority, which has yet to accept the proposal.",
      "Hamas has also demanded the lifting of a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt after it seized power in 2007, which experts say is needed for Gaza to be rebuilt.",
      "The lifting of the blockade, however, would allow Hamas to claim a major victory and to eventually rebuild its military capabilities. That's another nonstarter for Israel.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 15:22:20 -0500",
    "summary": "When President Biden took office four years ago, he sought to reassure global allies and reestablish foreign treaties from which the Trump administration had withdrawn.",
    "story": [
      "With a world at war in Ukraine, the Middle East and Sudan, President Biden argued in a speech at the State Department Monday that his administration has strengthened partnerships around the world, bettered the United States' position on the global stage and weakened key adversaries.",
      "When Mr. Biden took office four years ago, he sought to reassure global allies and reestablish foreign treaties from which the Trump administration had withdrawn. The president reestablished strong relationships with leaders of NATO countries in the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and reentered the Paris climate agreement. But world leaders have been preparing for significant changes with President-elect Donald Trump's impending inauguration.",
      "\"I come here to the State Department to report to the American people on the progress we've made in the last four years, in our foreign policy, in our presidency,\" Mr. Biden said. \"I've said many times, we are at an inflection point. The post Cold-War era is over. A new era has begun. In these four years, we faced crises, we've been tested, we've come through those tests, stronger in my view, than we entered those tests. This is a fierce competition underway. The future of the global economy, technology, human values and so much else. Right now, in my view, thanks to our administration, the United States is winning the world-wide competition.\"",
      "Specifically, the president made the case that the United States' partnerships and transnational institutions are significantly stronger than they were before he took office, a key claim of his presidency.",
      "\"Today, I can report to the American people, our alliances are stronger than they've been in decades,\" he said. \"NATO is more capable than it's ever been. And many more of our allies are paying their fair share.\"",
      "But the president also sought to make the case that the United States' \"adversaries are weaker than they were when we came into this job four years ago.\"",
      "Specifically, Mr. Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin has \"failed\" to subjugate Ukraine and weaken NATO. The president touted his work to rally the world around Ukraine, another central piece of his foreign policy.",
      "\"As I saw it, when Putin launched his invasion, I had two jobs \u2014 one to rally the world to defend Ukraine, and the other is to avoid war between two nuclear powers,\" Mr. Biden said. \"We did both those things. Today, Ukraine is still a free, independent country, with a potential, a potential for a bright future.\"",
      "He also argued that Iran is weaker than it's been in \"decades,\" saying Iran's main proxy Hezbollah is \"badly wounded\" and Iran's economy is in \"desperate straits.\"",
      "Something that has remained elusive for the Biden administration is the freeing of the hostages Hamas captured in Israel, which has been a top priority for the president and his aides. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said before Mr. Biden's speech on Monday the parties are \"close to a deal and it can get done this week,\" but also said he couldn't make a promise or a prediction.",
      "In his speech, the president briefly mentioned the soldiers who died during the chaotic and deadly withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, while emphasizing that he has been the president to end United States' involvement in its longest war.",
      "\"We grieve all 2,461 Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice in the longest war in American history,\" he said. \"And I grieve those brave service members whose lives were lost during the withdrawal.\"",
      "Thirteen U.S. service members\u00a0died in an attack\u00a0outside of the Kabul airport amid the evacuation as the Taliban took over control of the country faster than the U.S. expected.",
      "Mr. Biden also laid out the challenges ahead for the incoming Trump administration, which will have to deal with a chaotic Middle East, Russia's nearly three-year war on Ukraine and a tenuous situation in the Red Sea.",
      "\"Make no mistake, there are serious challenges the United States must continue to deal with, in Ukraine, in the Middle East, in the Indo-Pacific,\" he said. \"Must keep the pressure on the Houthis who are attacking ships in the Red Sea, launching missiles at Israel, and firing at American forces. Must deter North Korea as they rattle their saber and draw closer to Russia. And new challenges will certainly emerge in the months and years ahead.\"",
      "\"But even \u2014 but even so, it's clear,\" he continued. \"My administration is leaving the next administration with a very strong hand to play. And we're leaving an America with more friends and stronger alliances, whose adversaries are weaker and under pressure. An America that once again is leading, uniting countries, setting the agenda, bringing others together behind our plans and visions.\"",
      "The president recently told USA Today that he had helped reset ties that had frayed during the Trump administration, saying he had managed an \"inflection point\" in history. He credited his long history in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with helping him \"navigate some of the fundamental changes taking place, whether it's in Europe, in Latin America, in the Middle East, in the Far East.\"",
      "\"The only advantage of being an old guy is that I've known every major world leader for a long time,\" he told USA Today's Susan Page. \"And so I had a perspective on each of them and their interests.\"",
      "Jake Sullivan said the president will argue \"America is winning that contest for the future.\"",
      "In his first foreign policy speech as president, in 2021, Mr. Biden aimed to tie foreign and domestic policy interests by arguing for a foreign policy for the middle class. The focus was meant to be on China and repairing alliances but was disrupted by crises in Ukraine and the Middle East.",
      "\"The United States is in a worse geopolitical position today than it was four years ago,\" says Stephen Wertheim, historian and senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"The United States is immersed in a massive war on the European continent with serious escalation risks; it's back to bombing the Middle East with no end in sight; and it has entered into a full-spectrum strategic rivalry with China.\"",
      "A look at the major foreign policy issues of his presidency:",
      "Ukraine, Russia and NATO",
      "Mr. Biden has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine, becoming the first president to go to a conflict zone where U.S. troops were not involved and directing over $183 billion dollars in military aid since Russia's invasion in 2021. He played a key role in getting NATO to spend more on collective defense.",
      "Yet the fierce battle continues on the frontlines with no clear plan for a peace deal. Washington deferred to Kyiv on when and how negotiations should take place with the tagline \"nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\"",
      "The administration was criticized early in the conflict for holding back on sending the most lethal weapons and later by some Republicans for spending too much money on Ukraine aid.",
      "Mr. Biden is expected to argue that his policies have ensured the survival of Ukraine as an independent state and thwarted Putin's ambitions, a senior administration official tells CBS News.",
      "Israel-Hamas war",
      "After Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed over 1,200 civilians, Mr. Biden made it clear that Israel has the right to defend itself with his administration sending over billions of dollars worth of military assistance.",
      "As Israel launched a war on Gaza that has killed more than 45,000 people according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry and led to a humanitarian crisis, the administration did not change its stance.",
      "In April 2023, Mr. Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanhayu that future U.S. support of his country was dependent on Israel protecting civilians and aid workers in Gaza.",
      "\"Biden willingly threw away his leverage by immediately pledging military support for Israel; then he criticized the Israeli government's decisions from the self-imposed sidelines,\" Wertheim said.",
      "The State Department informed Congress earlier this month of a planned $8 billion weapons transfer to Israel. Ceasefire negotiations are still underway between Israel and Hamas as pressure mounts for a deal to be reached prior to Trump's inauguration on January 20.",
      "Chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal",
      "The most glaring foreign policy failure was the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "Mr. Biden had promised to end America's longest war and assured Americans that the Afghan military was capable of holding off a Taliban takeover. Instead the Taliban expanded its control of territory across the country more quickly than the U.S. expected and seized Kabul as the Afghan government collapsed. The U.S. hastily evacuated about 125,000 people, including 6,000 Americans, over the course of its frenzied withdrawal, but dozens of Afghans and 13 U.S. service members were\u00a0killed in a suicide bombing\u00a0outside Hamid Karzai airport in Kabul as thousands sought to flee the country.",
      "U.S. citizens and Afghan allies who supported American troops throughout the war were left behind. Thousands feared retribution from the Taliban and felt abandoned by an American government that had promised to take care of them.",
      "Images of Afghans clinging onto military planes in hopes of escape, and U.S. military weapons left behind and paraded about by the Taliban became emblematic of the missteps leading up to the evacuation.",
      "In the three years since the Taliban returned to power, al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have established a presence in the country, and\u00a0Afghan women and girls have been deprived of basic freedoms\u00a0they enjoyed during two decades of Western-backed government following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.",
      "China",
      "Trump began a trade war with China\u00a0and other countries during his first term, imposing tariffs that were aimed at deterring what he saw as unfair trade practices and to encourage American consumers and businesses to buy and sell more goods made at home. While the rhetoric changed under Mr Biden, he nonetheless continued the tariff policy. And as was the case during the Trump administration, both have viewed China as a security threat, not just an economic one.",
      "The Biden administration put safeguards in place to help protect industries like chip production from relying on China. Global alliances such as the Quad \u2014\u00a0 U.S., India, Japan and Australia \u2014\u00a0 and AUKUS \u2013 Australia, the U.S. and U.K. \u2013 made diplomatic and military headway in deterrence against China. And the Biden administration has also enhanced its military alliance with Japan.",
      "Mr. Biden was vice president when former President Barack Obama delivered his \"pivot to Asia\" speech. American policymakers have been attempting to shift foreign policy focus ever since, but there has been a world of distractions along the way.",
      "\"The United States cannot expect to prioritize China while remaining the leading military power in Europe and the Middle East. If the United States truly wants to prioritize China, it needs to pull back elsewhere,\"\u00a0 Wertheim said.",

      "Tsunami advisories were issued for Miyazaki prefecture, where the quake was centered, in the southwestern island of Kyushu, as well as nearby Kochi prefecture in Shikoku island, shortly after the quake struck at 9:19 p.m. according to the agency. They were all called off shortly before midnight.",
      "The U.S. Geological Survey\u00a0revised its estimate\u00a0down from 6.9, adding that \"there is no tsunami threat from this earthquake\" for the United States.",

    "story": [
      "A descendant of one of Jack the Ripper's victims has demanded a new inquest into one of history's most notorious serial killers, after DNA evidence suggested the murderer was a Polish barber.",
      "The true identity of Jack the Ripper, whose grisly murders terrorized the murky slums of Whitechapel in east London in 1888, has been a mystery ever since.",
      "There have been dozens of suspects, from royalty and prime ministers down to bootmakers.",
      "After extracting DNA from a shawl recovered from the scene of one of the killings, Jack the Ripper sleuth Russell Edwards claimed in 2014 that the murderer was Aaron Kosminski, an emigre from Poland, who worked as a barber.",
      "The story goes that the shawl came from the murder scene of the Ripper's fourth victim, Catherine Eddowes, on September 30, 1888.",
      "At Edwards' request, Doctor Jari Louhelainen, a senior lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University, isolated seven small segments of DNA from blood stains on the shawl.",
      "They were matched with the DNA of Karen Miller, a direct descendant of Eddowes, confirming her blood was on the shawl.",
      "\"On the testing, the first result showed a 99.2% match. Since the DNA has two complementary strands, we went on and tested the other DNA strand, which game a perfect 100% match,\" Louhelainen told\u00a0the Liverpool Echo\u00a0newspaper.",
      "DNA from semen stains on the garment were matched with a descendant of Kosminski.",
      "Edwards has demanded an inquest into the unsolved killing, saying the DNA evidence warrants it.",
      "Miller backed the call in an interview with the Daily Mail published on Monday.",
      "\"The name Jack the Ripper has become sensationalized. It has gone down in history as this famous character,\" she told the paper. \"People have forgotten about the victims, who did not have justice at the time. Now we need this inquest to legally name the killer.\"",
      "Miller added: \"Having the real person legally named in a court which can consider all the evidence would be a form of justice for the victims.\"",
      "Kosminski's descendants have also supported the inquest, the Daily Mail reported. According to the newspaper, Kosminski's great-great-great-niece Amanda Poulos said: \"I'm more than happy to finally establish what really happened.\"",
      "Some have cast doubt on Edwards' findings.",
      "The research has not been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, meaning the claims cannot be independently verified or the methodology scrutinized.",
      "Under the law, it is up to the attorney general to approve a further inquest.",
      "Two years ago, then the attorney general, Michael Ellis, refused the request, saying there was not sufficient new evidence.",
      "Miller said on Monday the time was right to reopen the case.",
      "\"It would mean a lot to me, to my family, to a lot of people to finally have this crime solved,\" she added.",
      "Kosminski was born in Klodawa in central Poland on September 11, 1865.",
      "His family fled the imperial Russian anti-Jewish pogroms and emigrated to east London in the early 1880s. He lived close to the murder scenes.",
      "Some reports say he was taken in by the police to be identified by a witness who had seen him with one of the victims.",
      "Although a positive identification was made, the witness refused to give incriminating evidence, meaning the police had little option but to release Kosminski.",
      "He entered a workhouse in 1889, where he was described on admission as \"destitute.\" He was discharged later that year but soon ended up in a mental asylum.",

    "summary": "After traveling more than a million miles on the job, the secretary of state discusses the Biden administration's foreign policy report card, from a reinvigorated NATO alliance and Russian aggression in Ukraine, to the ongoing turmoil in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "No easy stroll to the exit for Antony Blinken. With exactly eight days left as secretary of state, he's only just concluded what is likely his last trip back-and-forth across the globe, with meetings in Seoul, Tokyo, Paris and, finally, Rome.",
      "Blinken has traveled more than a million miles on the job. \"Every minute, every hour, every day of the time that we have left, we're focused on getting results,\" he said.",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" flew with him in early December \u2013 three trips ago \u2013 from Washington to Brussels for the most recent NATO foreign ministers meeting. The main topic of discussion was Russian aggression in Ukraine.",
      "\"We have a new NATO strategic concept,\" said Blinken. \"It recognizes Russia as the most direct threat to the alliance.\"",
      "But there was a lot of well-wishing going on as well. Blinken stood right in the middle of the so-called \"family photo,\" and also photo-bombed a portrait of all the women foreign ministers.",
      "Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, the secretary-general of NATO, told Blinken, \"You have been a staunch ally, and people like you very much.\"",
      "All this ceremonial show & tell might be seen as subtle messaging to the incoming Trump administration about the value of nurturing alliance \u2013 the \"stronger together\" argument. Blinken said, \"The instruction I got from President Biden on Day One was, get in there, rejuvenate, re-energize, and even re-imagine our alliances and partnerships.\"",
      "Here was one more chance for Blinken to hold up the Biden administration foreign policy report card \u2026 and his own. He explained, \"If the United States is not engaged, if we're not leading, then probably either someone else is (and probably not in a way that reflects our interests and our values), or maybe just as bad, no one is. What we've done over the last four years is, we've re-engaged.\"",
      "As for Ukraine, he told the press in Brussels, \"All told, the U.S. has provided $102 billion in assistance to Ukraine, our allies and partners $158 billion. This may be the best example of burden-sharing that I've seen in the 32 years that I've been doing this.\"",
      "President-elect Trump wants to end Russia's war with Ukraine, critics fear not to Ukraine's advantage. Ever the diplomat, Blinken won't say he's trying to Trump-proof the potential outcome. \"For any of us to really speculate at this point, I don't think makes a lot of sense,\" Blinken said. \"What does make sense is to make sure that we give the next administration, we give the incoming Trump administration, the strongest possible hand for it to play around the world, whether it's on Ukraine or anything else.\"",
      "Sixty-two years old, Antony Blinken was practically born to be secretary of state.\u00a0 His father, financier and philanthropist Donald Blinken, served as ambassador to Hungary. His stepfather, international lawyer and humanitarian Samuel Pisar, was a Holocaust survivor from Poland. \"He was on a death march out of the camps, and he and some friends managed to escape the death march itself, hid out in the Bavarian woods,\" Blinken said. \"They saw a tank with a five-pointed white star. And the hatch opened up, and a very large African American GI looked down at him, and he got down on his knees and said the only words that he knew in English that his mother had taught him before the war: 'God bless America.' And the GI lifted him into the tank, into freedom, into the United States. Those are the stories that I grew up hearing, and it made me feel that there was something special about our country.\"",
      "Blinken grew up in Paris. He went to Harvard, Columbia Law School, and in 1993, during President Clinton's first term, began his diplomatic career at the State Department. During one administration after another, Blinken was always in \"the room where it happens.\" There he was (right, background) in the famous picture when President Obama took out Osama bin Laden.",
      "Blinken was national security advisor to then-Vice President Joe Biden. The two are exceptionally close. \"One of the things that's been an immense privilege is to have the kind of relationship where he would seek my counsel,\" said Blinken, \"and I always felt with him the ability to speak my mind.\"",
      "It was reported in Bob Woodward's recent book, \"War,\" that after President Biden's shaky debate performance last July, Blinken met with the president and asked him to consider whether he \"wanted to be doing this another four years?\"... adding, \"I don't want to see your legacy jeopardized.\"",
      "Blinken and Biden's legacies are inevitably linked, for better or worse. Blinken has defended the chaotic U.S. pull-out from Afghanistan on their watch, reminding the world that the first Trump administration made a deal with the Taliban, forcing the withdrawal.",
      "On their rocky relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the devastation of Gaza, in response to the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, and the appearance that Netanyahu is not respecting the role that the United States is trying to play (and has helped to finance) in its support of Israel, that calls to protect and feed people have been ignored, Blinken said this: \"The quickest way, the most effective way to get people what they need is actually through what we've been trying to achieve for many months now, and that's a ceasefire, with the hostages coming home, massive assistance going in.\"",
      "Even this late in the game, Blinken is hoping a deal can be reached before Inauguration Day. But if not? He said, \"When that agreement is reached, it will be on the basis of what President Biden put forward.\"",
      "And who will get the credit? \"You know, ultimately, it doesn't matter,\" Blinken said. \"What really matters is whether the United States can bring real change, real change to people's lives.\"",
      "He still sounds idealistic. There's something a bit square about Antony Blinken. After all, he's the guy who promoted music diplomacy by performing the Muddy Waters blues standard, \"Hoochie Coochie Man,\" in a suit and tie:",
      "What will he do now? He's vague on that. As he left NATO headquarters for the last time as secretary of state, I asked, \"You can't not have strong feelings knowing that you're leaving this building?\"",
      "\"Sure,\" Blinken said. \"Look, there'll always be a moment. Someone says something to you, there's some generous recognition, and for about 30 seconds you feel that. You take it to heart. But then, it's back to work. That really is my focus. Now, talk to me on January 21.\"",

      "Just one brief ceasefire has been achieved in 15 months of war, and that was in the earliest weeks of fighting. The talks mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar have repeatedly stalled since then.",
      "Netanyahu has insisted on destroying Hamas' ability to fight in Gaza. Hamas has insisted on a full Israeli troop withdrawal from the largely devastated territory. On Thursday, Gaza's Health Ministry said over 46,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war.",
      "Also being sent to Qatar are the head of Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency and military and political advisers.

      "\"The urban fabric is completely destroyed,\" Barcelona resident Fernando told CBS News. He lives in a neighborhood that is popular among tourists for its restaurants and bars.",
      "\"This area particularly, you know, I've lived here for over 20 years and it's just, slowly getting, like, soulless. I would say 50% of the buildings are here just for temporary use, you know, for rentals,\" he said.",
      "\"If it was like interesting cultural artistic and these kinds of clients, that would be much better for everybody,\" Barcelona resident Elizabeth, who works at a hotel, told CBS News. \"But people who come only for party, drink and just not taking care of the city. That is the problem.\"",

      "\"The tourist tax is what the tourists that visit our city pay when they are in a hotel or in a touristic apartment,\" Barcelona's Deputy Mayor Laia Bonet told CBS News. \"The possibility of using these revenues, the tourism tax, for such a project is very important so that we can accept tourism in our city and the role that tourism has.\"",
      "Barcelona's City Hall has launched a program to install energy efficient heat pumps and solar panels in all of the city's 170 public schools over six years. The aim is to provide air conditioning while also decarbonizing by replacing old, gas-powered heating systems. It is investing the equivalent of around $100 million in the project, all of which it says, is coming from the tourist tax.",
      "\"I think it's the best way to link tourism to\u2026 the necessary fight against climate change,\" Bonet said, adding that the tourist tax funding for the program is \"a very important help.\"",

Egede, came after Trump said earlier this week that he wouldn't rule out using force or economic pressure in order to make Greenland \u2014 a semiautonomous territory of Denmark \u2014 a part of the United States. Trump said that it was a matter of national security for the U.S. Melting sea ice has\u00a0opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic, and Western powers have\u00a0already voiced concern about\u00a0Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.",

Israel launched the war after Hamas carried out its unprecedented terrorist attack, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage.",
      "The total number of dead in Gaza represents a little more than 2% of the tiny enclave's population, with an average of about 3,000 people killed each month or 100 killed each day since Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel 15 months ago.",
      "Israel has rejected the figures provided by Palestinian officials and blames Hamas for all deaths in Gaza, accusing the group of using civilians as human shields. But new research published in The Lancet medical journal suggests the figure provided by the Gazan health ministry for the first nine months of the war could have been understated by as much as 40%.",
      "Gaza death toll an underestimate, Lancet study suggests",
      "From the beginning of the war through June 30, 2024, Gaza's heath ministry said just under 38,000 people had been killed by traumatic injuries, but the Lancet's estimate \u2014 published in a peer-reviewed study based on data from health authorities, social media obituaries and an online survey \u2014 was that more than 64,000 people had been killed during that time.",
      "CBS News is unable to independently verify the numbers, and Israeli authorities have prevented Western journalists from entering Gaza to report independently since the war started.",

      "\"I am broken inside after losing my family,\" 21-year-old Mahmoud Sukkar told CBS News' local team in Gaza. All 17 members of his family were killed, including his mother, father and twin brother, when an Israeli strike hit their home in Gaza City in the first month of the war.",

      "The Houthis, like Hamas, are backed by Iran, and they've launched repeated missile and drone attacks on commercial shipping, U.S. and Israeli military vessels and Israeli territory in support of their allies since the war in Gaza began.

      "\"We're making some real progress, I met with negotiators today,\" Mr. Biden told reporters at the White House. \"I'm still hopeful that we will be able to have a prisoner exchange. Hamas is the one getting in the way of that exchange right now, but I think we may be able to get that done, we need to get it done.\"",
      "U.S. envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk had been working to hammer out the technical details of a proposal, but Israeli intelligence chief David Barnea did not fly to Doha this week as Israeli media had said he might, and there was no indication that CIA chief William Burns was in Qatar, either. Both men have joined the talks repeatedly when there's been hope of a potential agreement.",
      "One apparent sticking point in the talks has been the unconfirmed condition of 34 Israeli hostages in Gaza who were listed on a document that Hamas resurfaced this week after it first emerged last summer. Israel has demanded to know who on the list is still alive and who is dead. Hamas demanded a four-day ceasefire to contact its network of militants across Gaza to confirm the hostages' condition, saying Israel's ongoing operations made it impossible for the group to assess otherwise.",
      "Family members and friends of the hostages have protested regularly in Israel to demand that Netanyahu's government strike a deal to bring them all home at the same time. Israeli officials believe about 100 hostages are still held by Hamas or its allies in Gaza, though at least 30 are believed to be dead.",
      "If a ceasefire does take shape, the first phase would involve a swap of hostages for Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons, along with a surge in humanitarian assistance into Gaza.",

The Hisbah, a regional police force tasked with enforcing Islamic Sharia law, have carried out midnight raids on motor parks, markets and street corners in the regional capital, Kano, since the beginning of the year, evacuating children as they sleep.",
      "\"We have so far mopped up 300 of these boys from the streets and taken them into a camp provided for their rehabilitation,\" Hisbah's director-general Abba Sufi told AFP. \"Their continued living on the streets is a huge social and security threat because they are potential criminal recruits.\"",
      "\"They are a ticking time bomb that needs to be urgently defused with tact and care,\" said Sufi.",

      "Some were sent from villages to learn how to read the Koran at informal Islamic religious schools called almajiri. Residents said many students of the Koranic schools beg for food and alms between classes.",
      "Attempts by authorities and local groups to intervene and support the age-old almajiri system have faced opposition from traditional clerics.",
      "The Hisbah police plan to provide \"psychosocial\" support and counselling to the children before enrolling those who show interest in school, Sufi said, adding that others will be given seed money to start a trade of their choice.",

      "Previous attempts to clear the city of street children have failed.",

      "Serwer said he typically asks all patients to bring their home cuff to the office, where he first measures their blood pressure manually and then uses the patient\u2019s cuff.",
      "\"We can then assess the accuracy of their cuff,\" he said.",
      "The most accurate results are obtained after sitting in a low-stress environment for five minutes, Serwer noted.",

      "U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy warned in a recent advisory about alcohol use increasing cancer risk.",

      "For those who are interested in curbing their alcohol use, here are six tips on how to do so safely.",
      "The surgeon general's advisory noted that alcohol-related cancer deaths even occurred in some moderate drinkers. (iStock)",
      "1. Analyze your alcohol dependence",
      "Alcohol is \"one of the most serious substances\" when it comes to detoxification, sometimes requiring medical hospitalization to manage withdrawal symptoms, according to Dr. Chris Tuell, clinical director at the Lindner Center of HOPE in Mason, Ohio.",
      "\"If you are one of the 40% of Americans who is trying to stop alcohol use, sometimes it may be necessary to seek counseling services.\"",
      "Tuell, who is also an associate professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, recommended speaking to a primary care physician before discontinuing years of extreme alcohol use.",
      "DOES \u2018DRY JANUARY\u2019 ACTUALLY IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH? HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW",
      "Dr. Adi Jaffe, PhD, CEO of addiction recovery platform IGNTD in Los Angeles, noted that in some cases, it may be \"medically inadvisable to just quit\" if alcohol dependence is severe.",
      "People who drink heavily, or consume five to seven drinks a day, should consult their doctor before quitting, one addiction specialist recommended. (iStock)",
      "\"You must consult with a medical professional before stopping,\" said Jaffe, author of the book \"Unhooked.\" \"This is especially true if you get tremors, shaking or sweatiness when you don't drink, even for a day or two.\"",
      "\"Those are markers of somebody who's more likely to have a grand mal seizure if they just stop cold turkey.\"",
      "2. Set clear goals and track patterns",
      "For people who haven\u2019t had a \"necessarily problematic\" relationship with alcohol and are just looking to cut back, Tuell recommended setting clear goals to get there.",
      "DRINKING ALCOHOL IS LINKED TO CANCER, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"With any behaviors that you plan to change, what are clear, realistic and specific goals on how much or how often you plan to drink?\" he asked.",
      "\"Perhaps you have the goal of only drinking on weekends, or perhaps you limit the amount of alcohol to two drinks per occasion.\"",
      "Writing down your drinking behaviors can help identify triggers, experts say. (iStock)",
      "Tuell suggested tracking your drinking by keeping a journal of when, where and how much you drink.",
      "\"This helps to identify patterns or triggers that may be associated with your mood, such as work stress or family stress and anxieties,\" he said.",
      "Planning alcohol-free days and then gradually increasing the number of those days each week can be effective, the expert added.",
      "3. Avoid triggers and find alternatives",
      "After tracking when, where and how much you drink, it may become clear what triggers you to drink.",
      "Tuell encouraged identifying these situations, emotions and behaviors and finding alternative ways to handle them.",
      "\u2018ALCOHOL GENE\u2019 COULD PREDICT HOW COCKTAILS MAY AFFECT YOU \u2014 AND THERE\u2019S A TEST FOR IT",
      "\"These triggers will frequently lead to behaviors that give us relief and/or a reward, and many times it is not a healthy way of coping,\" he said.",
      "\"Choose non-alcoholic beverages in social settings \u2026 like sparkling water, mocktails or herbal teas, to satisfy the habit of having a drink \u2026 or avoid places where heavy drinking occurs.\"",
      "Social pressure to drink can pose a major temptation, according to experts. (iStock)",
      "Jaffe commented that focusing on less drinking won\u2019t be as effective as drinking something else, like a non-alcoholic drink, or doing a different activity instead.",
      "SEVERE HEALTH RISKS OF VAPING AND E-CIGARETTES, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUTH, SAY EXPERTS",
      "Tuell agreed that finding a healthier alternative to bad behaviors is a good way to stop them.",
      "This could include stress-relieving practices like exercising, reading, journaling or spending more time with supportive friends.",
      "Adding movement as a replacement for drinking can help curb bad habits. (iStock)",
      "Movement, mindfulness exercises and meditation can also be helpful practices throughout the day, according to Jaffe.",
      "\"You can do those practices while you're brushing your teeth or while you're making your coffee,\" he said. \"Meditation practices as short as five or 10 minutes can have an incredible impact on your stress response in life.\"",
      "4. Change your environment",
      "Removing temptations from your environment is a good way to prevent reaching for them, according to experts.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Tuell suggested removing alcohol from your home or limiting activities that make it more accessible, such as hanging out at bars.",
      "\"Smell is the strongest of the five senses connected to memory,\" he added.",
      "Jaffe agreed that environment \"plays a massive role\" in how people interact with alcohol.",
      "\"If you're looking to reduce your drinking \u2026 having other people who are participating in the journey with you will go a long way toward helping you meet your goals of reduction.\"",
      "5. Practice saying \u2018no\u2019 and surround yourself with support",
      "The social pressures of drinking can be a trigger, but learning to say \"no\" is powerful. Tuell recommended being prepared with a \"polite but firm\" response in situations where you might feel pressured to drink.",
      "\u2018I\u2019M A PSYCHOLOGIST \u2013 HERE'S HOW TO FINALLY BREAK YOUR BAD HABITS'",
      "This can be as simple as, \"No, thanks, I\u2019m taking a break from drinking\" or \"I\u2019m good, thanks.\"",
      "Tuell advises surrounding yourself with supportive individuals, like trusted friends or family members with whom you can share your goals.",
      "Experts recommend surrounding yourself with supportive individuals with whom you can share your goals. (iStock)",
      "He also suggested joining a support group, \"like Alcoholics Anonymous, SMART Recovery, Celebrate Recovery or Women for Sobriety.\"",

      "For more Health articles, visit\u00a0foxnews.com/health",
      "Tuell also mentioned that methods like cognitive behavioral therapy can be effective.",
      "6. Be kind to yourself",
      "Reflecting on the reasons you're looking to reduce alcohol intake \u2014 whether it's to improve your health, save money, strengthen relationships or another motivating factor \u2014 can help keep you on the right path, according to Tuell.",
      "\"Setbacks are normal. So be kind to yourself and focus on progress, not perfection.\"",
      "He also encouraged celebrating milestones by enjoying something non-alcohol-related, such as a massage, a round of golf, a shopping trip or another fun outing.",
      "\"To make changes, it takes time,\" Tuell said. \"Setbacks are normal. So be kind to yourself and focus on progress, not perfection.\"",
      "\"If you keep moving forward one step at a time, you will get to a point where you're drinking substantially less.\" (iStock)",
      "While about 40% of people quit their New Year\u2019s resolutions before the end of January, according to Jaffe, the specialist said it's important to not be discouraged by slip-ups.",

      "Special Counsel David Weiss' final report on his years-long investigation into Hunter Biden determined the first son's drug abuse could not explain away not paying taxes on millions of dollars of income earned off of his \"last name and connections.\"",
      "\"As a well-educated lawyer and businessman, Mr. Biden consciously and willfully chose not to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over a four-year period. From 2016 to 2020, Mr. Biden received more than $7 million in total gross income, including approximately $1.5 million in 2016, $2.3 million in 2017, $2.1 million in 2018, $1 million in 2019 and $188,000 from January through October 15, 2020,\" Weiss wrote in his final report, which was released Monday.",
      "\"Mr. Biden made this money by using his last name and connections to secure lucrative business opportunities, such as a board seat at a Ukrainian industrial conglomerate, Burisma Holdings Limited, and a joint venture with individuals associated with a Chinese energy conglomerate. He negotiated and executed contracts and agreements that paid him millions of dollars for limited work,\" Weiss continued.",

As jury selection was about to kick off in Los Angeles federal court for the case, however, Hunter Biden entered a surprise guilty plea.",

      "\"These are not 'inconsequential' or \u2018technical\u2019 tax code violations,\" Weiss wrote. \"Nor can Mr. Biden's conduct be explained away by his drug use-most glaringly, Mr. Biden filed his false 2018 return, in which he deliberately underreported his income to lower his tax liability, in February 2020, approximately eight months after he had regained his sobriety. Therefore, the prosecution of Mr. Biden was warranted given the nature and seriousness of his tax crimes.\"",

      "Hunter has a well-documented\u00a0history of drug abuse, which was most notably documented in his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things.\" The book walked readers through his previous addiction to crack cocaine, before getting sober in 2019. The memoir featured extensively in his separate firearms case in June, when a jury found him guilty of three felony charges related to his purchase of a gun while addicted to substances.",

      "\"The evidence demonstrated that as Mr. Biden held high-paying positions earning him millions of dollars, he chose to keep funding his extravagant lifestyle instead of paying his taxes. He then chose to lie to his accountants in claiming false business deductions when, in fact, he knew they were personal expenses. He did this on his own, and his tax return preparers relied on him, because, among other reasons, only he understood the true nature of his deductions and he failed to give them records that might have revealed that the deductions were bogus,\" Weiss continued.",

      "\"Politicians who attack the decisions of career prosecutors as politically motivated when they disagree with the outcome of a case undermine the public's confidence in our criminal justice system,\" Weiss wrote in another section of the report. \"The President's statements unfairly impugn the integrity not only of Department of Justice personnel, but all of the public servants making these difficult decisions in good faith.\"",

      "Former assistant U.S. attorney Andy McCarthy provides legal analysis on Hunter Biden's pardon and worries over a possible Trump justice department investigation on 'America Reports.'",
      "FIRST ON FOX: Special Counsel David Weiss blasted President Biden in his highly-anticipated report on his years-long investigation into Hunter Biden, saying the commander-in-chief's characterizations of the probe into his son were \"wrong\" and \"unfairly\" maligned Justice Department officials, while admitting that the presidential pardon made it \"inappropriate\" for him to discuss whether any additional charges against the first son were warranted.",
      "Fox News Digital obtained a copy of Weiss's final report after his years-long investigation into Hunter Biden.",
      "The Justice Department transmitted the report to Congress on Monday evening.",
      "Weiss, in his report, chided President Biden for his Dec. 1, 2024 decision to grant his son a \"Full and Unconditional Pardon\" covering nearly eleven years of conduct, including conduct related to both convictions the special counsel obtained.",
      "Hunter Biden was found guilty of three felony firearm offenses stemming from Special Counsel David Weiss\u2019 investigation. The first son was also charged with federal tax crimes regarding the failure to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes. Before his trial, Hunter Biden entered a surprise guilty plea.",
      "HUNTER BIDEN: A LOOK AT HOW THE SAGA SPANNING OVER SIX YEARS UNFOLDED",
      "The charges carried up to 17 years behind bars. His sentencing was scheduled for Dec. 16, but his father, President Biden, pardoned him on all charges in December.",
      "Weiss, in the report, blasted the president's decision to pardon but also the press release that was sent out to the public that \"criticized the prosecution of his son as \u2018selective,\u2019 \u2018unfair,\u2019 \u2018infected\u2019 by \u2018raw politics,\u2019 and a \u2018miscarriage of justice.'\"",
      "\"This statement is gratuitous and wrong,\" Weiss wrote in his report. \"Other presidents have pardoned family members, but in doing so, none have taken the occasion as an opportunity to malign the public servants at the Department of Justice based solely on false accusations.\"",
      "Weiss also pointed to a comment made by Judge Mark C. Scarsi, who said: \"The Constitution provides the President with broad authority to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 1, but nowhere does the Constitution give the President the authority to rewrite history.\"",
      "\"These prosecutions were the culmination of thorough, impartial investigations, not partisan politics,\" Weiss wrote in his report. \"Eight judges across numerous courts have rejected claims that they were the result of selective or vindictive motives.\"",
      "Weiss added: \"Calling those rulings into question and injecting partisanship into the independent administration of the law undermines the very foundation of what makes America's justice system fair and equitable. It erodes public confidence in an institution that is essential to preserving the rule of law.\"",
      "In another section of the report, Weiss notes that, in light of the presidential pardon, he \"cannot make any additional charging decisions\" and said it would be \"inappropriate\" to discuss \"whether additional charges are warranted.\"",
      "\"Politicians who attack the decisions of career prosecutors as politically motivated when they disagree with the outcome of a case undermine the public's confidence in our criminal justice system,\" Weiss wrote. \"The President's statements unfairly impugn the integrity not only of Department of Justice personnel, but all of the public servants making these difficult decisions in good faith.\"",

This data revealed sensitive details, such as the precise locations where cars were parked, including private locations like people\u2019s homes, government buildings and even questionable spots like brothels.",
      "The exposed data includes detailed movement patterns of these vehicles, allowing for the creation of comprehensive profiles of individuals' daily activities. This could be particularly concerning for public figures or anyone with privacy concerns.",
      "Several car brands under the Volkswagen group, including VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda, were affected by the breach, which exposed sensitive data across multiple countries. The information was stored on Amazon cloud servers without adequate protection, leaving it vulnerable for months before the issue was discovered.",
      "For around 466,000 of the 800,000 affected vehicles, the location data was detailed enough to map out drivers\u2019 daily routines. Spiegel reported that the list of affected users included German politicians, business leaders, the entire EV fleet used by Hamburg police and even suspected intelligence agents.",

This information could be misused in many ways, from targeted scams where hackers pretend to be Volkswagen or its partners to trick you into giving up sensitive information, to more personal threats like stalking or harassment.",

      "The breach also raises concerns for business leaders, government officials and military personnel as their movements linked to high-security or restricted areas could be exposed, increasing the risk of corporate espionage or national security threats. Moreover, when paired with other vulnerabilities, such as app credentials, hackers could potentially exploit the data to unlock or even control vehicles remotely.",

If your contact information was exposed, you might receive fraudulent letters pretending to be from Volkswagen or related services. These could ask for payments, personal details or even encourage you to visit fake websites.",
      "6) Install strong antivirus software: Ensure that you have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices, especially those connected to your vehicle or its apps.

It is a massive breach of trust. While VW has patched the issue, the damage shows how important it is for businesses to be more responsible with the data they collect.

Starting with diesel engines, the first two versions of the Starship made impressive strides in fuel efficiency, but now with the introduction of the Starship 3.0, we're witnessing a remarkable shift towards sustainability.

However, the introduction of the Cummins X15N natural gas engine in the Starship 3.0 represents a pivotal shift away from diesel, addressing both environmental concerns and operational efficiency.",
      "The X15N engine, launched in 2024, is designed specifically for heavy-duty applications and overcomes previous limitations associated with natural gas as a fuel source. It provides similar power outputs to diesel engines but does so with enhanced fuel efficiency and significantly lower emissions.

    "story": [
      "These scams can catch Facebook veterans and novices off guard.",
      "Cybercriminals spare no industry, targeting sectors like health care, insurance, automotive and education. Health care has been a frequent target, with attacks like the Ascension breach last year and the CVR incident in late 2024.",
      "Now, education technology giant PowerSchool has become the latest target, with records of millions of students and teachers stolen.",
      "While the exact number of affected individuals remains unknown, the scale of the breach is alarming.",
      "PowerSchool serves 18,000 customers worldwide, including schools in the U.S. and Canada, managing grading, attendance and personal information for over 60 million K-12 students and teachers.",

      "Kids working on their laptops\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How did hackers target PowerSchool",
      "PowerSchool revealed a cybersecurity breach to its customers Jan. 7, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer. The company said it discovered the breach Dec. 28, after customer data from its PowerSchool SIS platform was stolen through the PowerSource support portal.",
      "PowerSchool SIS is a student information system used for managing grades, attendance, enrollment and other student records. Hackers accessed the PowerSource portal using stolen credentials and used an \"export data manager\" tool to steal information.",
      "The company said this wasn\u2019t a ransomware attack or a result of software flaws, but rather a straightforward network break-in. The company has hired a third-party cybersecurity firm to investigate the breach, figure out what happened and determine who was affected.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "UNDERSTANDING BRUSHING SCAMS AND HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF",
      "What data got stolen",
      "The PowerSource portal includes a feature that allows PowerSchool engineers to access customer systems for support and troubleshooting. The attacker exploited this feature to export the PowerSchool SIS \"students\" and \"teachers\" database tables to a CSV file, which was then stolen.",
      "PowerSchool confirmed the stolen data primarily includes contact details like names and addresses. However, for some districts, the data may also include sensitive information such as Social Security numbers, personally identifiable information, medical records and grades.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The company said customer support tickets, credentials and forum data were not accessed or stolen during the breach. PowerSchool also emphasized that not all SIS customers were affected and expects only a subset of customers will need to notify those affected.",
      "\"We do not anticipate the data being shared or made public, and we believe it has been deleted without any further replication or dissemination,\" the developer told customers in a notice.",
      "\"We have also deactivated the compromised credential and restricted all access to the affected portal. Lastly, we have conducted a full password reset and further tightened password and access control for all PowerSource customer support portal accounts.\"",
      "PowerSchool said affected adults will be offered free credit monitoring, while minors will receive subscriptions to an unspecified identity protection service.",

      "5 ways you can stay safe from PowerSchool data breach",
      "The PowerSchool data breach has highlighted the importance of staying vigilant about your personal information. Here are five steps you can take to protect yourself:",
      "1. Monitor your accounts regularly:\u00a0Keep a close eye on your bank accounts, credit cards and any online services linked to your personal information. Watch for unauthorized transactions or changes to your accounts that could signal misuse of your data.",
      "2. Freeze your credit: If your Social Security number or other sensitive details were compromised, consider placing a credit freeze with major credit bureaus like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. This prevents potential identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name.",
      "3. Use identity theft protection services:\u00a0Take advantage of any identity protection services offered by PowerSchool as part of its breach response. These services can alert you to suspicious activity and provide support if your identity is stolen.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "One of the best parts of some identity protection services is that they have identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Wherever possible, enable\u00a02FA for your online accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text code or app-generated token, to access your accounts.",
      "5. Be aware of phishing links and use strong antivirus software: Cybercriminals often use phishing scams to exploit data breaches. Avoid clicking on suspicious links in emails or text messages, especially those claiming to be from PowerSchool or your school district.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "You can blame hackers for this breach, but PowerSchool shares the responsibility for failing to adequately protect sensitive data. The company may also be in violation of data privacy agreements it signed with school districts, as well as federal and state laws designed to safeguard student privacy. What\u2019s more concerning is that PowerSchool took nearly two weeks to notify its customers about the breach. Schools are now left scrambling to assess the full extent of the intrusion. This delay is not just irresponsible; it puts students, parents and teachers at heightened risk of cyberattacks and identity theft.",

      "1. Download apps only from official stores:\u00a0Always use trusted app stores like Google Play or the Apple App Store to download apps. These platforms have security measures to detect and remove fake or harmful apps. Avoid downloading apps from random websites, pop-up ads or unofficial third-party stores as these are common sources of fake apps.",
      "2. Verify the app\u2019s developer:\u00a0Before installing an app, check who created it. Look at the developer's name and ensure it matches the official company behind the app. Fake apps often copy the names of popular apps but use slightly altered spellings or extra characters. For example, a fake might be called \"PayPaal\" instead of \"PayPal.\"",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Pay attention to reviews and ratings:\u00a0Reviews and ratings can give you insight into an app's authenticity. If an app has mostly negative reviews, very few downloads or generic comments like \"Great app,\" it could be fake. Genuine apps typically have a large number of detailed reviews over time. Be cautious of apps with five-star ratings but no specific feedback.",
      "4. Be cautious of app permissions:\u00a0Check the permissions the app requests before installing. A flashlight app, for example, shouldn\u2019t need access to your contacts or messages. If an app is asking for permissions that don\u2019t align with its purpose, it could be a red flag. Always deny permissions that seem excessive or unnecessary.",
      "5. Keep your phone and apps updated:\u00a0Regular updates for your operating system and apps often include important security fixes that protect your device from malware. Turning on automatic updates can ensure you always have the latest protections.",
      "6. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Install strong antivirus software on your Android. These tools can scan apps for malware, detect suspicious activity and block harmful downloads. Strong antivirus software provides an extra layer of defense, especially when browsing or downloading apps. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "The FireScam malware is a powerful tool that can steal everything on your phone, and it\u2019s tough to detect if you're not careful. Such apps can\u2019t be distributed through legitimate app stores like the Play Store or the App Store, so they rely on third-party stores and fake websites to spread.

      "Meta's platforms, like Facebook and Instagram, have been more tightly moderated compared to platforms like X, which has meant less freedom of expression for users. The changes Zuckerberg announced on Tuesday aim to relax those rules, letting people share their thoughts more freely. This could lead to more offensive content, but that's the trade-off for more freedom. The introduction of Community Notes is a good change, too, as it gives users more control instead of leaving it to a small group of people who might be biased toward a certain political party or issue.",

      "The power of plasmonic solar stills",
      "At the heart of this innovation is a floating solar still, a device that harnesses the sun's energy to purify seawater.",
      "Dr. Mita Dasog, an associate professor of chemistry and Killam Memorial chair at Dalhousie, explains the science behind it: \"Refractory plasmonic nanomaterials are very good at capturing light and converting that light into heat.\"",
      "This principle forms the foundation of their ingenious design. The solar still, conceptualized by Dr. Matthew Margeson during his Ph.D. studies, addresses challenges that have long plagued similar devices. It minimizes thermal losses, prevents salt buildup and can withstand harsh maritime conditions.",
      "Researcher pictured next to floating solar still (Matthew J. Margeson)",
      "A BREAKTHROUGH GADGET COULD HELP YOU DETECT MICROPLASTICS IN YOUR DRINKING WATER",
      "How it works",
      "The floating solar still operates through an elegantly simple yet highly effective process. First, ocean water is drawn up to the device's foam surface through a wicking system. Once the water reaches the surface, it is evaporated by solar-heated plasmonic materials. As the water vapor rises, the salt is left behind, ensuring that only purified water is collected. The vapor then recondenses on a clear plastic dome situated above the device. Finally, the purified water is funneled down the sides of the dome and collected in a sealed bag for easy access.",
      "The results of this process are impressive. In real-world tests conducted in Halifax Harbour, the device produced up to 0.97 gallons of clean water daily, which was a record-breaking yield for passive floating solar stills.",

Through a process called pyrolysis, carbon waste from tires is transformed into a crucial component of the desalination unit.",
      "Dr. Dasog emphasizes the importance of accessibility: \"We shouldn't be making an expensive or very complicated device. It has to be easy to manufacture, last for a long time and be easy to take apart and move.\" This approach not only makes the technology more affordable but also addresses the environmental issue of tire waste.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says business email compromise scams are a serious threat.",
      "With our lives so intertwined with digital communication these days, the threat of email fraud is something we all need to take seriously. Recently, Teresa W. shared a scary experience that underscores the dangers of business email compromise (BEC).",
      "\"I almost lost many thousands of dollars through an internet fraud scam. I got a call from our personal banker who said she saw nearly all the money in our business account being withdrawn. She said she got an email from me along with the money wiring directions. I told her I didn't send that and she said my email came from me directly to her. I said to stop everything and I will get to the bottom of it.",
      "\"Apparently the thieves got hold of a wiring instruction paper from my email, which they hacked into. They created a rule in Outlook to bypass me if anything came from them and go straight to the banker. They changed the wiring instructions to go into their account but thank goodness our banker alerted me so I could get to the bottom of it. Too close for comfort!\"",
      "This incident highlights a sophisticated scam where cybercriminals gain access to legitimate email accounts and use them to deceive others into transferring funds. Teresa\u2019s quick action, combined with her banker's vigilance, prevented a significant financial loss, but it serves as a wake-up call for many businesses.",

      "Email hacking: Scammers often gain access to email accounts through\u00a0phishing attacks, where they trick users into revealing their login credentials or by deploying malware that captures sensitive information.",
      "Email rule creation: Once inside the account, scammers can create rules in email clients like Outlook that redirect or hide specific emails. This means that any communication related to fraudulent activities may go unnoticed by the victim.",
      "Impersonation: The scammer impersonates the victim and sends emails to contacts, such as banks or vendors, requesting urgent wire transfers or sensitive information.",
      "Execution: The scammer provides convincing details and urgency in their requests, making it appear as though the email is genuinely from the victim. They may use specific language or references only known to the victim and their contacts.",

      "To combat BEC and similar scams, businesses must adopt a proactive approach to cybersecurity.",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software: Use reputable, up-to-date, strong antivirus software to check your system. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Use strong passwords:\u00a0Ensure passwords are complex (a mix of letters, numbers and symbols) and unique for each account.\u00a0Make sure to create strong, unique passwords. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication: Where possible, enable multifactor authentication.\u00a0This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts.",
      "4) Monitor your accounts: Keep an eye on your financial accounts, email accounts and social media for any unusual activity. If you think scammers have stolen your identity, consider identity theft protection here.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5) Invest in personal data removal services: Using a data removal service can be an effective additional step to protect your personal information after a potential BEC scam. These services locate and remove your information from various online platforms, databases and data brokers. By eliminating unnecessary or outdated information, data removal services minimize your online presence, making it harder for scammers to find and exploit your data.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Regularly update security questions: Change security questions and answers periodically to enhance protection.",
      "7) Regularly review email rules: Check for unauthorized changes in email settings that could indicate compromise.",
      "8) Disable auto-forwarding: Unless absolutely necessary, turn off auto-forwarding features to prevent sensitive information from being sent elsewhere without your knowledge.",
      "9) Verify requests: Always verify any financial requests through a secondary communication method (e.g., a phone call) before proceeding with transactions.",
      "10) Limit access: Restrict access to financial information and transactions only to those who need it within your organization.",
      "11) Contact professionals: If you\u2019re unsure about any steps or if the situation seems severe, consider reaching out to a professional IT service.",
      "12) Report the incident: Report the scam to your local authorities and the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission in the U.S.",
      "13) Create alias email addresses: My top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is to use an\u00a0alias email address.\u00a0An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.",
      "In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.",
      "Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail and having your email eventually stolen in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",

      "New Orleans terrorist attacker Shamsud-Din Jabbar was radicalized by ISIS online \"within weeks,\" according to FBI Director Christopher Wray.",
      "Jabbar killed 14 civilians when he rammed a rented Ford F-150 truck through a New Year's crowd celebrating on Bourbon Street around 3:15 a.m. on Jan. 1. He then began shooting at police, who returned fire, killing the attacker.",
      "\"[H]e appears to have been inspired \u2014 from afar \u2014 by ISIS. And it is, in many ways, the most challenging type of terrorist threat we face,\" Wray told \"60 Minutes\" in a wide-ranging interview that aired Sunday. \"You're talking about guys like this, who radicalize not in years but in weeks, and whose method of attack is still very deadly but fairly crude. And if you think about that old saying about connecting the dots, there are not a lot of dots out there to connect. And there's very little time in which to connect them.\"",
      "The FBI noted earlier this month that Jabbar, 42, traveled to Cairo, Egypt, from June 22 to July 3, 2023, then returned to the U.S. In a separate trip on July 10, 2023, he traveled to Ontario, Canada, and returned to the U.S. a few days later.",

      "Prior to the New Orleans attack, he visited the city twice \u2014 once in October and again in November. He used Meta smart glasses to take videos of his surroundings as he rode a bike through the French Quarter months before carrying out the deadly attack.",

      "On Dec. 31, Jabbar rented the Ford truck in Houston and then drove it to New Orleans, where he checked in to an AirBnb. Authorities would later find bomb-making materials and remnants of a fire at the property, saying Jabbar likely attempted to cover up his crime by attempting to burn evidence at the rental home in the St. Roch neighborhood, about two miles from the French Quarter.",
      "WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT VICTIMS OF NEW ORLEANS TERRORIST ATTACK",
      "\"It's pretty clear so far that this is a guy who was radicalized online and who was determined to try to murder as many innocent people as he could in the name of ISIS,\" Wray said in his interview with \"60 Minutes.\"",

      "The New Orleans terrorist attacker raised \"red flags\" as he placed two IEDs in the French Quarter hours before he carried out an attack that left 14 civilians dead, according to behavioral analyst Susan Constantine.",
      "Constantine described Shamsud-Din Jabbar as an \"anomaly\" in the French Quarter on New Year's Eve, as shown in videos released by the FBI last week. In the videos, Jabbar can be seen wearing a long, formal-looking coat and glasses, carrying a cooler on wheels and frequently looking at his phone.",
      "\"These are all red flags,\" Constantine told Fox News Digital. \"Anyone looking for danger would pull out these anomalies, he\u2019s texting very quickly, obviously in communication with someone else. And then he\u2019s motioning to someone.\"",
      "Jabbar appears to wave around the 2:30-minute mark in the surveillance video of him carrying around the IED coolers in the French Quarter, and while he may have been waving to an accomplice, Constantine said the wave also could have been an attempt to look less \"conspicuous.\"",

They\u2019re performers and actors. . . . I think we need to have more education to consumers, because officers and security can\u2019t have their eyes everywhere.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 06:21:17 -0500",
    "summary": "The Lebanese parliament finally voted on a new president on Thursday following two years of deadlock. Joseph Aoun the head of the country&apos;s armed forces won a majority of the votes.",
    "story": [
      "Israel Defense Forces Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari says Hezbollah was planning to use bunker to stage attack on Israel. (Credit: IDF)",
      "Lebanon\u2019s political landscape has undergone a dramatic shift with the election of Joseph Aoun as president. After more than two years of political deadlock, the Lebanese Parliament elected the army commander on Thursday with 99 out of 128 votes.",
      "Aoun\u2019s election represents a significant achievement for the anti-Hezbollah camp, reflecting the weakening influence of the powerful Shia terrorist organization within Lebanon\u2019s political system. Despite this, experts say Hezbollah remains a formidable force in the country, and the challenges Aoun faces in balancing Lebanon's internal politics and foreign relations remain immense.",
      "For much of the past two years, Hezbollah worked tirelessly to block any movement toward the election of a new president. The group had strongly opposed Aoun\u2019s candidacy. However, as the political situation evolved and the ousting of Assad from Syria unfolded, Hezbollah was ultimately forced to accept Aoun, who secured the presidency.",
      "\"Hezbollah had been opposed to his election for the last two and a half years and had blocked any process toward electing a president for all that time. Now, they\u2019ve voted for him in the second round, which indicates they are in a bind, that they are weaker, and their leverage is not what it was,\" Vice President for International Engagement at the Middle East Institute Paul Salem told Fox News Digital.",

      "Newly-elected Lebanese President Joseph Aoun reviews the honor guard upon his arrival at the Lebanese Parliament to be sworn in as the new president in Beirut on Thursday, Jan. 9, 2025. (AP Photo/Hussein Malla)",
      "Salem points to the broader shift in regional politics, notably the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, which has left Hezbollah increasingly isolated. \"They are now not only cut off from Iran, but they're also isolated in the region. They're the only Shiite community between here and Basra, and it\u2019s a Sunni takeover of Damascus, which used to be dominated by a friendly Alawite, pro-Iranian regime. It\u2019s a huge historic shift that leaves the Shiites and Hezbollah deeply isolated. Hezbollah\u2019s future is worse than its present,\" he added.",
      "The U.S. and Israel, along with other Western and Arab powers, have long sought to distance Lebanon from Hezbollah\u2019s influence, and Aoun\u2019s election could be a step in that direction.",
      "Aoun, a Maronite Christian and the commander of the Lebanese army, took office with a strong message focused on Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty. In his inaugural speech, he emphasized the necessity for the state to have a monopoly on the use of force.",
      "David Schenker, former head of the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs at the U.S. State Department under the first Trump administration, remarked that Aoun\u2019s speech was both a positive and pragmatic step for Lebanon. \"He talked about disarming all groups and ensuring that weapons are under the control of the state,\" Schenker said. \"This was a good move, as it shows a commitment to sovereignty and the rule of law.\"",

      "An updated graphic detailing the members of Hezbollah's leadership who have been eliminated by the Israeli Defense Forces. (IDF Spokesman's Unit)",
      "However, Schenker, who is currently the Taube Senior Fellow at The Washington Institute and director of the Linda and Tony Rubin Program on Arab Politics, cautioned that Aoun\u2019s position as president does not grant him absolute power in Lebanon\u2019s political system. \"The president is not the most powerful position in Lebanon. The key position will be the prime minister. It remains to be seen whether Aoun will show the same courage in his new role that he demonstrated as chief of staff,\" Schenker noted.",
      "Though Hezbollah has been militarily weakened by recent Israeli campaigns and the assassination of its leader Hassan Nasrallah, among other key leaders, it still retains significant influence, particularly in southern Lebanon. However, Schenker says the organization\u2019s ability to intimidate Lebanon\u2019s population is diminishing. \"Hezbollah isn\u2019t the force it was. It can still reactivate its killing machine if needed, but it no longer dominates the way it did before,\" he said.",
      "\"Hezbollah has calculated that they\u2019ve lost this battle against Israel, and then they lost another battle in Syria. So their interest now is to lay low, have a president and government that\u2019s acceptable to the U.S. and the region, which, at the end of the day, they hope will protect them from any further Israeli incursions and help their people,\" Salem explained. \"They need a functioning government to secure international aid for the millions displaced by their actions in southern Lebanon. It\u2019s about survival for them, not just politically, but financially.\"",

      "Aoun\u2019s election is not only significant for Hezbollah\u2019s position in Lebanon, but also for the country\u2019s relations with external powers like the U.S. and Israel. Lebanon has faced economic collapse, with its currency devalued by over 99%, and nearly 80% of the population now living below the poverty line. Hezbollah\u2019s previous resistance to international pressure now seems less tenable.",
      "The U.S. has long supported Lebanon\u2019s military and is expected to strengthen its ties with Aoun, given his role in the army and his pro-sovereignty stance. Schenker said that Lebanon\u2019s future alignment with the U.S. and regional allies such as Saudi Arabia could provide the country with much-needed international support.",

      "\"The U.S. military has been close to the Lebanese military for many years,\" Salem told Fox News Digital. \"That has been the strongest link between the U.S. and Lebanon. So to have the head of the military come to power, he\u2019s a known figure in Washington. He\u2019s known to the military, and now, he\u2019s known to the diplomats and politicians, and will be known to President Trump and others over time. This realignment could put Lebanon on a much more natural path of cooperation with the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and other regional allies.\"",
      "Israel will also be closely monitoring Aoun\u2019s presidency. Schenker said that Aoun\u2019s commitment to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for disarmament in southern Lebanon, could lead to a more cooperative stance from Lebanon toward Israel. \"Israel will be invested in Lebanon\u2019s implementation of 1701,\" Schenker said. \"Aoun\u2019s stance will influence Israel\u2019s position toward Lebanon, as the Trump administration has clearly signaled a desire to end the wars in the region.\"",

    "summary": "Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado&apos;s aides claim she was detained Thursday, despite denials by the country&apos;s socialist government.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Aides to Venezuela opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said she was detained Thursday, followed moments later by official denials, in a confusing episode that capped a day of protests seeking to block President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from clinging to power.",
      "It's not clear exactly what transpired after Machado bid farewell to hundreds of supporters, hopped on a motorcycle and raced with her security convoy through the empty streets of eastern Caracas to an undisclosed location.",
      "At 3:21 p.m. local time, Machado\u2019s press team said in a social media post that security forces \"violently intercepted\" her convoy. Her aides later confirmed to The Associated Press that the opposition hardliner had been detained, and international condemnation immediately poured from leaders in Latin America and beyond demanding her release.",
      "But about an hour later, a 20-second video of Machado was posted online by a Maduro supporter in which the opposition leader said she was followed after leaving the rally and that she had dropped her purse. \"I'm good, I'm safe,\" Machado said in a raspy voice, adding \"Venezuela will be free.\"",
      "THOUSANDS OF VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS TAKE TO THE STREETS AHEAD OF MADURO'S THIRD INAUGURATION",
      "Her aides later said in a social media post that the proof-of-of-life video message had been coerced, and that after recording it she was freed. They said she would provide details of her \"kidnapping\" later.",
      "Meanwhile, Maduro supporters denied that she was detained and gloated that government opponents were trying to spread fake news to generate an international crisis. \"Nobody should be surprised,\" Communications Minister Freddy Nanez said. \"Especially since it's coming from the fascists, who were the architects of the dirty trick.\"",
      "Earlier Thursday, Machado addressed hundreds of supporters who heeded her call to take to the streets a day before the ruling party-controlled National Assembly was scheduled to swear in Maduro to a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost the presidential election.",
      "\"They wanted us to fight each other, but Venezuela is united, we are not afraid,\" Machado shouted from atop a truck in the capital minutes before she was reported detained.",
      "Machado, 57, is a hardliner former lawmaker who stayed and fought against Maduro even after many of her allies in the opposition leadership fled, joining an exodus of some 7 million Venezuelans who\u2019ve abandoned their homeland in recent years.",
      "Loyalists who control the country's judiciary banned her from running against Maduro last year. In a deft move, she backed an unknown outsider \u2014 retired diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez \u2014 who crushed Maduro by a more than two-to-one margin, according to voting machine records collected by the opposition and validated by international observers.",

      "Gonz\u00e1lez, invoking the title of president-elect recognized by the U.S. and other countries, was among those who demanded Machado's release in the immediate aftermath of what was believed to be her shock arrest.",
      "\"To the security forces, I warn you: don't play with fire,\" he said in a social media post from the Dominican Republic, where he met with President Luis Abinader and a delegation of former presidents from across Latin America.",
      "There was a relatively small turnout for Thursday's protests as riot police were deployed in force. Venezuelans who\u2019ve witnessed Maduro\u2019s security forces round up scores of opponents and regular bystanders since the July election were reluctant to mobilize in the same numbers as they have in the past.",
      "\"Of course, there\u2019s fewer people,\" said empanada vendor Miguel Contrera as National Guard soldiers carrying riot shields buzzed by on motorcycles. \"There\u2019s fear.\"",
      "Those demonstrators that did show up blocked a main avenue in one opposition stronghold. Many were senior citizens and dressed in red, yellow and blue, answering Machado\u2019s call to wear the colors of the Venezuelan flag. All repudiated Maduro and said they would recognize Gonz\u00e1lez as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president.",
      "The deployment of security forces as well as pro-government armed groups known as \"colectivos\" to intimidate opponents betrays a deep insecurity on the part of Maduro, said Javier Corrales, a Latin America expert at Amherst College.",
      "Since the elections, the government has arrested more than 2,000 people \u2014 including as many as 10 Americans and other foreigners \u2014 who it claims have been plotting to oust Maduro and sow chaos in the oil rich South American nation. This week alone, masked gunmen arrested a former presidential candidate, a prominent free speech activist and even Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s son-in-law as he was taking his young children to school.",
      "\"It\u2019s an impressive show of force but it\u2019s also a sign of weakness,\" said Corrales, who co-authored this month an article, \"How Maduro Stole Venezuela\u2019s Vote,\" in the Journal of Democracy.",
      "\"Maduro is safe in office,\" said Corrales, \"but he and his allies recognize they are moving forward with a big lie and have no other way to justify what they are doing except by relying on the military.\"",
      "Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council, also stacked with government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner of the election. But unlike in previous contests, authorities did not provide any access to voting records or precinct-level results.",
      "The opposition, however, collected tally sheets from 85% of electronic voting machines and posted them online. They showed that its candidate, Gonz\u00e1lez, had thrashed Maduro by a more than two-to-one margin. Experts from the United Nations and the Atlanta-based Carter Center, both invited by Maduro\u2019s government to observe the election, have said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate.",
      "The U.S. and other governments have also recognized Gonz\u00e1lez as Venezuela\u2019s president-elect. Even many of Maduro\u2019s former leftist allies in Latin America plan to skip Friday\u2019s swearing-in ceremony.",

      "Follow live coverage here",
      "The Eaton Fire, which has burned through more than 14,110 acres and destroyed over 7,000 structures, remained about one-third contained, fire officials said Monday. The fire was reported at 6:18 p.m. Tuesday, when wind gusts approaching 100 mph ripped through the region.",
      "Despite no official cause, the suits contend there is evidence pointing to Southern California Edison's inaction. The utility, however, has told state public utilities regulators that fire officials have not suggested its electric facilities played a part in the fire's ignition.",
      "Southern California Edison spokesperson Gabriela Ornelas told NBC News, \u201cOur hearts remain with our communities during the devasting fires in Southern California and we remain committed to supporting them through this difficult time.\u201d",
      "\u201cSCE crews, contractors and mutual assistance partners are dedicated to safely restoring power to our customers.

      "The suit alleges that the utility should have known of the dangers based on forecasts of potentially catastrophic Santa Ana winds several days before they tore through Los Angeles, fanning the massive Palisades Fire, the largest of the wildfires. At least 24 people have died in the fires.",
      "The suit says video footage, photos and local accounts suggest electrical infrastructure operated by the utility set off the fire in the Eaton Canyon area.",
      "Despite \"repeated and clear warnings,\" the company \"failed to de-energize all of its electrical equipment in the area that day,\" the suit says.",
      "In the hours preceding the first report of a fire, the complaint adds, \"data shows that there were more than 300 faults\" on Southern California Edison's lines in the vicinity of the fire's origins.",
      "\"Faults\" refer to instances in which a power line may have come into contact with a tree limb or other debris, causing a spark.",
      "The suit cited information from Bob Marshall, the CEO of Whisker Labs, a company that analyzes electrical grid data, which said there was a \"significant spike\" in faults in the hours leading up to the fires.",
      "Marshall told NBC News that while it's\u00a0too early to know what caused these fires, his company's data shows evidence of many electrical faults in the areas near the fires, including in Eaton Canyon, likely caused by trees hitting power lines. He also said that homes and communities in immediate proximity to where the fires started remained powered.",
      "\"That means that the distribution lines that carry the power to those communities were energized throughout, so there was no full Public Safety Power Shutoff\u00a0program implemented to turn off power to prevent sparking from the grid,\" Marshall said.",
      "In a statement a day after the Eaton Fire began, Southern California Edison noted that through the program, power is shut off during dangerous weather conditions, specifically to prevent wildfires.",
      "The utility said its \"distribution lines immediately to the west of Eaton Canyon were de-energized well before the reported start time of the fire.\"",
      "On Sunday, the utility said it filed two electric safety incident reports with the California Public Utilities Commission related to the current wildfires, including one for the Eaton Fire and another for the Hurst Fire, which has burned almost 800 acres in Los Angeles' Sylmar neighborhood.",
      "The reports contain preliminary information and are provided \"within two to four hours after a triggering event.\" They are often submitted before the utility \"can determine whether its electric facilities are associated with an ignition,\" Southern California Edison said.",
      "Additionally, the utility said, it had received evidence preservation notices from counsel representing insurance companies in connection with the fire.",
      "The utility also said a preliminary analysis of electrical circuit information for its four energized transmission lines in the Eaton Canyon area showed there were no interruptions or electrical anomalies in the 12 hours prior to the fire's reported start time through more than one hour after the blaze began.",
      "One of the suits notes that the utility's electrical equipment was responsible for the 2017 Thomas Fire and the 2018 Woolsey Fire, \"both of which destroyed thousands of homes, caused billions of dollars in damage, and displaced thousands of families.\"",
      "Financial analysts at Wells Fargo Securities estimated Monday that the latest Los Angeles County wildfires could amount to insured losses of about $30 billion, with about 85% involving homeowners."

      "Deadly wildfires continue to ravage the Los Angeles area, as firefighters battle windy conditions to contain the out-of-control blazes.",
      "But what does it mean to \u201ccontain\u201d a wildfire?",
      "Containment does not mean that a blaze has been completely extinguished. Rather, it refers to how much of a perimeter has been established around an active fire, preventing it from growing and engulfing more land.",
      "Fire crews aim to suppress a wildfire by creating containment lines around it \u2014 either with roads and highways or natural barriers such as rivers or other waterways \u2014 that are meant to surround the flames and stop them from spreading.",
      "Containment lines can also be constructed, by digging wide trenches around a fire\u2019s flank or by eliminating vegetation and other \u201cfuel\u201d in the immediate area that could ignite.",
      "Fire containment is usually given as a percentage that indicates the extent to which a fire has been hemmed in, according to the Western Fire Chiefs Association, a nonprofit group made up of leaders of fire organizations across western U.S. states and Pacific islands.",
      "Follow live coverage here",
      "The largest of the blazes in the Greater Los Angeles area is the Palisades Fire, which ignited almost a week ago in the Pacific Palisades and Malibu neighborhoods. The blaze has burned more than 23,000 acres and is only 14% contained as of Monday, according to\u00a0the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. That means fire crews have established containment lines around 14% of the perimeter.",
      "Meanwhile, the Eaton Fire, which has burned more than 14,000 acres in Altadena and Pasadena, is 33% contained. The Hurst Fire, which burned almost 800 acres in the Sylmar neighborhood, has been 95% contained, according to Cal Fire.",
      "While containment is a good indicator of how firefighting efforts are progressing, situations can change as wildfires evolve or if environmental conditions improve or deteriorate.",
      "In Southern California, for instance, Santa Ana winds\u00a0are forecast to cause critical fire conditions over the next three days across parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. Dry and windy conditions often help existing fires grow and are favorable for new ignitions to spread rapidly.",
      "Still, fully contained fires can continue to burn for some time. The key strategy, however, is to eliminate the threat of fires jumping the containment lines."

    "summary": "The requests of two prisoners who have taken the unusual step of asking a federal judge to nullify their death row commutations granted by President Joe Biden should be denied because the act of leniency doesn't violate the Constitution, the Justice Department argued Monday in a court filing.",
    "story": [
      "The requests of two prisoners who have taken the unusual step of asking a federal judge to nullify their death row commutations granted by President Joe Biden should be denied because the act of leniency doesn't violate the Constitution, the Justice Department argued Monday in a court filing.",
      "The inmates \u2014 Shannon Agofsky, 53, and Len Davis, 60 \u2014 are being held in a federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, where the U.S. government puts inmates to death. A week after Biden announced he was commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40 prisoners on federal death row to life without the possibility of parole, Agofsky and Davis filed emergency motions seeking an injunction to block the change, arguing it could affect their appeals amid claims of innocence in their initial convictions.",
      "In responding to Davis' request for an injunction, the U.S. government offered three reasons U.S. District Judge James Sweeney should deny it, writing that not only are commutations legal, but also that the president has the authority to decide them and a prisoner has \"no authority to reject\" one.",
      "\"The President's commutation of a sentence 'is the determination of the ultimate authority that the public welfare will be better served by inflicting less than what the judgment fixed,'\" the U.S. attorneys wrote. \"Allowing Davis to veto this action would encroach on this exclusive and ultimate authority that is 'part of the Constitutional scheme.'\"",
      "The Justice Department said Agofsky has failed to identify a \"jurisdictional basis for his petition.\"",
      "In his filing, Agofsky said he is worried that no longer being a death row inmate would strip him of heightened scrutiny in his case or the process in which courts should examine death penalty cases for errors because of the life and-death consequences of the sentence.",
      "Besides requesting an injunction, the men also asked for co-counsel to be assigned to help them in the latest litigation.",
      "Sweeney agreed last week and assigned the inmates representation through the Indiana Federal Community Defenders.",
      "Sweeney noted in an order granting counsel that federal prisoners are entitled to counsel only when they are under death sentences or for evidentiary hearings in their cases.",
      "\"Here, Mr. Agofsky is no longer under a death sentence,\" Sweeney wrote. \"Therefore, whether to appoint counsel is purely a discretionary matter.\"",
      "He added that the court \"harbors serious doubt that it has any power to block a commutation\" but that \"given the novelty of the legal question, the Court prefers to receive counseled briefing on the motion.\"",
      "Sweeney referred to a\u00a01927 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that maintains that a president has the power to grant reprieves and pardons and that \"the convict's consent is not required.\"",
      "Agofsky, however, believes he has the right to refuse a commutation based on wording in the Constitution, which says a president \"shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.\"",
      "According to Agofsky's wife, Laura, he said at issue is the word \"grant,\" which he believes implies a person needs to have made an initial request. In his case, he said, as well as Davis', the men never requested commutations and refused it when asked multiple times to ask for a reduced sentence.",
      "They contend that sets them apart from the other former death row inmates who did seek commutations.",
      "Davis and Agofsky must reply to the Justice Department's response this week.",
      "Agofsky was convicted in the 1989 murder of a bank president, Dan Short, whose body was\u00a0found in an Oklahoma lake. Federal prosecutors said Agofsky and his brother, Joseph Agofsky, abducted and killed Short and made off with $71,000.",
      "Both brothers were given life sentences. But it was while he was incarcerated in a Texas prison that Shannon Agofsky was convicted in the 2001 stomping death of a fellow inmate, Luther Plant, and was sentenced to death in 2004. (Joseph Agofsky\u00a0died in prison\u00a0in 2013.)",
      "Davis, a former New Orleans police officer, was\u00a0convicted in the 1994 murder\u00a0of Kim Groves, who had filed a complaint accusing him of beating a teenager. Prosecutors said Davis hired a drug dealer to kill Groves, and they charged him with violating Groves' civil rights. Davis' original death sentence was thrown out by a federal appeals court but reinstated in 2005.",
      "Davis \"has always maintained his innocence and argued that federal court had no jurisdiction to try him for civil rights offenses,\" he wrote in his filing last month, requesting an injunction for his commutation.",
      "Biden's sweeping clemency action was praised by anti-death penalty groups but also criticized by some of the victims' families, who say they believe death row prisoners are undeserving of such leniency.",
      "Biden declined to grant commutations to three federal death row prisoners who were involved in mass killings or terrorist attacks.",
      "Still, President-elect Donald Trump said after the announcement that he would \"vigorously pursue the death penalty\" during his second term. He has also said he would expand capital punishment on the federal level to include child rapists,\u00a0migrants who kill U.S. citizens\u00a0and law enforcement officers, and those convicted of drug and human trafficking, although how he would do so remains unclear.",
      "Trump's first term ended with 13 federal inmates having been put to death. The Biden administration announced a moratorium on federal executions\u00a0after he took office and said last month that he granted the death row commutations because \"in good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.\""

      "Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai decried the state of women\u2019s rights in Afghanistan as \u201cgender apartheid\u201d on Sunday and urged Muslim leaders to speak out against the Taliban government\u2019s repressive policies on women and girls' education.",
      "\u201cSimply put, the Taliban in Afghanistan do not see women as human beings,\u201d she said, speaking in Islamabad during a summit on advancing girls\u2019 education in Islamic countries, organized by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Muslim World League.",
      "The Pakistani education activist added there was \u201cnothing Islamic\u201d about the government\u2019s policies, which ban teenage girls from going to school beyond the sixth grade and women from attending university.",
      "Yousafzai, 27, also urged the attendees, which included dozens of ministers and scholars from Muslim nations, to \u201copenly challenge and denounce\u201d the Taliban by recognizing gender apartheid as a crime against humanity under international criminal law.",
      "\u201cIn Afghanistan, an entire generation of girls will be robbed of its future,\u201d she said. \u201cAs Muslim leaders, now is the time to raise your voice, use your power.\u201d",
      "Gender expert and Wilson Center Fellow Gaisu Yari told NBC News that \u201cMalala took a bold step by engaging with Muslim leaders, understanding that their influence could have a significant impact when addressing the Taliban.\u201d",
      "Afghan representatives did not attend the summit.",
      "Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid declined to comment, telling NBC News, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to comment on Malala Yousafzai\u2019s remarks about us.\u201d",
      "The Taliban has stated that it will use its own interpretation of Afghan culture and Islamic law, known as Sharia, to guide its policies on women\u2019s rights.",
      "Afghanistan is now the only country in the world that bars women and girls \u2014 nearly 1.5 million Afghans \u2014 from accessing secondary and higher education.",
      "Since it swept back to power in 2021, the Taliban has systematically stripped women and girls of their fundamental rights by passing laws that restrict access to education, work and freedoms of movement and speech.",
      "In December, it banned women from training as midwives and nurses, effectively ending women\u2019s only available access to further education and putting women and children\u2019s lives at risk.",
      "Earlier this month, it passed another order that prevents residential buildings from having windows where women can be seen while at home.",
      "For women, living in Afghanistan is \u201cakin to living in a prison\u201d Yari said.",
      "No foreign government has formally recognized the Taliban due to its restrictive stance on women, while the United Nations has repeatedly denounced the government.",
      "While gender apartheid has not yet been formally codified in international law, women activists, experts and the women\u2019s movement in Afghanistan contend that the Taliban\u2019s rule over the past three years has shown clear characteristics of the practice, Yari said.",
      "Legal experts define gender apartheid as the \u201csystemic, institutionalized discrimination and segregation of individuals based on their gender, designed to maintain male dominance by controlling women.\u201d",
      "In September 2023, the international legal expert and civil society representative Karima Bennoune told the U.N. Security Council that \u201cwhat has been tried since the Taliban returned to power is not working\u201d and urged the U.N. to wield all available measures to induce the Taliban to reverse its course.",
      "She added that codifying the crime into international law would be one of the most effective ways to do so."

      "In the report, Special Counsel David Weiss said that the president could not \"rewrite history,\" suggesting that Biden's criticism of the case against his son when announcing his pardon decision had maligned \"the public servants at the Department of Justice based solely on false accusations.\"",
      "Biden described the prosecution of his son as a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d in the official White House statement announcing the pardon, which prosecutors working for Weiss disputed in a later court filing.",

      "Although Biden lost the legal battle to deliver on his campaign promise of implementing a broad federal student loan forgiveness program, the president said Monday that his administration has still \"forgiven more student loan debt than any other administration in history.\"",
      "The 150,000 new beneficiaries announced Monday include more than 80,000 borrowers who were cheated or defrauded by their schools, over 60,000 borrowers with total and permanent disabilities, and more than 6,000 public service workers, Biden said in the release.",
      "The Biden administration has focused on revising and expanding federal student loan forgiveness programs that existed before Biden took office. That approach allowed the administration to expand loan forgiveness options despite its failure to implement new federal forgiveness programs after the Supreme Court struck-down Biden\u2019s initial plan in 2023.",
      "The Education Department pivoted to pre-existing pathways meant to lift the financial burden of loan repayments on some of the country\u2019s most financially vulnerable borrowers.",
      "Biden on Monday cited improvements to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which allows public servants to have the remainder of their student loan debt cancelled after making a decade\u2019s worth of payments. He also pointed to fixing administrative errors in income-driven repayment programs and expanding the maximum limit for Pell Grant awards, a form of need-based financial aid for low-income students.",
      "Of the 5 million borrowers who have had some or all of their loan debt cancelled over the last four years, 1.4 million spent decades in repayment before being relieved by the income-driven repayment programs, Biden said. Another 1 million were public service workers, like firefighter and teachers; 1.7 million had been victims of higher education fraud; and 663,000 had total or permanent disabilities.",
      "Monday\u2019s announcement came weeks after the Education Department withdrew broad plans to provide loan forgiveness to borrowers experiencing significant financial hardship as Biden approaches the end of his term.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump and congressional conservatives have been highly critical of the administration\u2019s attempts to cancel student loan debt, broadly arguing the costly plans would shift the burden of repayment onto Americans without college degrees and accusing Biden of overstepping his executive power \u2014 a notion the Supreme Court affirmed in ruling the Biden's initial plan was an unlawful exercise of presidential power in 2023.",
      "Both the administration\u2019s first and second attempts at loan forgiveness were legally challenged by multiple conservative-leaning states, with the Supreme Court in August 2024 denying a Biden administration plea\u00a0to lift the nationwide injunction on his forgiveness plan imposed by an appeals court in Missouri.",
      "\u201cSince Day One of my Administration, I promised to ensure higher-education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity,\u201d Biden said in the written statement Monday."

      "Teaching teens to have a healthy relationship with technology and social media is the goal, she argued, not simply keeping them off a mobile device until the school bell rings.",

      "DeSantis said he has personally spoken to the president-elect about the policy ideas, and he and his staff have been briefed on some of the Trump's early immigration-focused proposals.",
      "DeSantis has called the special session for the week of Jan. 27, a week after Trump is sworn in. That allows state legislators time to draft policy changes that complement the Trump administration's immigration policy.",

      "Trump\u2019s transition team has been preparing a series of executive orders for Day One of his administration. While they are expected to focus on wide range of issues, there is almost certainly going to be a heavy focus on immigration, one of his top campaign issues.",

      "Trump has not yet outlined specific changes he will seek by executive order, many of which are likely to face legal challenges, but has publicly focused on the idea of mass deportations and ending birthright citizenship.",
      "DeSantis generally did not delve into specifics on what sort of details his team has received from the incoming administration. He did say that he anticipates that Trump is likely to expand the so-called 287(g) program, which allows U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to delegate to local officials authority to perform some functions generally reserved for federal immigration officials.",
      "\u201cI think what they are going to do with the Trump administration, I think it is going to be a more robust application of 287(g) than we have probably seen,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cThat will be good. Something that I think will make a meaningful difference.\u201d",
      "Under the current program, state and local governments can \u201copt in\u201d to the program, but DeSantis hopes that Florida\u2019s Republican-dominated Legislature will use his special session to make the program mandatory. Any final decision on language would come after Trump issues his executive orders.",
      "\u201cWe are going to say sheriffs and municipalities are going to be part of 287(g),\u201d he said.",
      "The Florida Legislature, which would be responsible for drafting any specific legislation, has not yet filed any proposals, but DeSantis said he wants lawmakers to focus on strengthening the ability to punish local officials who do not follow federal immigration law, expand the ability of local law enforcement to carry out immigration policy and remove remaining \u201clingering incentives\u201d that exist for undocumented immigration to come and stay in Florida.",
      "DeSantis did specifically call out a 2014 law that offers in-state tuition rates to undocumented immigration, a proposal signed into law by Rick Scott, a Republican who at the time was the state\u2019s governor and is now a U.S. senator, and supported by DeSantis\u2019 own lieutenant governor, Jeanette M. Nu\u00f1ez.",
      "\u201cIn-state tuition, that is a benefit you are rewarding someone for being here illegally,\u201d he said.",

      "State Rep. Randy Fine, who is a Trump-endorsed candidate running to replace Rep. Mike Waltz \u2014 whom Trump has picked to serve as his national security adviser \u2014 said he will again file legislation for the special session focused on ending in-state tuition for undocumented students, which costs the state $45 million annually.",
      "\u201cGovernor DeSantis and I have had our differences, but one thing we have both wanted to do for years is end the $45 million in handouts for illegal immigrants that attend our world-renowned colleges and universities,\" said Fine, who backed Trump over DeSantis in the 2024 Republican presidential primary.",
      "Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody \u2014 who is seen as the favorite for DeSantis to appoint to the Senate seat being vacated by Marco Rubio, who is nominated to serve as Trump\u2019s secretary of state \u2014 backed DeSantis\u2019 call for a sweeping immigration bill.",
      "\u201cThank you @GovRonDeSantis for ensuring that the state is prepared to enact @RealDonaldTrump\u2019s immigration priorities on DAY ONE,\u201d she posted on X.",
      "DeSantis has not publicly signaled his pick to fill Rubio\u2019s seat, a move that must come before Trump is sworn in, but he has said that person will be a hard-liner on reforming the so-called H-1B visa program, which has become a subject of much internal fighting among Trump supporters in the wake of his election victory.",
      "Prominent supporters like billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk have said they back the program \u2014 which is a feeder of lower-cost international talent for many companies \u2014 while the more populist, anti-immigration portion of Trump\u2019s base, led by people like conservative pundits Steve Bannon and Laura Loomer, said they want the program abolished.",

    "title": "Dementia risk may be twice as high as Americans live longer, study finds",
    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 18:07:44 GMT",
    "summary": "The risk of developing dementia may be much higher than previously thought, a study published in the journal Nature Medicine has found.",
    "story": [
      "The risk of developing dementia may be much higher than previously thought, a study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine has found.",
      "Older studies estimated that about 14% of men and 23% of women would develop dementia in their lifetimes. The new study puts that estimate higher, at around 42% for both men and women.",
      "\u201cI think this is going to be a very important study, and I think it is going to change the way we look at dementia,\u201d said Dr. Ted Huey, director of the memory and aging program at Butler Hospital in Rhode Island, who wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",
      "More than anything, the increase in both risk and the number of people living with dementia \u2014 which the researchers estimated will double by 2060 \u2014 is the result of people living longer than previous generations, said study leader Dr. Josef Coresh, director of the Optimal Aging Institute at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.",
      "\u201cJust the fact that the population is going to get older will mean the number of dementia cases will double overall,\u201d Coresh said. Among Black Americans, for whom the risk is greater, the number of cases is expected to triple, he said.",
      "About 10% Americans over age 65 have been diagnosed with dementia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 7 million people in the U.S. have Alzheimer's, the most common type of dementia.",
      "The study included more than 15,000 people in the U.S. who were tracked for more than two decades. About one-quarter of the participants were Black and more than half were women \u2014 two groups known to have elevated risk.",
      "According to the study, the average 55-year-old\u2019s risk of dementia during their lifetime is 42%, but the risk was not the same at every age. The brunt of it occurred after a person\u2019s 85th birthday. Between ages 55 and 75, the average person\u2019s risk of developing dementia was 4%, according to the study. By the time someone turned 85, their risk was about 20%. Risk didn\u2019t reach 42% until a person\u2019s 95th birthday.",
      "For Black Americans and women, the risk was higher, but the pattern was similar.",
      "Black Americans had a 7% risk by age 75, nearly double the average. By 85, the risk jumped to 28%, and by 95 it was 42%. For women, this risk was 3% by 75, 21% by 85 and 48% by age 95.",
      "\u201cWe need to think about the causes for this risk and how to prevent it,\u201d Coresh said.",
      "Past research has found elevated risk may be caused by higher rates of diabetes and hypertension in Black Americans, largely due to inequalities regarding access to care, and structural racism that can cause stress, which puts people at higher risk for dementia.",
      "A lot of the elevated risk found in women can be attributed to the fact that, on average, women live longer than men \u2014 but that isn\u2019t the whole story.\u00a0 A genetic variant called APOE-4, which elevates a person\u2019s risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, may raise risk more for women than for men in certain age groups. Research into whether pregnancy has any part in dementia risk has produced mixed results.",
      "Why is dementia risk higher than before?",
      "Prior studies suggested that about 14% of men and 23% of women would develop dementia in their lifetimes. The 42% risk these researchers found is much higher, which may be explained by several factors, experts said.",
      "Previous studies, including the Framingham Heart Study and the Rotterdam Study, both published in the late 1990s, included a less diverse group of participants, all of whom lived in the same city. It\u2019s an issue, experts say, that\u2019s pervasive in dementia research.",
      "Dr. Monica Parker, an associate professor of neurology at Emory University\u2019s Goizueta Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center, sees patients as a primary care provider at Good Samaritan Health Clinic in Atlanta. Many of her patients are immigrants and do not speak English.",
      "\u201cMost of our academic health centers aren\u2019t set up to see non-English-speaking people,\u201d meaning this section of the population is often left out of the research, said Parker, who is also the chair of the Alzheimer\u2019s Foundation of America\u2019s medical, scientific and memory-screening advisory board and has been a paid educational consultant for Eli Lilly, Biogen and Eisai, three companies that make Alzheimer\u2019s drugs.",
      "Other studies may have struggled to keep in touch with participants who developed dementia, said Huey.",
      "The researchers in this study, however, \u201cdid a very good job of following people,\u201d he said.",
      "Finally, a lot of dementia data that exists singles out just one type: Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "\u201cSaying dementia is like saying cancer. You have a lot of subtypes,\u201d said Michelle Mielke, a professor and the chair of epidemiology and prevention at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine in North Carolina.",
      "Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common type of dementia, accounting for as much as 80% of cases, according to CDC data. Research that only tracks Alzheimer\u2019s, however, leaves out dementia caused by other conditions such as cardiovascular and neurological disease, Mielke said.",
      "\u201cAll aging-related diseases are increasing with this aging population, we are seeing increases in stroke, and that is going to be a risk factor for vascular dementia,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes we are a victim of our own success. People are living longer with a lot more comorbidities.\u201d",
      "Those comorbidities, including stroke, high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes, all increase a person\u2019s risk for dementia. It\u2019s also likely more cases that would have previously gone unrecognized are being diagnosed, said Dr. Peter Whitehouse, a professor of neurology at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio.",
      "In 2011, under the Affordable Care Act, Medicare began reimbursing providers for annual wellness visits that include screening for cognitive decline.",
      "\u201cIf more people are coming into a physician\u2019s office, they may be screening more, and more cases will show up,\u201d Whitehouse said.",
      "Although the new data is stark compared to previous numbers, Dr. Andrea Bozoki, division chief of cognitive and behavioral neurology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, said people should remember that not everyone will develop dementia in old age.",
      "\u201cLess than half of people who make it to age 95 will have dementia,\u201d she said. \u201cDementia is not an inevitable part of aging, no matter how old you are.\u201d",
      "While certain factors that increase dementia risk, such as genetics or exposure to air pollution, may be out of a person\u2019s control, the good news is there are plenty of ways to lower dementia risk.",
      "\u201cMaking sure hypertension and diabetes are controlled certainly will help with cognition,\u201d Mielke, of Wake Forest University, said.",
      "Getting quality sleep, which includes treating issues such as sleep apnea, can also lower dementia risk, as can eating a healthy diet. As a rule of thumb, what\u2019s good for the heart is also good for the brain, and vice versa.",
      "\u201cWe know that the vascular risk factor modifications that help your heart also help your brain,\u201d Coresh said."

      "Winter viruses are raging right now, with flu leading the way at extremely high levels in the West, across the Midwest and deep into the Southeast, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Monday.",
      "Flu-related hospitalizations and deaths are on the rise, and experts predict there\u2019s much more to come.",
      "\u201cI feel confident that flu activity is going to be elevated for several more weeks,\u201d said Alicia Budd, head of the CDC\u2019s domestic influenza surveillance team.",
      "The latest report reflects what was happening during the week ending Jan. 4 \u2014 right after the holidays \u2014 and suggests there was a slight dip in flu activity. That\u2019s probably an anomaly, Budd said, because people are less likely to go to the doctor over the holidays and while on vacation.",
      "Flu A strains are currently dominant, especially H3N2 and H1N1. While adults 65 and older are most likely to be hospitalized with the flu, the viruses that are circulating are hitting all age groups.",
      "Seasonal flu tends to spike from December to February. People who become infected tend to get a sore throat, cough, runny nose, headaches, body aches and sometimes fever. Many people describe flu symptoms as feeling like they\u2019ve been hit by a truck.",
      "Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and author of \u201cCrisis Averted: The Hidden Science of Fighting Outbreaks,\u201d suggested it may be another three months before the flu starts to quiet down.",
      "It\u2019s possible that B strains of the flu could spike later in the season, which is why Budd and other infectious disease experts say there\u2019s still time to get a flu shot. Plenty of people remain eligible \u2014 especially children.",
      "As of Dec. 28, just under 42% of kids had had their flu shot this season. This time last year, nearly 45% had received it.",
      "So far this season, 16 children have died from the flu. The CDC does not track adult flu deaths, but estimates that at least 4,700 people overall have died so far this season, with more than 110,000 hospitalizations.",
      "\u201cIf you haven\u2019t gotten vaccinated yet, there\u2019s still time,\u201d Budd said. \u201cIt would be worth it.\u201d",
      "The CDC recommends the annual flu shot for everyone 6 months and older.",
      "The flu vaccine is updated every year to match the latest strain of flu that\u2019s circulating, and, in general, reduces the risk of illness by around 40% and hospitalization by 60%.",
      "Flu mostly spreads by droplets from sneezing, coughing and even talking. It can be transmitted within a week after symptoms begin. It\u2019s most contagious, however, during the first three days of illness.",
      "Avoiding contact with infected people, and regular hand-washing can help reduce the risk of infection. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can also be useful, but hand-washing is preferred, doctors say.",
      "If you do catch the virus, antiviral medications like Tamiflu can help treat the symptoms and hasten recovery. These drugs are especially recommended for people at risk of serious complications, like those with lung disease, heart disease or diabetes.",
      "Antivirals work best when started within one to two days after symptoms begin.",
      "As with all viral illnesses, antibiotics are not effective against the flu, because they target bacteria, not viruses."

      "Ben Stiller and his wife, Christine Taylor, may have separated for several years beginning in 2017, but in Stiller's mind, the couple, who eventually reconciled, were always \"connected\" to each other.",
      "Stiller said in a new interview their time apart allowed him to gain a new sense of appreciation for their relationship after they enjoyed living together with their kids, daughter Ella, 22, and son Quinlin, 19, during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"When we separated, it was just having space to see what our relationship was, what my life felt like when we weren\u2019t in that relationship, how much I loved our family unit,\" the \"Meet the Parents\" franchise star told The New York Times.",
      "\"It was like three or four years that we weren\u2019t together but we always were connected,\" he added.",
      "Stiller always held out hope that he and his wife would reconcile.",
      "\"In my mind, I never didn\u2019t want us to be together,\" he told the publication. \"I don\u2019t know where Christine was, you\u2019d have to ask her, but Covid put us all together in the same house.\"",
      "Stiller recalled that he and Taylor cohabited for nearly a year in the same house before deciding to resume their romance. He added that he was \"grateful\" for the chance to be in a relationship with his wife again, noting that many couples who separate never reunite.",
      "\"There\u2019s nothing like that, when you come back,\" said Stiller. \"You have so much more appreciation for what you have, because we know we could not have it.\"",
      "For her part, Taylor opened up about how she and Stiller rebuilt their relationship during a March 2023 appearance on \u201cThe Drew Barrymore Show.\u201d",
      "She explained that she and Stiller got engaged after knowing each other for just six months. They married in 2000 and welcomed Ella the following year.",
      "\u201cFamily was always a priority, but I think Ben and I both sort of started to grow in different directions,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWhen we made the decision to separate, it was not something we wanted to talk publicly about. It was not something we took lightly, either.\u201d",
      "The couple's separation, she explained, allowed them to explore who they each were as individuals\u00a0while still remaining a \u201cfamily unit\u201d with their kids.",
      "\u201cThat time apart for each of us (was) to sort of get to know who we are. I think we have these growth spurts, even as adults, and I feel like we needed to see time to figure that out.\u201d",
      "When the couple decided to hunker down with their kids during the pandemic, they found they were able to have conversations with each other without \u201cdistractions,\u201d she noted.",
      "\u201cIt was a really special time for us, for the family,\u201d recalled Taylor, adding, \u201cIt just happened organically and naturally.\u201d"

      "Jenna Bush Hager is in go mode. It\u2019s 8:30 a.m. and she\u2019s already worked out, done breath work in the car to Manhattan, gotten her hair and makeup done, and reviewed her notes for the day\u2019s show.",
      "When she first began co-hosting TODAY with Hoda & Jenna in 2019, Hoda Kotb had one piece of advice about the gig\u2019s early hours: \u201cGive yourself a morning.\u201d Now, this disciplined routine is what helps Jenna be\u2026well, Jenna. Once 10 o\u2019clock hits and the cameras begin rolling on TODAY\u2019s fourth hour, Jenna is fully present.",
      "But it\u2019s not 10 o\u2019clock yet, and Jenna already seems exuberant. Walking through Studio 1A in full glam and a one-shouldered green sweater dress, no one is a stranger. She hugs multiple colleagues, takes photos with excited visitors, and graciously accepts several compliments \u2014 because she is quite literally glowing, both inside and out. (She tells a skeptical colleague that she swears by putting Bio Oil on her skin.)",
      "Part of the attention might be because our cameras are snapping away for this photo shoot, but it\u2019s also symbolic. After five years as a co-host of TODAY with Hoda & Jenna, Jenna is stepping into a new era \u2014 and the world is watching.",
      "January 13 kicks off the beginning of Jenna & Friends \u2014 the successor to \u201cHoda & Jenna.\u201d On the latter, it was the crackle of Hoda & Jenna\u2019s genuine chemistry that resonated with audiences who saw themselves reflected in the hosts. And while Jenna feels bittersweet about saying goodbye to Hoda, she says her outlook is clear.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to feel nervous \u2014 which, to be honest, I haven\u2019t been since my first day (at TODAY). I\u2019ve felt nerves here and there, but not real nervousness. Not, \u2018Holy moly, what are we starting?\u2019 And that\u2019s the sign of something super exciting.\u201d",
      "So long to \u2018Hoda & Jenna\u2019",
      "Jenna remembers the day in September 2024 Hoda asked\u00a0to meet in her office; she had something to tell her. When Jenna got there, a candle was burning. There, before the rest of the world knew, Hoda broke the news: She was moving on from TODAY. At age 60, she was ready to spend more time with her young children.",
      "Jenna\u2019s first reaction?",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Wait, you can\u2019t, you can\u2019t go.\u2019 And she said: \u2018...Well, I\u2019m going,\u2019\u201d Jenna says, laughing.",
      "Shocked by the news, Jenna immediately called her parents, former President George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush, in tears.",
      "\u201cI was crying in such a way that they thought something really bad had happened. When they found out that it was just that Hoda was ready to move on to other chapters, they said, \u2018Oh, Jenna, it\u2019s gonna be OK.\u2019 They basically said, \u2018This is your time. Enjoy it. You\u2019re ready for it,\u2019\u201d she says, calling them \u201cso supportive.\u201d",
      "Still, moving on from this \u201cwonderful, wonderful time\u201d has been a journey. Jenna says she has moved through the five stages of grief and has now reached the acceptance that eluded her when she first heard the news.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so proud of Hoda. I think she\u2019s doing exactly what she needs to do at this moment for her.\u201d",
      "For Jenna, this is more than the loss of a co-host, but also the loss of a champion. When Jenna first appeared on TODAY in 2009, she was a 27-year-old grade school teacher in Baltimore who was on the show to promote \u201cAna\u2019s Story,\u201d a book she wrote about the 17-year-old single mother living with HIV/AIDs she had met while working as a UNICEF intern in Latin America.",
      "An executive producer thought Jenna had the right spark for TV \u2014 and Hoda agreed. \u201cI never thought I would\u2019ve hosted an hour. But Hoda saw that in me,\u201d Jenna says, adding that through the years, Hoda helped her push past insecurities."

      "\u201cGomez is critiqued for experiencing the typical challenges of heritage speakers while being held to native speaker standards \u2014 a no-win situation that a rapidly growing number of Americans can relate to,\u201d Abbott wrote in a recent opinion piece for The Fulcrum.",

      "\u201cThe author misses the point completely. This has nothing to do with racism. Selena Gomez should be proud of her Spanish,\u201d the X user wrote. \u201cBut her accent doesn\u2019t match the character that she plays in the movie. And that\u2019s very distracting for viewers who know exactly how Mexicans speak.\u201d",
      "Director Audiard has addressed issues with the actors' varying Spanish accents in the movie.",
      "\u201cThroughout the shoot we had problems, for instance, with Selena\u2019s accent in Spanish. She is Texan. Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n speaks Castilian Spanish. She\u2019s from Madrid,\u201d he told The New York Times in November. \u201cGiven that I don\u2019t speak Spanish, the nuances of the Mexican accent versus the Castilian were lost on me. We had all these problems with accents, but we fixed them in the edit. We did a lot of dubbing.\u201d",
      "Some argue the movie perpetuates harmful trans stereotypes",
      "Some viewers have criticized the movie\u2019s depiction of trans people and the trans experience.",
      "GLAAD, the LGBTQ advocacy group formerly known as the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, called \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\" a \u201cstep backward for trans representation\u201d and said the film \u201crecycles the trans stereotypes, tropes, and clich\u00e9s of the not-so-distant past.\u201d",
      "Some critics say the film perpetuates the harmful narrative that transitioning is a form of lying. Emilia keeps her past a secret from her wife, posing as Manitas' aunt.",
      "\u201cIts protagonist\u2019s transition is seen as duplicitous and dishonest, an act of manipulation through which she continues her selfish attempts to control those that she abandoned,\u201d Mattie Lucas wrote in a November review for Trans | Cendental Cinema.",
      "\u201cNot only is her transition portrayed as more of a disguise to evade the authorities, it\u2019s an act of continued selfishness that ends up destroying not only her own life, but the lives of those she loves,\u201d Lucas added.",
      "Film critic Juan Barquin called the movie \u201ca regressive picture masquerading as progressive\u201d and criticized the way masculinity and femininity were portrayed in the film.",
      "\u201cAny time Emilia \u2018reverts\u2019 to her \u2018old ways,\u2019 Gascon lowers her vocal register as if to equate masculinity with evil and femininity with good,\u201d Barquin wrote for Little White Lies magazine.",
      "Reviewer David Opie echoed this criticism, pointing to a scene when Emilia throws her wife Jessi onto a bed \u201cand threatens her using the same low, masculine voice she used pre-surgery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s as if the so-called 'evil' in Emilia is a separate entity, the 'man' she was raised to be, rather than her being the same person going through a transitional journey,\u201d Opie wrote for Yahoo! Movies.",
      "Several critics and viewers, including Barquin, also took issue with one line from the movie in which Emilia describes herself as \u201chalf male, half female.\u201d",
      "Some transgender commentators shared counterpoints to these arguments and defended the film\u2019s representation of its trans protagonist.",
      "Journalist and critic Mey Rude, who is trans, rejected the argument that Emilia uses a \u201cmale voice\u201d in moments of anger.",
      "\u201cShe simply is a woman with a lower register, and when she gets angry, it shows,\u201d Rude wrote in a piece for Out Magazine. \u201cIf you listen to the scenes where Gasc\u00f3n is playing the character as Manitas, you can clearly hear a difference in the voice she uses in the fight scene with Gomez.\u201d",
      "Rude also argues that the film does not lean into \u201charmful trans tropes about trans women being deceptive or liars.\u201d",
      "\u201cEmilia isn\u2019t a liar because she\u2019s trans, she\u2019s a liar because she\u2019s a bad person and she\u2019s in many ways, afraid,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe movie shows that if you live a lie, whether you\u2019re trans or not, your lies will catch up with you.\u201d",
      "Writer Julie River, who is trans, argues in a piece for Out Front magazine that Emilia is portrayed sensitively as a \u201cmorally complex\u201d character who makes \u201ca desperate attempt to atone for her sins in her former life.\u201d",
      "River also argues that Emilia hides her transition not because the movie is painting trans people as duplicitous, but because as a cartel leader, Emilia \"was hardly surrounded by people who were easy to come out to or who were likely to accept her transition.\u201d",
      "\u201cI may be amongst the minority in the LGBTQ+ community doing this, but I\u2019ll be applauding it for every award it wins,\u201d River wrote.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n herself has pushed back at people calling her \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d character transphobic.",
      "\u201cThere are some that say, \u2018I want to see LGBTQ or trans characters outdoing what people do in real life,\u2019 but we do bad things too ... I don\u2019t understand the criticism about the representation of portraying Emilia P\u00e9rez this way,\u201d she told Vanity Fair in January. \u201cThe reality is that the trans experience is not the same for everybody \u2014 my trans experience is different from somebody else\u2019s.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, go and make your own movie,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n also said. \u201cGo create the representation you want to see for your community.\u201d"

    "summary": "Mike Leigh's \"Hard Truths,\" starring Marianne Jean-Baptiste, is leaving audiences with a lot of questions about its ending. Here's what the star says it means.",
    "story": [
      "If you\u2019re paying attention to this year\u2019s film awards season, you\u2019ve probably heard of Mike Leigh's new British drama called \u201cHard Truths.\u201d",
      "Set in London, the 97-minute film centers on Pansy (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), a woman deeply unhappy with the world and takes it out on everyone around her, including her long-suffering husband Curtley (David Webber), her adult son Moses (Tuwaine Barrett) who lives at home, and even her seemingly happy sister Chantelle (Michele Austin).",
      "\u201cHard Truths\u201d is somewhat of a reunion for director Mike Leigh and Jean-Baptiste who worked together nearly 30 years ago on his Oscar-nominated film \"Secrets & Lies.\" The two also teamed up the following year when he used some of her music in his film \"Career Girls.\"",
      "Similar to his latest film, \"Secrets & Lies\" also centered on Jean-Baptiste, but as an adopted Black woman who traces her family history and discovers her biological mother is white. It also generated much critical-acclaim, including five Oscar nominations.",
      "\"Hard Truths\" appears to be following suit; it has already received early award season buzz \u2014 and accolades. It won a National Board of Review award, and Jean-Baptiste has won awards from critics organizations in New York, San Diego, Toronto, Chicago and Los Angeles.",
      "With the film's release in theaters on Jan. 10, there will be many who see the film who'll likely have a slew of questions as the final credits roll. Namely, happened to Pansy and Curtley and what is the takeaway?",
      "Let\u2019s dive a little deeper, and hear from the film\u2019s star, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, and directer to understand the film's cryptic ending.",
      "Note: Spoilers about the end of \u201cHard Truths\u201d ahead.",
      "What is \u2018Hard Truths\u2019 about?",
      "\u201cHard Truths\u201d is a small independent film that focuses on Pansy, the matriarch of a small family living in London. Pansy is deeply unhappy with the world, and takes it out on everyone around her, including her husband Curtley, son Moses, and sister Chantelle.",
      "As Jean-Baptiste tells TODAY.com, \u201c(Pansy) is somebody who has a lot of anxiety and fear\u2026 She\u2019s someone who doesn\u2019t enjoy life and doesn\u2019t quite understand why, and blames other people for it\u2026. I\u2019ve seen people that are quite similar to her, and observed that way they present in the world.\u201d",
      "But, as viewers soon learn, Pansy's temperament isn't solely based on her interactions with others; her frustration also comes from unresolved grief. There's an important scene in the film where Pansy and Chantelle go to their mother's gravesite; Pansy is abrasive and dismissive at first, but the sisters end up talking about their mother, Pearl's, death.",
      "\"Your memory of Pearl is not the same as mine,\" insists Pansy. She is resentful that she had to be the one who found their mother \"lying stiff in the bed\" with her eyes still open, \"Accusing. Disappointed.\"",
      "One of the film's critical moment comes when Pansy reveals that she thinks everyone hates her, to which Chantelle responds that she loves her \"but I don't understand you.\"",
      "Pansy\u2019s revelation helps shed insight on her complicated relationship with the world, and how she\u2019s surrounded herself with people she can barely stand. Chantelle offers Pansy an opportunity for respite amid her suffering: she tells her to simply walk away. But Pansy doesn't seem ready to do that.",
      "Leigh said he used locations, like Pansy's house, as way to highlight and reflect her inner mental health struggles.",
      "\"The choice of locations is critical... In this film, most obviously, you can see that Pansy\u2019s house is a function of her paranoia, her fear of stuff and things and plants and insects and all the rest of it, whereas (her sister) Chantal\u2019s flat is a celebration of color and light and plants and joy,\" he told Film Comment in Oct. 2024. \"For me, that\u2019s what it\u2019s always been about.\u00a0\"",
      "What happens at the end of \u2018Hard Truths\u2019?",
      "Don\u2019t expect some big twist or denouement at the end of the film. It seems to just \u2026 end. But \u201cHard Truths\u201d isn\u2019t a movie that\u2019s going to give easy answers or wrap things in a bow.",
      "The last twenty minutes or so of \u201cHard Truths\u201d stops being about Pansy taking everything out on the world, and becomes a bit more of the world reacting to her. Following a series of increasingly tense moments \u2014 a meltdown at her Mother\u2019s Day gathering, throwing her husband's clothes out of their bedroom, calling him \u201cdisgusting\u201d \u2014 Curtley is injured while at work.",
      "His co-worker brings him home and tells Pansy what\u2019s going on, but she doesn\u2019t appear to want to leave the bedroom after being woken up \u2014 instead she quietly sits in a chair by the bed.",
      "The final scenes are close-ups of Curtley, a single tear running down his face as he waits for his wife to come down and comfort him; and Pansy, also in a close-up, her expression almost unreadable. She\u2019s not happy or sad. She lets out a small breath. And then the film ends.",
      "So what does the ending of \u2018Hard Truths\u2019 mean?",
      "Leigh is not going to do your homework for you. He\u2019s been open about working with a very loose script, and has said his actors do a certain amount of improvisation.",
      "\"For me, every film is a learning curve. And the great thing about being able to work, in this particular case, with actors with this particular background, is they\u2019re able to come up with what this character would say,\" Leigh said during a tastemakers screening attending by TODAY.com. \"I'm there to learn from and to take from (them). And if you like to put it more crudely, to exploit their experience, their knowledge and understanding.\"",
      "Jean-Baptiste also shared her thoughts on the significance of the ending, telling TODAY.com that they \"leave it to the audience\" to figure out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s intentional on Mike Leigh\u2019s part (to keep things ambiguous). As far as I was concerned, I didn\u2019t know it was the ending when we were doing that scene, because you don\u2019t know what the film\u2019s about or what\u2019s happening. You don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s going to film stuff after that,\u201d she says.",
      "In fact, the first time she saw the ending was when she saw the completed film. As Jean-Baptiste explains, until the end of the film you\u2019ve been watching a woman who \u201cis unable to help themselves.\u201d So when she has an injured husband downstairs, \u201cHow is she going to help anyone else? And that\u2019s as much as I can give you. The rest is for the audience to take in, to argue about with their friends and come up with whatever ending they want to put on it.\u201d",
      "What did you think of the ending of \u201cHard Truths\u201d?",
      "\u201cHard Truths,\u201d a Bleecker Street film, in now available in theaters."

      "The \u201cSVU\u201d star has portrayed Olivia Benson on the NBC drama since it premiered in 1999. Before her character\u2019s ascent from detective to captain, she spent many years fighting crime alongside her beloved partner, Detective Elliot Stabler, who\u2019s portrayed by Christopher Meloni.",
      "\u201cChris and I are polar opposites in terms of who we are as people. I mean, you can\u2019t get two people who are more different,\u201d she said during a Sunday Sitdown with Sunday TODAY host Willie Geist that aired Jan. 12. \u201cAnd yet,\u201d she continued, clapping her hands, \u201cthere was this yin-yang. We just fit, and so everyone had talked about that very early on. So that wasn\u2019t a surprise, because we knew it.\u201d",
      "Mariska Hargitay\u2019s \u2018Law & Order: SVU\u2019 audition in 1999",

      "Wolf is the creator of the \u201cLaw & Order\u201d franchise, and Hargitay describes him as \u201ca visionary,\u201d as well as her friend and equal.",
      "Hargitay\u2019s connection to Wolf stems back to the late \u201890s when she auditioned to play Olivia Benson not long after wrapping up a recurring role on \u201cER.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was very funny,\u201d she explained to Willie. \u201cI walked in there and because after \u2018ER\u2019 I said, \u2018What am I \u2014 what am I going to do? This is the greatest show ever. There\u2019s no other show. Oh, except for \u201cLaw & Order,\u201d\u2019 I said to myself. And I was making jokes, \u2018I need to get on that \u201cLaw & Order.\u201d\u2019\u201d",
      "She said Wolf gave her \u201ca couple of notes,\u201d and she later returned for another meeting with him, but this time, she saw a \u201cstunning girl in the waiting room.\u201d",

I am Olivia Benson.\u2019 And (Wolf) was sort of laughing, I could tell, and I was like, \u2018No, no, you don\u2019t understand.\u2019\u201d",

      "Hargitay explained that during one of her callbacks, three sets of actors and actresses were paired up.",
      "\u201cIn the room, when he walked in, I sort of sized him up, and I said, \u2018That\u2019s the guy,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201c\u2019That\u2019s the guy. That is the guy. That is the guy.\u2019 It was so obvious to me that that was the guy, and apparently, he felt the same way.\u201d",

It\u2019s chemistry, right? And, we were just always very important people in each other\u2019s lives, and we knew it. We knew it from Minute 1. And we\u2019re still very close, very close.\u201d",

      "The 26th season of \u201cLaw & Order: SVU\u201d premiered in October 2024. Hargitay knew around the show\u2019s second or third season in the early 2000s that it \u201chad something\u201d and was destined to be successful, thanks to her bond with Meloni.",
      "\u201cWell, I knew quickly that we had this kind of magical chemistry. I knew that, because I felt it, and we were so close so fast,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd again, it\u2019s that thing we talked about, of that thing that happens with somebody where you\u2019re like, \u2018We are so different, and I know you, and I get it, all of it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Earlier in her conversation with Willie, Hargitay also said she believes Wolf \u201crespects his audience with intelligent writing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that we\u2019re all fascinated between the complexities of the human condition, good vs. evil, justice. It\u2019s something we need. We need it,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe has a legacy that I think will never be challenged, because he understands that part, and yet he\u2019s such a businessman.\u201d",
      "Hargitay also credits the dynamics of Benson and Stabler\u2019s characters as part of the show\u2019s \u201cgenius.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that the genius of the conception of my show was the architecture of the angry, protective father and the nurturing, loving, empathetic mother, right, between us,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIt was a perfect balance,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou want him to fight and protect you, and you want me to hold you, to hold a space for those most tender feelings after we\u2019ve been violated. And you want, as we all want, to be seen. Probably one of the most important things, I think, in the human condition, that we all want to be seen.\u201d"

      "It \u201cremains a very challenging, often very contentious and in a long-term way deeply competitive relationship,\u201d Ambassador Nicholas Burns told NBC News in an interview this week. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t get around that. We\u2019re rivals for global power.\u201d",
      "Still, the world\u2019s two biggest economies have learned that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to talk to each other,\u201d Burns said, adding that \u201cthere are times when we have to work with China because it\u2019s in the American national interest.\u201d",
      "China is increasingly challenging the U.S.-led international order that has been in place since the end of World War II, working to various degrees with Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "The two countries have profound differences on issues such as trade, technology, the status of Taiwan and human rights, and blame each other for cyberattacks and the deadly U.S. fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s been unduly provocative in the Taiwan Strait with its military maneuvers,\u201d Burns said, adding that Beijing \u201chas made a major mistake and continues with that mistake in helping Russia to prosecute its illegal and barbaric war against Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Beijing denies that it is aiding the Russian war machine or carrying out cyberattacks on the U.S. that Burns said are \u201con a scale of lethality that is unprecedented.\u201d",
      "Burns is winding down his job after nearly three years of managing the day-to-day tensions of what is often described as the world\u2019s most important bilateral relationship and navigating some of its lowest points in decades.",
      "If Beijing wants to maintain the newfound stability in ties, \u201cI think the onus is on the government here in China to make that happen,\u201d Burns said.",
      "One thing the Chinese government can do, he said, is lift its sanctions on Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., if he is confirmed as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state. Rubio and other U.S. lawmakers were sanctioned in 2020 over their criticism of authorities\u2019 crackdown on dissent in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cThey have to talk to the American secretary of state,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Burns declined to comment directly on how the incoming Trump administration might manage the U.S.-China relationship, though he said he had been in touch with former Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., whom Trump has said he will nominate as his China ambassador.",
      "Trump has advocated a tougher approach toward the country than the Biden administration.",
      "In what may be indirect advice to Trump and his Cabinet appointees, Burns emphasized the importance of talking with China as well as maintaining regional alliances the Biden administration has fortified in order to counter China\u2019s influence, the future of which is uncertain as Trump begins a second term.",
      "\u201cWe have got to keep our allies close to us,\u201d Burns said, pointing to South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and India.",
      "Working with allies \u201cmultiplies and expands American power in trying to deter some of these really pernicious actions\u201d by China, Russia and others, Burns said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one way to compete with China effectively, to win part of the competition for power, but also to keep the peace with China,\u201d he said.",
      "Slowly thawing ties",
      "In-person diplomacy was disrupted during the Covid-19 pandemic, which kept China\u2019s borders closed for three years. During this time, the previous Trump administration ratcheted up criticism of Beijing\u2019s handling of the outbreak, which began in China.",
      "When Burns arrived in Beijing in March 2022 to take up his post, he spent most of the first month of his job in quarantine at the ambassador\u2019s residence, unable to meet anybody even as the relationship he was tasked with steering was heading to new lows.",
      "At the same time, Chinese nationalism and anti-Western sentiment surged across state media and online platforms here, and the people-to-people exchanges that Burns likes to call the \u201cballast\u201d of the relationship have never really recovered.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has the tightest grip on power here since Mao Zedong, and has carried out an internal campaign against corruption that, during Burns\u2019 term alone, saw a foreign minister and two defense ministers expelled from their positions and the public eye. The heightened scrutiny has made some Chinese officials, academics and average citizens more reluctant to engage with foreigners.",
      "Relations hit their lowest point in decades in August 2022, when Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House speaker at the time, visited the Beijing-claimed island of Taiwan over China\u2019s objections. They sank even lower in early 2023, when the American military shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that had been spotted over the continental United States.",
      "\u201cIt took us a while to dig out of that,\u201d Burns said. Since then, both sides have moved to stabilize ties.",
      "China has only recently resumed direct military and other communications that were cut off in protest over Pelosi\u2019s visit. The head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command has since had two meetings with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s significant because we\u2019re trying to drive down the probability or the chance of any kind of accident or misunderstanding between our military forces,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Another example of improved cooperation, he said, is in addressing the U.S. fentanyl crisis, one of the areas where Biden and Xi agreed to cooperate at a summit in California in November 2023. Many of the precursor chemicals used to make the deadly opioid originate in China before being processed into fentanyl in Mexico and other countries, then smuggled into the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe have begun to see action from the government of China,\u201d Burns said, including 300 arrests, the shutdown of online sales of illicit chemicals and the scheduling of 55 synthetic opioids and precursor chemicals as prohibited for export.",
      "Burns pointed to other successes in the Biden administration, including the release of four Americans who had been detained in China for years: David Lin in September, and Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung in November.",
      "\u201cTo meet them at the airport, to give them their passports, to tell them that they were free people again was an extraordinary moment, certainly for me as the American ambassador,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Though all Americans the State Department considered wrongfully detained by China have been released, hundreds of others remain imprisoned on various charges, more than in any other foreign country. They continue to receive consular assistance.",
      "In the interest of keeping the lines of communication open, Burns urged members of Congress from both parties to make greater efforts to visit China.",
      "\u201cI have hawkish views on the relationship between China and the United States. Many members of Congress do, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to be here to understand the adversary and to talk to the adversary and to know the reality on the ground.\u201d",

      "In September 2023, the international legal expert and civil society representative Karima Bennoune told the U.N. Security Council that \u201cwhat has been tried since the Taliban returned to power is not working\u201d and urged the U.N. to wield all available measures to induce the Taliban to reverse its course.",

The authorizations have largely been used to justify the use of military force against those who aided the 2001 attack and \u201cthe continuing threat posed by Iraq.\u201d",

      "Trump\u2019s incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News last week that Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland is about \u201cthe Arctic.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have Russia that is trying to become king of the Arctic with 60-plus icebreakers, some of them nuclear-powered,\u201d Waltz said.",
      "During an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Vice President-elect JD Vance said America does not need to use military force to secure Greenland but that the U.S. needs to make sure that Greenland is \u201cproperly cared for from an American security perspective.\u201d",

      "\u201cThat was a very important piece for me. Obviously, she voted against 702 authority. ... But when she came out and said, \u2018Hey, this is something I\u2019m going to stand for,\u2019 that\u2019s part of the role of the Office of National Intelligence, is to make sure we\u2019re actually watching for people to come attack us and stopping them before they do,\u201d Lankford said."
