      "Director Francis Ford Coppola, actor Viola Davis, director Paul Feig and actor George Takei are among those paying tribute to Gene Hackman after his death at age 95. Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa and their dog were found dead in their New Mexico home, authorities said Thursday.",
      "\u201cThe loss of a great artist, always cause for both mourning and celebration: Gene Hackman a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity, I mourn his loss, and celebrate his existence and contribution.\u201d \u2014 Francis Ford Coppola on Instagram.",
      "\u201cWe have lost a true legend. The magnificent Gene Hackman has passed away. A man whose breath of talent was immeasurable. Growing up on his movies was an absolute thrill for me. To observe his remarkable facility and humanity in every role was something to behold. Whatever film he was in, he made it better. A force of nature like no other and as such there will never be another like him.\u201d \u2014 actor Cary Elwes.",
      "\u201cHe was a tough nut, Gene Hackman, but he was really good and he was really difficult. Like, we can say it now, but he was a tough guy because older, great actors do not give young directors much of a chance. They're really rough on \u2019em.\u201d \u2014 actor Bill Murray, recalling working with Hackman on \u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums\u201d with director Wes Anderson, in an interview.",

      "\u201cSo awful. Gene was such an inspiration to so many of us who love movies. So many brilliant roles. His performance in \u2018The Conversation\u2019 alone changed the way I looked at acting and what actors could bring to a role. Such an amazing career. RIP Mr. Hackman.\u201d \u2014 director Paul Feig on X.",

      "Marcelo Rubens Paiva, a popular author in Brazil for four decades, has had intense days and exchanges since the movie based on his 2015 book \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d became a box-office success",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian author Marcelo Rubens Paiva happily swung his wheelchair from side to side, dancing with thousands of Carnival revelers there to celebrate him and his work. Seconds later, an unidentified man showed Paiva his middle finger, then threw a beer can and a backpack that hit him in the head.",
      "Paiva, a popular author in Brazil for four decades, has had intense days and exchanges since the movie based on his 2015 book \u201cI'm Still Here\u201d became a box-office success. The film, a rare blockbuster in the South American nation, garnered three Oscar nominations ahead of the awards ceremony Sunday.",
      "While millions of Brazilians love the story for its long-overdue truth-telling about the country\u2019s 1964-1985 military dictatorship, others see it as left-wing propaganda. Paiva has been dismayed at the outpouring of hatred, mostly online, directed at him.",
      "\u201cIt is simply (our) history being told in the way we believe it must be told, the way our family lived it, so it never happens again,\u201d Paiva, 65, told The Associated Press in his Sao Paulo apartment. \u201cI assure you that some of those on the far-right or on the right have watched it and maybe changed their opinion.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d is up for best picture and best international feature, while Fernanda Torres, who portrayed Paiva's mother Eunice, is competing for best actress. The film centers on the disappearance of Rubens Paiva, the author's father, and Eunice's decadeslong quest to force authorities to confirm his death.",
      "Paiva, one of five siblings, has known success, but not as much controversy. His 1982 book \u201cHappy Old Year\u201d narrating his life before and after a diving accident put him in a wheelchair, sold more than 1.5 million copies. He is also an award-winning playwright, former TV talk show host and political activist.",
      "But he says nothing prepared him for the sudden impact \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d had since it won best screenplay at the Venice Film Festival. Many other awards followed since.",
      "\u201cThis is very different; it is more intense because of social networks,\" Paiva said. \u201cPeople (around the world) react in the same way to this movie, with the same emotion that Brazilians felt.\u201d",
      "After his book about his accident, he knew he still had another important story to tell.",
      "\u201cI was the son of a disappeared politician; few people knew what had happened during the dictatorship,\u201d he said.",
      "That was largely because Congress passed an amnesty law in 1979, as the dictatorship neared its end, sparing perpetrators of political crimes from prosecution.",
      "Cracks started to emerge in 2011 after then President Dilma Rousseff \u2014 a former guerrilla who was tortured during the dictatorship \u2014 established a national truth commission to investigate its abuses. It was one of the seeds for Paiva's book and, later, the film.",
      "\u201cPeople were asking for reparations for families of missing politicians, they sued my father\u2019s torturers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe military showed they were upset, because their colleagues and their fellow coup mongers were under fire. The accusations were being published, so they started to threaten Brazil\u2019s democracy. And little by little it was once again in doubt.\u201d",
      "Past ire toward the Paiva family has notably come from one man: Jair Bolsonaro, the former army captain who rode a wave of anti-establishment populism to his presidency (2019-2022).",
      "In 2014, then-lawmaker Bolsonaro spat on a statue of the late Paiva in Congress, accusing him and his family of being at the service of communist terrorists. His claims date to the 1990s and falsely link a farm the Paiva family owned, near where Bolsonaro grew up, to a guerrilla group.",
      "\u201cEvery year, he made a speech against my father, making up stories,\u201d Paiva said. \u201cOnce, he said my father had been killed by his comrades who were in the armed struggle, because he had revealed things during the torture sessions. It was the first time I heard anyone tell such an absurd story, with no evidence, and people believed it. It was the first time I saw the power of social media in creating a new narrative, a lie.\"",
      "Bolsonaro said in an interview Monday he hasn't seen the film, but his allies have railed against it, saying Paiva died in a war, as did many on both sides. Brazil\u2019s Truth Commission found that at least 434 people died at the hands of the military regime, including 136 who disappeared.",
      "Paiva published \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d as Alzheimer\u2019s disease washed away his mother\u2019s memory. Director Walter Salles bought the rights in 2017, but chose not to make the film during Bolsonaro's presidency. Last week, Brazil's prosecutor-general indicted Bolsonaro for allegedly staging a coup to remain in power. It included inciting a riot in capital Brasilia by encouraging his supporters to riot marking an echo of the Capitol insurrection in the U.S.",
      "\u201cPeople everywhere are afraid of watching their democracies become dictatorships,\" Paiva said. \"This movie glorifies democracy and the understanding that human rights, empathy are in short supply.\u201d",
      "Adding to Paiva's recent achievements since the film premiered, his father\u2019s death certificate, first obtained by his mother in 1996, was updated in January to go beyond mere confirmation to include: \u201cviolent death caused by the Brazilian State in the context of systematic persecution to the population identified as dissidents of the policies of the dictatorial regime installed in 1964.\u201d",
      "Brazil's Supreme Court said earlier this week it will rule whether the sole survivor among Rubens Paiva\u2019s torturers, Gen. Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f4nio Nogueira Belham, can be tried. Brazilian human rights activists have argued that concealing bodies is a continuous crime not covered by the country\u2019s amnesty law.",
      "\u201cI see literature as a mission, and I feel mine was accomplished,\" said Paiva. \u201cThe movie\u2019s mission is accomplished, even if it doesn\u2019t win any Oscars.\u201d",

      "A routine deep-sea diving mission in the North Sea goes terribly wrong when a young diver is stranded some 300 feet below the surface in the new film \u201cLast Breath.\u201d His umbilical cable has severed. The support vessel above is aimlessly drifting away from the site through violent, stormy waters. And the diver has only ten minutes of oxygen in his backup tank.",
      "As if that wasn\u2019t enough, it\u2019s also a true story.",
      "If merely reading this is giving you heart palpitations already, you can only imagine the white-knuckle experience of watching this all play out on the big screen. It\u2019s 40ish minutes of pure suspense and anxiety as the story shuffles between the man at the bottom of the ocean, Chris Lemons (Finn Cole), his fellow saturation divers (Woody Harrelson as Duncan and Simu Liu as Dave) in the diving bell below the waters who are unable to help and the crew in the support vessel above (including Cliff Curtis and Mark Bonnar) scrambling to get their systems back online and operational as the clock rapidly runs out. Ten minutes has never felt so short \u2014 and then it just gets worse as the clock starts counting up, showing Chris\u2019s time without oxygen.",
      "At one point, Liu\u2019s character Dave, a no-nonsense, all-business diver says matter-of-factly at that it\u2019s a body recovery, not a rescue. Deep-sea saturation diving is a dangerous business, described at the start of the film as the most dangerous job on earth. Chris tells his fianc\u00e9, in a short introduction, that it\u2019s no more dangerous than going to space. She replies that it\u2019s funny that he thinks that is comforting.",
      "The real incident happened in September 2012 \u2014 Dave, Duncan and Chris were just one team of divers sent to the ocean floor off the coast of Aberdeen, Scotland, to repair oil pipeline.",
      "The seas were particularly rough that day, with winds up to 35 knots, common for the North Sea but also not what one might call safe. Chris and Dave were in the middle of their work when they heard the urgent calls to abort: The dynamic positioning system in the support vessel above had failed and they were in drift. Chris scrambled to maneuver out of the pipeline corridors, but his umbilical got caught. For a brief, awful moment he\u2019s the anchor to the ship above, but soon enough the cord snapped, and he was thrown back to the ocean floor in pitch black with no coms, no heat and very little hope for survival. News articles about the incident clock his backup oxygen supply as being closer to five or six minutes \u2013 perhaps the movie wanted to give the audience a little buffer.",
      "If this sounds at all familiar, it may be because it was made into a documentary, also called \u201cLast Breath\u201d and released in 2019. While it was well-received, some true stories are just too gripping to exist solely in that form. It\u2019s not exactly a surprise that a narrative film was made as well. There\u2019s a good track record of recent complimentary adaptations \u2014 think Ron Howard\u2019s \u201c13 Lives\u201d and \u201cThe Rescue\u201d about the Thai boys soccer team stuck in the cave.",
      "This one was made by Alex Parkinson, the same director who co-directed the doc, and it\u2019s a well-executed narrative interpretation that doesn\u2019t get in its own way with padding. Harrelson gets to be the wise mentor who really doesn\u2019t want to lose someone on his last mission. Liu gets to flex his action muscles (literally and figuratively) in a modest but solid role. And they don't go out of their way to shoehorn in a villain \u2014 this is just a group of people trying their best to save a life.",
      "The only real problem, if one can even call it that, is that it\u2019s so short. The film doesn\u2019t take liberties with stretching out the timeline much at all and after 93 minutes, the whole thing is over. It feels strange to want a movie to be longer, but in the case of \u201cLast Breath\u201d I was both desperate for it to end, for anxiety reasons, and also wanting more.",
      "\u201cLast Breath,\u201d a Focus Features release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 Motion Picture Association for \u201cbrief strong language.\u201d Running time: 93 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "HOUSTON -- Takashi Murakami\u2019s artwork has graced luxury goods from top fashion houses and album covers of superstar musicians.",
      "Now the famed contemporary Japanese artist has teamed with Major League Baseball for an exclusive merchandise collaboration to celebrate next month\u2019s Tokyo Series.",
      "The Takashi Murakami x MLB Tokyo Series collection presented by Complex was announced Thursday and launches March 7 in advance of the series between the Dodgers and Cubs that opens the MLB season at the Tokyo Dome on March 18-19.",
      "\u201cI think this new collection builds upon the historical friendship between Japan and the United States,\u201d Murakami said. \u201cI feel lucky to be able to work alongside Complex, MLB and highlight Shohei Ohtani, an outstanding athlete who has emerged from Japan and made a name for himself on the global stage. This is something I am overwhelmed with gratitude to be a part of.\u201d",
      "Murakami, initially known for paintings and sculptures, saw his popularity explode when he paired with Louis Vuitton in 2002 for a line of bags featuring his artwork. The bags, which featured his iconic flower motifs and quirky characters in bright colors, quickly became some of the brand\u2019s most coveted items.",
      "Often referred to as the Andy Warhol of Japan, he created the cover art for several hip hop and rap albums, most notably Kanye West\u2019s hit 2007 album \u201cGraduation.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis collaboration with a world-renowned artist in Takashi Murakami is one of the special projects that continue our commitment to growing Major League Baseball\u2019s presence in Japan through key marketing initiatives,\u201d MLB chief marketing officer Uzma Rawn Dowler told The Associated Press. \u201cIt allows us to engage existing baseball fans while also extending our reach to new, casual fans and making an impact outside the ballpark. Working with a Japanese artist of Takashi Murakami\u2019s caliber also allows us to celebrate Japan\u2019s deep connection to baseball while showcasing baseball fashion as a powerful form of cultural storytelling.\u201d",
      "The apparel collection of Dodgers and Cubs products will include Nike T-shirts, hoodies and jerseys featuring Murakami\u2019s flower motifs. These jerseys will only be made for a handful of stars from both teams. For the Dodgers, they\u2019ll be available for two-way star Ohtani, fellow Japanese pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, shortstop Mookie Betts and first baseman Freddie Freeman. The Cubs\u2019 jerseys will be available for Japanese pitcher Shota Imanaga, outfielder Seiya Suzuki, who is also Japanese, and shortstop Dansby Swanson.",
      "The line also features Murakami flower-adorned New Era knits and adjustable caps, Rawlings baseballs and gloves and Victus bats, all decorated with the artist\u2019s eye-catching creations.",
      "Two limited-edition slides from Marakami\u2019s Ohana Hatake footwear brand will also be available with each team\u2019s logo and his flower motif.",
      "Also included in the collaboration is a Topps X Murakami MLB Tokyo Series Matchup Set of 25 cards which features his artwork and star players from both teams. Select card sets will include autographs, highlighted by a 1-of-1 dual autograph card of Murakami and Ohtani.",
      "\u201cComplex is proud to bring together Takashi Murakami and two of the biggest teams in MLB to celebrate this historic sports moment in Tokyo,\u201d Complex CEO Aaron Levant said. \u201cThis once-in-a-lifetime collaboration merges Murakami\u2019s unmistakable artistry with the global energy of baseball, capturing the essence of the city and the deep cultural connection between art and sport.\u201d",
      "The series marks the 25th anniversary of the Mets and Cubs playing MLB\u2019s first regular-season games in Japan and will be the sixth time the opener has taken place in the country.",
      "The entire collection will be available on Complex.com, Fanatics.com and MLBShop.com on March 7. Select products will be available at the Tokyo Series and at Dodger Stadium, Wrigley Field and the MLB Flagship Store in New York City.",
      "Fans interested in the collection can attend immersive pop-up events featuring the collaboration with Murakami-inspired installations in Los Angeles and Tokyo leading up to the Tokyo Series.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014  \u201cI\u2019m Just Ken\u201d is a hard act to follow.",
      "Last year\u2019s Oscars was by all accounts a successful show, with memorable performances and unscripted moments (thanks in part to Emma Stone\u2019s dress), and a winning movie that most people had seen. But the team behind last year\u2019s show is \u201caiming for the stars\u201d once more.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re feeling the pressure,\u201d said Oscars executive producer and showrunner Raj Kapoor. \u201cBut we\u2019re not ones to rest on our laurels. We always want to push the envelope.\u201d",
      "With just days to go until the three-and-a-half hour live broadcast, airing on ABC and streaming live on Hulu Sunday, March 2, the team behind the show gave The Associated Press a little insight into what to expect.",
      "\u201cWe want people when they watch the Oscars to be inspired by the films but also be inspired by the broadcast and feel something like it\u2019s a show that you can watch with your friends and your family and debate on who should have won and who is winning,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cWe want people to have all the feels when they watch the show.\u201d",
      "One of the major things that the producers are excited about this year is their first-time host, Conan O\u2019Brien.",
      "\u201cThat alone brings this fresh, invigorated energy,\u201d Kapoor said. O\u2019Brien, he said, has been a \u201cwealth of ideas and imagination\u201d since he accepted the gig and that he and his team are going to keep writing up until the show \u2014 and as a veteran of live television, he's skilled at in-the-moment improvisation as well.",
      "\u201cHe is going to be this great, exciting, warm hug and guide us through the night,\u201d said Oscars executive producer Katy Mullan. \u201cHe\u2019s got some surprises up his sleeve, which is fantastic because we love to keep people guessing.\u201d",
      "The Oscars this year decided to nix performances of the original songs, but there will still be some big names gracing the stage including \u201cWicked\u201d stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo \u2014 though they\u2019re staying mum on whether any gravity will be defied in that performance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking for months,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a moment that\u2019s been very special.\u201d",
      "Lisa of Blackpink and Doja Cat will also be part of the broadcast, and the producers promised a musical moment that will honor Los Angeles and filmmaking in Hollywood.",
      "The wildfires, Mullan said, will be acknowledged in the show.",
      "\u201cThe Grammys did an incredible job with their show and how it was treated,\u201d Mullan said. \u201cOur show being a month after that and Conan having been affected himself, we\u2019re just looking at the right way to calibrate it so that it feels like the right show for March 2 \u2014 that we do acknowledge it and reflect on it but also allow people the chance to step on that stage and have their moment and celebrate their talent.\"",
      "Last year the Oscars made a moment out of what is usually just a list of names by inviting past Oscar acting winners to speak about each of the nominees before the winner was read. This year it's back, but evolved. It won\u2019t be the actors this time, but some of the other categories that \u201cmaybe don\u2019t normally get the spotlight on the Oscar stage,\u201d Mullan said.",
      "She added: \u201cOur theme is all about collaboration and the alchemy of filmmaking and really taking a look behind the scenes and understanding a bit more of the interconnectedness of how a film comes together.\u201d",
      "First, Mullan said, it\u2019s only Wednesday \u2014 there\u2019s still time to catch the diverse group of 10 best picture nominees before Sunday if you really try. But don\u2019t fret if you\u2019ve only seen a few. The show could be a discovery event.",
      "\u201cIf you love the movies, like come to the Oscars and maybe you\u2019ll discover things that you actually have not seen yet but will want to,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cHopefully you\u2019ll fall in love even with a few pictures while watching the show.\u201d",
      "Also? It's just full of major stars.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got some reunions that I think will hit people in the heart,\" Mullan said.",

      "A new album documents jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald in concert in Oakland, California, in 1967",
      "The setting is less grand than suggested by the title of a new Ella Fitzgerald album, \u201cThe Moment of Truth: Ella at the Coliseum.\u201d In this case, the coliseum is not in Rome or Los Angeles, but the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena in Oakland, California.",
      "Jazz giant Fitzgerald\u2019s presence elevated any event, however, and that was the case on June 30, 1967, when she performed at a concert that also included The Duke Ellington Orchestra and other luminaries.",
      "\u201cThe Moment of Truth\u201d documents Fitzgerald\u2019s set, and her incomparable alto is in typically fine form. She bounces and glides, blares and coos, bellows and whoops and scats and swings to the audience\u2019s delight. \u201cIf you love her, clap!\u201d someone shouts.",
      "The album, which will be released Friday, features performances of nine songs unearthed from the private tape collection of Verve Records founder Norman Granz. The vinyl release offers outstanding sound quality and extensive, informative liner notes by the critic Will Friedwald. He notes that while it was unusual for Fitzgerald to sing contemporary pop tunes, the set includes her only known performance of two classics from the mid-1960s \u2014 the Burt Bacharach and Hal David penned \"Alfie\u201d and Bob Crewe's \u201cMusic to Watch Girls By.\u201d",
      "Fitzgerald is accompanied by a piano trio, and on several songs by the Ellington orchestra, with whom she had a lengthy 1960s collaboration. Ellington doesn\u2019t play, however, and the understated arrangements leave the spotlight entirely to Fitzgerald. She\u2019s in a playful mood in her on stage banter, teasing a late arrival, impersonating Louis Armstrong, and ruling out a striptease.",
      "Her singing is radiant as she turns sophisticated melodies into a thrill ride. Their direction is as unpredictable as a pinball, with rhythmic daring and inventiveness that could make an arena sway. And it probably did.",
      "Fitzgerald flies high on \u201cMack the Knife,\u201d and displays jazzy verve on Benny Goodman\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Be That Way\u201d and the Tony Bennett staple \u201cThe Moment of Truth,\u201d while \u201cYou\u2019ve Changed\u201d shimmers with bluesy beauty. On \u201cLet\u2019s Do It (Let\u2019s Fall in Love),\u201d her phrasing is as clever as Cole Porter\u2019s lyrics. In her version, she injects references to the Beatles,James Bond, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor.",
      "As Friedwald notes, Fitzgerald rarely drew from the Burt Bacharach-Hal David catalogue. But her interpretation of their classic ballad \u201cAlfie\u201d is a marvel of technique, emotional investment and creativity, including a brief digression. Fitzgerald navigates the complicated melody and rhythm with ease. It's an exemplar of the album, because as always, in keeping with the advice of the lyrics, her heart leads the way.",

      "New York musician Larry Saltzman isn't really a movie fan, but he'll be sure to watch the Oscars this year",
      "NEW YORK -- He's not a movie buff, so New York musician Larry Saltzman doesn't always watch the Oscars. This year, however, he's got a rooting interest.",
      "Saltzman taught actor Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet how to play guitar for the role of Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d In turn, Chalamet earned a best actor nomination and the film is also up for best picture at the Academy Awards on Sunday.",
      "A guitarist who's performed with Simon & Garfunkel, Bette Midler and David Johansen, as well as in the pit at Broadway productions \u201cHairspray\u201d and \u201cAin't Too Proud to Beg,\u201d Saltzman has developed a specialty in teaching actors how to play music for their roles. Besides Chalamet, recent pupils have included Adam Driver and Sadie Sink of \u201cStranger Things.\u201d",
      "On a fellow musician's recommendation, Saltzman first got a call from a movie studio about a decade ago. He admits to being cranky as discussions dragged on. \u201cI almost did everything to talk them out of hiring me,\u201d he said.",
      "Not until the fifth phone call did the studio identify the client: Meryl Streep.",
      "She needed to learn the electric guitar for her starring role in the 2015 film \u201cRicki and the Flash,\u201d where she portrayed an aging rocker trying to keep her career and life together in the wake of a series of disappointments.",
      "Working with Streep is a little like a political consultant's first client being elected president. If she likes you and word gets around, other students will follow. Teaching actors now represents about 40% of his business, the 69-year-old said.",
      "\u201cMy time spent with her was excellent,\u201d he said of Streep. \u201cShe's smart. She knows how to learn things. There was a steady progress over three or four months. She did very well.\u201d",
      "Faking it just won't do for serious actors and film directors. It's like lip-syncing \u2014 the audience is going to tell the difference, and the characters will be less believable. That was especially true with Chalamet, who needed to sing and play at the same time for a character whose artistry is the centerpiece of the film.",
      "\u201cWhen the actors come to you, they're kind of vulnerable,\u201d Saltzman said. \u201cThey want to do a great job.\u201d",
      "Saltzman had more than 50 sessions with Chalamet, starting in person and retreating to Zoom during the pandemic. It wasn't easy. Chalamet had to learn some 25 songs in the script.",
      "\u201cSometime in 2018 I had my first lesson with this great guitar teacher named Larry Saltzman who at some point became less of a teacher and more a co-sanity artist through COVID,\u201d Chalamet recalled during a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI think we were keeping each other sane. We would Zoom three, four times a week and doing songs that never made it into the movie.\u201d",
      "It helped that Saltzman is a Dylan buff. Focusing on imparting \u201cthe guitar playing of \u2018pre-electric Bob,\u2019\u201d he taught his charge so well that Chalamet was a musical guest as well as host on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d performing obscure Dylan cuts last month. Saltzman says, in the course of their sessions, Chalamet \u201cwent the extra mile\u201d and unearthed \u201cvery early, obscure\u201d Dylan songs that weren't even in the script.",
      "Saltzman generally likes teaching actors more than common folk, in part because there's a specific goal: They need to learn certain songs to inhabit a particular character. When it's open-ended \u2014 someone just wants to learn the guitar \u2014 it can be more of a challenge, he said. Saltzman also believes that it's an advantage to not be a regular teacher, someone who may approach clients with a more rigid style.",
      "Actor Johnny Cannizzaro said he appreciated Saltzman's calming \u201cbedside manner\u201d and felt welcome in an apartment filled with guitars. Cannizzaro has the role of E Street Band member \u201cLittle Steven\u201d Van Zandt in the upcoming Bruce Springsteen biopic, \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was never really a moment where he expressed any sort of frustration or impatience with me during a session,\u201d said Cannizzaro, who has background playing keyboards but not guitar. \u201cIf anything, he would express some excitement when you grasped something he was teaching. That put me at ease.\u201d",
      "Saltzman also studied film of Van Zandt so he wasn't just teaching Cannizzaro guitar \u2014 he was showing specifics of how Van Zandt plays, the actor said.",
      "Beyond teaching, Saltzman's time is divided between studio work, playing in New York clubs accompanying different artists and Broadway \u2014 he's just about to begin \u201cSmash.\u201d",
      "It's an eye-opening experience for him to later see his students on screen. That was particularly the case when he saw \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d and marveled at Chalamet's ability as an actor.",
      "All the more reason to watch the Oscars, and to take some pride in his own work.",
      "\u201cIn my own humble way, I'm a small gear in that machinery,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is rewarding is knowing that in some small way I'm contributing to making a better film.\u201d",

      "But one initial idea the 38-year-old had did stick. \u201cMy first thought, on pretty much the first read of it, was, \u2018It\u2019s like Ren and Stimpy,\u2019\u201d he said of the irreverent animated Nickelodeon series from the 90's about a cat and dog.",
      "The dynamic between the two Mickeys is an apt comparison given Ren\u2019s short temper and diabolical nature (Mickey 18), which stands in stark contrast to Stimpy\u2019s naivete (Mickey 17). The similarities in their voices can also be heard.",
      "\u201cI kind of wanted to do this like cartoon character performance. You start out really, really extreme and then kind of gradually tone it down,\" he said of how he refined the characters. \u201cWhen directors just let you do stuff, you just come out of the box doing whatever and wherever your instinct is taking you.\"",
      "In addition to Pattison, the sci-fi comedy boasts an impressive cast, including Mark Ruffalo,Steven Yeun,Toni Collette and Naomi Ackie. Although Ackie, who plays Mickey\u2019s romantic partner in the film, hadn\u2019t worked with Pattinson before, she said they quickly hit it off.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re both quite similar in how we work, which is very chatty up until the point of \u2018Action,\u2019 and then we do the acting. And I really enjoy that kind of separation between character and self. I find it quite difficult to hold onto characters once there\u2019s no cameras on,\u201d she said.",
      "But it wasn\u2019t just Pattinson who made the experience a positive one for her. \u201cI\u2019m pretty certain you could ask anyone who works with Bong Joon Ho, \u2018Would you go back?\u2019 And they\u2019d be like, \u2018I\u2019d pay money.\u2019\u201d",
      "Despite the notoriety the director has reaped since \u201cParasite\u201d racked up four Oscars in 2020, including best picture and best director, Bong said the experience hasn't changed him.",
      "\u201cIt was fun and exciting to meet with all these famous artists and filmmakers during the campaign, but I didn\u2019t feel like I was like on cloud nine. It was actually very mentally and physically exhausting because the campaign is so long and I just remember thinking, \u2018Wow, this is really tough,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe kept just like handing each other vitamins.\u201d"

      "Supported by government money and private donations and attracting millions of visitors each year, the Kennedy Center is a 100-foot high complex featuring a concert hall, opera house and theater, along with a lecture hall, meeting spaces and a \u201cMillennium Stage\u201d that has been the site for free shows.",

      "The esteemed group of Ralph Fiennes, Isabella Rossellini and John Lithgow had enough collective gravitas on their own, but Harrison Ford, who had just presented them the best ensemble award, the night's big prize, also walked among them.",

      "A gleeful Jamie Lee Curtis descended on the two before they left and gave congrats and kisses to each.",

      "The wins for \u201cConclave\u201d and Chalamet threw a wrench into expectations for the Oscars that are just a week away, with Chalamet, Fiennes and Rossellini all nominees. The presumed Oscar frontrunner, \u201cAnora,\u201d was shut out.",

      "The group moved along and signed show posters, then made their way to the area where winners pose for press photos.",
      "Actors always say awards are heavy when they get them, but by all accounts the SAG statue truly is. Kieran Culkin made the heft the subject of half his acceptance speech for best supporting male actor.",
      "While he waited for the photo session, the 62-year-old Fiennes did some presses with his award with each arm.",

      "During the first break in the telecast, they headed straight past Ford and Jeff Goldblum, who were standing and chatting, to the table where Grande sat with the \u201cWicked\u201d cast, perhaps looking to impress their children with the photos.",

      "The SAG Awards are also a union meeting, and this group, who went on a historic strike in 2023, were asked through fliers at place settings, a video that played during a break, and a pre-telecast plea from their leader to support their striking colleagues who work on video games.",
      "Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, also spoke of the need for legislation putting strict limits on the use of artificial intelligence to create actors' performances.",

      "A London judge has dismissed part of a lawsuit against the British band The 1975 over the lead singer\u2019s gay kiss that led Malaysian authorities to shut down a music festival",
      "LONDON -- Members of the British band The 1975 cannot be held personally liable for losses of a Malaysian music festival that was shut down by authorities after lead singer Matty Healy kissed a male bandmate on stage, a London judge ruled Monday.",
      "The organizer of the Good Vibes Festival is seeking 1.9 million pounds ($2.4 million) in losses after Healy criticized the country's anti-homosexuality laws and then kissed bassist Ross MacDonald at the Kuala Lumpur show in July 2023.",
      "Footage of the kiss sparked a backlash in the predominantly Muslim country, where homosexuality is a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning. Some LGBTQ+ groups also criticized the band for endangering its community and disrupting the work of activists pushing for change.",
      "Future Sound Asia sued The 1975 Productions LLP in the High Court over breach of contract and said its four members owed a duty of care. But the band\u2019s lawyer argued that the suit should only target the company \u2014 not the musicians.",
      "Judge William Hansen said the claims against the band members were \"bad as a matter of law and that there is no good reason why the matter should go to trial.\" He allowed the case to proceed against the company, but ordered FSA to pay 100,000 pounds ($126,000) in legal costs.",
      "Band attorney Edmund Cullen had argued the claim was an \u201cillegitimate, artificial and incoherent\u201d attempt \u201cto pin liability on individuals\u201d because FSA only had a contract with the band's company.",
      "FSA\u2019s attorney Andrew Burns said authorities had initially refused to let the band perform because of reports about Healy\u2019s drug addiction and subsequent recovery. They relented after the band promised he would follow guidelines and regulations, he said.",
      "When the band played the same festival in 2016, they had agreed not to swear, smoke, drink, take off clothes or talk about religion and politics on stage, Burns said.",
      "Burns said the band deliberately provoked Malaysian authorities in 2023 by smuggling a bottle of wine on stage, and through Healy's \u201cobscene speech\u201d and the kiss. He said the band also performed a \u201csecond-rate set of songs\u201d to upset the crowd.",
      "\u201cThey could be argued to have been on a frolic of their own rather than simply acting within the course of their ordinary role as LLP members,\" Burns said.",
      "The band was supposed to be paid $350,000 (276,000 pounds) for a one-hour set, Burns said.",
      "The show wasn't the first time Healy made a political statement in the name of LGBTQ+ rights: he kissed a male fan at a 2019 concert in the United Arab Emirates, which outlaws same-sex sexual activity.",
      "After the show in the Malaysian capital, The 1975 canceled its concerts in Taiwan and Jakarta, Indonesia.",
      "The Malaysian government has blacklisted the band."

      "The 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards should offer the final clue in an unusually unpredictable Oscar race",
      "The 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday night should offer the final clue in an unusually unpredictable Oscar race.",
      "The other major awards \u2014 including the BAFTAs, the Producers Guild Awards, the Directors Guild Awards and the Golden Globes \u2014 have all had their say. But actors make up the largest piece of the film academy pie, so their picks often correspond strongly with Academy Award winners.",
      "After wins from the PGA and the DGA \u2014 and last night, the Independent Spirit Awards \u2014 Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d is seen as the favorite to win best picture in a week\u2019s time at the Oscars. But Edward Berger\u2019s \u201cConclave\u201d won last weekend at the BAFTAs, the latest wrench in an award season full of them. That\u2019s included the unlikely rise and precipitous fall of another top contender, \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d",
      "So there are plenty of questions heading into the SAG Awards, hosted by Kristen Bell from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Can \u201cWicked\u201d make a late push and win the guild\u2019s top award, best ensemble? Can Adrien Brody hold off Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet for best actor? Can Mikey Madison keep the momentum and win best actress over Demi Moore?",
      "The 31st SAG Awards will be streamed live by Netflix beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. An official pre-show will start an hour earlier, also on Netflix. Last year\u2019s show, the first to air on the streaming platform, drew an audience of 1.8 million, roughly on par with earlier SAG ceremonies broadcast by TNT and TBS.",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d comes in the leading film nominee, with five nods, while \u201cSh\u014dgun\u201d heads the TV categories.",
      "Jon M. Chu\u2019s hit musical hasn\u2019t yet had a major awards win, but the Screen Actors Guild has often favored populist contenders. Also up for best ensemble are \u201cAnora,\u201d \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d \u201cConclave\u201d and \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d",
      "The best actor and best actress categories should be nail biters. While Brody (\u201cThe Brutalist\u201d) has won a string of awards, Chalamet (\u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d) and Ralph Fiennes (\u201cConclave\u201d) could easily pull off the upset. Best actress could go to either Moore (\u201cThe Substance\u201d) or Madison (\u201cAnora\u201d).",
      "In the supporting categories, Kieran Culkin (\u201cA Real Pain\u201d) and Zoe Saldana (\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d) are the favorites.",
      "In addition to the competitive categories, Jane Fonda will be given the SAG Life Achievement Award.",
      "The devastating wildfires that began in early January forced the guild to cancel its in-person nominations announcement and instead issue a press release. The guild has launched a disaster relief fund for SAG-AFTRA members affected by the fires. Producers have said the show will honor those affected."

      "In an 8 \u00bd-minute video posted to TikTok on Friday, Schafer, who transitioned as a young teen, said the passport that was meant to carry her well into her 30s was stolen while she was filming in Spain. After receiving an emergency passport, she later had to apply for a new, permanent one in Los Angeles. Having had female gender markers on her license and passport since she was a teenager, Schafer marked \u201cfemale\u201d on her application \u2014 but received a passport that identified her as male, she said.

She said she was making the video not to \u201cfearmonger or like create drama or receive consolation,\u201d but to note the reality of the situation.",
      "\u201cI wasn't even really looking for support, but I have an amazing community around me and it's one of the greatest blessings of my life and so I felt very supported throughout, before and then now,\u201d she told the AP on Saturday.",
      "The State Department said in response to a request for comment that it was implementing Trump\u2019s executive order but declined to comment on specific cases, citing privacy laws and restrictions.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't really change anything about me or my transness. However, it does make my life a little harder,\u201d Schafer said in the video, saying she has to travel for the first time with the new passport next week.",
      "\u201cTrans people are beautiful. We are never going to stop existing. I'm never going to stop being trans. A letter and a passport can't change that,\u201d she concluded.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d soared on opening weekend, but crash-landed in its second go-around with audiences.",
      "\u201cBrave New World,\u201d the latest sign that the Marvel machine isn\u2019t quite what it used to be, remained No. 1 at the box office in its second frame with $28.2 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. But after a debut of $100 million over four days and $88 million over three days, that meant a steep drop of 68%.",
      "While blockbusters often see significant slides in their second weekends, only two previous MCU titles have fallen off so fast: 2023\u2019s \u201cThe Marvels,\u201d which fell 78%, and 2023\u2019s \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,\u201d which dropped 70%.",
      "The Anthony Mackie-led \u201cCaptain America\u201d installment has been slammed by critics, and audiences also have graded it poorly, with a \u201cB-\u201d CinemaScore. \u201cBrave New World,\u201d which fans had hoped would right the Marvel ship, has been largely met as another example of a once impenetrable brand struggling to recapture its pre-\u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d aura of invincibility.",
      "Still, \u201cBrave New World\u201d has quickly grossed $289.4 million worldwide, with international sales nearly reaching $150 million. And with few big-budget offerings arriving in theaters in the coming weeks, it will have scant competition through much of March.",
      "The biggest new release of the weekend was Oz Perkins\u2019 \u201cThe Monkey,\u201d the director\u2019s follow-up to his 2024 horror hit, \u201cLonglegs.\u201d Adapted from a Stephen King short story, \u201cThe Monkey\u201d opened with $14.2 million for Neon, the second-best debut for the indie distributor.

      "Neon had much to celebrate over the weekend. Its top awards contender, \u201cAnora,\u201d by Sean Baker, continues to gather momentum into next Sunday's Academy Awards. The best-picture favorite added wins at the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday.",
      "Perkins, Neon and Blumhouse, which partnered in the release of \u201cThe Monkey,\u201d have found a productive low-budget collaboration, with more on the way.

      "\u201cThe Monkey,\u201d starring Tatiana Maslany and Theo James, revolves around an old monkey toy found in an attic. Reviews have been good (77% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), though audiences were less impressed, giving it a C+ CinemaScore. Horror films, though, typically grade low.",
      "As it did with \u201cLonglegs,\u201d Neon leaned into cryptic promotion for \u201cThe Monkey,\u201d along with some macabre marketing. A funeral premiere was held Los Angeles\u2019 Immanuel Presbyterian Church, and fan screenings took place at Hollywood Cemetery. The film, produced by James Wan, cost $10 million to make.",
      "Lionsgate\u2019s \u201cThe Unbreakable Boy\u201d opened with a paltry $2.5 million in 1,687 theaters. The Christian-themed Jon Gunn-directed film starring Zachary Levi and Meghann Fahy, is about parents who learn their son is autistic and has brittle bone disease.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The number of babies born in South Korea rebounded for the first time in nine years in 2024, welcome news for a country grappling with one of the the world\u2019s most serious demographic crises.",
      "South Korea\u2019s statistics agency said Wednesday that 238,300 babies were born last year, an increase of 8,300 from a year earlier. It said the country\u2019s fertility rate \u2014 the average number of babies born to each woman in their reproductive years \u2014 was 0.75 in 2024, up from 0.72 in 2023.",
      "It\u2019s the first time that the yearly number of births has increased since 2015.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say this is a considerably meaningful rebound,\u201d Choi Yoon Kyung, an expert at the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education, said Thursday. \u201cWe still have to see figures in the next few years to find whether it was a temporary rebound or it was driven by structural changes.\u201d",
      "Park Hyun Jung, a senior official at the Statistics Korea, said that her agency assessed the increase in births was partly attributable to an increase in marriages among couples who delayed weddings during the COVID-19 pandemic period.",
      "Park said that another factor behind the rebound was a growing number of people entering their early 30s. She also cited a government survey showing a small increase in the number of young people hoping to have children after marriage.",
      "Official data show South Korea\u2019s fertility rate has been the lowest in the developed world in recent years. In 2022, it was the only country whose fertility rate was below 1 among members of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "The low fertility rate poses a major potential threat to South Korea\u2019s economy, Asia's fourth largest, as it will cause labor shortages and greater welfare spendings. South Korea\u2019s central and regional governments have been increasingly offering a variety of financial incentives and other support programs to those who give birth to children.",
      "But experts say that it will be extremely difficult to address the country's demographic challenges as young people don't want to have babies, owing to a mix of factors that make it difficult to raise them in the brutally competitive, fast-changing country. They cite expensive housing, low levels of social mobility, the huge cost of raising and educating children and a culture that requires women to handle far more of childcare.",
      "Park said that the fertility rate will likely stay on an upward trend at least for another year. But observers say it remains to be seen whether the rate will go back down as post-pandemic marriages even out. The country\u2019s demographic structure will also eventually see a drop in people in their early 30s.",
      "Some experts argue that the government should focus on supporting young couples who want to have babies, rather than providing broad programs meant to address diverse social problems.",
      "\u201cThere are still people with solid wills to have a family and babies. When we help them realize their hopes, our fertility rate won\u2019t suffer a steep, 45-degree drop,\u201d Choi said."

      "The U.S. registered its first death from measles since 2015 this week, as a child who wasn\u2019t vaccinated died in a measles outbreak in rural West Texas",
      "BANGKOK -- The U.S. registered its first death from measles since 2015 this week, as a child who wasn\u2019t vaccinated died in a measles outbreak in rural West Texas.",
      "Normally, most U.S. cases are brought into the country by people who have traveled overseas. So far, Texas state officials have reported 124 cases. New Mexico has reported nine.",
      "Experts point to declining measles vaccination rates worldwide since the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United States, most states now are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "Britain reported 2,911 confirmed measles cases in 2024, the highest number of cases recorded annually, since 2012.",
      "Measles cases in the United States last year were nearly double the total for all of 2023, raising concerns about the preventable, once-common childhood virus. Health officials confirmed measles cases in at least 18 states in 2024, including in New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago.",
      "\"Measles anywhere is a threat everywhere,\" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control say on their website.",
      "Here's a brief look at the global measles situation.",
      "According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 10.3 million people were infected with measles in 2023 and 107,500 died. Most were unvaccinated people or children younger than five. Cases were most common in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia where incomes are low and health services insufficient.",
      "In places where measles have largely been eradicated, cases have been spread by travelers from other countries.",
      "While measles-related deaths declined slightly in 2023, the number of outbreaks increased. Major outbreaks took place in 57 countries in 2023, including India and Indonesia, Russia, Yemen and Iraq. The largest number of cases in 2023 was 311,500 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "The worldwide rate of childhood vaccinations has fallen in recent years, to 83% in 2023 from 86% in 2019, partly due to disruptions in immunization and health care due to the pandemic.",
      "The WHO estimates that vaccination helped to prevent more than 60 million deaths worldwide between 2000 and 2023, as efforts to get the shots to more people ramped up. In 2000, 800,062 people are estimated to have died of measles. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, major epidemics caused about 2.6 million deaths a year.",
      "Measles is so highly infectious that 95% immunity is required to prevent epidemics, the WHO says. Put another way, it infects about 9 of 10 people exposed if they lack immunity.",
      "The WHO and others are backing an effort called \u201cImmunization Agenda 2021-2030,\u201d to push for elimination of measles.",
      "Independent experts declared the Americas free of endemic measles in 2016 but that status was lost in 2018 due to measles outbreaks in Brazil and Venezuela. Reduced vaccination rates are undermining efforts to fully eradicate the disease, experts say.",
      "Global health organizations and other groups have increased their efforts to speed up immunization programs and close the gaps in prevention."

    "story": [
      "A bill that would strip gender identity protections from Iowa\u2019s civil rights code has received final legislative approval and now goes to the governor",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Iowa lawmakers became the first in the nation to approve legislation removing gender identity protections from the state\u2019s civil rights code Thursday, despite massive protests by opponents who say it could expose transgender people to discrimination in numerous areas of life.",
      "The measure raced through the legislative process after first being introduced last week. The state Senate was first to approve the bill on Thursday, on party lines, followed by the House less than an hour later. Five House Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it.",
      "The bill would remove gender identity as a protected class from the state\u2019s civil rights law and explicitly define female and male, as well as gender, which would be considered a synonym for sex and \u201cshall not be considered a synonym or shorthand expression for gender identity, experienced gender, gender expression, or gender role.\u201d",
      "The measure would be the first legislative action in the U.S. to remove nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity, said Logan Casey, director of policy research at the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank.",
      "The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who signed earlier policies banning sports participation and public bathroom access for transgender students. A spokesperson for Reynolds declined to comment on whether she would sign the bill. If she does, it will go into effect on July 1.",
      "Hundreds of LGBTQ+ advocates streamed into the Capitol rotunda on Thursday waving signs reading \u201cTrans rights are human rights\u201d and chanting slogans including \u201cNo hate in our state!\u201d There was a heavy police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. Of the 167 people who signed up to testify at a 90-minute public hearing before a House committee, all but 24 were opposed to the bill.",
      "Protesters who watched the vote from the House gallery loudly booed and shouted \u201cShame!\u201d as the chamber adjourned. Many admonished Iowa state Rep. Steven Holt, who floor managed the bill and delivered a fierce defense of it before it passed.",
      "Supporters of the change say the current law incorrectly codified the idea that people can transition to another gender and granted transgender women access to spaces such as bathrooms, locker rooms and sports teams that should be protected for people who were assigned female at birth. Holt said the inclusion of gender identity in the civil rights codes threatens recent \u201ccommonsense\u201d laws to ban transgender participation in sports and access to bathrooms.",
      "\u201cThe legislature of Iowa for the future of our children and our culture has a vested interest and solemn responsibility to stand up for immutable truth,\u201d Holt said.",
      "The Iowa lawmakers\u2019 actions came as the Georgia House backed away from removing gender protections from the state\u2019s hate crimes law, which was passed in 2020 after the death of Ahmaud Arbery.",
      "Iowa\u2019s current civil rights law protects against discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status.",
      "Sexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state\u2019s Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, also with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers.",
      "Iowa state Rep. Aime Wichtendahl was the last Democrat to speak out Thursday against the bill removing those protections, becoming emotional as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: \"I transitioned to save my life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,\u201d Wichtendahl said. \u201cThe sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill is to make our existence illegal.\u201d",
      "About half of U.S. states include gender identity in their civil rights code to protect against discrimination in housing and public places, such as stores or restaurants, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Some additional states do not explicitly protect against such discrimination but it is included in legal interpretations of statutes.",
      "Iowa\u2019s Supreme Court has expressly rejected the argument that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender identity.",
      "Several Republican-led legislatures are pushing to enact more laws this year creating legal definitions of male and female based on the reproductive organs at birth following an executive order from President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump also signed orders laying the groundwork for banning transgender people from military service and keeping transgender girls and women out of girls and women\u2019s sports competitions, among other things. Most of the policies are being challenged in court.",

      "EL PASO, Texas -- On the Texas border, Dr. Hector Granados treats children with diabetes at his El Paso clinics and makes hospital rounds under the shadow of accusations that have thrown his career into jeopardy: providing care to transgender youth.",
      "In what's believed to be a U.S. first, Texas is suing Granados and two other physicians over claims that they violated the state's ban on gender-affirming care for minors, calling the doctors \u201cscofflaws\u201d in lawsuits filed last fall that threaten to impose steep fines and revoke their medical licenses. He denies the accusations, and all three doctors have asked courts to dismiss the cases.",
      "The cases are a pivotal test of intensifying Republican efforts to prevent such treatments, including President Donald Trump's executive order that would bar federal support for gender-affirming care for youth under 19.",
      "Some hospitals have already begun unwinding services for pediatric patients. But, so far, only Texas is demonstrating what punishing doctors looks like when bans are allegedly broken.",
      "Granados, in an interview with The Associated Press, said he was meticulous in halting transgender care before Texas' ban took effect in 2023. He denied that he continued prescribing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to transitioning patients and said he was initially unclear which patients, who are not named in the lawsuit, he is accused of wrongfully treating.",
      "The other accused doctors \u2014 both in Dallas \u2014 are under temporary court orders not to see patients and only practice medicine in research and academic settings.",
      "\u201cLooking at the patients was hard because they were kind of disappointed of what was going on,\u201d Granados said of ending their care. \u201cBut it was something that needed to be followed because it\u2019s the law.\u201d",
      "The lawsuits are believed to be the first time a state has brought enforcement under laws that ban or restrict gender-affirming care for minors, which Republicans have enacted in 27 states, including this month in Kansas over the Democratic governor\u2019s veto. Although those accused of violating bans face criminal charges in some states, they do not in Texas.",
      "Nationwide, doctors and hospital executives are reevaluating transgender health programs that carry a widening risk of litigation and losing federal funding. For transgender Americans, the climate has narrowed options for care and deepened fears.",
      "Trump has launched a broad charge against transgender rights quickly in his second term, signing executive orders that include barring schools from using federal education dollars to support students who are socially transitioning. Supporters say restrictions protect vulnerable children from what they see as a \u201cradical\u201d ideology about gender and making irreversible medical decisions.",
      "The Texas lawsuits were brought by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has previously gone beyond the state's borders to launch investigations into gender-affirming treatment.",
      "His office did not respond to requests for an interview. At a court hearing Wednesday involving the Dallas doctors, an attorney in Paxton\u2019s office declined to comment and referred questions to the agency\u2019s press office.",
      "\u201cI will enforce the law to the fullest extent to prevent any doctor from providing these dangerous drugs to kids,\u201d Paxton said in a statement this month.",
      "Granados is one of two pediatric endocrinologists in El Paso, a desert city of about 700,000 where mountains rise in the distance.",
      "Granados, 48, is from Ciudad Juarez, the neighboring Mexican city that sprawls out south of El Paso. He said that after attending medical school in Mexico he completed additional training in New York and Connecticut but he wanted to return to what he said is an underserved region.",
      "He opened a gender clinic at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso before starting his own practice in 2019. Before the ban, Granados said, treating transgender youth was just an extension of his practice that also treats youth with diabetes, growth problems and early puberty.",
      "He said he accepted transgender patients only if they had first received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a mental health provider.",
      "\u201cIt was not different from doing everything else that a pediatric endocrinologist does,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just taking care of children who required that specific therapy.\u201d",
      "Emiliana Edwards was among them. Now 18, she called Granados an \u201camazing\u201d caregiver who carefully explained her gender-affirming treatment. But at her first appointment after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the ban in 2023, Edwards said the room felt different, \u201clike there were wires everywhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt felt like we couldn\u2019t talk about anything really, even the most simple stuff,\u201d she said.",
      "Her mother, Lorena Edwards, said Granados put a \u201ccold stop\u201d to her daughter\u2019s care.",
      "\u201cIt was just: \u2018I don\u2019t provide that care anymore.\u2019 And it was done,\u201d she said.",
      "At the heart of Texas' lawsuits against Granados, Dr. May Lau and Dr. M. Brett Cooper are allegations of prescribing treatment to transition their patients' sex after the ban took effect.",
      "In one instance, the state accuses Granados of prescribing testosterone to a 16-year-old, alleging that although the doctor's records identify the patient as male, the teenager's sex assigned at birth is female. Granados and Lau are also accused of having instructed patients to wait until after the ban was in place to fill prescriptions.",
      "Granados does not dispute that he has continued prescribing puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy. He said those treatments are not for gender transition but for children with endocrine disorders, which occur when hormone levels are too high or too low.",
      "He said he prescribes testosterone for many reasons, including for patients whose testicles don\u2019t work or had to be removed because of cancer. Others have brain tumors, or surgery or radiation to the brain, that impact puberty. Patients with early onset puberty also need puberty blockers, he said.",
      "Attorneys for Lau said she has always complied with the law and the claims have no merit. Attorneys for Cooper did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "\u201cThis is really part of a bigger pattern of extremism within the state that even other states have shied away from replicating,\u201d said Sarah Warbelow, vice president of legal for the Human Rights Campaign.",
      "Transgender adults and youth make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, according to estimates by the Williams Institute, an LGBTQ+ research center at the UCLA School of Law.",
      "Granados' trial has been set for late October; trial dates have not yet been set yet for Lau and Cooper. While the cases are pending, Lau and Cooper agreed to practice medicine only in research and academic settings and not see patients.",
      "Neither Lau or Cooper attended the Wednesday hearing in their cases by a judge who is set to decide where their trials will be held.",
      "Under Texas' ban, the state medical board is instructed to revoke the licenses of doctors who are found to have violated the law.",
      "Lorena Edwards said she watched her daughter thrive during her transition then descend into melancholy as laws targeting transgender rights gained steam.",
      "Emiliana Edwards has switched to receiving treatment in neighboring New Mexico \u2014 where gender-affirming care is legal \u2014 but she said attacks on the transgender community have taken a toll on her mental health.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re normal people, too, and we\u2019re just trying to live,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d starring Natalie Morales and Sonequa Martin-Green, confronts a dark reality of post-combat struggle with as much humor and playfulness as it does trauma and sorrow",
      "Even for a film titled \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d the opening scenes of Kyle Hausmann-Stoke\u2019s movie have a startling rhythm.",
      "First, two female American soldiers are riding in a Humvee in Afghanistan 2016 blasting Rihanna\u2019s \u201cUmbrella.\u201d They are clearly friends, and more concerned with the music coming through loudly than enemy fire. Merit (Natalie Morales) tells Zoe (Sonequa Martin-Green) that they ever set foot in \u201csome dopy group therapy,\" to please kill her.",
      "Cut to years later, they\u2019re sitting in a counseling meeting for veterans and Morales\u2019 character has a sour look at her face. She turns to her friend: \u201cDid we survive the dumbest war of all time just to sit here all broken and kumbaya and ouchie-my-feelings?\u201d",
      "But after this rush of cavalier soldiering and bitter sarcasm comes a sobering moment. Merit blinks her eyes and is instead staring at an empty chair. Zoe isn\u2019t there at all.",
      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d co-starring Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris, confronts a dark reality of post-combat struggle with as much humor and playfulness as it does trauma and sorrow. It comes from a real place, and you can tell. Hausmann-Stoke is himself a veteran and \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is dedicated to a pair of his platoon mates who committed suicide. The opening titles note the film was \u201cinspired by a true story.\u201d",
      "Audience disinterest has characterized many, though not all, of the films about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and the output has pretty much dried up over the years. \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d feels like it was made with an awareness of that trend and as a rebuke to it.",
      "This is an often breezy and funny movie for what, on paper, is a difficult and dark story. But the comic tone of \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is, itself, a spirited rejection to not just the heaviness of many films about veterans but of the grief that can consume those who have dealt with loss and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Throughout the film, Zoe appears only to Merit, ala Brad Pitt in \u201cFight Club,\u201d singing alongside her as she drives or impatiently waiting for Merit to come home from a run. Whether this, following some unspecified end to Zoe, is a healthy thing or not for Merit is increasingly in doubt. Merit needs to cling to her friend, or her memory of her. But Zoe also rolls her eyes at any suggestion of talking through her feelings. Zoe, as an apparition, is both the cause and relief to her pain.",
      "There are a few other points of view, courtesy of two of our finest actors. Freeman plays the counselor of Merit\u2019s mandatory group sessions. He refuses to let Zoe coast. To pressure her to share and participate, he threatens withholding Zoe's certification.",
      "Meanwhile, Merit\u2019s grandfather, Dale (Harris), a Vietnam vet, has just been diagnosed with early Alzheimer\u2019s. Merit is tasked with keeping an eye on him at his rural lakeside cabin and helping him into a retirement community \u2014 a prospect that infuriates him. As Merit\u2019s original inspiration for joining the army, Dale \u2014 stubborn and tight-lipped \u2014 epitomizes an earlier generation of soldier.",
      "In toggling between the present and wartime flashbacks, \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is sometimes a bumpy ride. The interplay between Merit and Zoe also shifts, beginning more like a buddy comedy and veering toward horror-film haunting, especially when Merit hesitantly agrees to a date with a worker at the prospective retirement home (Utkarsh Ambudkar).",
      "But the movie\u2019s earnestness carries it through these less smooth moments. So does the cast. Any opportunity to see Freeman or Harris, still at the top of their games, is a chance to be treasured. Freeman is typically sage and Harris characteristically fiery. But the leads are even better. Morales is at her finest as a cynical soldier, devoted to her friend but little else. And with compelling poise, Martin-Green (\"The Walking Dead\") carries a movie that at times can feel scattershot but never not sincere.",
      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d a Briarcliff Entertainment release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language. Running time: 101 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "The Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in contract cuts after an uproar that critical veterans health services were harmed, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in planned contract cuts following concerns that the move would hurt critical veterans' health services, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday.",
      "The pause affects hundreds of VA contracts that Secretary Doug Collins a day earlier described as simply consulting deals, whose cancellation would save $2 billion as the Trump administration works to slash costs across the federal government.",
      "\u201cNo more paying consultants to do things like make Power Point slides and write meeting minutes!\u201d Collins posted to X Tuesday, in a post that was then lauded by Elon Musk, President Donald Trump's cost-cutting chief at the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "The Associated Press has obtained the full list of 875 affected contracts, which shows the cuts would affect everything from cancer care to the ability to assess toxic exposure. The list underscores how the Trump administration\u2019s approach to broad spending reductions has immediate and potentially unintended consequences, generating significant concern not just among Democrats but also Republican lawmakers.",
      "The VA said in a statement to the AP that its review of the contracts \u201cis ongoing and not final.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not be eliminating any benefits or services to Veterans or VA beneficiaries, and there will be no negative impact to VA health care, benefits or beneficiaries. We are always going to take care of Veterans at VA. Period,\u201d VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in a statement.",
      "One contract that was on the chopping block supports assessing veterans' disability ratings. Those evaluations are one of the most important steps needed for a veteran to qualify to have their medical care covered and receive financial compensation if they were wounded due to their military service. An inaccurate rating can have a long-term impact on their access to care and financial support.",
      "Another contract is intended to identify and integrate data between the Pentagon, VA and other agencies to support the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022, a bill passed in 2022 to increase veterans\u2019 access to care.",
      "Some of the other contracts marked for cancellation also directly affect veterans' care.",
      "At a joint House and Senate hearing Wednesday with veterans services organizations, Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal submitted a partial list of the affected contracts his office had received and submitted it for the congressional record.",
      "If carried out, these cuts \u201cwill harm veterans and taxpayers for years to come,\u201d Blumenthal said in a statement.",
      "In an internal VA email sent Tuesday and seen by the AP, a VA contracting official said DOGE targeted contracts broadly categorized as \u201cconsulting\u201d but they included ones that if terminated would halt chemotherapy and imaging services.",
      "Contracts to calibrate radiation detection equipment, to support cancer care and veterans cemetery management, among others were also targeted. Another would directly affect the ability to assess toxic exposure because it supports more than 24,000 research requests to look through the National Archives and Records Administration and other government sources to validate service and toxic exposure events.",
      "Former VA Secretary David Shulkin, who served in the Trump administration in his first term, said that while the agency has gotten larger and there are likely savings to be found, the VA grew, in part, to meet the large expansion of veterans enrolling to get care under the PACT Act. More than 740,000 veterans signed up for coverage after the law passed, according to a September 2024 VA press release.",
      "\u201cI do think slowing down and pausing to see what the consequences are, even if they are unintended consequences, is important to do,\u201d Shulkin told The Associated Press.",
      "Veterans service organizations called for \u201dimmediate transparency\u201d on what contracts were affected.",
      "\u201cWith funding suddenly stripped from contractors processing claims, conducting medical screenings and expanding outreach, there are growing concerns veterans will face delays, denials and disruptions in accessing critical services,\u201d said Rosie Torres, executive director of Burn Pits 360.",
      "The group advocates for veterans who face life-altering respiratory illnesses and cancers due to toxic exposure to dangerous air particle matter generated from massive trash-burning fires at overseas bases.",
      "The Washington Post was first to report on the cancellations.",

      "A former surgeon is set to stand trial in France for the alleged rape or sexual abuse of 299 victims",
      "VANNES, France -- A former surgeon is set to stand trial in France on Monday for the alleged rape or sexual abuse of 299 victims, most of them children who were his patients, in what investigators and his own notebooks describe as a pattern of violence spanning over three decades.",
      "Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, now 74, will face hundreds of victims during a four-month trial in Vannes, Brittany. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, on top of 15 years he has been serving after being found guilty in 2020 of rape and sexual assault of children.",
      "He does not deny the allegations, though says he doesn't remember everything. Some survivors have no memory of the assaults, having been unconscious at the time.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s trial comes as activists are pushing to lift taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse in France. The most prominent case was that of Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of other men who were convicted and sentenced in December to prison terms ranging from three to 20 years.",
      "Child protection and women\u2019s rights groups and medical community associations have called for a rally on Monday in front of the courthouse where Le Scouarnec will be tried.",
      "The case began in 2017, when a 6-year-old neighbor said Le Scouarnec had touched her over the fence separating their properties.",
      "A subsequent search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions, according to investigation documents.",
      "In 2020, Le Scouarnec was convicted of rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.",
      "He had admitted to child abuse dating to 1985-1986, but some cases could not be prosecuted because the statute of limitations had expired.",
      "The Vannes trial will examine alleged rapes and other abuses committed between 1989 and 2014 against 158 men and 141 women who were aged 11 on average at the time.",
      "The doctor sexually abused both boys and girls when they were alone in their hospital rooms, according to investigation documents.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really remember the operation. I remembered the post-operation, a surgeon who was quite mean,\u201d one of the victims, Am\u00e9lie L\u00e9v\u00eaque, recalled of her time in the hospital when she was 9 years old in 1991. \u201cI cried a lot.\"",
      "Years later, she described feeling overwhelmed when she learned that her name appeared in Le Scouarnec\u2019s notebooks.",
      "\u201cThat was the beginning of the answers to a lifetime of questions, and then it was the beginning of the descent into hell,\u201d she told public broadcaster France 3. \u201cI felt like I had lost control of everything. I wasn\u2019t crazy, but now I had to face the truth of what had happened.\u201d",
      "\u201cI fell into a deep depression. ... My family tried to help, but I felt completely alone.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press does not name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s lawyer, Thibaut Kurzawa, told Sud-Ouest newspaper his client will \u201canswer the judges\u2019 questions\u201d as he decided \u201cto face up to reality.\u201d",
      "Le Scouarnec had already been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year.",
      "Some child protection groups joined the proceedings as civil parties, saying they hope to toughen the legal framework to prevent such abuse.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is reinstating some of the hundreds of staffers it fired last week",
      "Associated Press -- Barely a week after mass firings at the Food and Drug Administration, some probationary staffers received unexpected news over the weekend: The government wants them back.",
      "Beginning Friday night, FDA employees overseeing medical devices and other key areas received calls and emails notifying them that their recent terminations had been \u201crescinded effective immediately,\u201d according to messages viewed by The Associated Press.",
      "Three FDA staffers impacted by the decisions spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity because they planned to continue working for the agency and weren\u2019t authorized to discuss its internal procedures.",
      "The reversal is the latest example of President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk's chaotic approach to cost-cutting, which has resulted in several agencies firing, and then scrambling to rehire, employees responsible for nuclear weapons, national parks and other government services.",
      "The FDA reinstatements followed pushback by lobbyists for the medical device industry, which pays the agency hundreds of millions of dollars annually to hire extra scientists to promptly review products. The industry's leading trade group said Monday \u201ca sizeable number\u201d of device reviewers would apparently be returning to FDA.",
      "\u201cThis would be welcome news, and I appreciate the administration for acting quickly,\u201d AdvaMed CEO Scott Whitaker said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe all share the same goal \u2014 an efficient, effective FDA review process that helps advance the medical technologies American patients depend on.\u201d",
      "FDA staffers said entire teams of five or more medical device reviewers had been reinstated. There did not appear to be a similar effort to rehire staffers in other parts of the agency, including its food and tobacco centers.",
      "The agency hasn\u2019t released official numbers on the terminations, but former FDA officials have pegged the number at roughly 700, with more than 220 coming from the medical device center. That would represent roughly 10% of the program's total staffing.",
      "The FDA did not respond to requests Monday about how many employees were being reinstated.",
      "Like other agencies, the FDA terminations went to employees in their probationary period, typically the first two years of federal employment. But that approach resulted in the terminations across key areas where the agency has been working to beef up staffing, including rapidly evolving fields like artificial intelligence and digital health. The cuts also included agency leaders who were recently hired for senior roles.",
      "\u201cThe disarray caused by the wholesale termination of a wide swath of device center staff was counterproductive and appears to have caused a variety of unintended and negative results,\u201d said Steve Silverman, a former FDA device official who now runs a consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see a shift in the opposite direction that recognizes the critical expertise of these staffers.\u201d",
      "Many reviewers have advanced degrees in specialized medical and technological fields. They can typically earn more in the private sector than in government.",
      "Last week, the lobbying group AdvaMed pushed back on the firings, calling on Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reverse course. The group warned that the cuts would result in slower approvals for companies and fewer new treatment options for patients.",
      "\u201cFDA will lose hundreds of new employees, the best and most innovative hires under our most recent agreement,\u201d Whitaker wrote in a statement posted online. He noted that the hiring of FDA device reviewers is largely financed through an ongoing five-year agreement between the FDA and medical device companies.",
      "More than half the device program\u2019s $791 million budget last year came from industry fees, according to federal figures. In return, the FDA is obligated to meet certain benchmarks for quickly and predictably reviewing applications for new and updated devices.",
      "FDA staffers who were reinstated said their immediate supervisors received no explanation or advance notice on the decisions. Instead, staffers received calls or emails from the FDA\u2019s \u201cOffice of Talent Solutions,\u201d informing them that their access to FDA computer systems and offices had been restored.",
      "\u201cWe are so grateful to still have you working for the FDA and serving the American public!\u201d the emails concluded.",
      "A week earlier, the same employees received emails stating that they were \u201cnot fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the agency\u2019s current needs.\u201d",
      "Nearly half the FDA\u2019s budget, or about $3.3 billion, comes from fees paid by drugmakers, device and tobacco companies. The result is that broad cuts to those programs won\u2019t add much toward Musk\u2019s stated goal of shrinking the federal budget.",
      "But the financial support of industry fees did not appear to help staffers in other parts of the agency.",
      "The agency\u2019s tobacco center \u2014 which reviews new products like electronic cigarettes and nicotine pouches \u2014 is 100% funded by industry fees. But there did not appear to be an effort to rehire any of the estimated 100 or so employees fired from that center.",
      "Similarly, the recalls did not appear to apply to the agency\u2019s food program, which recently went though a major restructuring to better oversee essential products like infant formula and baby food.",
      "Last week, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for foods, Jim Jones resigned, citing \u201cthe indiscriminate firing\u201d of nearly 90 staffers in his division, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by the AP. The employees fired included those with \u201chighly technical expertise in nutrition, infant formula, food safety response\u201d and chemical safety, Jones said.",

      "Utah appears to be the first state ready to put a full ban on fluoride in public water systems under a bill that doesn't allow cities or communities to decide whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral.",
      "A bill sponsor and an organization opposed to fluoridating water said Utah's proposal would set a precedent in the U.S. \u2014 and it would come as new federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, which is considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Utah's bill cleared its final hurdle in the legislature Friday, and heads to Gov. Spencer Cox for his approval. A spokesperson for Cox didn't immediately respond to a question about whether he'd sign it.",
      "Already, some cities across the country have tossed fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids\u2019 intellectual development.",
      "Utah ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data published in 2022 by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "Lawmakers who backed the bill, which was sponsored by state Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius and state Sen. Kirk Cullimore, said putting fluoride in the water is too expensive.",
      "\u201cI don't dispute that there can be positive benefits from fluoride, which is why the bill also includes a deregulation of the prescription,\u201d Gricius said in a text message to The Associated Press, referencing a fluoride pill. \u201cThis isn't anti-fluoride legislation, it is pro-informed consent and individual choice.\u201d",
      "Fluoridation is the the most cost effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "\u201cI think the anti-fluoride people, they\u2019re latching onto Kennedy\u2019s opportunity with his beliefs and using that now as a way to kind of get in the door to stop water fluoridation,\u201d Koci said.",
      "She added that fluoridated public water is often the only form of preventive dental care for some people, and the impacts may be most visible in low-income Utah residents.",
      "Fluoride strengthens the teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population drinks fluoridated water.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state's biggest city, Salt Lake City.",
      "In 2023, voters in Brigham City, north of Salt Lake City, struck down a measure that would have removed fluoride from its public water supplies. The proposal was defeated by more than a two-to-one margin.",
      "Val Radmall, the executive director of the Utah Dental Association, said he and others met with Gricius to try to get her to rethink the bill. He worked in a non-fluoridated community for three decades, and said the lack of fluoride showed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d have a patient come in without cavities or anything else like that, and I\u2019d say, \u2019You didn\u2019t grow up here. Where did you grow up?' ... because everybody here has lots of cavities!\u201d he said.",

      "Three workers at UPMC Memorial Hospital, including a doctor, a nurse and a custodian, and two other officers were shot and wounded in the attack, York County District Attorney Tim Barker said. A fourth staffer was injured in a fall.",
      "Gunfire erupted after officers went to engage the shooter, whom Barker identified as Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49. He said Archangel-Ortiz was holding at gunpoint a female staff member who had her hands bound with zip ties when police opened fire.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge loss to our community,\u201d Barker said at a press conference following the shooting. \u201cIt is absolutely clear, and beyond any and all doubt, that the officers were justified in taking their action using deadly force.\u201d",
      "Barker added that while the investigation is in its early stages, it appears Archangel-Ortiz had previous contact with the hospital's ICU earlier in the week for \u201ca medical purpose involving another individual\u201d and he intentionally targeted the workers there.",
      "No one answered the door Saturday at an address in York believed to be that of Archangel-Ortiz.",

      "\u201cWe all have broken hearts and are grieving at his loss,\u201d West York Borough Manager Shawn Mauck told The Associated Press.",
      "Duarte was a law enforcement veteran who joined the department in 2022 after five years with the Denver Police Department, according to his LinkedIn profile.

      "UPMC Memorial is a five-story, 104-bed hospital that opened in 2019 in York, a city of about 40,000 people known for its creation of York Peppermint Patties in 1940.",
      "The shooting is part of a wave of gun violence in recent years that has swept through U.S. hospitals and medical centers, which have struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make health care one of the nation's most violent fields, with workers suffering more nonfatal injuries from workplace violence than workers in any other profession, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In 2023, a shooter killed a security guard in the lobby of New Hampshire\u2019s state psychiatric hospital before being fatally shot by a state trooper. In 2022, a man killed two workers at a Dallas hospital while there to watch his child\u2019s birth. In May of that year, a man opened fire in a medical center waiting room in Atlanta, killing one woman and wounding four. And just one month later, a gunman killed his surgeon and three other people at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, medical office because he blamed the doctor for his continuing pain after an operation.",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- An annual United Nations conference on biodiversity that ran out of time last year will resume its work Tuesday in Rome with money at the top of the agenda.",
      "That is, how to spend what's been pledged so far \u2014 and how to raise a lot more to help preserve plant and animal life on Earth.",
      "The talks in Colombia known as COP16 yielded some significant outcomes before they broke up in November, including an agreement that requires companies that benefit from genetic resources in nature \u2014 say, by developing medicines from rainforest plants \u2014 to share the benefits. And steps were taken to give Indigenous peoples and local communities a stronger voice in conservation matters.",
      "But two weeks turned out to be not enough time to get everything done.",
      "The Cali talks followed the historic 2022 COP15 accord in Montreal, which included 23 measures aimed at protecting biodiversity. Those included putting 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems under protection by 2030, known as the Global Biodiversity Framework.",
      "\u201cMontreal was about the \u2018what\u2019 \u2014 what are we all working towards together?\u201d said Georgina Chandler, head of policy and campaigns for the Zoological Society London. \u201cCali was supposed to focus on the \u2018how\u2019 \u2014 putting the plans and the financing in place to ensure we can actually implement this framework.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey eventually lost a quorum because people simply went home,\u201d said Linda Krueger of The Nature Conservancy, who is in Rome for the two days of talks \u201cAnd so now we\u2019re having to finish these last critical decisions, which are some of the the nitty gritty decisions on financing, on resource mobilization and on the planning and monitoring and reporting requirements under the Global Biodiversity Framework.\u201d",
      "The overall financial aim was to achieve $20 billion a year in the fund by 2025, and then $30 billion by 2030. So far, only $383 million had been pledged as of November, from 12 nations or sub-nations: Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Province of Qu\u00e9bec, Spain, and the United Kingdom.",
      "Participants will discuss establishing a \u201cglobal financing instrument for biodiversity\u201d intended to effectively distribute the money raised. And a big part of the talks will be about raising more money.",
      "Chandler and Kruger both said the finance points at Colombia's talks were particularly contentious.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really about how do we collect the money and how do we get it distributed fairly, get it to the ground where it\u2019s needed most, so that that\u2019s really the core issue,\u201d said Kruger.",
      "Oscar Soria, chief executive of The Common Initiative, a think tank specializing in global economic and environmental policy, was pessimistic about raising a great deal more money.",
      "\u201cWe are completely off track in terms of achieving that money,\u201d Soria said. Key sources of biodiversity finance are shrinking or disappearing, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat was supposed to be a good Colombian telenovela in which people will actually bring the right resources, and the happy ending of bringing their money, could actually end up being a tragic Italian opera, where no one actually agrees to anything and everyone loses,\u201d Soria said.",
      "Susana Muhamad, Colombia's former environment minister and the COP16 president, said she's hopeful of \u201ca good message from Rome.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat message is that still, even with a very fragmented geopolitical landscape, with a world increasingly in conflict, we can still get an agreement on some fundamental issues,\" Muhamad said in a statement. \"And one of the most important is the need to protect life in this crisis of climate change and biodiversity.\u201d",
      "Global wildlife populations have plunged on average by 73% in 50 years, according to an October report from the World Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Society of London.",
      "\u201cBiodiversity is basically essential to our livelihoods and well-being,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cIt\u2019s essential to the the air we breathe, the water we drink, rainfall that food systems rely on, protecting us from increasing temperatures and increasing storm occurrences as well.\u201d",
      "Chandler said deforestation in the Amazon has far-reaching impacts across South America, just as it does in the Congo Basin and other major biodiverse regions worldwide.",
      "\u201cWe know that has an impact on rainfall, on food systems, on soil integrity in other countries. So it\u2019s not just something that\u2019s kind of small and isolated. It's a widespread problem,\u201d she said.",

      "A former surgeon is going on trial in France for the rape and sexual abuse of 299 victims over a period spanning more than three decades",
      "PARIS -- France is about to hold its largest-ever child sex abuse trial. While just one man is in the dock \u2014 a former surgeon accused of raping or sexual abusing 299 people, mostly child patients \u2014 activists hope the trial empowers other victims and helps expose other abusers long protected by societal taboos.",
      "Central to the trial are defendant Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec\u2019s chillingly detailed notebooks, which he used to document decades of sexual violence.",
      "Le Scouarnec, now 74, will face hundreds of victims during a four-month trial starting Monday in Vannes, in the Brittany region of northwestern France. He doesn't deny the charges, though he says he doesn't remember everything.",
      "Some survivors have no memory of the assaults, having been unconscious at the time to undergo surgery at Le Scouarnec's hands.",
      "The trial comes as activists are pushing to lift taboos surrounding sexual abuse. That was highlighted recently during the trial that made Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of others, France\u2019s symbol of fight against sexual violence.",
      "Child protection and women\u2019s rights groups and medical community associations see the trial as an opportunity to reaffirm that shame must change sides.",
      "\u201cIt should also mark a new step towards a justice system that listens and protects victims and firmly convicts aggressors,'' they said in a statement.",
      "Le Scouarnec faces up to 20 years in prison for rape, sexual assault and indecent acts committed with violence or surprise.",
      "The case began in 2017 when a 6-year-old neighbor denounced Le Scouarnec, who had touched her over the fence separating their properties.",
      "A subsequent search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedopornographic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions, according to investigation documents.",
      "In 2020, Le Scouarnec was sentenced to 15 years in prison for the rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces and a young patient.",
      "Le Scouarnec has admitted child abuse dating back to 1985-1986, according to investigation documents. Some cases couldn't be prosecuted, because the statute of limitations had expired.",
      "The Vannes trial will examine rapes and other abuses committed from 1989 to 2014 on 158 men and 141 women who were age 11 on average at the time.",
      "The doctor sexually abused both boys and girls when they were alone in their hospital rooms, according to the investigation documents. His strategy was to disguise sexual violence as a medical act, targeting young patients who were less likely to recall what had happened.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really remember the operation. I remembered the postoperation, a surgeon who was quite mean,\u201d one of the victims, Am\u00e9lie L\u00e9v\u00eaque, recalled of her time in the hospital at the age of 9 in 1991. \u201cI cried a lot, but I didn\u2019t think something like that had happened to me during this operation.\u201d",
      "Years later, she described feeling overwhelmed when she learned that her name appeared in Le Scouarnec\u2019s notebooks.",
      "\u201cThat was the beginning of the answers to a lifetime of questions, and then it was the beginning of the descent into hell as I left the lawyer\u2019s office,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like I had lost control of everything. I wasn\u2019t crazy, but now I had to face the truth of what had happened.\"",
      "She also described the emotional toll of the revelation.",
      "\u201cI fell into a deep depression ... My family tried to help, but I felt completely alone,\u201d she said.",
      "The Associated Press doesn't name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.",
      "Le Scouarnec's lawyer, Thibaut Kurzawa, told Sud-Ouest newspaper that his client would \u201canswer the judges' questions\u201d as he decided \u201cto face up to reality.\u201d",
      "The case could have come to light much earlier. Le Scouarnec had already been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child pornography and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time.",
      "Despite this, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the next year. Because of processing delays, the criminal record check requested by the Health Ministry at the time didn't include any mention of his past offenses.",
      "Even after being informed of his conviction, health authorities and hospital management didn't pursue disciplinary action.",
      "Some child protection groups joined the proceedings as civil parties. The lawyer for L\u2019Enfant Bleu association, Jean-Christophe Boyer, said that one key purpose is \u201cto do something, perhaps modify the legal framework ... to prevent this kind of situation from happening again.\u201d",

      "The owners of an island volcano in New Zealand where 22 tourists and local guides died in an eruption had their criminal conviction for failing to keep visitors safe overturned by a judge on Friday",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- The owners of an island volcano in New Zealand where 22 tourists and local guides died in an eruption had their criminal conviction for failing to keep visitors safe thrown out by a judge on Friday.",
      "The release of the decision followed a three-day hearing last October for the owners\u2019 company at the High Court in the city of Auckland where they appealed the charges laid by New Zealand's workplace health and safety regulator following the 2019 eruption of Whakaari, also known as White Island.",
      "The company, Whakaari Management \u2014 run by three brothers who own the active volcano on New Zealand's North Island \u2014 was ordered in March 2024 to pay millions of dollars in fines and restitutions to the victims of the eruption, who were mostly U.S. and Australian cruise ship passengers on a walking tour.",
      "Lawyers for the company filed an appeal against the criminal conviction the same month.",
      "The case hinged on whether Whakaari Management \u2014 which granted access to the volcano to tourists and scientific groups, collecting fees for permits \u2014 should have been in charge of safety at the volcano site under New Zealand\u2019s workplace health and safety laws. Anyone in charge of a workplace must ensure management of hazards and the safety of all there, including at entry and exit points.",
      "Survivors told the trial in emotional testimony during the company's 2023 trial that they had not been told the active volcano was dangerous when they paid to visit it. They were not supplied with protective equipment, and many were wearing clothing that made their horrific burns more damaging.",
      "In Friday's written ruling, Justice Simon Moore ruled the company did not have a duty under the relevant law to ensure that the walking tour workplace was without risks to health and safety. He agreed with the company's lawyers that the firm only granted access to the bare land to tourism business \u2014 and should not have been legally considered the entity that managed or controlled the workplace.",
      "The case had far-reaching implications and has already changed the laws governing New Zealand\u2019s adventure tourism industry, which is often based around outdoor thrills on or around the country\u2019s many natural hazards. Operators must now take all reasonable steps to inform customers of any serious risks.",
      "The lawyers for the company said during last October's hearing that if the conviction was allowed to stand, it would make other land owners reluctant to allow such activities to take place on their property \u2014 a suggestion rejected by the regulator."

      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered a zoo to improve the health of an African elephant named Ely, the first time the country\u2019s highest court has made such a move in favor of an animal.",
      "The court ordered that there be \u201ca constant improvement of her health and physical condition.\u201d",
      "The decision by a panel of four justices upheld a lower court\u2019s order last year in Ely\u2019s favor and experts believe it could set a precedent in Mexico recognizing that animals have rights.",
      "Advocates have argued that Ely suffered from depression, especially since the death of Maggie, the other elephant sharing her habitat, in 2016, as well as illnesses she suffered in captivity. Ely would bang against the walls of her enclosure and lost weight. Her defenders called her \u201cthe world\u2019s saddest elephant.\u201d",
      "That was when Diana Valencia, founder and director of the animal rights group Opening Cages and Opening Minds, met Ely. \u201cIt really moved me to see the state that she was in, it tore my soul and I made Ely a promise,\u201d Valencia said, who has continued to visit the elephant regularly over the years. She told Ely, \u201c'They aren't going to do the same to you.'\u201d",
      "Ely, who estimated to be between 43 and 45 years old, has lived at the San Juan de Aragon zoo in Mexico City for 13 years since being rescued from a circus.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s ruling follows another high court decision last month when it determined that Mexico City laws against animal mistreatment and cruelty were constitutional.",
      "Valencia conceded that the zoo had improved Ely\u2019s living conditions, but only after public pressure.",
      "The zoo expanded the elephant enclosure and added two more elephants in 2023 and 2024.",
      "Veterinarian Gabriela Uribe Acosta, director of zoo, said she was confident the zoo could fully comply with the court\u2019s order to improve Ely\u2019s life.",
      "She said a team of six people are responsible for keeping her enclosure of more than 78,000 square feet clean and another half dozen people are monitoring her health.",
      "Uribe Acosta dismissed assertions that Ely is depressed. She said the elephant was stable and had improved since the other elephants were added. She moves around more and has new vocalizations.",
      "She said that when Ely arrived in 2012, after years in a circus, she had a problem with her rear right leg that limited her mobility, as well as nutritional deficiencies resulting from a poor diet.",
      "But Wednesday\u2019s order could reverberate beyond Ely. Lawyer Sergio M\u00e9ndez Silva, litigation coordinator for the local Foundation for Justice, said \u201cMexico is taking a significant step with a precedent like this and I believe this will mark a before and after.\u201d",
      "Still, Valencia plans to continue fighting for all three of the zoo's elephants to be moved to a sanctuary in Brazil or the United States. \u201cI can't be satisfied because an elephant can't live in captivity, it hurts them mentally,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's one of the animals that most suffers in captivity.\u201d",

      "Pope Francis is continuing his slow recovery from double pneumonia and beating back speculation of an imminent death, resignation or conclave",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis continued his slow recovery from double pneumonia on Thursday, beating back speculation of an imminent death, resignation or conclave and signaling that he was still very much in charge, albeit in a weakened state.",
      "The 88-year-old pope once again slept well during the night at Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital, had breakfast and resumed his therapy Thursday morning in good spirits, the Vatican said. The results of more medical tests were expected later Thursday.",
      "Doctors on Wednesday reported further slight improvements in his clinical condition as his hospital stay neared the two-week mark on Friday. They said the kidney insufficiency that had been detected in recent days had receded, blood tests showed a slight improvement and a chest CT scan showed that his complex lung infection was taking the \u201cnormal evolution\u201d as it is being treated.",
      "The prognosis remained guarded, however. The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, is still receiving high flows of supplemental oxygen and respiratory physiotherapy to help his lungs expel fluid. But he hasn\u2019t had any more respiratory crises since Saturday, the Vatican said.",
      "Nevertheless, his near-term upcoming calendar of events was being changed: The Vatican cancelled a Holy Year audience scheduled for Saturday, and it remained to be seen if Francis would skip his Sunday noon blessing for the third week in a row. Longer term, Ash Wednesday loomed on the horizon March 5, the start of the church's Lenten season leading up to Holy Week and Easter, which this year falls on April 20.",
      "In past years, when Francis has battled bronchitis and influenza in winter, he has had to cut back his participation in Ash Wednesday and Holy Week events, which call for the pope to be outdoors in the cold leading services, participating in processions and presiding over prayers in the solemn period in which the faithful commemorate Christ's crucifixion and resurrection.",
      "Beyond that, Francis has a few major events coming up that he presumably would hope to keep if well enough. On April 27, he is due to canonize Carlo Acutis, considered to be the first millennial and digital-era saint. The Vatican considers the Italian teenager, who died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, as an inspiring role model for today's young Catholics.",
      "Another important appointment is the May 24 commemoration of the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicea, Christianity's first ecumenical council. The spiritual leader of the world\u2019s Orthodox Christians, Patriarch Bartholomew I, has invited Francis to join him in what is today's Iznik, Turkey to commemorate the anniversary, which he has called an important sign of reconciliation between the Catholic and Orthodox churches. Before he got sick, Francis said he hoped to go, though the Vatican hasn't confirmed the trip.",
      "Prayers for his heath continued to pour in from near and far, with a group of Mexican pilgrims in Rome for the Holy Year taking a detour to pray for Francis outside the Gemelli hospital.",
      "Lili Iparea Fernandez, from La Cruz, Mexico, had come to Rome with plans to attend Francis' Wednesday general audience this week, but it was cancelled.",
      "\u201cHowever, we firmly believe that the pope will recover because he is a very strong man,\u201d she said Thursday outside Gemelli. \u201cSo I invite everyone to believe firmly, with certainty, with confidence, with hope that the pope is going to be well.\u201d",
      "The dean of the College of Cardinals, Giovanni Battista Re, presided Wednesday night over what has now become a nightly appointment in St. Peter\u2019s Square, the 9 p.m. Rosary prayer.",
      "As is now popularly known thanks to the Oscar-nominated film \u201cConclave,\u201d the 91-year-old Re would have a key role in any papal death or conclave, called to preside over the funeral and organize the secret balloting in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new pope. Francis recently extended Re\u2019s term, keeping him on in the important job rather than naming someone new.",
      "But on Wednesday night, Re was merely one of the Catholic Church\u2019s most senior cardinals, an important point of reference for the men who lead the church, praying for Francis\u2019 speedy recovery.",
      "By now a certain rhythm appears to have emerged from the Vatican\u2019s updates: The pope receives treatments in the morning, including respiratory physiotherapy, and resumes work in the afternoon from his hospital room.",
      "The Vatican said Wednesday that he had appointed four new bishops and approved the creation of a new fundraising initiative to encourage donations to the Holy See, which has been enduring a financial crisis for years.",
      "Francis likely approved the bishop appointments a while back and the new norms for the fundraising entity were approved Feb. 11, before he was hospitalized. But the announcements made them official and suggested Francis was still very much in charge and governing.",

      "LYON, France -- A Tunisian national was sentenced late Wednesday to life imprisonment without parole, France\u2019s most severe sentence possible, over the killing of three people in a basilica in the French Riviera city of Nice in 2020, one of multiple attacks that year linked to Islamic extremism.",
      "Brahim Aouissaoui, 25, was charged with terrorist murder and attempted terrorist murder. He admitted responsibility for the attack during the trial in Paris, even though he had said he couldn\u2019t remember anything since then. He explained that he wanted to avenge Muslims killed around the world by Western nations.",
      "On Oct. 29, 2020, Aouissaoui killed worshippers Nadine Vincent, 60, and Simone Barreto, a 44-year-old French-Brazilian woman, and church worker Vincent Loqu\u00e8s, 55. Police officers fired at him as he lunged at them, shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d (God is great) and wielding a knife. He was shot and seriously wounded.",
      "The attack was the third in less than two months that French authorities attributed to Islamic extremists, and prompted the government to raise its security alert to the maximum level. It came while France was holding a trial over the 2015 attacks on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, which published caricatures of Islam\u2019s prophet. France at the time faced anger from many Muslims around the world for defending the cartoons and for its policies against Islamic radicalism.",

      "The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Cyprus\u2019 law enforcement authorities failed to live up to their obligation to thoroughly and effectively investigate a British teenager\u2019s claims that she had been gang-raped by a group of Israelis while ...",
      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus\u2019 law enforcement authorities failed to live up to their obligation to thoroughly and effectively investigate a British teenager\u2019s claims that she had been gang-raped by a group of Israelis while on a 2019 vacation in a popular resort town, the European Court of Human Rights ruled Thursday.",
      "In its ruling released Thursday, the court placed particular weight on the failure of the authorities to determine whether the woman \u2014 who was 18 at the time of the alleged rape \u2014 had ever consented to having sex with some of the suspects.",
      "According to the ruling, the woman had told authorities she rejected the suggestion of having sex with multiple partners. However, the suspects persisted in entering the hotel room where the alleged rape took place, disregarding her pleas for them to leave.",
      "Even though the woman was having sex with an Israeli friend of the suspects in that hotel room at the time, the court said investigators didn\u2019t establish whether the suspects had secured her consent. According to testimony, some of them only assumed they would because of her previous behavior.",
      "The court said investigators appeared not to take into account the woman\u2019s capacity to consent in light of testimony that she had consumed alcohol prior to the alleged rape and that traces of cocaine were found in her urine.",
      "Moreover, police and investigators took the suspects\u2019 statements that no rape had taken place \u201cat face value\u201d despite testimony that her Israeli partner \u201csaid he would arrange for his friends to have sex\u201d with her.",
      "This compounded what the court described as a series of flaws investigators in the initial state of the investigation, from a limited search of physical evidence such as fingerprints in the hotel room to failure to track down potential suspects or witnesses.",
      "\u201cThe Court observes that the present case reveals certain biases concerning women in Cyprus which impeded the effective protection of the applicant\u2019s rights as a victim of gender-based violence and which, if not reversed, run the risk of creating a background of impunity, discouraging victims\u2019 trust in the criminal justice system, despite the existence of a satisfactory legislative framework,\u201d the ruling said.",
      "The July, 2019 case made headlines in Cyprus, Britain and Israel when all 12 suspects were released without charge after the woman retracted her rape claims. The Cyprus attorney-general opted not to pursue legal proceedings against the suspects, while the woman was subsequently found guilty on a charge of public mischief and sentenced to a four-month suspended jail term.",
      "In the lower court ruling, the judge said the woman didn\u2019t tell the truth and tried to deceive the court with \u201cevasive\u201d statements. He said the woman had admitted to investigators that she made up the claims because she was \u201cashamed\u201d after finding out that some of the Israelis had videoed her having consensual sex with her Israeli boyfriend on their cellphones.",
      "In 2022, the Cyprus Supreme Court overturned the woman\u2019s conviction, citing among other reasons that she didn\u2019t have a lawyer present when police repeatedly questioned her and that the lower court misconstrued evidence, prejudicing proceedings against her.",
      "The ECHR ruling said given the conditions of the woman\u2019s questioning by police, \u201cthere is force in her argument\u201d that the \u201clong and repeated interviews\u201d prompted her to retract her rape allegations.",
      "Justice Abroad Director Michael Polak, who represented the woman both in Cyprus and at the ECHR, called the ruling a \u201clandmark decision for victims of sexual violence.\"",
      "\u201cThis ruling reinforces the fundamental principle that allegations of sexual violence must be investigated thoroughly and fairly, without institutional obstruction,\u201d he said."

      "North Korea says it has test-fired strategic cruise missiles to demonstrate its nuclear counter-attack capability",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea said Friday it had test-fired strategic cruise missiles to demonstrate its nuclear counter-attack capability, days after it vowed to respond to what it called escalating U.S.-led hostilities since the start of the Trump administration.",
      "The official Korean Central News Agency said leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the missile tests off the country\u2019s west coast Wednesday. They were the North\u2019s fourth missile launch event this year and the second of President Donald Trump's second term.",
      "The launches were designed to inform \u201cthe enemies, who are seriously violating our security environment and fostering and escalating the confrontation environment,\u201d of the North Korean military\u2019s counterattack capability and the readiness of its nuclear operations, KCNA said.",
      "Kim expressed satisfaction over the results of the drills and said the military must be fully ready to use its nuclear weapons, the report said.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement later Friday that it had detected and tracked the North Korean launches. It said the South Korean military maintains readiness to repel any potential provocation by North Korea based on the solid South Korea-U.S. military alliance.",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has boasted of his summitry with Kim during his first term and said he would reach out to Kim again. North Korea hasn\u2019t directly responded to Trump\u2019s overture as it continues its typical aggressive rhetoric against the U.S. and weapons testing activities.",
      "Many experts say Kim, now preoccupied with his support of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine with supply of weapons and troops, won\u2019t likely embrace Trump\u2019s outreach anytime soon. They say Kim could reconsider if he doubts he'll maintain North Korea's current solid cooperation with Russia after the war ends.",
      "Last Saturday, North Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry alleged the U.S. and its allies were ramping up more serious military provocations targeting North Korea since Trump took power. It cited the recent U.S.-South Korean aerial exercise involving a U.S. B-1B bomber and other reported activities involving U.S. military assets. A Defense Ministry statement said North Korea will counter the strategic threat of the U.S. with strategic means.",
      "Kim and Trump met three times from 2018-19 to discuss the fate of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, but their diplomacy derailed due to disputes over U.S.-led sanctions on the North. Kim has since sharply increased the pace of weapons tests to expand and modernize his nuclear arsenal. Having a bigger nuclear arsenal now, experts say Kim would think he could win greater U.S. concessions if he revives diplomacy with Trump.",

      "BERLIN -- Germany's top prosecutor has charged a suspected Islamic extremist with murder, attempted murder and membership in a terrorist organization abroad in connection with a deadly knife attack last year at a festival in the western German city of Solingen.",
      "The Aug. 24 violence left three dead and 10 wounded at a festival marking the city\u2019s 650th anniversary. Prosecutors previously said the alleged perpetrator shared the radical ideology of the Islamic State extremist group \u2014 and was acting on those beliefs when he stabbed his victims repeatedly from behind in the head and upper body.",
      "IS later claimed responsibility for the attack, without providing evidence. IS previously said on its news site that the attacker targeted Christians, and that the perpetrator carried out the assaults \u201cto avenge Muslims in Palestine and everywhere.\u201d",
      "The suspect was only identified as Issa Al H. in accordance with German privacy rules. He turned himself in after the attack.",
      "The federal prosecutor filed the charges Monday and announced them Thursday in a news release.",
      "Issa Al H. allegedly took an oath of allegiance to IS and announced his plan in a video sent to his IS contact, then traveled to the festival minutes later, the federal prosecutor said in a statement.",
      "He allegedly viewed the festival-goers as infidels and representatives of Western society upon whom he would seek revenge for military acts by Western states, the federal prosecutor said. His IS contact promised that the militant group would claim responsibility for the act and use it in their propaganda.",
      "Issa Al H. is a Syrian citizen who had applied for asylum in Germany. He was supposed to be deported to Bulgaria last year but reportedly disappeared for a time and avoided deportation.",
      "The Solingen attack prompted Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s government to announced new restrictions on knives and measures to make deportations easier. Days later, the government deported Afghan nationals to their homeland for the first time since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, following up on a pledge made in June.",
      "Migration was a major campaign issue during Germany\u2019s national election on Sunday, pushed to the forefront by five deadly attacks \u2014 including in Solingen \u2014 involving immigrants over the past nine months.",
      "IS declared its caliphate in large parts of Iraq and Syria about a decade ago, but now holds no control over any land and has lost many prominent leaders. The group is mostly out of global news headlines.",
      "Still, it continues to recruit members and claim responsibility for deadly attacks around the world, including lethal operations in Iran and Russia earlier this year that killed dozens of people. Its sleeper cells in Syria and Iraq still carry out attacks on government forces in both countries as well as U.S.-backed Syrian fighters.",

      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- An investigation by the Israeli military has determined that Hamas was able to carry out the deadliest attack in Israeli history on Oct. 7, 2023, because the much more powerful Israeli army misjudged the militant group\u2019s intentions and underestimated its capabilities.",
      "The findings, released Thursday, could pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to launch a widely demanded broader inquiry to examine the political decision-making that preceded the attack.",
      "Many Israelis believe the failures of Oct. 7 extend beyond the military and blame Netanyahu for a failed policy of deterrence and containment in the years leading up to the attack. That approach included allowing Qatar to send suitcases of cash into Gaza and sidelining Hamas' rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority.",
      "The prime minister has not taken responsibility, saying he will answer tough questions only after the war, which has been paused for nearly six weeks by a tenuous ceasefire. Despite public pressure, including from the families of the roughly 1,200 people killed in the Oct. 7 attack and the 251 taken as hostages into Gaza, Netanyahu has resisted calls for a commission of inquiry.",
      "The military's main findings were that the region\u2019s most powerful and sophisticated military misread Hamas\u2019 intentions, underestimated its capabilities and was wholly unprepared for the surprise attack by thousands of heavily armed militants in the early morning hours of a major Jewish holiday.",
      "The military\u2019s findings are in line with past conclusions reached by officials and analysts. The military released only a summary of the report and military officials outlined its findings.",
      "\u201cOct. 7 was a complete failure,\u201d said one military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.",
      "A central misconception was that Hamas, which seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority in 2007, was more interested in governing the territory than fighting Israel, the inquiry found. The military also misjudged the militant group\u2019s capabilities.",
      "Military planners had envisioned that, at worst, Hamas could stage a ground invasion from up to eight border points, the official said. In fact, Hamas had more than 60 attack routes.",
      "Intelligence assessed in the aftermath of the attack has shown Hamas came close to staging the offensive on three earlier occasions but delayed it for unknown reasons, the official said.",
      "The official said that in the hours before the attack, there were signs that something was amiss, including when Hamas fighters switched their phones over to Israeli SIM cards.",
      "The perception that Hamas did not want war guided decision makers away from taking action that might have thwarted the attack. The Israeli military official said intelligence shows that Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack who was killed last October, had begun planning it as early as 2017.",
      "With the military off guard on a holiday weekend, Hamas launched a heavy wave of rockets that allowed thousands of fighters to burst through the security fence or fly over it on hang gliders. They knocked out surveillance cameras and quickly overwhelmed hundreds of soldiers stationed along the border.",
      "From there they advanced to key highway intersections and attacked troops dispatched to the area, including some senior officers, disrupting the military\u2019s command and control, according to a second military official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "For the first three hours after the attack, Hamas fighters marauded through border communities and a music festival with little resistance. That was when most of the 251 hostages were taken and most people were killed, the official said. The official said the chaos led to friendly fire incidents, although he said there were not many, without disclosing a figure.",
      "It took hours for the military to regain control and days until the area was fully cleared of militants.",
      "According to the first official, the report blamed the military for being overconfident in its knowledge and not showing enough doubt in its core concepts and beliefs. It did not place blame on any individual soldiers or officers, but is likely to pave the way for a reckoning in the military and eventual dismissals.",
      "Some high-ranking officers have already resigned, including the former head of military intelligence and Israel\u2019s top general, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, who steps down next week."

It\u2019s the fourth time that Aceh, the only province in Indonesia to practice Shariah law, has caned people for homosexuality since the Islamic law was implemented in 2006 as a concession made by the government to end a long-running separatist rebellion.",
      "The men, aged 24 and 18, were whipped across the back dozens of times by a team of five enforcers wearing robes and hoods. They were given a break to drink after 20 strokes and their wounds were treated.",
      "The men were arrested in November after residents suspected them of being gay and broke into their rented room, where they were caught naked and hugging each other, and took them to Sharia police.",
      "A Shariah court on Monday sentenced the two college students to receive 85 and 80 strokes respectively, but they were caned 82 and 77 times after a remission for time spent in prison. One of the men had to be carried because he was too weak to move after the last lash.",
      "Two other people were also sentenced to 34 and 8 strokes each for gambling.",
      "Indonesia\u2019s secular central government granted Aceh the right to implement Islamic Shariah law in 2006 as part of a peace deal to end a decades-long separatist war. A religious police and court system have been established, and the law was a significant strengthening of Shariah in the region.",
      "Aceh implemented an expansion of Islamic bylaws and criminal code in 2015 that extended Shariah law to the province\u2019s non-Muslims, who account for about 1% of the population. The region allows up to 100 lashes for morality offenses including gay sex and sex between unmarried people.",

      "At a September news conference, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas had been using tunnels under the border to import arms and was trying to rebuild the military machine it unleashed on Israel in its Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.",
      "However, Israeli media reported in September that the tunnels had not been used for years. Israel\u2019s Haaretz news outlet, citing military officials, said Israeli troops had found nine tunnels running under the Philadelphi corridor, all sealed from the Egyptian side since Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi came to power in 2013 and launched a campaign to destroy tunnels.",

      "In the second phase, Hamas was to release the rest of the living hostages in exchange for more prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal and a lasting ceasefire. The third phase would see the exchange of remains and the start of Gaza's daunting reconstruction.",
      "Negotiations over the second phase were supposed to begin in early February, but so far only limited preparatory talks have been held.",
      "Netanyahu says he remains committed to bringing back all the hostages and destroying the military and governing capabilities of Hamas. Those aims are likely incompatible, however, as Hamas still rules Gaza and has ordered its fighters to kill hostages if their rescue appears imminent.",

It withdrew soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but continued to control the territory\u2019s airspace, its coastline and all of its border crossings except Rafah.",
      "An Israeli decision to stay in the corridor could also further strain relations with Egypt, an American ally that has served as a key mediator with Hamas. Egypt has warned that it could undermine its nearly half century-old peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of American influence in the region.",
      "The United States has not taken a position on control of the corridor, and U.S. President Donald Trump has not said how it might figure into his proposal for Gaza\u2019s roughly 2 million Palestinians to be relocated to other countries so the U.S. can redevelop the territory as a tourist destination.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The number of babies born in South Korea rebounded for the first time in nine years in 2024, welcome news for a country grappling with one of the the world\u2019s most serious demographic crises.",
      "South Korea\u2019s statistics agency said Wednesday that 238,300 babies were born last year, an increase of 8,300 from a year earlier. It said the country\u2019s fertility rate \u2014 the average number of babies born to each woman in their reproductive years \u2014 was 0.75 in 2024, up from 0.72 in 2023.",
      "It\u2019s the first time that the yearly number of births has increased since 2015.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say this is a considerably meaningful rebound,\u201d Choi Yoon Kyung, an expert at the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education, said. \u201cWe still have to see figures in the next few years to find whether it was a temporary rebound or it was driven by structural changes.\u201d",
      "Park Hyun Jung, a senior official at the Statistics Korea, said that her agency assessed the increase in births was partly attributable to an increase in marriages among couples who delayed weddings during the COVID-19 pandemic period.",
      "Park said another factor behind the rebound was a growing number of people entering their early 30s. She also cited a government survey showing a small increase in the number of young people hoping to have children after marriage.",
      "Official data show South Korea\u2019s fertility rate has been the lowest in the developed world in recent years. In 2022, it was the only country whose fertility rate was below 1 among members of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "The low fertility rate is considered as a major potential threat to South Korea\u2019s economy, Asia's fourth largest, as it will cause labor shortages and greater welfare spendings. South Korea\u2019s central and regional governments have been increasingly offering a variety of financial incentives and other support programs to those who give birth to children.",
      "But experts say it\u2019s will be extremely difficult to address the country's demographic challenges as young people do not want to have to babies owing to a mix of factors that make it difficult to raise them in this brutally competitive, fast-changing country. They cite expensive housing, low levels of social mobility, the huge cost of raising and educating children and a culture that requires women to handle far more of childcare.",
      "Park said that the fertility rate will likely stay on an upward trend at least for another year. But observers say it remains to be seen whether the rate will go back down as post-pandemic marriages even out. The country\u2019s demographic structure will also eventually see a drop in the people in their early 30s.",
      "Some experts argue the government should focus on supporting young couples who want to have babies, rather than providing broad programs meant to address diverse social problems.",
      "\u201cThere are still people with solid wills to have a family and babies. When we help them realize their hopes, our fertility rate won\u2019t suffer a steep, 45-degree drop,\u201d Choi, the expert, said."

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- A new peace deal between Senegal and a separatist rebel group in the country\u2019s southern region has been touted by the government as a key step in ending one of Africa\u2019s longest conflicts. Analysts, however, say it did not involve all the rebels and fails to address the root causes of the conflict.",
      "The deal, signed by the government and the Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance was announced by Senegalese Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko during a visit to neighboring Guinea-Bissau on Monday.",
      "Past peace deals have failed to end the fighting in the Casamance region, which is separated from the rest of Senegal by the nation of Gambia and has historically suffered from lower development rates and access to markets in the more prosperous north.",

      "\u201cConvene your congress and make a decision. All groups must lay their arms and the PKK must dissolve itself,\u201d Ocalan said, according to a message that was read in Kurdish and Turkish by pro-Kurdish party politicians who visited Ocalan earlier in the day.",
      "Ocalan\u2019s momentous announcement is part of a new effort for peace between the group and the Turkish state, which was initiated in October by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli. The far-right politician suggested that Ocalan could be granted parole if his group renounces violence and disbands.",
      "Ocalan, 75, has been imprisoned on the island of Imrali, off Istanbul, since 1999, after being convicted of treason. Despite his incarceration, he continues to wield significant influence over the PKK. The group's leadership is widely expected to heed any call Ocalan makes, although some factions within the group could resist, analysts say.",
      "The peace effort comes at a time when Erdogan may need support from the DEM party in parliament to enact a new constitution that could allow him to stay in power.",

      "The DEM party has long pressed for greater democracy in Turkey, rights for the country\u2019s Kurdish population and to improve conditions for the imprisoned Ocalan.",
      "Turkish officials haven't said what Kurdish groups may have been promised as part of the peace effort.",
      "There was no immediate reaction from the PKK's leadership, which is based in northern Iraq.",
      "The group, founded by Ocalan in 1978, has led an insurgency in Turkey\u2019s southeast since 1984. The PKK is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies. Previous peace efforts have ended with failure \u2014 the most recent time in 2015.",
      "In the predominantly Kurdish cities of Diyarbakir and Van in southeast Turkey, people gathered in public spaces, dancing in anticipation of the announcement. They had hoped to watch it on large screens, but authorities permitted only a voice recording to be broadcast.",
      "In his message, Ocalan highlighted the reasons behind the PKK\u2019s armed struggle, including the state\u2019s refusal to recognize a Kurdish identity. The statement went on to suggest that there was no longer any reason for armed conflict.",
      "\u201cThere is no alternative to democracy in the pursuit and realization of a political system. Democratic consensus is the fundamental way,\u201d Ocalan said in his message.",

      "Efkan Ala, a deputy chairman of Erdogan\u2019s governing party, who was involved in previous peace efforts, said that the group should heed Ocalan\u2019s call.",
      "\u201cIf the terrorist organization evaluates this call, lays down its arms and gathers to dissolve itself, Turkey will be freed from its shackles,\u201d the state-run Anadolu Agency quoted Ala as saying.",
      "In Iraq, Hoshyar Zebari, an Iraqi-Kurdish politician who served as foreign minister in the Iraqi government, described Ocalan\u2019s statement as a \u201chistoric and powerful word.\u201d",
      "\u201cIts timing was appropriate and it will have a positive impact in northeastern Syria, Iraqi Kurdistan and Turkey as well,\u201d said Zebari, a senior official of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, which has maintained good relations with Turkey and has been at odds with the PKK.",
      "In northeastern Syria, hundreds of people took to the streets to celebrate. Kurds in the region hope that an end to the PKK-Turkey conflict will also mean the end of the conflict between the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, and Turkish-backed groups in Syria.",
      "Revelers danced in the street in the city of Qamishli and waved flags featuring Ocalan\u2019s portrait alongside the Kurdish flag.",

      "However, he added during a news conference, \u201cOcalan\u2019s call regarding disarmament and the dissolution of the party concerns only the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party and its forces; it has no connection to our forces.\u201d",
      "At the celebration in Qamishli, Lezgin Ibrahim, a Kurdish researcher at the Euphrates Center for Strategic Studies, said, \u201cTurkey always uses the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party as a pretext to launch attacks against Kurds in Syria and the Syrian Democratic Forces. The PKK\u2019s dissolution means it can no longer be a pretext for Turkey, which will have positive outcomes for Syrians, and Kurds will gain a political role.\u201d",
      "Murat Kilic, who was among those listening to the message being delivered in the Turkish city of Diyarbakir, expressed his excitement over the announcement.",
      "\u201d(Ocalan) has developed a new road map as an answer to the suffering that has been going on in this country for years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe message that leader Ocalan gave is binding for us.\u201d",
      "Kilic said, however, that many people who have relatives or friends in the conflict would be apprehensive.",
      "\u201cMany of the people who have given their (loved ones) to the ground in this struggle will of course have an emotional void at first.\u201d",
      "Mazlum Tenha, a lawyer, also voiced support for the call to disarm.",
      "\u201cIf the founder of this movement is making this call, we will show our loyalty to the leadership and stand behind this movement, this call, until the end,\u201d he said.",
      "Although Tenha lamented the fact that details of the possible agreement between Ocalan and the state weren't disclosed, he said that he was hopeful that Kurds would be granted more rights.",
      "A group of mothers or other relatives of people who disappeared in what they believe were politically-motivated assassinations in the 1980s and 1990s, were among hundreds of people and journalists who witnessed the announcement in Istanbul. The group - known as the Saturday Mothers because of the vigils they held in Istanbul on Saturdays - cheered and applauded after Ocalan's message was read.",
      "Even amid the latest peace efforts, Erdogan\u2019s government has widened a crackdown on the opposition, arresting journalists and politicians. Several elected Kurdish mayors have been ousted from office and replaced with state-appointed officials.",
      "Thursday's meeting was the third time DEM party officials have met with Ocalan as part of the peace efforts. The officials have also met with Selahattin Demirtas, an imprisoned former pro-Kurdish party leader, and traveled to Iraq for talks with Kurdish leaders there.",

      "Economic and climate-related challenges put the yearly sacrifice and feast out of reach for most Moroccans, Ahmed Toufiq, the kingdom\u2019s minister of Islamic Affairs, said late Wednesday evening. Reading a letter from the King on state-run Al Aoula television, Toufiq said it was Morocco's duty to acknowledge circumstances in which livestock shortages have led prices to skyrocket.",
      "\u201cPerforming it in these difficult circumstances will cause real harm to large segments of our people, especially those with limited income,\u201d the king, who is also Morocco's highest religious authority, wrote in the letter.",
      "Eid al-Adha, which takes place this year in early June, is an annual \u201cfeast of sacrifice\u201d in which Muslims slaughter livestock to honor a passage of the Quran in which the prophet Ibrahim prepared to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to God, who intervened and replaced the child with a sheep. It's a major holiday from Senegal to Indonesia, with traditions so embedded that families have been known to take out loans to buy sheep.",
      "The prices have become so exorbitant that 55% of families surveyed by the Moroccan NGO Moroccan Center for Citizenship last year said they struggled to cover the costs of purchasing sheep and the utensils needed to prepare them.",
      "That's in part because of a six-year drought in North Africa that's caused unrelenting inflation to hit food markets.",
      "The sheep price spikes are driven by increasingly sparse pastures, which offer less grazing room and raise the costs of feed for herders and farmers. Morocco's agricultural minister told reporters earlier this month that rainfall this season was currently 53% below the last 30 years' annual average and sheep and cattle herds had shrunk 38% since 2016, the last time Morocco conducted a livestock census.",

      "It's the first time in 29 years that Morocco has asked citizens to forego holiday feasting and reflects that food prices remain a struggle for many despite Morocco's transformation from a largely agrarian nation to a mixed economy whose cities have some of the Middle East and Africa's most modern infrastructure. King Hassan II issued similar decrees three times throughout his reign, during wartime, drought and when the IMF mandated Morocco end food subsidies.",

      "MAE SOT, Thailand -- Eighty-four Indonesians freed from scam centers in Myanmar arrived at the Thai border city of Mae Sot earlier on Thursday in an ongoing repatriation effort that follows a crackdown by Thailand, Myanmar and China.",
      "Two buses with the Indonesians on board drove across the Second Thailand Myanmar Friendship Bridge, accompanied by police escort. The vehicles then entered a checkpoint area, where passengers were seen being taken in batches for a screening that includes a health check and identity verification.",
      "They were among more than 7,000 people from across the world currently being held in the Myanmar border town Myawaddy.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people were believed to had been lured to work in Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos to commit scams against people across the world through false romances, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes. Many who end up in these areas were recruited under false pretenses, only to find themselves trapped in virtual slavery.",
      "Last week, the Indonesian Foreign Affairs Ministry said they were coordinating to repatriate as many as 270 of their citizens stranded in Myanmar after being taken out of scam centers.",
      "Judha Nugraha, director of Indonesian citizen protection at the ministry, said the 84 Indonesians will fly to Jakarta on two commercial flights on Friday. He did not immediately clarify why only 84 were being repatriated.",
      "Nugraha has said that approximately 6,800 Indonesians have fallen victim to illegal job scams, ending up in online gambling operations or bogus investment schemes in Myanmar and several other countries over the past few years.",
      "The crackdown and repatriation effort came shortly after Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra paid a visit to Beijing earlier this month, where she told Chinese leader Xi Jinping that Thailand would crack down on the scam networks.",
      "As part of Thailand\u2019s crackdown, it also has cut off electricity, internet and gas supplies to several areas in Myanmar hosting scam centers along the border, citing national security.",
      "More than 600 Chinese citizens were repatriated on charter flights over four days last week. Due to the large number, Thailand is allowing Beijing to handle most processing on their return to China.",
      "Earlier this month, some 260 people from 20 different countries, ranging from Ethiopia to Brazil to the Philippines, crossed from Myanmar into Thai custody. Many of them have returned to their home countries since, but over 100 remain in Thailand awaiting repatriation, Thai officials said.",
      "The unprecedented size and scale of the repatriation effort is straining Thai government resources, and leading to delays for those waiting to be repatriated to their home countries. Officials from Thailand, Myanmar and China are expected to meet soon to address the logistics of the crackdown as the apparent delay grows concerns about a possible humanitarian crisis along the border.",

      "Romania\u2019s anti-organized crime agency, DIICOT, said in a statement Thursday that prosecutors approved a \"request to modify the obligation preventing the defendants from leaving Romania,\u201d but that judicial control measures remained in place.

The minister insisted it didn\u2019t amount to pressure.",
      "In December a court in Bucharest ruled that the case against the Tates and the two Romanian women could not go to trial because of multiple legal and procedural irregularities on the part of the prosecutors.",
      "That decision by the Bucharest Court of Appeal was a huge setback for DIICOT, but it did not mean the defendants could walk free. The case has not been closed, and there is also a separate legal case against the brothers in Romania."

    "story": [
      "The Chinese embassy in Thailand has confirmed that a group of Uyghur men detained in Thailand for more than a decade have been deported to China",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- A group of Uyghur men detained in Thailand for more than a decade have been deported to China, the Chinese embassy in Thailand confirmed Thursday. The men last month made a public appeal to halt the deportation, saying they faced imprisonment and possible death in China.",
      "On Wednesday, Thai lawmakers, activists, and lawyers raised the alarm about the possible deportation of the men. In a statement on Facebook, the Chinese embassy said Thursday that 40 Chinese nationals who entered Thailand illegally were deported to China\u2019s northwestern Xinjiang province by a chartered flight on Thursday. It said the men had been detained in Thailand for more than 10 years due to \u201ccomplicated international factors.\u201d",
      "Several Thai lawmakers and international officials had urged the Thai government to halt the deportation, warning it would amount to a serious rights abuse.",
      "\u201cThe Uyghurs must not be returned to face persecution. They have been held in detention for 11 years. We have violated their human rights enough. There are better solutions,\u201d Thai lawmaker Kannavee Suebsang wrote in a post on X.",
      "The deportation had been scheduled for early Thursday morning, according to a Thai government official, a foreign official, and three people in touch with Thai authorities. All five people declined to be named to disclose sensitive internal information.",
      "Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported Thursday that \u201c40 Chinese illegal immigrants\u201d had been repatriated, quoting a police official who said they had been \u201ddeceived by criminal organizations\u201d and stranded in Thailand. Photos of those repatriated by China and shared by the embassy appeared to show people of Uyghur ethnicity.",
      "On Tuesday, an advocate who was in contact with the Uyghurs daily said she lost contact with the men. On Wednesday evening, an AP journalist witnessed heightened security around the detention center where the men were held, with police briefly detaining the journalist and searching his belongings. Trucks with black sheets covering their windows headed for an airport early Thursday, according to staff working for Suebsang and Uyghur activist Polat Sayim.",
      "China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not confirm details of the deportation.",
      "The Uyghurs are a Turkic, majority Muslim ethnicity native to Xinjiang. After decades of conflict with Beijing over discrimination and suppression of their cultural identity, the Chinese government launched a brutal crackdown on the Uyghurs that some Western governments deem a genocide. Hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs, possibly a million or more, were swept into camps and prisons, with former detainees reporting abuse, disease, and in some cases, death.",
      "More than 300 Uyghurs fleeing China were detained in 2014 by Thai authorities. In 2015, Thailand deported 109 detainees to China against their will, prompting an international outcry. Another group of 173 Uyghurs, mostly women and children, were sent to Turkey, leaving 53 Uyghurs stuck in Thai immigration detention and seeking asylum.",
      "Since then, five have died in detention, including two children. Advocates and relatives say the 48 remaining Uyghurs were subject to harsh conditions in Thai immigration detention and were forbidden contact with relatives, lawyers, and international organizations. The Thai government\u2019s treatment of the detainees may constitute a violation of international law, according to a 2024 letter sent to the Thai government by U.N. human rights experts.",
      "Schoochart Kanpai, an attorney representing the men, said if confirmed, their deportation would be a violation of Thai and international law.",
      "\u201cAny action to deport them without due process would not only violate Thai law but also severely damage Thailand\u2019s international reputation,\u201d Kanpai said.",
      "For over a decade, the Uyghur detainees have presented a diplomatic conundrum for Thailand, which is caught between China, its largest trading partner, and the U.S., its traditional military ally.",
      "Beijing claims the Uyghurs are jihadists, but has not presented evidence of that. Uyghur activists and Western politicians say the men are innocent and have repeatedly expressed alarm over their possible deportation, saying they face persecution, imprisonment, and possible death in China.",
      "Facing potential backlash from all sides, Thailand detained them indefinitely.",
      "Discussions to deport them restarted after Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra took office last year. Her father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, maintains close links to top Chinese officials.",
      "In December, shortly after Paetongtarn met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing, Thai officials began secretly discussing plans to deport the Uyghurs, according to four people familiar with the matter. The people declined to be named for fear of retaliation to themselves or their contacts.",
      "But pressure mounted on the Thai government after AP reported in January that Thai authorities were discussing deporting the Uyghurs. The United Nations special rapporteur on torture and Japanese, American and European officials issued statements expressing concern.",
      "U.S. and other officials expressed concern again this week following reports about the possibility of imminent deportation.",
      "\u201cThese men face torture, imprisonment, and even death upon return to China,\u201d U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee members Jim Risch and Jeanne Shaheen said Tuesday. They said the men\u2019s deportation would be \u201cill-advised\u201d and that the U.S. had proposed practical options to resolve the status of the Uyghurs in Thailand, their statement said.",
      "Rayhan Asat, an attorney who had petitioned the U.N. to block the deportation of the men, said she had notified contacts in the U.S. government on Thursday.",
      "\u201cIf the deportation occurs, Thailand will effectively issue death sentences, thereby aiding and abetting the Chinese government in committing atrocities,\u201d Asat said.",

      "The U.K. government has provided provisional approval to the creation of a second runway at Gatwick Airport outside London",
      "LONDON -- The U.K. government gave its provisional backing Thursday to the creation of a second runway at Gatwick Airport outside London if certain improvements were met, including on noise reduction \u2014 a move that has been met with incredulity from environmental campaigners.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said in a written statement that she was \"minded to approve\u201d the expansion, which would involve moderately moving Gatwick's northern standby runway used for planes to taxi or as a backup.",
      "The original Gatwick project, which was rejected but then revised by planning inspectors, means that the final approval may be delayed by nine months.",
      "Under the new plan, Gatwick will have to ensure at least 50% of passengers traveling to and from the airport do so by public transport and take steps to mitigate noise.",
      "Gatwick, which is about 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of London and serves more than 40 million passengers a year, is the country's busiest single-runway airport, and second-busiest overall behind London's Heathrow Airport.",
      "Under the plan, Gatwick will have to move the current emergency runway 12 meters (39 feet) north away from the main runway in order to meet international safety standards. That would allow it to be used for departures of narrow-bodied planes such as Airbus A320s and Boeing 737s.",
      "The project, which will be funded privately, is expected to cost 2.2 billion pounds ($2.8 billion), could be completed by the end of the decade, if construction begins later this year.",
      "The expansion would allow it to cater for another 100,000 flights a year, taking capacity up to more than 380,000. It's projected to create 14,000 new jobs and generate 1 billion pounds ($1.26 billion) in annual economic benefits to the country.",
      "Gatwick, which is majority-owned by France-based VINCI Airports, has until April 24 to formally respond to the new proposals, while Alexander is expected to make a final decision shortly after that date, although a deadline has been extended to Oct. 27.",

      "That is not what many scientists and climate activists envisioned in the fight against climate change. And it is endangering progress on the greenhouse gas-reduction goals that scientists say are necessary to manage the damage from burning fossil fuels that warms the planet.",
      "Across the nation, tech companies are snapping up real estate and seeking new power projects to feed their energy-hungry operations.",
      "In some cases, Big Tech is building climate-friendlier projects like solar, wind, geothermal or battery storage.",
      "But industry decision-makers are also turning to natural gas for what they say is a cheap and reliable source of power, raising the prospect that gas-fired power will play a bigger role \u2014 and for a longer period of time \u2014 than even they had anticipated.",
      "\u201cGas is growing faster now and in the medium term than ever before,\u201d said Corianna Mah, a power and renewables analyst at data analytics firm Enverus.",
      "Before the spike in electricity demand last year, many in the industry had assumed that there would be few new gas plants and that the nation's fleet would gradually retire in favor of a grid powered by wind, solar, geothermal, batteries and possibly the next generation of nuclear power \u2014 sources that don't emit the planet-warming greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.",
      "For many countries, that ramp down is happening as they work toward the goal of slashing their emissions to zero \u2014 or at least, net zero \u2014 by 2050, which scientists say could help the world avoid the worst effects of climate change.",
      "In the U.S., the electric power sector is the second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, according to government figures. And the construction of every new natural gas plant \u2014 built to last for decades \u2014 is a setback for climate goals, said John Quigley, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Kleinman Center for Energy Policy.",

      "That means natural gas is once again attractive to investors over solar and wind, he said.",
      "\u201cIn the near term, the reality has dawned on most that it has to be gas,\u201d Jennings said.",
      "Industry officials say they strive to deliver electricity that is clean, reliable and affordable.",
      "For instance, some new gas plants are replacing higher-pollution coal-fired plants, some are designed to run only at times of high demand, some are paired with battery storage or a wind farm nearby and some are designed with carbon-capture technology or to run on a hydrogen blend, said Alex Bond of the Edison Electric Institute, which represents U.S. investor-owned electric companies.",
      "At the very least, building gas-fired capacity will have high-level political support.",
      "In his remarks to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month, President Donald Trump declared that he'd issue \u201cemergency declarations\u201d to get coal - and gas-plants built to make the U.S. a superpower of manufacturing, cryptomining and artificial intelligence.",
      "But Amanda Levin of the Natural Resources Defense Council said the U.S. must take big steps by 2035 to reduce its reliance on gas.",
      "That means slashing a fleet of roughly 1,500 gas plants down to about 100 if the U.S. is to meet strong climate commitments and preserve a chance of addressing climate change, she said.",
      "Still, she said there are reasons to be optimistic that gas plant projects on the drawing board won\u2019t get built.",
      "In recent weeks, Chinese tech startup Deepseek released a new AI model that it boasted was on par with similar models from U.S. companies and at a fraction of the cost \u2014 calling into question the need for a massive expansion of energy-hungry data centers.",
      "And some analysts believe utilities overestimate the electricity they\u2019ll need, essentially by double- or triple-counting data center proposals when firms express interest in multiple locations \u2014 but only build in one.",
      "Besides, Levin said, data center operators are getting better at energy efficiency, particularly in how they cool their servers.",
      "Even if all the gas plants are built, they may not get used, she said.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of reasons,\u201d Levin said, \"for why we might not actually see all of this (demand) materialize.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Vietnam is revising its energy plans to focus more on large solar farms and less on reliance on coal and natural gas",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- Vietnam is revising its energy plans to focus more on large solar farms and less on reliance on coal and natural gas. The fast-growing economy now aims to get 16% of its energy from the sun \u2014 more than triple its earlier target of just 5%.",
      "A draft of the new policy outline, likely to be finalized in coming weeks, scraps plans to build offshore wind turbines, instead building more onshore wind capacity, rooftop solar and energy storage.",
      "Offshore wind and new gas projects have proven expensive and difficult. Large solar farms are cheaper and easier to build.",
      "But Vietnam also is emphasizing expansion of large solar farms to meet soaring demand for power generation. It forecasts it will need more than 211 gigawatts of energy by 2030 as its economy grows, 40% more than its previous estimate and more than Germany's current total capacity.",
      "\u201cThis reflects both an overall increase in potential power demand by 2030 and the fact that LNG (or liquefied natural gas) projects are not on track to be completed by 2030,\u201d said Giles Cooper, a partner at the international law firm Allens based in Hanoi who specializes in energy policy.",
      "Solar power expanded rapidly in Vietnam from 2018 to 2020, helped by generous government policies, as it leaped past its neighbors and some richer nations like the United Kingdom. But construction of new solar capacity stalled in 2020 as the Southeast Asian nation realized that its creaky electricity grid was getting overloaded since electricity was only available when the sun shone.",
      "\u201cIt was like the market almost stopped,\u201d said Dimitri Pescia, of Berlin-based thinktank Agora Energiewende.",
      "Use of polluting coal, which releases earth-warming gases into the atmosphere, has surged and Vietnam is set to become of the world's top five coal importers, displacing Taiwan, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Like many other countries, Vietnam still needs to upgrade its rickety grid, which has failed to keep up with rapid growth of clean power generation. However, it has made improvements and gained experience dealing with energy sources that aren\u2019t always availables, Cooper said.",
      "Last year, authorities allowed electricity-guzzling factories to buy power directly from energy producers, aiming to ease pressure on the overstrained power grid and help big manufacturers like Samsung Electronics meet their climate targets. But that was hindered by a lack of space to build clean energy projects close to factories.",
      "Solar energy is \u201cseen as the most promising technology to kick start\u201d those direct purchases, Cooper said.",
      "But while it's building clean power capacity, Vietnam is also ramping up use of coal. That's partly to make up for lost hydropower capacity due to drought, and also to meet soaring demand as businesses shift factories from China to Vietnam.",
      "Vietnam is Southeast Asia's second-biggest coal producer after Indonesia. It also imported 50 million ton of coal in the first three quarters of 2024 \u2014 a 31% increase, according to government data.",
      "Pescia noted that Vietnam\u2019s coal-fired power plants aren\u2019t very old and operators have yet to recoup their investments.",
      "\u201cPhasing out coal in a country like Vietnam will take more time,\u201d he said.",

      "Overall, while layoffs remain low by historical standards, some high-profile companies have announced job cuts already this year.",
      "Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines and Facebook parent company Meta have all trimmed their workforces already in 2025.",
      "Late in 2024, GM, Boeing, Cargill and Stellantis announced layoffs.",

      "Cloud believes it's more imperative than ever for athletes across American professional sports to speak out against racial discrimination in the face of President Donald Trump's sweeping orders to end government diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and as corporations and major institutions face pressure to roll back DEI policies aimed at creating opportunities for minority groups.",
      "\u201cThe systems of power are working as they always were intended to work,\" Cloud said. \"And it\u2019s time to break down a system that has only been about white men.\u201d",

      "With his attempt to abolish diversity and inclusion programs, Trump has sought to ban transgender athletes from girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports and has directed schools and universities to eliminate diversity initiatives or risk losing federal money. That includes no longer teaching material dealing with race and sexuality \u2014 part of his effort to end \u201cwokeness\u201d in schools.",

James headlined the \u201cMore Than A Vote\u201d Campaign, formed soon after police shot and killed Floyd and Breonna Taylor, to target systemic voter suppression and encourage Black people to vote.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that their activism and decision to not go to the White House was a primary or even a major factor in the outcome of the 2020 election,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cBut no doubt, those athletes and athletes who have similar profiles as them leveraging their platform to promote freedom, human rights ... it's extremely powerful.\u201d",

      "Congress sent to President Donald Trump's desk a repeal of a fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas production",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Republican-controlled Congress has voted to repeal a federal fee on oil and gas producers who release high levels of methane, undoing a major piece of former President Joe Biden's climate policy aimed at controlling the planet-warming \u201csuper pollutant.\" The fee, which had not gone into effect, was expected to bring in billions of dollars.",
      "The Senate on Thursday voted along party lines 52-47 to repeal the fee, following a similar House vote on Wednesday. The measure now goes to President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it.",
      "Methane is a much stronger global warming gas than carbon dioxide, especially in the short term, and is to blame for about one-third of the world\u2019s warming so far. Oil and gas producers are among the biggest U.S. methane emitters and controlling it is critical to address climate change.",
      "Most major oil and gas companies do not release enough methane to trigger the fee, which is $900 per ton, an amount that would increase to $1,500 by 2026. The measure was part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, but the Environmental Protection Agency didn\u2019t formally set rules until late last year.",
      "That timing made it vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to pass a resolution to undo rules that are finalized towards the end of a president's term. If those resolutions pass and the president signs them, the rule is terminated and agencies can\u2019t issue a similar one again.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sorry testament to the influence of Big Oil on Capitol Hill that one of the top priorities of Congress is a blatant handout to the worst actors in the fossil fuel industry,\" said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen\u2019s energy program.",
      "The American Petroleum Institute, the largest lobbying group for the oil and gas industry, applauded the move, calling the fee a \u201cduplicative, punitive tax on American energy production that stifles innovation.\"",
      "\u201cThanks to industry action, methane emissions continue to decline as production increases, and we support building on this progress through smart and effective regulation,\u201d said Amanda Eversole, the executive vice president and chief advocacy officer at API.",
      "Globally, methane concentrations in the atmosphere have been steadily climbing.",
      "Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, who chairs the Senate's Environment and Public Works committee, spoke in favor of repeal on the Senate floor.",
      "\u201cWe should be expanding natural gas production, not restricting it. Instead, the natural gas tax will constrain American natural gas production, leading to increased energy prices and providing a boost to the production of natural gas in Russia,\u201d she said.",
      "When gas leaks, the producer is wasting gas it could keep and sell.",
      "Repeal of the methane fee is the latest of several pro-oil and gas moves Republicans have taken since the start of Trump's term. On his first day, he declared a national energy emergency, calling for more oil and gas production, and fewer environmental reviews. Democrats failed to overturn that declaration yesterday. Trump has also lifted a pause on new applications for liquified natural gas export terminals, removed the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement and moved to open up more areas of public lands and waters for oil and gas drilling.",
      "The fee on methane releases was aimed at pushing companies to adopt better practices to curb emissions and make their operations more efficient. The EPA had said the fee was expected to reduce 1.2 million metric tons of methane emissions by 2035 \u2014 that\u2019s about the same as removing 8 million cars from the road for a year.",
      "The Biden administration had also implemented methane regulations on existing oil and gas wells, after addressing methane escaping from new wells. The EPA at the time meant for the fee to complement that rule and focus on the worst polluters.",
      "About half of all methane emissions from wells are from just 6% that are smaller producers, according to a recent study.",

      "Nelson was arrested on state charges of using an incendiary device or explosives during a felony, criminal mischief and criminal attempt to commit a felony in connection with the vandalism Monday, police said.

      "Security footage from the dealer also showed someone throwing Molotov cocktails into a row of Tesla sedans. The affidavit said at least four vehicles worth a combined $220,000 were targeted by the incendiary devices, which were crafted from empty liquor bottles. Police said that when Nelson was arrested, in her car they observed cans of spray paint, gasoline, bottles and various cloth pieces that could be soaked with an accelerant.",

      "The European Union is insisting that the 27-nation bloc is not out to undermine the United States as U.S. President Donald Trump put it",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union on Thursday pushed back hard against allegations by U.S. President Donald Trump that the 27-nation bloc was out to get the United States, and warned that it would vigorously fight any wholesale tariff of 25% on all EU products.",
      "The tit-for-tat dispute following the vitriolic comments of Trump aimed at an age-old ally and its main postwar economic partner further deepened the trans-Atlantic rift that was already widened by Trump's warnings that Washington would drop security guarantees for its European allies.",
      "Thursday's EU pushback came after Trump told reporters that \u201cthe European Union was formed in order to screw the United States. That\u2019s the purpose of it, and they\u2019ve done a good job of it,\u201d adding that it would stop immediately under his presidency.",
      "Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, went on a counteroffensive.",
      "\u201cThe EU wasn\u2019t formed to screw anyone,\" Tusk said in an X post. \"Quite the opposite. It was formed to maintain peace, to build respect among our nations, to create free and fair trade, and to strengthen our transatlantic friendship. As simple as that.\u201d",
      "The EU also warned that the moment the tariffs would be announced, it would trigger tough countermeasures, on iconic U.S. industries like bourbon, jeans and motorcycles.",
      "\u201cThe EU will react firmly and immediately against unjustified barriers to free and fair trade,\u201d European Commission trade spokesman Olof Gill said in a statement. \u201cWe will also protect our consumers and businesses at every turn. They expect no less from us.\u201d",
      "Trump said in comments late Wednesday that the United States stood ready.",
      "\u201cWe are the pot of gold. We\u2019re the one that everybody wants. And they can retaliate. But it cannot be a successful retaliation, because we just go cold turkey. We don\u2019t buy any more. And if that happens, we win.\u201d",
      "Gill also countered Trump's caustic comments on the inception of the EU and its development as an economic powerhouse.",
      "\u201cThe European Union is the world\u2019s largest free market. And it has been a boon for the United States,\u201d he said, adding that the EU has \u201cfacilitated trade, reduced costs for U.S. exporters, and harmonized standards and regulations,\u201d which makes it easier for U.S. exporters.",
      "The EU estimates that the trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion, representing around 30% of global trade. Trump has complained about a trade deficit, but while the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, the EU says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services.",
      "The EU says that trade in goods reached 851 billion euros ($878 billion) in 2023, with a trade surplus of 156 billion euros ($161 billion) for the EU. Trade in services was worth 688 billion euros ($710 billion) with a trade deficit of 104 billion euros ($107 billion) for the EU.",
      "The figures are so big that it remained essential to avoid a trade war, the EU has said.",
      "\u201cWe should work together to preserve these opportunities for our people and businesses. Not against each other,\u201d Gill said. \u201cEurope stands for dialogue, openness and reciprocity. We\u2019re ready to partner if you play by the rules.\u201d"

      "The People's Union USA calls the 24 hours of spending abstinence set to start at midnight an \u201ceconomic blackout,\u201d a term that has since been shared and debated on social media. The activist movement said it also plans to promote weeklong consumer boycotts of particular companies, including Walmart and Amazon.",
      "Other activists, faith-based leaders and consumers already are organizing boycotts to protest companies that have scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and to oppose President Donald Trump's moves to abolish all federal DEI programs and policies. Some faith leaders are encouraging their congregations to refrain from shopping at Target, one of the companies backing off DEI efforts, during the 40 days of Lent that begin Wednesday.",
      "Here are some details about the various events and experts' thoughts on whether having consumers keep their wallets closed is an effective tool for influencing the positions corporations take.",
      "The People's Union USA, which takes credit for initiating the no-spend day, was founded by John Schwarz, a meditation teacher who lives near the Chicago area, according to his social media accounts.",
      "The organization's website said it's not tied to a political party but stands for all people. Requests for comment sent to the group's email address this week did not receive a reply.",
      "The planned blackout is scheduled to run from 12 a.m. EST through 11:59 p.m. EST on Friday. The activist group advised customers to abstain from making any purchases, whether in store or online, but particularly not from big retailers or chains. It wants participants to avoid fast food and filling their car gas tanks, and says shoppers with emergencies or in need of essentials should support a local small business and try not to use a credit or debit card.",
      "People's Union plans another broad-based economic blackout on March 28, but it's also organizing boycotts targeting specific retailers \u2014 Walmart and Amazon \u2014 as well as global food giants Nestle and General Mills. For the boycott against Amazon, the organization is encouraging people to refrain from buying anything from Whole Foods, which the e-commerce company owns.",
      "There are a number of boycotts being planned, particularly aimed at Target. The discounter, which has backed diversity and inclusion efforts aimed at uplifting Black and LGBTQ+ people in the past, announced in January it was rolling back its DEI initiatives.",

      "The Rev. Al Sharpton, founder and president of the National Action Network, a civil rights organization, announced in late January it would identify two companies in the next 90 days that will be boycotted for abandoning their diversity, equity and inclusion pledges. The organization formed a commission to identify potential candidates.",
      "\"Donald Trump can cut federal DEI programs to the bone, he can claw back federal money to expand diversity, but he cannot tell us what grocery store we shop at,\u201d Sharpton said in a statement posted on the National Action Network's website.",
      "Some retailers may feel a slight pinch from Friday's broad \u201cblackout,\u201d which is taking place in a tough economic environment, experts said. Renewed inflation worries and Trump's threat of tariffs on imported goods already have had an effect on consumer sentiment.",
      "\u201cThe (market share) pie is just so big,\u201d Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor at market research firm Circana, said. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford to have your slices get smaller.

      "Still, Cohen thinks the overall impact may be limited, with any meaningful sales declines more likely to surface in liberal-leaning coastal regions and big cities.",
      "Anna Tuchman, a marketing professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, said she thinks the economic blackout will likely make a dent in daily retail sales but won't be sustainable.",
      "\u201cI think this is an opportunity for consumers to show that they have a voice on a single day,\" she said. \u201dI think it\u2019s unlikely that we would see long-run sustained decreases in economic activity supported by this boycott.\u201d",
      "Other boycotts have produced different results.",
      "Target saw a drop in sales in the spring and summer quarter of 2023 that the discounter attributed in part to customer backlash over a collection honoring LGBTQ+ communities for Pride Month. As a result, Target didn\u2019t carry Pride merchandise in all of its stores the following year.",
      "Tuchman studied the impact of a boycott against Goya Foods during the summer of 2020 after the company's CEO praised Trump.

Bud Light\u2019s sales still haven\u2019t fully recovered, according to alcohol consulting company Bump Williams.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge in San Francisco on Thursday found that the mass firings of probationary employees were likely unlawful, granting temporary relief to a coalition of labor unions and organizations that has sued to stop the Trump administration\u2019s massive dismantling of the federal workforce.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup ordered the Office of Personnel Management to inform certain federal agencies that it had no authority to order the firings of probationary employees, including the Department of Defense.",
      "\u201cOPM does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute in the history of the universe,\u201d to hire or fire any employees but its own, Alsup said.",
      "The complaint filed by five labor unions and five nonprofit organizations is among multiple lawsuits pushing back on the administration\u2019s efforts to shrink the federal workforce, which Trump has called bloated and sloppy. Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired, and his administration is now aiming at career officials with civil service protection.",
      "Lawyers for the government agree that the office has no authority to hire or fire employees in other agencies.",
      "But they say the Office of Personnel Management asked agencies to review and determine whether employees on probation were fit for continued employment. They also say that probationary employees are not guaranteed employment and that only the highest performing and mission-critical employees should be hired.",
      "Attorneys for the coalition cheered the order, although it does not mean that fired employees will automatically be rehired or that future firings will not occur.",
      "\u201cWhat it means in practical effects is the agencies of the federal government should hear the court\u2019s warning that that order was unlawful,\u201d said Danielle Leonard, an attorney for the coalition, after the hearing.",
      "Emails for comment to the Office of Personnel Management and the U.S. Department of Justice were not immediately returned Thursday.",
      "Alsup ordered the personnel office to inform a limited number of federal agencies represented by the five nonprofits that are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which include veterans, parks, small businesses and defense. He seemed particularly troubled by firings expected at the Department of Defense.",
      "He also ordered the acting head of the personnel office, Charles Ezell, to testify in court about the nature of a Feb. 13 phone call in which agency heads were told to fire probationary employees.",
      "\u201cThe agencies could thumb their noses at OPM if they wanted to if it\u2019s guidance, but if it\u2019s an order, or cast as an order, the agencies may think they have to comply,\u201d he said.",
      "There are an estimated 200,000 probationary workers \u2014 generally employees who have less than a year on the job \u2014 across federal agencies. About 15,000 are employed in California, providing services ranging from fire prevention to veterans\u2019 care, the complaint says.",
      "Elon Musk has led the purge through the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, roiling the workforce with demands including a Saturday email sent through the personnel office ordering workers to list five things they did last week or risk getting fired. The Office of Personnel Management later said that the edict was voluntary, although workers could face similar requests in the future.",
      "The plaintiffs said in their complaint that numerous agencies informed workers that the personnel office had ordered the terminations, with an order to use a template e-mail informing workers their firing was for performance reasons.",
      "Probationary employees of the National Science Foundation, for example, were told by the foundation that it had decided to retain its workers but was overruled by the Office of Personnel Management, according to the complaint.",
      "Unions have recently struck out with two other federal judges.",
      "A judge in Washington, D.C., last week denied a motion from unions to temporarily block layoffs because he found their complaint should be heard in federal labor court. Earlier this month, a judge in Massachusetts said unions suing over a deferred resignation offer weren\u2019t directly affected and so lacked legal standing to challenge it.",
      "Alsup said labor unions likely lack legal standing to sue, but the nonprofit organizations likely have cause because their members will be denied government services resulting from the loss of workers, such as the enjoyment of parks, mental health services for veterans and loans for small businesses.",
      "He was appalled that probationary employees were fired with a mark against them for poor performance.",
      "\u201cProbationary employees are the lifeblood of our government,\u201d he said, adding that they are younger employees who work their way up.",
      "Alsup plans to issue a written order. An evidentiary hearing is set for March 13."

      "Intuitive Machines\u2019 lander, named Athena, caught a lift with SpaceX from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center. It\u2019s taking a fast track to the moon \u2014 with a landing on March 6 \u2014 while hoping to avoid the fate of its predecessor, which tipped over at touchdown.",
      "Never before have so many spacecraft angled for the moon\u2019s surface all at once. Last month, U.S. and Japanese companies shared a rocket and separately launched landers toward Earth's sidekick. Texas-based Firefly Aerospace should get there first this weekend after a big head start.",
      "The two U.S. landers are carrying tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of experiments for NASA as it prepares to return astronauts to the moon.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing time. There\u2019s so much energy,\u201d NASA's science mission chief Nicky Fox told The Associated Press a few hours ahead of the launch.",
      "This isn\u2019t Intuitive Machines\u2019 first lunar rodeo. Last year, the Texas company made the first U.S. touchdown on the moon in more than 50 years. But an instrument that gauges distance did not work and the lander came down too hard and broke a leg, tipping onto its side.",
      "Intuitive Machines said it has fixed the issue and dozens of others. A sideways landing like last time would prevent the drone and a pair of rovers from moving out. NASA\u2019s drill also needs an upright landing to pierce beneath the lunar surface to gather soil samples for analysis.",
      "\u201cCertainly, we will be better this time than we were last time. But you never know what could happen,\u201d said Trent Martin, senior vice president of space systems.",
      "It\u2019s an extraordinarily elite club. Only five countries have pulled off a lunar landing over the decades: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan. The moon is littered with wreckage from many past failures.",
      "The 15-foot (4.7-meter) Athena will target a landing 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the lunar south pole. Just a quarter-mile (400 meters) away is a permanently shadowed crater \u2014 the ultimate destination for the drone named Grace.",
      "Named after the late computer programming pioneer Grace Hopper, the 3-foot (1-meter) drone will make three increasingly higher and longer test hops across the lunar surface using hydrazine fueled-thrusters for flight and cameras and lasers for navigation.",
      "If those excursions go well, it will hop into the nearby pitch-black crater, an estimated 65 feet (20 meters) deep. Science instruments from Hungary and Germany will take measurements at the bottom while hunting for frozen water.",
      "It will be the first up-close peek inside one of the many shadowed craters dotting both the north and south poles. Scientists suspect these craters are packed with tons of ice. If so, this ice could be transformed by future explorers into water to drink, air to breathe and even rocket fuel.",
      "NASA is paying $62 million to Intuitive Machines to get its drill and other experiments to the moon. The company, in turn, sold space on the lander to others. It also opened up the Falcon rocket to ride-sharing.",
      "Tagalongs included NASA\u2019s Lunar Trailblazer satellite, which will fly separately to the moon over the next several months before entering lunar orbit to map the distribution of water below. Also catching a ride was a private spacecraft that will chase after an asteroid for a flyby, a precursor to asteroid mining.",

      "In recent weeks, senior Trump administration officials have made clear that U.S. priorities lie elsewhere \u2013 in Asia and along America\u2019s southern border \u2013 and that Europe should take care of itself, including Ukraine.",
      "\u201cFor me, the absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that we can really achieve independence from the U.S. step by step,\" Friedrich Merz, the likely next chancellor of Germany, told broadcaster ZDF after winning Sunday's election.",
      "\u201cI never thought I would have to say such a thing on a television program,\u201d Merz said, admitting surprise at apparent American indifference to the fate of Europe.",

      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has said member countries probably should spend 3.5-3.7% to execute the alliance\u2019s plans for defending Europe. Russia, Rutte worries, could be capable of mounting an attack on a European country by the end of the decade.",
      "Those defense plans include U.S. participation. Without U.S. forces, the Bruegel think tank in Brussels estimates, Europe could need 300,000 troops and an annual spending hike of at least 250 billion euros ($262 billion) to deter Russia.",
      "Bruegel said stopping a Russian advance might require 1,400 tanks, 2,000 infantry fighting vehicles and 700 artillery pieces. \u201cThis is more combat power than currently exists in the French, German, Italian and British land forces combined,\u201d it said.",
      "In Ukraine alone, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for 150,000 European troops to ensure the conflict doesn\u2019t flare up again after a ceasefire, but Europe\u2019s armies are too small. One proposal would see fewer than 30,000 European troops on the ground, backed by air and sea power. Finding even that many poses a challenge.",
      "Defense spending throughout Europe has gone up since Russia\u2019s invasion began in earnest. Much is spent on weapons to keep Ukraine in the fight and back fill depleted European stocks, but demand is driving up prices.",
      "Europe lacks military transport and logistics chains. Manpower shortages abound. The continent\u2019s combined armies total around 2 million personnel but few can be effectively deployed. Talk of conscription is mounting.",
      "To help address shortfalls, the European Commission is easing its fiscal rules so EU member countries can spend more on defense, at least temporarily. It\u2019s not a magic bullet but could provide an incentive to boost military budgets.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Merz will soften Germany\u2019s opposition to EU defense bonds. As with Europe's post-pandemic recovery, this would use joint borrowing to provide grants and low-interest loans. France, Italy, Poland and Spain already support defense bonds.",

But he warned that the impact of the new budget might only be felt in 2030, so any action on defense \u201cshould take place now.\u201d",
      "Finding money to adapt to the new security reality poses huge challenges. Also in short supply is the political courage and unity required to confront an adversary like Russia. Europe has relied on a U.S. security umbrella for decades and old habits die hard.",
      "The EU \u201ccannot become a truly regional and global actor without a relevant military dimension,\u201d former EU Council President Herman Van Rompuy said in 2016, before Donald Trump became U.S. President for the first time.",
      "Getting 27 countries to agree has never been easy, and more than eight years on, Europe is arguably at its weakest as the steady rise of a hard right that is often pro-Russian undermines the old order.",
      "Merz may bring stability to Germany, even though the far right came second in elections there. But France\u2019s latest government is fragile. Spain relies on small parties to keep its coalition intact, and the Dutch cabinet dominated by hard-right leader Geert Wilders is shaky.",
      "Poland appears strong under Prime Minister Donald Tusk. However, a presidential election looms and a right-wing candidate is well placed. Belgium just got a new government after long months of wrangling.",
      "Italy is probably most stable but also somewhat unpredictable, under Premier Georgia Meloni, whose ruling party has neo-fascist roots. Among smaller countries, Hungary and Slovakia have proved disruptive, undermining EU support for Ukraine.",

      "House Speaker Mike Johnson will try against the odds to muscle a Republican budget blueprint to passage this week",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Mike Johnson will try against the odds to muscle a Republican budget blueprint to passage this week, a step toward delivering President Donald Trump's \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d with $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and $2 trillion in spending cuts over stiff opposition from Democrats \u2014 and even some Republicans.",
      "With almost no votes to spare in Johnson's bare-bones GOP majority, the speaker is fighting on all fronts \u2014 against Democrats, uneasy rank-and-file Republicans and skeptical GOP senators \u2014 as he works to keep the package on track. Votes set for Tuesday evening are in jeopardy, and the outcome is uncertain.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to get everyone there,\u201d Johnson, of Louisiana, said at an event at the start of the week, half-joking that he had a \u201cprayer request\u201d involved.",
      "The package, if approved, would be a crucial part of the budget process as Trump pushes the Republicans who control Congress to approve a massive bill that would extend tax breaks, which he secured during his first term but are expiring later this year, while also cutting spending across federal programs and services.",
      "But Republicans are running into a familiar problem: Slashing federal spending is typically easier said than done. With cuts to the Pentagon and other programs largely off limits, much of the other government outlays go for health care, food stamps, student loans and programs relied on by their constituents.",
      "It's all unfolding as billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk is tearing through federal agencies with his Department of Government Efficiency firing thousands of workers nationwide, and angry voters are starting to confront lawmakers at town hall meetings back home.",
      "\u201cWhile we fully support efforts to rein in wasteful spending and deliver on President Trump's agenda, it is imperative that we do not slash programs that support American communities across our nation,\u201d wrote Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, and several other GOP lawmakers in the Congressional Hispanic Conference.",

      "Trump has signaled a preference for the \u201cbig\u201d bill but also appears to enjoy a competition between the House and the Senate, lawmakers said, as he pits the Republicans against each other to see which version will emerge on a path toward approval.",
      "Senate Republicans, wary that Johnson can lift his bill over the finish line, launched their own scaled-back $340 billion package last week. It\u2019s focused on sending Trump money his administration needs for its deportation and border security agenda now, with plans to tackle the tax cuts separately later this year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m holding my breath. I\u2019m crossing my fingers,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who said he is rooting for the House's approach as the better option. \"I think a one-shot is their best opportunity.\u201d",
      "Johnson, whose party lost seats in last November\u2019s election, commands one of the thinnest majorities in modern history, which means he must keep almost every Republican in line or risk losing the vote.",
      "Already, several lawmakers have objected to the package either because it cuts too much or because it doesn't cut enough.",
      "The most conservative Republicans warn it will pile onto the nation\u2019s $36 trillion debt load, because the cost of the tax breaks, at least $4.5 trillion over the decade, outweighs the $2 trillion in spending cuts to government programs.",
      "More moderate Republican lawmakers worry that the enormous budget cuts being eyed \u2014 some $880 billion to the committee that handles health care spending, including Medicaid, for example, or $230 billion to the agriculture committee that funds food stamps \u2014 will be too harmful to their constituents back home.",
      "GOP leaders are trying to convince lawmakers that the details will be debated in the weeks to come and that this week's vote is just a first step.",
      "The budget is being compiled during a lengthy process that first sends instructions to the various House and Senate committees, which will then have several weeks to devise more detailed plans for additional debate and votes.",
      "\u201cThe committees need time to go work to find savings,\" said Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La. \"But we can\u2019t even get to that if we don\u2019t get through the budget. So, we\u2019ve got to get the first step done later this week.\u201d",
      "Ten House GOP chairmen of the committees involved issued a joint statement in a show of force to push the package forward.",

      "Rep. Jodey Arrington, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, told reporters he recognizes the tension between Republicans who want more cuts and those from politically competitive districts who \u201chave a higher level of sensitivity to some of the spending reforms.\"",
      "Arrington said with economic growth assumptions, from 1.8% as projected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to 2.6% as projected by House Republicans, the package would generate about $2.6 trillion in savings over 10 years and would ensure the plan helps reduce the deficit.",
      "Some fiscal advocacy groups view the GOP\u2019s economic projections as overly optimistic.",

      "The tale follows the journey of the Hickory Huskers, a team that in the movie version took on big-city South Bend Central in the 1952 state championship game and won with Jimmy Chitwood hitting a buzzer-beater. The story is loosely based on the real-life story of small-school Milan winning Indiana\u2019s 1954 state championship. Bobby Plump was the hero in the actual game.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about change,\" Hackman once said. \"It\u2019s about what happens with change, how we deal with it, where we learn to give up our ideas about who we are as people.\u201d",

Other than to say, \u201cOh, my,\u201d she couldn't put into words what the team's accomplishment and movie have meant to the town.",

      "Norwegian soccer will vote this weekend on whether to scrap the use of video reviews in its top league after a turbulent couple of years since the technology was introduced in the Nordic country",
      "Norwegian soccer will vote this weekend on whether to scrap the use of video reviews in its top league after a turbulent couple of years since the technology was introduced.",
      "The decision will be noted with plenty of interest around the soccer world, given the video review system \u2014 or VAR, as it is better known \u2014 has had such a huge impact on the sport since being formally written into the laws of the game in 2018.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at how and why Norwegian soccer has reached this stage, what to expect in the vote, and why it is significant.",
      "The Norwegian soccer federation brought in video technology in 2023, in a way some found controversial. That\u2019s because the decision was reached before Norway\u2019s member-run clubs could establish a unified position on whether they wanted VAR, leading to disgruntlement among some fans who felt the democratic process in the Norwegian game had been undermined. Disillusionment increased in the early months of VAR\u2019s adoption, with the technology taking seven minutes to decide on an offside call in one match.",
      "Disillusionment about VAR quickly led to active protests about the use of the technology \u2014 and some were very quirky in their nature. A match between Rosenborg and Lillestr\u00f8m was suspended \u2014 and later abandoned and restaged behind closed doors \u2014 after fans threw fish cakes and then tennis balls onto the field soon after kickoff. In the second tier, fans of Lyn disrupted a game by throwing champagne corks onto the pitch in what was viewed as a protest against VAR. Amid such strident anti-VAR sentiment at certain clubs, the federation agreed to set up a working group to look further into the issue. And in a vote in January of the 32 clubs making up the top two leagues in Norway, 19 voted to scrap VAR and 13 to keep it. A recommendation was sent to the federation to support the clubs' majority decision and remove VAR \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d",
      "In a blow to anti-VAR campaigners, the Norwegian Football Association came out in favor of the technology a week later, with president Lise Klaveness saying the association acknowledged processes needed improving but wanted to retain video officials. \u201cThe governing body unanimously concluded that the best thing for Norwegian football is to maintain and develop it,\u201d Klaveness said. For Anders Kjellevold, chairman of the Norwegian supporters\u2019 alliance, it felt like a betrayal, saying most people thought the vote of the top clubs would be decisive. \u201dIf we end up with a decision where the FA decides not to listen to the affected clubs in this issue, then we are undermining club democracy and club democracy is a bulwark against many of the negative aspects of football,\" Kjellevold told The Associated Press.",
      "The final decision on whether to scrap VAR will be taken at a vote at the federation's congress taking place over Saturday and Sunday. All clubs which are active members of the federation are allowed to vote, along with leaders of the federation's counties and members of the federation board. A majority decision is needed either way. Anti-VAR campaigners fear many clubs who vote will end up siding with the view of the federation, as is the tradition in major decisions in order to maintain good relations with the governing body. The vast majority of clubs which will be voting aren't affected by VAR because the technology is used only in the top division.",
      "According to Kjellevold, anti-VAR sentiment lingers because the technology \u201cis incompatible with the intention of the game of football.\u201d It ruins \u201cthe experience of football as a live spectator,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it brings up these stoppages in the game, it takes away some of the euphoria of a goal, which is just vital to a game and how we live it when we use so much of our time and effort to follow the game.\u201d Kjellevold is just as unhappy at how the whole process has been handled, chiefly how the teams most affected by VAR might not get their voices heard.",
      "The result of the vote is significant on a wider level because Norway scrapping VAR might influence supporters in other countries to step up protests about the technology in an effort to remove it from their leagues. Premier League clubs voted in June to continue using VAR after being asked to consider scrapping the technology following controversies last season. Sweden is one of the few countries in Europe to have decided against introducing VAR to its league.",

      "Knapp \u2014 the No. 99 player in golf's current world rankings \u2014 shot a bogey-free 59 in the opening round of the Cognizant Classic at PGA National, the 15th time that someone has broken 60 in a PGA Tour event.",
      "Knapp finished one shot off the tour scoring record of 58, done by Jim Furyk in the final round of the 2016 Travelers Championship. Knapp became the 14th player to shoot a sub-60 round; it has been done 15 times, with Furyk the one who has carded such a round twice.",
      "Knapp had a putt for eagle at the par-5 18th that would have tied Furyk\u2019s mark of 58 \u2014 18 feet, 8 inches was the measurement given by the PGA Tour. The eagle putt didn\u2019t have the speed and he tapped in for 59.",
      "The 12-birdie round on the par-71 course also broke the previous Cognizant scoring record of 61, first done in 2012 by Brian Harman and matched in 2021 by Matt Jones. There are three rounds of 62 in tournament history \u2014 Tiger Woods in the final round in 2012 on his way to a tie for second, Brandon Hagy in the second round in 2021 and eventual winner Chris Kirk in the second round of the 2023 event.",
      "There was barely any wind and PGA National was largely defenseless in the morning session. The closest there was to any trouble was the seventh hole, where Billy Horschel \u2014 a Florida Gator from his college days \u2014 used a club to poke at an actual alligator that was catching some sun near the green and got it to retreat back to its watery home.",
      "Even that was easy on Thursday morning. But nobody had an easier time than Knapp, who finished no better than a tie for 17th in any of his first seven starts of 2025 \u2014 and then played his way into golf history in Round 1 at PGA National.",
      "Knapp has one PGA Tour win, that coming at last year\u2019s Mexico Open. He\u2019s played the Cognizant only once before and did well, tying for fourth last year after shooting three rounds of 68 or better and finishing at 13 under.",
      "And this year, so far, he\u2019s even better.",
      "He started Thursday with five straight birdies, that stretch highlighted by a 60-foot putt at the par-4 second hole. The birdies kept coming in bunches; three in a row on holes 9 through 11, three more coming on holes 13 through 15 \u2014 the last of those a big breaking putt from 31 feet, going across the green before dropping dead center into the cup.",
      "A 12-footer for birdie on the par-3 17th hit the outside right edge of the cup and spun off, leaving him at 11 under with only the par-5 finishing hole left.",
      "A 335-yard tee shot left him 200 yards to the hole at No. 18, and a simple two-putt was all that remained to cap the history-making round.",

      "Vanderbilt freshman Mikayla Blakes knows each time she drops the ball in the basket it will bring more attention",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Vanderbilt freshman Mikayla Blakes knows each time she drops the ball in the basket it will bring more attention.",
      "That's what happens when someone scores 53 points, then sets the NCAA freshman single-game scoring record with 55 just 17 days later.",
      "\u201cEverybody wants to stop you now,\" Blakes said about being a bigger target for opponent's scouting plans. \u201cSo I think just continuing to keep going and continue to keep working on my weaknesses and turn them into strengths is definitely going to help me.\u201d",
      "Blakes has scored at least 30 points in five games, tied for fourth-most by any NCAA Division I player this season and most among freshmen. She ranks second in the Southeastern Conference averaging 23.3 points a game.",
      "South Carolina coach Dawn Staley called Blakes special after her No. 6 Gamecocks held the freshman to 19 points last weekend. Blakes got only two in the fourth quarter as the Gamecocks made Blakes work hard on both ends of the court.",
      "\u201cTo come in our league and to have done what she\u2019s done, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a bigger offensive impact,\" Staley said. \"I mean, she\u2019s very, very efficient.\u201d",
      "Blakes already is in exclusive company.",
      "Her 55 points are the ninth most scored in NCAA history. She also joined Patricia Hoskins of Mississippi Valley State as the only players to score 53 or more points twice in the same season. Blakes scored 53 on Jan. 30 in a win at Florida.",
      "With Vanderbilt trailing by 15 with 6:55 left at Auburn, even her brother Jaylen watching on TV thought that game was over. Then she took over, scoring 30 of her 55 points over the final 10 minutes, 25 seconds of regulation and overtime in the victory.",
      "Blakes also went 23 of 24 at the line. She knocked down down her first 23 attempts on her way to the single-game scoring record first set by Elena Delle Donne with 54 as a redshirt freshman at Delaware in a 2010 loss to James Madison.",
      "It's just not about the points. Her brother knows only too well the sister he worked out with and played 1-on-1 with couldn't let the Commodores lose.",
      "\u201cShe hates losing,\" Jaylen said. \"At the end of the day, she hates losing more than she loves winning and for her, that was the most important thing, I think. Obviously the 55 was great, but she was so happy about just winning that game.\u201d",
      "Tara VanDerveer tried to get Blakes to play at Stanford: \u201cShe\u2019s fantastic. She\u2019s a star. She\u2019s awesome.\u201d",
      "The now retired Hall of Fame coach called it disappointing not to get the 2024 McDonald's All-American from Somerset, New Jersey. VanDerveer said she's mad that Jaylen came to Stanford as a graduate transfer this season from Duke and didn't bring his sister with him.",
      "Joking aside, VanDerveer said she loves the Blakes family and called Mikayla a great student and that she is really happy for the 5-foot-8 freshman.",
      "\"She\u2019s doing really well,\u201d VanDerveer said.",
      "Everybody wanted Blakes. Stanford, UCLA, Tennessee, Indiana, Wisconsin and Rutgers were among those recruiting her. Shea Ralph convinced Blakes to become her highest-rated recruit yet for the coach's fourth season at Vanderbilt.",
      "Jaylen, who joined the family on some Zoom calls as coaches pitched away, knows why Mikayla chose a program with only one Final Four berth way back in 1993 and now is on the verge of a second straight NCAA Tournament berth after a 10-year drought.",
      "\u201cShe was just about building something,\u201d Jaylen said.",
      "Thanks to Stanford playing on Wednesdays and Saturdays and the Vanderbilt women on Thursdays and Sundays, the Blakes siblings are able to keep up with each other's games.",
      "In that comeback against Auburn, Mikayla Blakes joined LeBron James as the only basketball players to score 55 or more points playing every second of a game since 2005 whether at the NBA, WNBA, NCAA men or women's basketball level.",
      "She also earned both the SEC player and freshman of the week, something not done in this league since Candace Parker in 2006.",
      "Ralph said while Blakes has not been a secret for a long time now, she liked how the point guard played against South Carolina. Ralph is focused on making sure her freshman doesn't have to score 50 to win as the Commodores host Texas A&M on Thursday night in their final home game of the regular season.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s done it in moments where we\u2019ve really needed it,\" Ralph said. \u201cBut she also has to get a little bit of help.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Ludvig Aberg and Brian Campbell don't have much in common except winning on the PGA Tour",
      "One week the PGA Tour winner was Ludvig Aberg, a Swede so supremely talented that he played in a Ryder Cup before his first major, entered the top 10 in the world ranking just nine months after he left college and has been there ever since.",
      "The next week it was Brian Campbell, a 31-year-old who averaged $7,999 for the 186 tournaments he played over the last decade \u2014 one full year on the PGA Tour, the rest on the Korn Ferry Tour \u2014 before winning the Mexico Open. That was worth $1,260,000.",
      "Golf needs them both.",
      "Stars are what fuel interest. The PGA Tour gets a boost from these 72-man signature events with $20 million purses because they tend to deliver big names and often big moments. Scottie Scheffler has won four of them over the last two years. Rory McIlroy has won twice.",
      "There also has been some discussion over the last 25 years \u2014 dating to the World Golf Championships \u2014 that smaller fields make it easier to win no matter how stacked they are. But the signature events have not disappointed.",
      "Campbell, however, was a reminder that anyone can win on any given week. He had never won, not in his short time on the PGA Tour or what seemed like an eternity on the Korn Ferry Tour. That's one of the great charms about golf and always will be.",
      "His victory also showed those longshot moments still exist, even as the PGA Tour moves to reduce the number of full cards from 125 to 100 this year, and starts reducing the size of fields next year, including the elimination of some Monday qualifiers.",
      "Yes, the numbers are shrinking, but the opportunity is there.",
      "Meritocracy has not left the building.",
      "Campbell had a career season on the Korn Ferry Tour last year with three runner-up finishes to finish No. 8 on the points list and earn a ticket back to the big leagues. That gave him access to tournaments like the Mexico Open, where the final hour was no less compelling than when Aberg tracked down Maverick McNealy at Torrey Pines.",
      "An otherwise sleepy week at the Mexico Open \u2014 only two players from the top 30, four from the top 50 in the world \u2014 produced a duel over the final hour that was fun to watch considering what was at stake.",
      "There was Aldrich Potgieter, full of promise and power, a 20-year-old South African who won the British Amateur at the age of 17 and last year became the youngest Korn Ferry Tour winner. He's only getting started, and he simply smashes it off the tee.",
      "Potgieter led the field at Vidanta Vallarta by averaging 324.7 yards for all his measured drives, nine of them at 350 yards or longer.",
      "Campbell couldn't keep up with that \u2014 he was on average 39 yards shorter off the tee \u2014 and he didn't try. He spent the weekend alongside Potgieter and never flinched. He played with what he had, and it was enough.",
      "Both felt the nerves of trying to win their first PGA Tour title.",
      "\u201cI thought I was going to throw up at multiple times during the day,\u201d Campbell said.",
      "\u201cPressure is a big thing. You can't really beat it, you just have to learn and adjust to it next time you're in this position,\u201d Potgieter said.",
      "The playoff was as fickle as golf gets. Potgieter twice pounded drives into the fairway on the par-5 18th holes, leaving him only a 6-iron to the green. Both times he could only manage par.",
      "Campbell pushed his drive so badly on the second playoff hole that it was sailing out-of-bounds until it crashed into the trees and caromed back into play. He was on hardpan, 94 yards behind Potgieter. He ripped a 3-wood back into position and hit lob wedge 3 1/2 feet from the hole.",
      "Potgieter missed his birdie putt from 6 feet. Campbell made his for the win, and the shock of it all didn't wear off for some time, especially after his girlfriend, Kelsi, just about tackled him on the 18th green and he swung her around in pure joy.",
      "\u201cI'm literally freaking out on the inside,\u201d Campbell told NBC when he regained his footing. \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "Here's what is going on. Campbell is headed to The Players Championship to compete for a $25 million purse. Then he has the Masters, and the PGA Championship. Along the way, he'll be in five of the $20 million signature events left on the PGA Tour schedule.",
      "Everyone expects Aberg or McIlroy or Scheffler or a dozen other stars to win. Not many knew anything about Campbell, who became a PGA Tour footnote as the last person assessed a penalty for slow play for two bad times in 2017 in New Orleans.",
      "(That was a weird one, the first year the Zurich Classic went to two-man teams. Campbell and teammate Miguel Angel Carballo each got a bad time, and because it was foursomes, they counted as one competitor).",
      "Now he's a PGA Tour winner, a feel-good story, just like Rafael Campos last year when he arrived in Bermuda two hours before his tee time because his wife had just given birth to their first child. In danger of losing his card, he won for the first time.",
      "They don't move the needle. That doesn't mean there's no room for them in this sport.",
      "The PGA Tour hopes to be stronger by rewarding the top performers and by reducing jobs and field sizes. That's harsh for those who don't make it, but they have no excuses as long as they have a tee time \u2014 whether that's in signature events, regular events or opposite-field events, or even if they have to go back to the Korn Ferry Tour or Q-school.",
      "No one ever wants to hear the solution is to play better, either because they have heard it for too long or they know it's true.",
      "A leaner tour \u2014 fewer cards, smaller fields \u2014 eliminates those who don't perform. That was Campbell in 2017 and for the next seven years in the minor leagues.",
      "And now he's going to the Masters.",

      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Former Penn State star Abdul Carter made one thing clear Wednesday: He should be the No. 1 overall pick in this year's NFL draft.",
      "Carter was in the first group of players to speak with reporters at the NFL's annual scouting combine in Indianapolis, and he wasted no time declaring himself the top player in the 2025 draft class.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019m the best player in the country and the best player should be picked first,\" he said. \"It\u2019s the work I put in with my dad, who trained me, and all the sacrifices I made, I know I\u2019m the best.\u201d",
      "Of course, such pronouncements have come to be expected during combine week.",
      "Still, Carter certainly has a case after finishing last season with 68 tackles, a Football Bowl Subdivision-leading 23 1/2 tackles for loss and 12 sacks to finish seventh nationally.",
      "He was the Big Ten's top defensive player in 2024 and finished his three-year career with 39 1/2 tackles for loss, 23 sacks and 14 passes defensed.",
      "The question is whether the 6-foot-3, 259-pound Carter is a better fit at defensive end or outside linebacker. Either way, he's likely to be the first or second defensive player selected April 24 in Green Bay, Wisconsin.",
      "Going No. 1 overall remains a challenge, though.",
      "Since 2007 only three defensive players have been chosen No. 1 overall \u2014 Jadeveon Clowney in 2014, Myles Garrett in 2017 and Travon Walker in 2022. Each was chosen primarily because of their pass-rushing ability.",

We\u2019ll see.\u201d",
      "Tobin, who attended Colorado, was referring to Hunter, who is listed as a cornerback but hopes to also play receiver in the NFL as he did in college.",
      "Yet Carter believes he can defy the odds and become the third Penn State player to hear his name called first on draft weekend. Tennessee holds the No. 1 overall pick.",
      "\"Defensive players impact the game just as much as the quarterback,\u201d the 21-year-old Carter said. \u201cAll the teams that have won Super Bowls, they have that one standout player. I feel like I\u2019m that.\u201d",

      "The 76ers are a team in trouble",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Yes, the Philadelphia 76ers played without two-time NBA scoring champion and the always-injured Joel Embiid. Yes, they haven't been a playoff contender this season, even with two other All-Stars in the starting lineup.",
      "Yet, there it was, on the scoreboard, on all the social media derision, on the top of the implausibility-meter when the 76ers broke camp for the Bahamas.",
      "That was no misprint on the ticker in the fourth quarter: Bulls 136, 76ers 86.",
      "Down 50!",
      "Did the Sixers quit? Do the Sixers realize \u2014 with or without whatever Embiid and his balky left knee can give them \u2014 their season is over?",
      "\u201cI don't want to believe that,\u201d nine-time All-Star Paul George said. \u201cI don't sense that in the locker room and I don't believe that.\u201d",
      "George has little choice publicly but to stand by the Sixers, even as they lost their eighth straight game and 10th of 11 overall \u2014 142-110 on Monday nigh t to the 23-win Chicago Bulls \u2014 and see even the odds of a play-in tournament berth dip to the point where fans are already looking at next season.",
      "Not that it promises anything better than the mess that's unraveled in South Philly this year.",
      "\u201cI'm not quite sure what fell apart to give up 140 points, at home, against the Chicago Bulls,\u201d George said.",
      "The real bad news \u2014 you know, before six Bulls scored at least 15 points \u2014 came hours ahead of this debacle when the Sixers offered no real update on Embiid. Embiid missed his 38th game of the season for the sagging Sixers, and all options \u2014 from rest to potential surgery to playing through pain \u2014 remain on the table, depending on the results of continued testing and imaging.",
      "Embiid has played in just 19 of 57 games for the Sixers, who fell to 20-37 an have only a faint shot at earning a berth in the NBA play-in tournament. Embiid has averaged 23.8 points \u2014 he averaged at least 30 and won two scoring titles the last three seasons \u2014 and scored only 29 points combined in his last two games.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody envisioned it going like this,\u201d coach Nick Nurse said. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing on a lot of levels. He wants to play. We want him to play. Our best version is of with him playing. It hasn\u2019t worked out like that. Yet.\u201d",
      "The 76ers are a franchise in turmoil and suffering through an internal tug-of-war when it comes to Embiid. Can he play through the pain and should he, even with the woeful record? Why not just shut him down and try again next year?",
      "Even George \u2014 who left the Los Angeles Clippers to sign a four-year, $212 million free-agent contract \u2014 conceded the juice might not be worth the squeeze when it comes to a potential Embiid return. The 76ers are one of the worst teams in the league and are trending closer to Toronto, Charlotte, Washington and a lottery pick than making a serious run in the postseason.",
      "Maybe sitting Embiid is for the best \u2014 just as it was seemingly was early in the Process.",
      "The 76ers\u2019 first-round pick is top-six protected or else it goes to the Oklahoma City Thunder, perhaps one more reason the Sixers could shut down Embiid and cut their losses on the season.",
      "\u201cWe're showing no signs of a team that will compete,\u201d George said. \u201cWe just don't have the habits of a championship or a playoff-contending team would have. To be honest, right now, it's a little farfetched. All we can do is work hard. Try to just keep going for one another. We've shown no signs of, forget championship, but a playoff contending-team here.\u201d",
      "Does Nurse survive and earn a third season on the bench?",
      "What about team president Daryl Morey, who built this mishmashed roster full of patchwork free-agents and needlessly gave Embiid a three-year, $193 million contract extension ahead of training camp.",
      "Just as former Eagles running back Ricky Watters once said: For who? For what?",
      "\u201cWe've got to be more dialed in. More effort. More energy,\" George said. \"More pride on the defensive end. Again, same conversations we've been having. Low communication. It baffles me just how easy we give up layups in this league. I don't understand.\u201d",
      "Join the club.",
      "So where is the next win on the schedule? Wednesday night against a Knicks team winning at a 65% clip at Madison Square Garden? Against Steph Curry and the Warriors?",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see a vision, but we have a lot of games left,\u201d 2024 All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey said.",
      "Not really. Certainly not enough to make anyone who watched a 1-9 February \u2014 and has four of 20 wins against Charlotte \u2014 believe the season can be saved. The 76ers are only 7-8 this season when Embiid, George and Maxey start together.",
      "\u201cEverybody needs to look at themselves, at what they can do better, and then look at what they can do better for the team. And do our jobs, man. Be professional,\u201d Nurse said.",

      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Travis Hunter arrived at the NFL's annual scouting combine with a Heisman Trophy resume, an invitation to work out at two positions and ready to answer all doubters.",
      "The former Colorado star already appears to have completed one task this week in Indianapolis \u2014 convincing coaches and general managers he can become the league's first true two-way player in decades, and maybe even play special teams, too.",
      "Hunter is more than a just a curiosity now.",
      "\"What do you do with a player like him? And where do you first start him? And where does he help you on all sides of the ball?\" Tennessee coach Brian Callahan said. \u201cHe can return punts. He\u2019s got a really unique skill set. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s many players you can compare him to.\u201d",
      "Sure, some players have been featured in special packages on both sides of the ball. Some of the most prominent names on that list include Mike Vrabel and Troy Brown of the New England Patriots, William \u201cThe Refrigerator\u201d Perry of the Chicago Bears and Hall of Fame cornerback Deion Sanders, whose most productive offensive season came as a receiver with the Dallas Cowboys in 1996.",
      "Most consider Hall of Famer Chuck Bednarik the last true two-way star. He started at linebacker and along the offensive line for the Philadelphia Eagles from 1949 to 1962.",
      "The closest contender to Bednarik probably would be either Sanders or Roy Green, who was drafted as a safety, caught 33 passes while playing both ways in 1981 and then led the league with 1,555 yards receiving in 1984.",
      "But unlike 1997 Heisman winner Charles Woodson, the only other defensive player to win college football's most prestigious award, it appears nothing is out of Hunter's reach.",
      "\u201cHe can be whatever he wants to be, he's that talented,\u201d Denver Broncos general manager George Paton said. \u201cWe're still working through it, you know, but I think he's going to play on both sides of the ball. I'll just leave it at that.\u201d",
      "Hunter certainly thrived in both spots in college, first at Jackson State in Mississippi before following his coach, Sanders, to Boulder, Colorado. In his final two college seasons, Hunter had 153 receptions, 1,979 yards, 20 TDs, broke up 11 passes and had four interceptions.",
      "Combine organizers gave Hunter a defensive backs T-shirt, partly because it gives him the option of doing on-field drills with the defense Friday and offense Saturday \u2014 if he chooses.",
      "The first indication he'll do either, or both, could come Thursday when he's scheduled to speak with reporters.",
      "Sanders is already lobbying publicly for his star player, urging any team that doesn't intend to use Hunter as a cornerback and as a receiver to pass on drafting him.",
      "Yet most executives who fielded questions Tuesday seem to concur with Sanders' assessment that Hunter can excel at both, even if they believe he should start at cornerback as a rookie.",
      "\u201cTravis is obviously an exceptional talent. He can do it all, that\u2019s no secret,\u201d Carolina Panthers coach Dan Morgan said. \"Yes, he can play both sides of the ball. That\u2019s up to the team to decide that, whatever team that drafts him.\u201d",
      "One lingering question is how many snaps can Hunter be expected to play at the pro level without declining production?",
      "He held up relatively well at Colorado, where he logged roughly 2,500 snaps between 2023 and 2024. But he'll be facing bigger, stronger, faster opponents in the NFL, plus a more physical style, a 17-game regular season and even more games if his team makes the playoffs.",
      "Few would argue Hunter is the best athlete in this year's draft or a legitimate top-five talent, but everyone is trying to figure out just how high someone with Hunter's talent will go in a draft where quarterbacks tend to be the first pick, the second pick and last year the top three picks.",
      "That could the case again with Tennessee, Cleveland and the New York Giants holding the top three selections with each presumably looking for new franchise quarterbacks.",
      "\u201cI think quarterbacks have kind of a lock on that or maybe a great pass rusher,\u201d Cincinnati Bengals general manager Duke Tobin said when asked about a non-quarterback being the top overall selection. \u201cOr maybe a guy that plays six positions like the one from my alma mater (Colorado). We'll see.\u201d",
      "But with third-year quarterback Will Levis still on the Titans roster, Callahan and general manager Mike Borgonzi aren't ruling out anything. Even taking Hunter, who could fill two holes in their rebuilding effort.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a special player,\u201d Borgonzi said. \u201cWe were watching him, and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anybody that\u2019s actually done what he\u2019s done in modern-day football, playing both offense and defense during the course of a season. He\u2019s definitely a special player.\u201d",

      "\u201cIn my opinion, what the greats have in common is, they transcend the sport and become synonymous with the sport,\" Auriemma said. \u201cFor as long as people talk about college basketball, WNBA basketball, Olympic basketball, Diana is the greatest winner in the history of basketball, period.

      "North Korean state media has not acknowledged either the theft or the FBI accusation. Pyongyang's mission to the United Nations in Geneva did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "However, North Korea has stolen an estimated $1.2 billion in cryptocurrency and other virtual assets in the past five years, according to South Korea's spy agency. It represents a rare source of badly needed foreign currency to support its fragile economy and fund its nuclear program in the face of intense U.N. sanctions and North Korea's strict border closures during the coronavirus pandemic.",

      "Unwanted phone calls are out of control",
      "LONDON -- Unwanted phone calls are out of control. Whether it's a robocall trying to sell you something or spam calls from scammers trying to rip you off, it's enough to make you want to stop answering your phone. So what can you do to stop them?",
      "The scourge of unwanted phone calls has been branded an epidemic by consumer groups, while the Federal Communications Commission says it's the top consumer complaint. The calls are a nuisance to many ordinary people, some of whom have complained to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI need help on getting spam calls to stop,\u201d one reader said in an email. She's getting up to 14 calls a day despite the countermeasures she's employed.",
      "As the name implies, robocalls are automated calls to deliver recorded messages to a large number of phones. A robocall purely to deliver a message or collect a debt is allowed under U.S. regulations, but the Federal Trade Commission says robocalls with a recorded voice trying to sell you something are illegal unless you've given explicit written permission to receive them. Many robocalls are also probably scams, the FTC warns.",
      "If you're flooded by unsolicited calls, here are some ways to fight back.",
      "Smartphone users can turn on some built-in settings to combat unknown calls.",
      "Apple advises iPhone users to turn on the Silence Unknown Callers feature. Go to your \u201cSettings,\u201d then scroll down to \u201cApps,\u201d and then to \u201cPhone,\u201d where you'll see it under the \u201cCalls\u201d section. When you turn this on, any calls from numbers that you've never been in touch with and aren't saved in your contacts list will not ring through. Instead, they'll be sent to voicemail and show up in your list of recent calls.",
      "Android has a similar setting that allows you to block calls from private or unidentified numbers, although you will still receive calls from numbers that aren't stored in your contact list.",
      "Just keep in mind that you could also end up not getting important calls, which sometimes come from unknown numbers.",
      "If an unwanted call does get through, both Android and iPhone users can block the individual phone number by tapping on it in the recent callers or call history list. You can also enter numbers directly into your phone's block list.",
      "Sign up for the national Do Not Call registry, which is a list of numbers that have opted out of most telemarketing calls. The Federal Trade Commission, which runs the registry, says it only contains phone numbers and holds no other personally identifiable information, nor does the registry know whether the number is for a landline or a cellphone.",
      "The FTC says there are some exemptions, including political calls, calls from non-profit groups and charities, and legitimate survey groups that aren't selling anything. Also allowed are calls from companies up to 18 months after you've done \u2014 or sought to do \u2014 business with them.",
      "But it also warns that while having your number on the registry will cut down on unwanted sales calls, it won\u2019t stop scammers from making illegal calls.",
      "Other countries have similar registries. Canada has its own Do Not Call list while the U.K. has the Telephone Preference Service.",
      "Check whether your wireless carrier has a call-blocking service. Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T, three of the biggest U.S. networks, all have their own call filters for customers to block robocalls and report spam. There's typically a free basic version and an advanced version that requires a subscription fee.",
      "If your phone company's filters aren't good enough, try third-party apps to weed out unwanted callers.",
      "There are a host of smartphone apps available that promise to block spam calls, like Nomorobo, YouMail, Hiya, RoboKiller, TrueCaller and others. Many charge a monthly or annual subscription fee but some offer a free basic option. Some also can be installed on landline phones, but only if they use VOIP technology, not copper cables.",
      "The Associated Press hasn't tested any of these apps and isn't making specific recommendations. We recommend you read user reviews and try some out for yourself.",
      "Apple says the apps work by comparing a caller's number with a list of known numbers and labeling them, for example, spam or telemarketing. Then it might automatically block the call. \u201cIncoming calls are never sent to third-party developers,\u201d the company says.",
      "Did you know you can file a complaint with the FCC about specific spam calls? You can do so easily through an online form. It might not give you immediate satisfaction, but the National Consumer Law Center says data on complaints is the best tool federal agencies have for determining how big a problem robocalls are.",
      "While companies you've done business with can make robocalls to you, the National Consumer Law Center says it's probably because you gave consent - possibly hidden in fine print. But you can also revoke your consent at any time.",
      "Just tell the company representative that you want to \u201crevoke consent,\u201d and if that doesn't stop them, contact customer service and tell them that you don't consent to receive calls and want your number added to the company's \u201cdo not call\u201d list, the center says.",
      "You might be tempted to try to engage with the call in an attempt to get your number off the call list or be put through to a real person. The FTC warns against doing this and recommends that you just hang up.",
      "\u201cPressing numbers to speak to someone or remove you from the list will probably only lead to more robocalls,\u201d the agency says on its advice page. \u201cAnd the number on your caller ID probably isn\u2019t real. Caller ID is easy to fake\" and can't be trusted, it says.",
      "Cybersecurity company Kaspersky advises not even saying anything when you receive what you think is a robocall. We've all received scammy calls that start with something like \u201cHello, can you hear me?\u201d to which you've probably replied \u201cyes\u201d without thinking.",
      "Scammers \u201ccan then store the recording of your confirmation and use it for fraudulent activities,\u201d Kaspersky says. \u201cSo, avoid saying yes where possible.\u201d",

      "Three tropical cyclones are spinning in the South Pacific, an occurrence that scientists say is unusual.",
      "Tropical cyclones Rae, Seru and Alfred are all churning as the region is in the peak of a season that starts in November and ends in April.",
      "The storms are called cyclones when they happen in the Southwest Pacific and hurricanes when they form in the North Atlantic, but are essentially the same phenomenon.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not incredibly unusual to have three hurricanes simultaneously in the month of September in the North Atlantic,\u201d said Brian Tang, an atmospheric science professor at University at Albany. \u201cCertainly it is a very busy period for the South Pacific and three tropical cyclones is a lot to happen at once, but not unprecedented.\u201d",
      "The last time three such storms occurred in the South Pacific was January 2021 when Lucas, Ana and Bina were churning simultaneously, though it\u2019s not clear if Bina officially reached Category 1 status, Tang said.",
      "Rae formed Friday north of Fiji and brought whipping winds and heavy rain that damaged fruit trees, according to local reports.",
      "Alfred developed in the Coral Sea on Monday and is expected to bring flooding rains to the northeast Australia state of Queensland this weekend.",
      "Seru became a cyclone on Tuesday and is expected to track near the island nation of Vanuatu but remain offshore.",
      "Scientists say that's hard to say, but any explanation starts with the high activity that's usual this time of year.",
      "Gabriel Vecchi, a climate scientist at Princeton University, noted evidence of what's called a Madden\u2013Julian Oscillation \u2014 a fluctuation in the atmosphere that results in a blob of rising air and rainfall that circles the globe and lasts for 30 days or longer. He said it seems to be tracking over the southwest Pacific in a way that could enhance cyclone activity.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere is chaotic. There\u2019s a lot of natural fluctuation in it \u2026 we need to be open to the possibility that factors that are beyond our ability to predict might have led to these three cyclones at the same time,\u201d said Vecchi.",

      "NEW YORK -- Apple announced Monday that it plans to invest more than $500 billion in the United States over the next four years, including plans to hire 20,000 people and build a new server factory in Texas.",
      "The move comes just days after President Donald Trump said Apple CEO Tim Cook promised him that the tech giant\u2019s manufacturing would shift from Mexico to the U.S. Trump noted the company was doing so to avoid paying tariffs. That pledge, coupled with Monday's investment commitment, came as Trump continues to threaten to impose tariffs that could drive up the cost of iPhones made in China.",

      "Officials say a first-of-its-kind project will use a swarm of small, independent submersibles to monitor, protect and provide data on offshore artificial reefs whose purpose is to attract new marine life in otherwise barren sections of sea",
      "AYIA NAPA, Cyprus -- A first-of-its-kind project will use a swarm of small, independent submersibles to monitor, protect and provide data on offshore artificial reefs whose purpose is to attract new marine life in otherwise barren sections of sea, officials said Monday.",
      "The small, autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs, hailed as the \u201cfuture of underwater surveillance\u201d will be equipped with sensors and high-definition cameras to give scientists at the Cyprus Marine and Maritime Institute a clear picture on the effectiveness of their intricate artificial reefs designed and built using 3D printing.",
      "Made of an environmentally friendly cement mixture, the artificial reefs will be embedded with a docking station at which the AUVs can recharge and transmit collected data including video, said CMMI CEO Zakarias Siokouros.",
      "The advantage of the AUVs lies in their ability to loiter underwater for as long as a month at a time and provide a continuous flow of data while \u201cprotecting\u201d the reefs by alerting scientists to any disturbance in protected waters from illegal fishing and encroaching boats. Scientists would, in turn, notify local authorities.",
      "A trial run of the project, dubbed EONIOS, is currently underway off Cyprus\u2019 Ayia Napa marina. Scientists plan to place the artificial reefs in waters off Cyprus\u2019 southern coastal town of Limassol at a depth of around 20 meters (66 feet) where sunlight can still reach the seabed.",
      "\u201cThe reefs attract everything from vegetation to large fish and for waters off Cyprus where there isn\u2019t enough food for fish, we aim to create the appropriate environment to bring such fish there,\u201d Siokouros told The Associated Press following a demonstration of the AUVs' capabilities at the Ayia Napa Marina.",
      "EONIOS is a partnership between the CMMI, AUV makers Arkeocean of France, Cypriot tech company SignalGeneriX and French consultancy company Lanego.",
      "Siokouros said the partnership aims to market EONIOS to other countries who would want to build up their fish stocks using artificial reefs.",
      "A key selling point for the AUVs is that they can provide surveillance, 3D data collection and area protection at a significant discount compared to tethered submersibles, said Arkeocean official Tamara Brizard.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to make a system under which six of our mini-drones can do the same work for the price of one conventional drone,\u201d Brizard said.",
      "Arkeocean AUVs can currently pack a maximum 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of sensors and other gear and can operate to a depth of 300 meters (984 feet) although newer versions are being designed to reach 3,000 meters (9,842 feet). The AUVs receive commands through an attached acoustic antenna and can pinpoint their location.",
      "Battery-powered thrusters make the AUVs very stealthy and nearly undetectable, Brizard said, making them extremely useful for defense purposes such as surveillance in restricted waters. The AUVs can operate anywhere in the world thanks to an Iridium satellite antenna.",
      "The AUVs can also use undersea currents to roam, extending battery life. Another application is in the energy field where the submersibles can be used to detect seismic activity for offshore oil and gas exploration as well as finding suitable areas on which to build offshore wind and solar farms, said Brizard."

    "summary": "Public health experts are questioning RFK Jr's comments after he said the Texas measles outbreak was \"not unusual.\"",
    "story": [
      "\"We've shown we could eliminate this disease.\"",
      "In his first public comments on the measles outbreak hitting West Texas and New Mexico,\u00a0Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic whose first steps in combatting the outbreak will be closely watched, said his department was monitoring the situation daily but called it \"not unusual.\"",
      "\"Incidentally, there have been four measles outbreaks this year in this country. Last year there were 16. So, it's not unusual, we have measles outbreaks every year,\" Kennedy said Wednesday at the White House.",
      "However, some public health experts were quick to point out that the outbreak in Texas has defied America's recent history with the highly contagious disease.",
      "Prior to this outbreak, the U.S. had not seen a death from measles since 2015. And in 2000, years after the U.S. implemented a two-dose vaccine schedule, measles was declared eliminated from the U.S., meaning that the disease had stopped spreading within the country.",
      "Only in recent years have cases and outbreaks been rising, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The outbreak in West Texas and New Mexico is already drawing close to the halfway mark of total cases seen nationally last year, when there were at least 285 cases of measles \u2013 which were also the highest numbers since 2019, according to the CDC's latest figures.",
      "And while there were 16 outbreaks last year, that was a four-time increase from the number of outbreaks in 2023, when there were just four outbreaks. The U.S. has nearly hit that 2023 number already, just two months into 2025.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, called Kennedy's comments about measles cases happening \"every year\" an attempt to normalize an outbreak that has been anything but normal.",
      "\"First of all, we eliminated measles from this country by the year 2000. The reason measles have come back is because a critical percentage of parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children, because they've gotten misinformation and disinformation from people like him and his Children's Health Defense,\" Offit told ABC News.",
      "Children's Health Defense, a group founded by Kennedy, advocates against the recommended vaccine schedule for children.",
      "\"It's unconscionable enough that he's done that, but that he sort of glibly says, well, measles outbreaks occur every year \u2014 the point is they don't have to occur at all, because we've shown we could eliminate this disease,\" Offit said.",
      "ABC News has reached out to HHS about RFK Jr.'s comments.",
      "The increase in cases and outbreaks over the last few years coincides with decreasing vaccination coverage for measles among kindergarteners nationally from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year to 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year \u2013 leaving about 280,000 kindergartners at risk, according to the CDC.",
      "Kennedy, prior to taking his role as HHS secretary, said the measles vaccine is effective at preventing measles, but has also suggested that it's not necessary because people who die from measles are typically malnourished or have other comorbidities.",
      "\"The measles vaccine definitely eliminates measles, or, you know, close to eliminates it,\" Kennedy said in 2022.",
      "But he went on to question the deadliness of the disease.",
      "\"In 1963, it was killing only 400 kids a year. Mainly, they were kids who had malnutrition, or had some other devastating co-morbidity,\" Kennedy said. \"Those were the kids who were dying.\"",
      "Kennedy has also questioned that the deaths of 83 people \u2013 mostly young children \u2013 in Samoa in 2019 were caused by measles, despite widespread evidence that the deaths were due to an outbreak of the disease caused by under-vaccination in the American territory.",
      "\"Nobody died in Samoa from measles. They were dying from a bad vaccine,\" Kennedy told an interviewer last year.",
      "Twenty percent of kids with measles in the U.S. require hospitalization, said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, often for measles pneumonia, measles diarrhea, measles encephalitis or deafness from measles otitis, an ear infection \u2014 many of which can be life-threatening conditions.",
      "\"This is a bad, bad actor. And I'm really concerned that this thing is continuing to accelerate and expand,\" Hotez said Wednesday night in an interview on MSNBC.",
      "Doctors in West Texas have described shock and fear over treatingng a disease they thought was something of the past.",
      "\"This is the first time I've had any professional experience with a measles outbreak,\" Dr. Lara Johnson, pediatrician and Chief Medical Officer at Covenant Children's and Covenant Health in Lubbock, who is currently treating measles patients from the outbreak in West Texas, told ABC news.",
      "\"I saw one travel-related case when I was in medical school, very briefly, but at that time, back in around 2000, we really thought that we'd eradicated measles from the United States and didn't have any anticipation of seeing any outbreaks here,\" she said.",
      "The outbreak in Texas is a prime example of the risk posed to unvaccinated communities. Vaccine exemptions among children in Gaines County, the epicenter of the outbreak, have grown dramatically in the past few years. Roughly 7.5% of kindergarteners had filed an exemption for at least one vaccine in 2013. 10 years later, that number rose to over 17.5% \u2013 one of the highest in all of Texas, state health data shows.",
      "As the response to the outbreak in Texas and New Mexico continues, with cases expected to significantly rise, public health experts like Hotez and Offit say they're watching Kennedy, as leader of the nation's health department, to encourage swift surveillance and widespread vaccination.",
      "\"I want him to say to the American public that there's a safe way to prevent these outbreaks from happening so that we don't have the tragedy like what just happened in West Texas,\" Offit said. \"There's so much in medicine you don't know. There's so much we can't do. This we know. This we can do.\"",

    "summary": "The House GOP is considering significant cuts to Medicaid, potentially slashing billions. Health policy experts say Medicaid provides vital services to many Americans",
    "story": [
      "Republicans are considering slashing billions of dollars from Medicaid funding.",
      "Earlier this week, the House passed the Republican budget resolution. One goal is to slash $2 trillion over a decade from the federal budget, which could bring significant cuts to Medicaid.",
      "Medicaid is a joint federal and state health insurance program for disabled and low-income Americans. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services works with state programs to administer Medicaid, which enrolls more than 72.1 million people.",
      "Medicaid offers benefits including nursing home care, personal care services and assistance paying for premiums and other costs, according to CMS.",
      "Health policy experts say Medicaid provides vital services to many vulnerable Americans and cuts to the program could put them at risk of losing medical care, either by taking away their coverage or by closing the centers that provide such care.",
      "\"The Medicaid program provides this life-saving coverage for the most vulnerable individuals in our country,\" Mariana Socal, an associate professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told ABC News. \"The uncertainty surrounding coverage in the Medicaid program moving forward ... is a big stressor in the lives of these individuals who depend on the program.\"",
      "\"I think we should all agree that protecting the health of vulnerable individuals should be a priority in this country, not seen as an opportunity for savings,\" she continued. \"You can save dollars, but then we are not saving lives.\"",
      "One of the proposals being considered by the GOP to cut down on Medicaid costs includes getting rid of the Medicaid match rates. Under the Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid, the government finances 90% of the costs of those who were made newly eligible under the program.",
      "This could change to the government paying states the same it does for everyone else in the program, which is about two-thirds of total costs.",
      "Additionally, the federal government could implement per capita grants. Currently, the federal government matches what the states spend on payment -- at different levels for different states -- without a budget cap.",
      "The per capita cap would see the federal government set a limit on how much states can be reimbursed per enrollee.",
      "\"What that means then is, in order to live within that fixed budget, you would have to find either individuals to cut out of the program or services that you would not provide to people in the program,\" Dennis Shea, a professor of health policy and administration at Penn State College of Health & Human Development, told ABC News.",
      "Mark Peterson, a professor of public policy at UCLA Meyer and Renee Luskin School of Public Affairs, said the issue is not just cuts in federal spending but also how states would respond if there was a shortfall in funding.",
      "He said Medicaid is currently the single largest expenditure of the states, on average, and dramatic cuts in funding from the federal government would be an enormous hole for the states to fill.",
      "\"If they were to try to fill in, they either have to raise taxes significantly, which is not likely to happen, or they would have to cut, say, their next major spending category, which is also not likely,\" Peterson told ABC News. \"And even very wealthy states, like California, for instance, have been going through their own budget struggles. So, it's not as though they're sitting on a pile of money that's ready to reallocate. There would be extremely serious budgetary consequences.\"",
      "The experts say Medicaid cuts would also impact the health care system. Medicaid provides a great deal of funding for hospitals, long-term care facilities, nursing homes and services for children with special needs.",
      "Shea said one example is that Medicaid pays for more than 60% of nursing home residents. If funds are slashed, then residents won't have money to pay for nursing home care and nursing homes won't receive that revenue, which could lead to the closure of nursing homes.",
      "Rural Americans would also be at risk of losing services. Shea said many rural hospitals and community health centers have already closed and the ones that remain open already face funding challenges.",
      "If they were to lose Medicaid funding, they could face closures, which could deprive rural Americans of vital health services, he explained.",
      "\"In rural areas, Medicaid coverage tends to be a larger proportion of the coverage, so it's not unusual for 30, 40, 50% of people in a rural area to be covered by Medicaid,\" he said. \"And if that source of revenue is not coming into the hospitals or the nursing homes or the physician practices in those areas, it makes it that much harder for those businesses to survive.\"",
      "\"And so, we would probably see thousands of nursing homes close in rural areas \u2026 and you would see hundreds of hospitals closing too,\" he added."

      "Health and Human Services issued new guidance that recognizes only two sexes.",
      "Some major medical associations are pushing back against the Department of Health and Human Services' updated definitions of biological sex in federal policy in the wake of President Donald Trump's executive order.",
      "HHS issued new guidance on Feb. 19 where it said it \"recognizes there are only two sexes: male and female,\" adding: \"HHS will use these definitions and promote policies acknowledging that women are biologically female and men are biologically male.\"",
      "\"There is extensive scientific research that supports the complexity of sex and gender beyond binary classifications,\" American Psychological Association CEO Arthur C. Evans Jr., Ph.D., told ABC News in a statement. \"The new restrictive definition of sex ignores decades of science, increasing harm to youth and families, while undermining critical mental health outcomes.\"",
      "The new HHS guidance for the federal government defines \"sex\" as \"a person's immutable biological classification as either male or female.\" It further defines \"female\" as \"a person of the sex characterized by a reproductive system with the biological function of producing eggs (ova)\" and \"male\" as \"a person of the sex characterized by a reproductive system with the biological function of producing sperm.\" It additionally defines the definition of a \"woman\" as \"an adult human female\" and a \"man\" as \"an adult human male.\"",
      "The updated HHS guidance also includes definitions for \"father\" as describing a \"male parent\" and \"mother\" as describing a \"female parent.\"",
      "The HHS guidance doesn't mention intersex individuals -- people born with sex characteristics that don't fit typical definitions of male or female. The National Institutes of Health estimates that about .018% of the population is considered intersex.",
      "The federal government previously defined \"sex\" in broader terms.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one of HHS' agencies, defines sex as \"an individual's biological status as male, female, or something else. Sex is assigned at birth and associated with physical attributes, such as anatomy and chromosomes.\"",
      "The CDC's website defines gender as \"the cultural roles, behaviors, activities and attributes expected of people based on their sex.\"",
      "After Trump took office, the administration ordered the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration to remove certain public health websites, including the CDC's page with more gender-inclusive definitions, which were then taken offline. A judge granted a temporary restraining order to restore the pages after organizations filed lawsuits.",
      "A banner at the top of the CDC page currently states: \"Per a court order, HHS is required to restore this website as of 11:59PM ET, February 14, 2025. Any information on this page promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female.\"",
      "The HHS did not include its own definition of gender in its updated guidance posted Feb. 19.",
      "The second Trump administration has issued a number of executive orders targeting the transgender population, and a number of lawsuits have been filed to challenge them.",
      "Human biology is complex, and not all individuals fit neatly into binary categories, Evans told ABC News.",
      "\"We cannot just ignore the biological science that some people are born with a difference of sex development (DSD),\" Evans said in his statement. \"DSD are congenital conditions where the development of anatomical, chromosomal or gonadal sex is atypical. It is important that we support access to psychological and medical interventions for such individuals who do not fall into the male or female category, putting them at a higher risk of depression and anxiety.\"",
      "Evans also said the new HHS definitions excluded the concept of gender identity.",
      "\"It is crucial to recognize the psychological science on the validity of gender identity, as it allows for a more accurate understanding of individual experiences beyond the binary framework of biological sex,\" he said. \"Research consistently shows that affirming both sex and gender identity is vital for promoting mental health and well-being.\"",
      "In its updated guidance, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the Trump administration \"is bringing back common sense and restoring biological truth to the federal government. The prior administration's policy of trying to engineer gender ideology into every aspect of public life is over.\"",
      "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement that it will not change its current definitions of sex and gender, and will use inclusive language \"to recognize and affirm all people who seek and receive care from obstetrician-gynecologists.\"",
      "The ACOG also called on researchers to diversify studies by including gender-expansive participants and to report study participant characteristics inclusively by using language beyond traditional binary descriptors.",
      "The American Academy of Family Physicians noted its long-standing policy on care for transgender and nonbinary patients, saying in a statement that it will continue to recognize that \"diversity in gender identity and expression is a normal part of human existence and does not represent pathology.\"",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics said it will comply with all applicable executive orders as the law requires.\u00a0\"The AAP continues to hold that medical decisions are best made by patients, their families and their physicians, supported by medical evidence,\" the organization said in a statement.",
      "The American Medical Association's policy on the Medical Spectrum of Gender, first enacted in 2018, appears to remain unchanged. It \"affirms that an individual\u2019s genotypic sex, phenotypic sex, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity are not always aligned or indicative of the other, and that gender for many individuals may differ from the sex assigned at birth,\" according to the policy.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon told ABC News the department has no comment.",
      "ABC News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday, a day after HHS updated its guidance, that Trump \"reestablished the scientific and biological truth that there are only two sexes in this country -- male and female -- that those are biologically based determinations.\u00a0 They are not based and can never be based on gender identity.\"",

      "Trump has so far imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese imports and says he\u2019ll impose additional 10%, plus 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico on March 4. Trump also says he will impose \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d that match the duties other countries levy on the U.S. That comes on top of tariff plans on cars, semiconductors, steel and aluminum. Even if Trump doesn\u2019t ultimately move forward with all his tariff threats, the mere uncertainty has a chilling effect.",
      "\u201cIf one of the inputs of your factory goes up by 25%, you might cut your production and say maybe we\u2019ll have to fire some people,\u201d Ziemba added.",
      "Meanwhile, the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s slashing of the federal workforce across the country \u201calso impacts consumption, because people are losing their jobs or are afraid of losing their jobs, so that might cause them to save more money,\u201c Ziemba said.",
      "This week, The Conference Board\u2019s consumer sentiment survey found that it registered the largest monthly decline since August 2021.",
      "\u201cViews of current labor market conditions weakened. Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a 10-month high,\u201d said Stephanie Guichard, senior economist for global indicators at The Conference Board.",
      "\u201cAverage 12-month inflation expectations surged from 5.2% to 6% in February. This increase likely reflected a mix of factors, including sticky inflation but also the recent jump in prices of key household staples like eggs and the expected impact of tariffs,\u201d Guichard said.",
      "The Canada and Mexico tariffs would have a sweeping effect, since those are America\u2019s two biggest trading partners. It could raise prices at the grocery store and the gas pump. Ziemba also noted that the cost of cars could increase by several thousand dollars.",
      "\u201cEvery time a car part crosses the border, 25% tariffs could be very onerous,\u201d Ziemba said. \u201cWe could see the cost of building a house go up quite substantially.\u201d",

      "Republicans getting pressure from Democrats and some moderates in their party.",
      "House Republicans signaled they\u2019re going full steam ahead on significant changes to Medicaid, despite pressure from Democrats and even some moderates in their party.",
      "The suggested overhauls to the program, which provides health care for lower-income Americans and those with disabilities, are part of an effort to slash federal spending and hit the House GOP\u2019s goal of cutting $2 trillion over a decade from the federal budget.",
      "\u201cI support any plan that helps Medicaid be sustainable. And the current trajectory of Medicaid is not,\u201d said Florida Republican Rep. Byron Donalds, who recently declared he's running for governor of Florida -- a state with millions of Medicaid recipients.",
      "\"Medicaid is supposed to be for people who are disabled, for children, for single parents with multiple kids. That's what Medicaid is for. And if we continue down this line where it just becomes a bigger and bigger portfolio of beneficiaries, the federal government is not going to be able to afford the match,\" Donalds added.",
      "In a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson, moderate Republican members of the Congressional Hispanic Conference warned \"slashing Medicaid would have serious consequences, particularly in rural and predominantly Hispanic communities.\"",
      "Asked what he would say to Republican colleagues who are worried cuts to Medicaid will have a serious impact on lower income Americans, Donalds replied, \"I think some of that is, quite frankly, fear-based. We know the Democrats are already running ads about Medicaid and about how what we're trying to do is damaging to people and it\u2019s just simply not true.\"",
      "Some GOP members have floated adding new work requirements to the program and capping the amount of money states receive to run their Medicaid programs -- a pitch that could drastically reduce the number of people on Medicaid and limit the funding available for beneficiaries.",
      "\"I don't consider that a cut,\" Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., said about work requirements. \"I don't consider block-granting to the states a cut. The Democrats are using that but it\u2019s just not right.\"",
      "The exact plan is still unclear. Approving the House budget blueprint Tuesday night was just the first step in a months-long budgeting process that could stretch into the summer.",
      "\"We're very early in this process,\" New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, a moderate who represents a Staten Island district with a significant number of Medicaid recipients, said.",
      "\"Maybe you should wait until we actually do the work and highlight what we're going to do,\" she said.",
      "Republicans also believe they can achieve a significant amount of their spending cuts by targeting fraud in Medicaid and Medicare. But eliminating all fraud and waste would likely only chip away at Republicans\u2019 goal.",
      "Asked about that approach, Malliotakis said, \"There's about $50 billion a year in fraud, just within the Medicaid program.\"",
      "But whether Republicans can get to the kinds of numbers they're talking about by just eliminating fraud, Malliotakis said, \"Well, yes. Within the health care. You're going to look at that, you're going to look at the loopholes the states have put in place.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats are pouncing.",
      "An internal Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee memo first obtained by ABC News shows Democrats aim to make Medicaid cuts \"politically perilous for House Republicans\" in the November 2026 midterm elections.",
      "\u201cRather than delivering on their campaign promises to lower the high cost of living, [Republicans] are poised to pass an extreme budget scheme that would decimate affordable health care and take food off the tables of millions of American families,\u201d the memo reads.",

    "summary": "Since Elon Musk threatened federal workers with firings if they didn't list five work accomplishments, Trump tells them they're \"on the bubble\" if they don't comply.",
    "story": [
      "The president and Musk were asked about the confusion at his Cabinet meeting.",
      "After days of confusion over emails asking government workers to detail what they had done over the previous week, President Donald Trump didn't clear things up when asked about them in his Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.",
      "Asked by ABC News' Mary Bruce if the 1million workers who didn't reply to the email risked termination, Trump said, \"I wouldn't say that we're thrilled about it. They haven't responded. Now, maybe they don't exist. Maybe we're paying people that don't exist,\" he said. \"But those people are on the bubble ...they're going to be gone.\"",
      "But despite Trump's assertion, there is still mixed guidance on how employees should respond.",
      "Millions of workers were left in limbo after Musk posted on X Saturday that they could be terminated if they did not respond to a \"What did you do last week?\" email from the Office of Personnel Management. Soon after the e-mail was sent, some agency leaders, particularly those who work with sensitive and confidential information, told their employees not to reply. Others cautioned against replying to the request without guidance.",
      "OPM late Monday afternoon offered guidance saying a reply was not mandatory and to rely on guidance from individual agencies. Then Musk offered another threat in a post Monday night, saying employees were being given \"another chance\" and \"Failure to respond a second time will result in termination\" and set a deadline of Tuesday night.",
      "To add to the confusion, Musk said he intended to send another email without saying when. Asked by Bruce if a response to the next email, Trump didn't answer directly, saying, \"We're trying to figure out, do they exist? Who are they? And it's possible that a lot of those people will be actually fired.\"",
      "It is unclear if Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have any power to terminate employees over the email request. The previous emails sent from OPM, in essence the government's human relations department, did not have any mention of termination -- those threats were issued only from Musk on his X platform.",
      "Those not following Musk on social media might have not been aware of the threats.",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the largest union of federal workers, called the email unlawful and has threatened legal action.",
      "Wednesday's remarks came after a confusing weekend for government workers.",
      "Senior White House officials -- who had not been fully briefed on the plan -- were initially caught off guard, multiple sources told ABC News.",
      "Before OPM weighed in Monday afternoon, some agencies like Health and Human Services first told employees to reply then reversed itself hours later before issuing specific guidelines on what employees could or could not post in their replies.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed Tuesday that the move was to ensure that federal employees were actually working their jobs and declined to comment if this was a tactic to eliminate more federal jobs.",
      "The White House claimed Trump sent Musk an e-mail with five things he had done, but they were generic talking points.",
      "Musk told reporters Wednesday that the email was his idea after the president told him to \"be more aggressive\" with his cuts.",
      "\"I said, 'Can we send out an email to everyone just saying what did you get done last week?' The president said, 'Yes.' So, we did that,\" Musk said.",
      "Musk used similar tactics when he bought Twitter, which he renamed X, making employees submit weekly reports detailing projects and accomplishments and contributions. Replying to a post on Saturday pointing out the simiarities , Musk wrote, \u201cIt works.\u201d",
      "When asked by Bruce if he had a target number of employees he wanted to cut, Musk didn't give a concrete answer.",
      "\"We wish to keep everyone who is doing a job that is essential and doing that job well, but if the job is not essential or they're not doing the job well, they obviously should not,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "UK's Keir Starmer didn't echo that sentiment as he pushed for security promises.",
      "President Donald Trump said on Thursday he believed President Vladimir Putin would \"keep his word\" if a deal is reached with Russia to end its invasion of Ukraine -- and that Britain could \"take care of themselves\" if its peacekeeping troops were attacked, although he then added the U.S. would \"help.\"",
      "The comments came when Trump hosted United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House, as the U.S. president says Europe will need to take the lead on security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "Starmer and France's Emmanuel Macron came to Washington this week after Europe and Ukraine were shut out of peace talks between the U.S. and Russia in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"We agree that history must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader,\" Starmer pointedly said during a news conference with Trump, who had earlier avoided saying Russia had attacked Ukraine. \"So, the stakes, they couldn't be higher. And we're determined to work together to deliver a good deal.\"",
      "Ukraine's Zelenskyy is expected to travel to the nation's capital on Friday to sign a proposed agreement enabling the U.S. to access revenue from Ukraine's wealth of critical minerals and other resources.",
      "Here are key takeaways from the Trump-Starmer meeting.",
      "Trump said he didn't believe Putin would try to reinvade Ukraine after the war if the United States didn't provide a \"backstop\" in the region along with European peacemakers.",
      "Speaking more about his relationship with Putin, Trump said they've known each other for a \"long time\" and that going through the \"Russia hoax\" together gave him some trust in the Russian leaders as negotiations unfold. (Trump was likely referring to the investigation into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election).",
      "\"I think he'll keep his word,\" Trump said of Putin.",
      "Starmer didn't go nearly as far when asked if he agreed with Trump's assessment.",
      "\"I think my views on Putin are pretty well-rehearsed and pretty well known,\" Starmer responded. He added if there is an agreement, it's \"really important that Putin knows that this deal -- a historic deal which I very much hope comes about -- is there, is there and it's a lasting deal and we're able to deal with any inclination he has to go again or go further.\"",
      "Trump was asked if the U.S. would come to Britain's aid if British troops deployed to keep the peace in Ukraine were attacked by Russia. Starmer said the U.K. is ready to \"ready to put boots on the ground and planes in the air to support a deal.\"",
      "\"You know, I've always found about the British, they don't need much help. They can take care of themselves very well,\" Trump responded with Starmer sitting beside him.",
      "\"It sounds like it's evasive, but it's not evasive. You know, the British are -- have been incredible soldiers, incredible military, and they can take care of themselves,\" he continued. \"But if they need help, I'll always be with the British, okay? I will always be with them. But they don't need help.\"",
      "Trump was later asked if he supported Article 5 of NATO -- which outlines that an attack against one ally is considered as an attack against all allies -- and whether he was concerned it may be triggered if European peacekeepers end up in Ukraine after the war.",
      "\"I support it,\" Trump said of Article 5. \"I don't think we're going to have any reason for it. I think we're going to have a very successful peace and I think it's going to be a long lasting peace.\"",
      "Asked repeatedly about what role the U.S. will play in Ukraine's security after the war, Trump declined to discuss any guarantees or U.S. participation in peacekeeping but argued that a mineral resource deal would serve as a kind of \"backstop.\"",
      "\"We'll have a lot of people working there,\" he said. \"And so, in that sense, it's very good. It's a backstop, you could say. I don't think anybody's going to play around if we're there with a lot of workers and having to do with rare earths and other things which we need for our country, and we appreciate it very much.\"",
      "Trump said the focus should first be on securing an agreement between Russia and Ukraine before talk about peacekeeping in the region.",
      "\"I don't like to talk about peacekeeping until we have a deal,\" he said.",
      "Starmer, for his part, made clear his view that security guarantees are critical. \"If there's a deal in, we got to make sure it's a deal that lasts,\" he told Trump.",
      "Trump on calling Zelenskyy a dictator: 'Did I say that?'",
      "As he prepares to host Zelenskyy in Washington on Friday, Trump appeared to try to soften his past comments blasting the Ukrainian leader.",
      "When asked if he still believed Zelenskyy was a dictator, Trump responded: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that.\"",
      "Trump called Zelenskyy a \"dictator without elections\" in a social media post last week. He's notably declined to apply the same term to Putin.",
      "Trump was asked if he will apologize to Zelenskyy for the comment when they meet.",
      "\"I think we're going to have a very good meeting tomorrow ... We're going to get along very well, okay? We have a lot of respect. I have a lot of respect for him,\" Trump said. \"We've given him a lot of equipment and a lot of money but they have fought very bravely. No matter how you figure it, they have really fought.\"",
      "After previously saying it was unrealistic for Ukraine to return to its pre-war borders, Trump said he will try to get some of it back in peace talks.",
      "\"Well, they've fought long and hard on the land, and you and I will be discussing that, and we're going to certainly try and get as much as we can back,\" Trump said.",
      "The president was also asked if there had been any discussion around returning Crimea to Ukraine.",
      "\"There were a lot of areas that were taken. Yeah, we've talked about it. A lot of the sea line has been taken, and we'll be talking about that. And we're going to see if we can get it back or get a lot of it back for Ukraine, if that's possible. We'll be seeing about that,\" Trump said.",
      "At the same time, he firmly ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine. \"That's not going to happen,\" he said.",

      "A Mississippi judge on Wednesday vacated her order that a newspaper remove its editorial criticizing local officials, days after a city decided to drop the lawsuit that spurred it.",
      "The judge's order had been widely condemned by free speech advocates as a clear violation of the paper's First Amendment rights.",
      "Chancery Judge Crystal Wise Martin had issued the restraining order against the Clarksdale Press Register last week, telling it to remove from its website a Feb. 8 editorial titled \u201cSecrecy, Deception Erode Public Trust.\u201d The piece criticized the city for not sending the newspaper notice about a meeting the board held regarding a proposed tax on alcohol, marijuana and tobacco.",
      "The board of commissioners dropped the suit Monday at the request of Mayor Chuck Espy, who cited an offer from the paper's owner to run a clarification. However, Emmerich Newspapers president Wyatt Emmerich said he made that offer before the city filed its lawsuit and that it was no longer on the table.",
      "Emmerich had offered to clarify that the council said the lack of notification wasn\u2019t a deliberate attempt to hide the meeting, according to a text message Emmerich sent to the city attorney. The text also offered to clarify that a sentence questioning whether there was \u201ckick-back from the community\u201d should have said \u201cpush back.\u201d",
      "The city\u2019s lawsuit called the editorial libelous and said it \u201cchilled and hindered\u201d the city\u2019s efforts to lobby for the tax with state legislators. The newspaper and other critics of the ruling said the order was a clear example of prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment.",
      "The order drew widespread criticism from press groups and free speech advocates around the country, including the National Press Club and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression had agreed to represent the newspaper in court."

      "The legal battle over Adnan Syed 's conviction, scrutinized a decade ago in the hit podcast \u201cSerial,\u201d keeps twisting and turning, even after prosecutors freed him from more than 23 years in prison for a murder he still says he didn't commit.",
      "Baltimore prosecutors resolved one key question this week, dropping an earlier request to clear Syed's record and instead saying his murder conviction will stand.",
      "But they also joined his defense lawyers in asking a judge on Wednesday to reduce his sentence to the time he served. The victim's family objected during the emotional hearing, saying he should serve out his original life sentence.",
      "The judge said she'll rule soon. Meanwhile, here's what you \u2014 like the true crime enthusiasts who became obsessed with the genre after listening to the \u201cSerial\u201d podcast in 2014 \u2014 need to know.",
      "Syed was 17 when his high school ex-girlfriend and classmate, Hae Min Lee, was found strangled to death and buried in a makeshift grave in 1999. At trial, prosecutors said Syed killed her after becoming inconsolably jealous when the two broke up and she began dating someone else. Syed was convicted of murder and received life in prison, plus 30 years.",
      "Syed's appeal didn't gain traction until the debut season of \u201cSerial\u201d raised doubts about cellphone tower data and other evidence. No eyewitnesses tied him to the crime, and Syed\u2019s attorney, Cristina Gutierrez, failed to interview an alibi witness who said she was with Syed at the time Lee was killed. Gutierrez, a high-profile Baltimore-area criminal defense attorney, was disbarred in 2001 when client funds went missing. She died in 2004.",
      "A plethora of legal activity followed in multiple courts, until Baltimore's former top prosecutor, Marilyn Mosby, moved to vacate the conviction in 2022, allowing Syed to walk free. But Maryland's Supreme Court then reinstated the conviction on procedural grounds, saying Lee's family wasn't given enough advance warning to testify in person.",
      "Mosby's successor, Ivan Bates, announced on the eve of Wednesday's hearing that his office is withdrawing the motion to vacate \u201cto preserve the credibility of our office and maintain public trust in the justice system.\u201d",
      "Today, it's a given that millions of people are listening to podcasts where popular hosts can be catapulted into celebrity status. But in 2014, the podcast world was still relatively new.",
      "That's when \u201cSerial\u201d dropped. The podcast was the brainchild of longtime radio producer and former Baltimore Sun reporter Sarah Koenig, who spent more than a year digging into Syed\u2019s case and built suspense as she reported her findings in hourlong segments.",
      "The podcast debut didn't just cast doubt on Syed's murder conviction; it also upended the true crime genre by portraying Syed as a sympathetic character, rather than taking a defendant's guilt for granted.",
      "There's been a flood of true crime interest since Koenig's smash hit. Experts are conflicted on the rise of online sleuths, who can expose wrongdoing, but also sow distrust of the U.S. criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cThis is not a podcast for me. This is real life,\u201d said Hae Min Lee's brother Young Lee, when the conviction was vacated in 2022.",
      "Ultimately, Lee family's appealed to the Maryland Supreme Court, arguing crime victims should be given a larger role in the process. And Young Lee was able to speak in court on Wednesday, urging a judge to return Syed to prison for life.",
      "Judge Jennifer Schiffer indicated that her ruling will take into account Syed's recent accomplishments and the unimaginable suffering of the victim\u2019s family as well as the horrific nature of the crime.",
      "She also offered an apology to Young Lee, telling him: \u201cI am so sorry for what you\u2019ve been through, and all I can say is that your words are not lost on me, and my heart goes out to you.\u201d"

      "Existing Alabama law already offers enhanced legal protections for law enforcement, but proponents of the \u201cback the blue\u201d bill say that it will increase the recruitment and retention of officers and make police safer.",
      "Police and civilians alike are currently entitled to a \u201cstand your ground\u201d hearing in criminal cases where a judge can determine whether the defendant acted in self defense. The new bill would allow an additional immunity hearing for officers accused of criminal wrongdoing, where a judge will decide if a case can proceed based on whether the officer acted recklessly outside the scope of law enforcement duties.",
      "As the bill is currently written, even if the judge initially denies the officer immunity in a criminal case, defense attorneys for the officers can repeat their argument for immunity in front of a jury.",
      "Unlike civilians, police are also currently protected from civil liability unless an officer acts \u201cwillfully, maliciously, fraudulently, in bad faith, beyond his or her authority, or under a mistaken interpretation of the law.\u201d The new bill would limit liability further to mirror the standards used the criminal immunity hearing.",
      "Norma Sanders, the president of the Lee County NAACP in the eastern part of the state, said at a public hearing in February that the organization gets complaints regularly about police brutality, but that it is already difficult to get legal accountability under current law.",
      "\u201cWe know that many of the police officers receive little to no punishment when they commit a crime, because they are hiding behind the badge and say that they feared for their lives,\u201d Sanders said.",
      "The bill is one of several in Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey \u2019s crime package that she said is as a priority for this legislative session.",
      "Republican Rep. Rex Reynolds, who sponsored the bill, said that it is essential for officer safety.",
      "\u201cWe need that same confidence within our law enforcement officers that they can perform their duties \u2014 sometimes at 21 years old \u2014 and put them in a situation where within three seconds they have to make a discretionary authority decision,\u201d Reynolds said.",
      "Democrats on the state House of Representatives Judiciary Committee argued that it made officers functionally immune from criminal prosecution, and pointed to several high-profile police killings in the state that have not resulted in guilty verdicts.",
      "Former Alabama police officer Jim Taylor testified at the February hearing that the bill has the potential to undermine an already strained relationship between some citizens and law enforcement.",
      "\u201cThe trust in law enforcement is conditioned on the ability to hold officers accountable for their actions. That\u2019s what builds trust in our communities with our law enforcement representatives,\u201d Taylor said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department is abandoning cases that sought to force police and fire departments to end what the Biden administration alleged were discriminatory hiring processes, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Wednesday in the latest move by the Trump administration to end government support for efforts to increase diversity.",
      "A Justice Department official said the administration is walking away from four cases, including one that led to a settlement agreement resolving an investigation into discriminatory hiring practices affecting Black and female applicants to the Maryland State Police.

      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump is planning a \u201cgold card\u201d visa with a potential pathway to U.S. citizenship for $5 million.",
      "The program would replace an existing program that offers U.S. visas to investors who spend about $1 million on a company that employs at least 10 people. And it echoes similar \u201cgolden visa \u201d programs in countries such as Canada, New Zealand, Malta and others that have allowed participants to pay a fee or make an investment in order to secure a pathway to residency in desirable places.",
      "\u201cGolden visa\u201d programs all have different frameworks and paths to permanent residency and have had mixed results in spurring investment in a country's economy.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said Trump's gold card would replace an existing program in two weeks, so details about who would qualify and what the application process would look like should be available before then. For now, all Trump has said is they will cost $5 million.",
      "Of recipients, he said, \u201cThey\u2019ll be wealthy and they\u2019ll be successful and they\u2019ll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people, and we think it\u2019s going to be extremely successful.\u201d",
      "He added that companies, not just individuals, \u201c will be able to buy gold cards. \u201d",
      "Congress created a program called EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program in 1990 to create jobs and encourage foreign investment. Under that program, investors who spent about $1 million on a company that employs at least 10 people can qualify for a visa and a pathway to permanent residency.",
      "About 8,000 people obtained investor visas in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, according to the Homeland Security Department\u2019s most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics.",
      "Henley & Partners, which advises both governments and people on residence or citizenship by investment programs, says more than 100 countries around the world offer or have offered \u201cgolden visas\u201d to wealthy individuals and investors. That list includes the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy, although some countries have tightened their restrictions or ended programs.",
      "Under different programs in different countries, requirements include buying a house, making a financial investment or creating a certain number of jobs.",
      "Basil Mohr-Elzeki, managing partner Henley & Partners North America, said the programs often help countries meet investment goals. But they don't always last.",
      "Spain\u2019s government scrapped its program to allow people from outside the European Union to obtain residency permits if they invested more than half a million euros ($520,000) in real estate. The program was criticized for causing soaring housing prices. The U.K. ended its program in 2022 over security concerns.",
      "Mohr-Elzeki of Henley & Partners said despite the high price tag, there may be an appetite for the program, but it remains to be seen what the parameters are.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have that much information aside from the investment threshold and the intention,\u201d he said. But generally these kind of programs can help countries meet investment goals, depending on the goal, he said.",
      "\u201cWe do think that there will be significant demand in this program,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are just waiting on on the details of what frameworks that they\u2019re going to be outlining.\u201d",
      "The key to whether it will be a success or not will less likely be the $5 million investment threshold and more to do with the process.",
      "\u201cTypically speaking, the lower the residency requirements, the more popular the program as those wealthy individuals globally, they like options,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they may be investing in the United States, but they may invest elsewhere as well \u2014 to have access to live in the States, access to live in Europe, access to live in the UAE. So all of these come into play. \u201d",
      "If the new program replaces the existing EB-5 program in two weeks, there are questions over what will happen to people in the existing program. Typically those people get grandfathered in to the new program but there's a possibility they might not be, said Mohr-Elzeki.",
      "In 2022, Congress extended the EB-5 program until 2027, so Congressional action would be needed to change it. But Trump has said gold cards won't require Congressional approval."

      "The policy memo was included in the latest court filing in a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's executive order against transgender military service, one of many hot-button issues the president made a priority to address on his first days in office.",

      "The policy provides two exceptions \u2014 if transgender personnel who seek to enlist can prove on a case-by-case basis that they directly support warfighting activities, or if an existing service member, who was diagnosed with gender dysphoria, can prove they support a specific warfighting need and never transitioned to the gender they identify with and proves over 36 months they are stable in their biological sex \u201cwithout clinically significant distress.\u201d",
      "If a waiver is issued in either case, the applicant would still face a situation where only their biological sex was recognized for bathroom facilities, sleeping quarters and even in official recognition, such as being called \u201cSir\u201d or \u201cMa'am.\u201d",
      "Gender dysphoria occurs when a person's biological sex does not match up with their gender identity.",
      "While the number of transgender troops serving is small compared to the size of the total force, it's taken up a large amount of time and attention both at the White House and within the Pentagon. The military services due to medical privacy laws do not provide an exact count of transgender troops, but a 2018 independent study by the Palm Center, which researched LGBTQ issues, assessed there were an estimated 14,000 transgender troops among the more than 2 million troops serving.",
      "It was a policy Trump tried to overturn in his first term in office but the issue ended up mired in lawsuits until former President Joe Biden was elected and he overturned the ban."

      "POTTSVILLE, Pa. -- A Pennsylvania hiker had followed his dog off a mountain trail this week when he glanced toward a deep coal pit below and saw a tail move near a pile of rocks.",
      "Collin Leiby, an avid hiker and wedding photographer, locked eyes with the animal and knew it was Freddy, a 6-month-old Golden Retriever whose disappearance had sparked a weeklong search in Pottsville, a community in eastern eastern Pennsylvania\u2019s historic coal country. Leiby had been on alert for the missing dog and finally found him Monday on Sharp Mountain, about 10 feet (3 meters) down the coal pit, too weary to make his way out.",
      "\u201cA tear came to my eye,\u201d said Leiby, 33, who lives a few blocks from the dog's home. \u201cI started calling his name. He slowly got up and started walking toward us.\u201d",
      "Freddy made it partway up the icy side wall while Leiby reached down and grabbed him. He gave him water, clipped a spare leash on him and walked Freddy off the mountain alongside his dog, a pit bull mix named Bass.",
      "\u201cHe was crying and jumping on me,\u201d Leiby said. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Get me home.\u2019\u201d",
      "Pam and Joe Palko had pulled out all the stops since Freddy went missing on Feb. 17. They took to social media. They chased tips. They organized a posse of volunteers to distribute flyers in schools, churches and across town in Pottsville. They even hired a company that uses search dogs to track missing pets, and another that flew thermal drones overhead.",
      "That helped rule some places out. But there was still no sign of the 6-month-old puppy as the week wore on and temperatures dipped into the single digits in snow-covered Schuylkill County.",
      "\u201cIt was excessively cold,\u201d said Pam Palko, a financial planner and mother of three. \u201cWe knew we would never give up, but the more that time went on throughout the week, our hopes were getting smaller.\"",
      "They were chasing one of many false alarms at a nearby animal shelter just before dusk Monday when Joe Palko got an alert from their home security camera. A stranger was at the door with Freddy. Then their neighbor called. They raced home.",
      "\u201cHe just was a little frantic, hungry and confused,\u201d said the neighbor, Dr. Carolyn Canizaro-Orlowsky, a retired veterinarian. \u201cWhen they showed up, he started wiggling.\"",
      "The Palkos, whose children are 17, 20 and 22, had been especially heartsick after losing a beloved 4-year-old dog last year to cancer. They had gotten Freddy not only for themselves, but to give their other Golden Retriever, 2-year-old Harper, a new companion.",
      "Freddy, who had weighed about 45 pounds (20 kilograms), lost at least 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) from the ordeal, and is a little the worse for wear, but otherwise healthy. The Palkos are grateful for that, and for the community that went to such lengths to reunite them.",
      "\u201cThere's a big collective sigh of relief,\" said Canizaro-Orlowsky. \u201cIt's a neat lesson not to give up.\u201d",

Many believe they\u2019re on solid legal ground, and they know it would be all but unprecedented \u2014 and extremely time-consuming \u2014 for the government to cut off funding.",
      "State officials in Washington and California urged schools not to make changes, saying it doesn\u2019t change federal law and doesn\u2019t require any action. New York City schools have taken the same approach and said district policies and curriculum have not changed.",
      "Leaders of some colleges shrugged the memo off entirely. Antioch University \u2019s chief said \u201cmost of higher education\u201d won\u2019t comply with the memo unless federal law is changed. Western Michigan University\u2019s president told his campus to \u201cplease proceed as usual.\u201d",

      "Education organizations have been urging a measured approach, warning institutions not to make any hasty cuts that would be difficult to undo. Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, is telling colleges that if they were in compliance with federal law before the memo, they still are.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to act on until we see the administration or its agencies try to stop something,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll have the argument.\u201d",
      "A loss of federal money would be devastating for schools and colleges, but imposing that penalty would not be quick or simple.",
      "The Education Department office that conducts civil rights investigations had fewer than 600 employees last year \u2014 before the Trump administration began cutting staff \u2014 while the U.S. has more than 18,000 school districts and 6,000 colleges.",
      "Even when a school or state faces an investigation, it can take years to terminate funding. Under former President Joe Biden, the Education Department tried to pull federal money from Michigan\u2019s education agency after finding it violated the rights of students with disabilities. The investigation began in 2022 and is still tied up in federal court.",
      "\u201cI hope very much that schools charged with providing inclusive, equal education to every student in their school community will stand for that principle,\u201d said Catherine Lhamon, who led the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights under Biden.",

      "The memo said schools have promoted DEI efforts often at the expense of white and Asian American students.",
      "It doesn\u2019t carry the weight of law but explains how the new administration will interpret nondiscrimination laws. It dramatically expands a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring the use of race in college admissions to all aspects of education \u2014 including, hiring, promotion, scholarships, housing, graduation ceremonies and campus life.",
      "The guidance is being challenged in court by the American Federation of Teachers, which said the memo violates free speech laws.",
      "While some schools are keeping quiet out of fear of being targeted, many leaders also are still struggling to grasp the implications.",
      "\u201cWe are looking to our attorney general for guidance because it\u2019s very confusing,\u201d said Christine Tucci Osorio, superintendent of the North St. Paul School District in Minnesota.

      "Usually, civil rights investigations by the Education Department take at least six months and often much longer. If a school is found in violation of federal law, department policy offers a chance to come into compliance and sign a resolution \u2014 typically a 90-day process.",
      "Only if a school refuses to comply can the department move to revoke federal money. That can be done in the Education Department through a court-like process decided by an administrative law judge.

      "Late last week, Trump fired Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr. as chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth followed that by firing Adm. Lisa Franchetti, chief of naval operations; Gen. Jim Slife, vice chief of the Air Force; and the judge advocates general for the military services.",
      "Hegseth has defended the firing of Brown, saying that other presidents made changes in military personnel and that Trump deserves to pick his own team. Hegseth said he fired the JAGs because he didn\u2019t think they were \u201cwell-suited\u201d to provide recommendations when lawful orders are given.",
      "The letter \u2014 signed by William Perry, Leon Panetta, Chuck Hagel, Jim Mattis and Lloyd Austin \u2014 said there were no real justifications for the firings because several of the officers had been nominated by Trump for previous positions. And it said they had exemplary careers, including operational and combat experience.",
      "\u201cWe, like many Americans \u2014 including many troops \u2014 are therefore left to conclude that these leaders are being fired for purely partisan reasons,\u201d said the letter, adding that \u201cwe\u2019re not asking members of Congress to do us a favor; we\u2019re asking them to do their jobs.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, they said, senators should refuse to confirm any new Pentagon nominations, including retired Lt. Gen. Dan Caine, who Trump has said should be the next joint chiefs chairman.",
      "Trump\u2019s choice of Caine is unusual. Caine, who is widely respected in the military, would have to come back onto active duty but he does not meet the legal requirements for the top post. According to law, a chairman must have served as a combatant commander or service chief. The president can waive those requirements.",
      "Hagel is a Republican and Mattis, an independent, was Trump's first defense chief. The other three are Democrats. Four of the five served in the military, including two \u2014 Mattis and Austin \u2014 who were four-star generals.",
      "\"The House and Senate should demand that the administration justify each firing and fully explain why it violated Congress\u2019 legislative intent that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff complete a four-year term in office,\" the letter said.",
      "The chairman has a four-year term, and Brown had served a bit less than 17 months.",
      "In recent decades, a number of three-star and four-star officers have been fired, but Pentagon leaders have routinely made clear why they were ousted. Those reasons included disagreements over the conduct of the Iraq or Afghanistan wars, problems with the oversight of America\u2019s nuclear arsenal and public statements critical of the president and other leaders."

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Labor unions are asking a federal judge in San Francisco on Thursday for an emergency injunction blocking the mass firings of probationary federal employees by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, saying officials not only lack the authority to order terminations but that notices to workers were premised on a lie of poor job performance.",
      "On the other side, attorneys for the U.S. Office of Personnel Management will argue before U.S. District Judge William Alsup that the office did not create a \u201cmass termination program\u201d as plaintiffs say, but asked agencies to review and determine whether employees on probation were fit for continued employment.",
      "\u201cAgencies were responsible for deciding which probationary employees to keep and to terminate,\u201d said Charles Ezell, acting director of the personnel office in a declaration filed with the court, adding that a determination of fitness must \u201ctake into account the existing needs and interests of government.\"",
      "\"An agency must determine, and OPM has determined, that only the highest-performing probationers in mission-critical areas demonstrate the necessary fitness or qualifications for continued employment,\u201d he said.",
      "The complaint filed last week by a coalition of five labor unions and five nonprofit organizations is among multiple lawsuits pushing back on the administration's efforts to vastly shrink the federal workforce, which Trump has called bloated and sloppy. Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired and his administration is now aiming at career officials with civil service protection.",
      "There are an estimated 200,000 probationary workers \u2014 generally employees who have less than a year on the job \u2014 across federal agencies. About 15,000 are employed in California, providing services ranging from fire prevention to veterans\u2019 care, the complaint says.",
      "Elon Musk has led the purge through the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, roiling the workforce with demands including a Saturday email sent through the personnel office ordering workers to list five things they did last week or risk getting fired. The Office of Personnel Management later said that the edict was voluntary, although workers could face similar requests in the future.",
      "Unions have recently struck out with two other federal judges.",
      "A judge in Washington, D.C., last week denied a motion from unions to temporarily block layoffs because he found their complaint should be heard in federal labor court. Earlier this month, a judge in Massachusetts said unions suing over a deferred resignation offer weren't directly affected and so lacked legal standing to challenge it.",
      "The coalition in San Francisco, which includes groups representing veterans and small businesses, seeks an injunction to stop more firings and to rescind those that have already happened.",
      "Congress has determined that each agency is responsible for managing its employees and the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as a human resources department for the federal government, lacks the authority to terminate workers in the way that it did, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The plaintiffs say in their complaint that numerous agencies informed workers that the personnel office had ordered the terminations, with an order to use a template e-mail informing workers their firing was for performance reasons.",
      "Probationary employees of the National Science Foundation, for example, were told by the foundation that it had decided to retain its workers but was overruled by the Office of Personnel Management, according to the complaint.",
      "The coalition argues the judge should issue a temporary restraining order in part due to the ongoing \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to the organizations and their members, including the loss of work and benefits and disruption of critical government services."

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 00:06:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Ireland is investing billions of euros to revamp its healthcare service - will AI help?",
    "story": [
      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",
      "When AI influences their decisions, doctors need to \"be able to articulate the reasoning behind those decisions in a manner that is accessible and understandable to those affected,\" he says.",

      "Since taking office, he has raised tariffs of 10% on goods from China and taken steps to hit other imports with duties, including directing his staff to develop recommendations for custom \"reciprocal\" tariffs for each country.",
      "But he has also suspended some of those plans, leaving many businesses and analysts guessing as to whether he is prepared to carry out his threats.",
      "\"The 25% threat that he threw out today is in line with the high end of the range that he previously indicated,\" said Tobin Marcus, head of US policy and politics at Wolfe Research.",
      "\"It's a number that's concerning - certainly should be concerning - for the trans-Atlantic trade relationship, but not totally out of the blue.\"",
      "'Worried, not afraid'",
      "Antonin Finkelnburg, of the Federation of German Wholesale, Foreign Trade and Services which represents businesses, told the BBC that a 25% tariff on EU goods entering the US would created a \"difficult\" but \"not an impossible\" situation for Germany's economy.",
      "\"We are worried but we shouldn't be afraid,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "Germany's car industry's products are popular in the US.",
      "Mr Finkelnburg said many German car manufacturers were \"already producing in the American market, so they wouldn't be directly affected by the tariffs\", but said tariffs would still drive up prices.",
      "\"The car parts that are manufactured in to those cars are crossing the borders of Mexico and Canada several times so that already is driving the prices up,\" he added.",
      "Earlier this month, Trump ordered 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, America's top two trading partners. But he suspended the duties before they went into effect until 4 March, to allow for talks on border security.",
      "On Monday, Trump said he expected tariffs of 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada to come into effect \"on schedule\".",
      "At Wednesday's meeting, when asked for an update, he said the 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada would go into effect on 2 April.",

      "BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production.",
      "The energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been lower than its rivals.",
      "BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).",
      "The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.",
      "Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".",
      "He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.",
      "He said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.",
      "Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.",
      "Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.",
      "BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.",
      "The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.",
      "BP shareholders want it to make money, not climate policy",
      "BP set to scale back green investments as profits drop sharply",

      "Mr Auchincloss is under pressure to boost profits from some shareholders, including the influential activist group Elliot Management, which took a near \u00a34bn stake in the \u00a370bn company to push for more investment in oil and gas.",
      "In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year.",
      "However, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production.",
      "Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables.",
      "The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".",
      "Alexander Kirk from Global Witness added BP \"cannot be trusted to deliver the clean energy transition\", adding that it was \"focusing on short-term profits to shareholders while energy prices are high, with the rest of the world picking up the tab from its climate-wrecking products\".",
      "Global Witness drove a lorry around central London with messages criticising BP's decision.",
      "Sir Ian Cheshire, who has held many executive roles at companies such as B&Q owner Kingfisher and Barclays bank, questioned whether BP's latest move would work.",
      "\"I do wonder whether this sort of decision will look right in 10 years,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,\" he said.",
      "'Not just down to one company'",
      "Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.",
      "She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.",
      "According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,",
      "\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told the Scottish Affairs committee of MPs.",
      "\"It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.\"",
      "The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to \"capital-light partnerships\" in other green energy such as wind and solar.",
      "BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.",
      "Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.",
      "But in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.",
      "In the five years since former chief executive Bernard Looney first unveiled his strategy, shareholders have received total returns including dividends of 36%.",
      "In contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively.",
      "BP's under performance has prompted speculation that it may be a takeover target or may consider moving its main stock market listing to the US where oil and gas companies command higher valuations.",

      "It was more than 20 years ago that the then boss of BP reframed those famous initials as \"Beyond Petroleum\".",

      "Why?",
      "Profit and share price. There is simply less money in renewables than in oil and gas and some BP shareholders have become angry and impatient as they watch Shell produce double the returns they have seen while Exxon investors have received four times as much.",
      "For most - but not all - shareholders, the number one job of a company's board and management is to maximise the value of the company.",

    "story": [
      "Shares in electric car maker Tesla have slumped more than 9% after EU and UK sales fell by almost half in January.",
      "The drop in Tesla shares took the company's valuation back below $1trn for the first time since November 2024.",
      "Tesla has been facing stiff competition in the European market from Chinese and other manufacturers.",
      "In addition, Tesla owner Elon Musk has been making controversial political waves on both sides of the Atlantic, an analyst said.",
      "Tesla sales in January bucked European electric car sale trends, which grew by more than a third in the month, according to trade body Acea.",
      "Instead, Tesla sales across the EU, EFTA and the UK fell more than 45%, and more than 50% in the EU alone.",
      "It comes after Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade as demand faltered and rivals gained pace.",
      "The main factor in the January sales slump was likely to be increasing competition, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.",
      "Chinese manufacturer BYD has been making big strides, in part because it includes as standard some features which cost extra from other makers, Mould said.",
      "However, some car buyers may also be taking a \"principled stand\" on Musk's political interventions, he said.",
      "Musk has made waves in the US with his involvement in slashing US development funds and efforts to drastically reduce US federal funding.",
      "In the UK he supports jailed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, and repeatedly criticised Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.",
      "Musk also supports the far-right AfD party in Germany, and congratulated its leader after the party's record second-place result in elections.",
      "Too toxic?",
      "Asked if the reason for Tesla's share price slump was down to Musk being too toxic, a former senior director of the car maker's Europe, Middle East and Asia division said it was \"definitely one of the reasons for the decline\", but added there was a \"cumulative number of things that are piling up a domino effect\".",
      "\"There's no doubt his flirting with the right in politics, running around on TV with a chainsaw is not exactly helping his image,\" Peter Bardenfleth-Hansen told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"He may be getting a bigger fanbase within a specific type of clientele, but they're not the ones that are buying the Teslas. They're not the ones putting money in to his company. So he has a problem.\"",
      "Tesla shares got a big boost after the US election due to Musk's closeness to Donald Trump - Musk has described himself as \"first buddy\" to the US president.",
      "Investors thought this would stand his businesses in good stead.",
      "However, Trump is not a supporter of electric vehicles, and has said he will cancel efforts to boost their ownership.",
      "\"How anybody thought this was going to be good for Tesla, I don't know,\" Mould said.",
      "There is also general market skittishness about the path of interest rate cuts and concerns about Trump tariff plans that could be contributing to the fall, he added."

    "story": [
      "Energy costs are one of a number of bill rises which will come into force at the start of what some commentators have described as \"awful April\".",
      "The exact amount you pay will depend on your individual circumstances, and where you live.",
      "Although minimum wages will increase from April, and wages on average have been outpacing inflation, household finances could still come under extra pressure.",
      "Here are seven ways in which you could be affected.",
      "1. Water bills",
      "Water bills for households are due to go up in England and Wales by \u00a310 more per month on average, but there's a lot of variation depending on the company.",
      "For example, the annual Southern Water bill will jump 47% to \u00a3703, while Anglian Water customers will pay 19% more, or \u00a3626.",
      "Factors including whether households have a meter and how much water used will also impact bills, which are being front-loaded for the next five years, meaning the big increase is coming in April.",
      "Water companies in England and Wales have said the increases are needed to invest in creaking infrastructure, including sewage, and to build more reservoirs.",
      "In Scotland, water bills are set to rise by almost 10%. Scottish Water, which is a public body, said spending was needed to cope with periods of \"drought and intense rainfall\" brought on by climate change.",

      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "2. Energy bills",
      "The annual energy bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will go up \u00a3111 a year to \u00a31,849 from April.",
      "Regulator Ofgem increased the energy price cap because of higher wholesale costs and inflation.",
      "The cap is set every three months and limits the amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity, but not the total bill, so if you use more, you will pay more.",
      "It affects 22 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "Standing charges - fixed fees to connect to a gas and electricity supply and vary by region - are rising again for gas but dropping for electricity, but it depends on where you live.",

      "3. Council tax",
      "It is likely the tax you pay to your local authority will go up from April.",

      "Smaller councils without social care duties can increase bills by up to 2.99%.",
      "For 2025-26, the government is allowing Bradford, Newham, Birmingham, Somerset, and Windsor and Maidenhead to bypass the 4.99% cap, meaning they could raise council tax by more.",

      "The Scottish government says it is offering local authorities an extra \u00a31bn in 2025-26 to help reduce the scale of any rise.",
      "In Wales, council tax rates could jump by as much 15% in some areas. Local authorities were given \u00a3253m by the Welsh government in its draft budget, but council leaders say more money needed.",

      "4. Car tax",
      "From April, the standard rate of tax for cars registered after April 2017 rises \u00a35 to \u00a3195 a year. According to the RAC, you may pay less or more if your car was first used before 2017.",
      "The exact amount for your road tax will depend on the year your car was registered and the type of fuel it uses.",
      "One big change is that electric vehicles (EVs) will no longer be tax exempt. EVs registered from April 2025 will pay the lowest rate of \u00a310 in the first year, then move to the standard rate. The standard rate will also apply to EVs first registered after April 2017.",
      "5. Broadband, phone and TV licence",
      "Rule changes introduced by the telecoms regulator this year mean that mobile and broadband providers must now tell customers \"in pounds and pence\" about any price rises, as well as when they occur.",
      "The new rules typically only apply to new customers, so any price rise will depend on when you took your contract out.",
      "For instance, under the new rules, someone with a mobile Sim only contract with EE will see their bill go up by \u00a31.50 a month, or \u00a318 a year.",
      "But for the majority of customers who took their contract out before 10 April 2024, they will face an increase of 6.4%, based on the inflation rate last December, plus an additional charge.",
      "Similarly, most Virgin Media broadband customers will face a 7.5% rise in bills, but for anyone who took out a contract after 9 January this year, their monthly bill will go up by \u00a33.50.",
      "The cost of a TV licence will also go up by \u00a35 to \u00a3174.50, and for a black and white TV it will go up by \u00a31.50 to \u00a358.50.",
      "6. Stamp duty",

      "First-time buyers currently pay no stamp duty on homes up to \u00a3425,000, but this will drop to \u00a3300,000.",

      "The government has kept in place the freeze on tax thresholds on income tax and National Insurance until 2028, a policy brought in by the previous government.",
      "This is often dubbed a stealth tax - as governments don't explicitly label it as a tax.",
      "But the policy amounts to a tax rise because of a process called \"fiscal drag\", which sees more people \"dragged\" into paying higher rates of tax as wages rises.",
      "According to figures from the government's financial watchdog by 2028-29, nearly four million additional people will be expected to pay income tax - and three million more will have moved to the higher rate - due to the threshold being frozen.",

    "summary": "The tech giant's decision has prompted questions and concerns about reduced protections for UK iCloud users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has made headlines by pulling its most advanced data security tool for UK customers.",
      "It is removing Advanced Data Protection (ADP) after the Home Office asked for the right to be able to access data which it is applied to - something even Apple itself cannot currently do.",
      "Rather than comply with that request, on Friday the tech giant said it would halt new UK sign-ups to the tool and remove existing user access at a later date.",
      "The move has prompted criticism of the UK government's actions - but also confusion about what protections remain for UK Apple customers.",
      "What is Apple's Advanced Data Protection?",
      "ADP is an opt-in data security tool designed to provide users of devices such as iPhones with a more secure way to protect data stored in their iCloud accounts.",
      "Items including back-ups, photos, notes and voice memos are given standard encryption by default.",
      "The company can be ordered to hand over this data by law enforcement.",
      "ADP, meanwhile, applies an extra level of protection through what's known as end to end encryption, which means Apple cannot see or access the data - only the user can.",
      "Because Apple does not have a key, losing access to your account can mean losing your data altogether.",
      "It also means law enforcement agencies have no way of accessing such data either.",
      "The tool is independent of the protections for blue messages sent with iMessage, passwords stored in iCloud keychain, Health app data and Facetime, which are end to end encrypted by default.",
      "What does this mean for my iCloud data?",
      "If you are in the UK and have not turned on ADP, you will not see a change to the way your data is protected as a result of Apple disabling it.",
      "Your iCloud data will remain protected by standard encryption and, as before, can still be accessed by Apple.",
      "But it does mean you now cannot apply to protect iCloud storage with end to end encryption, even if you want to.",
      "Meanwhile, people in the UK who had ADP enabled prior to Friday's change will lose access to it a later date.",
      "Apple has not said when, nor how many UK users will be affected.",
      "Some experts have raised alarm over its removal, saying it will leave users less protected and also have wider, global consequences.",
      "Graeme Stewart of cybersecurity firm Check Point said it would not mean \"a complete free-for-all\" as law enforcement must have a warrant to request iCloud data.",
      "But he said other governments may look to replicate the UK's demand of Apple for a so-called \"backdoor\" to encrypted cloud data.",
      "Cybersecurity experts have likened the idea of creating a backdoor to someone leaving their house keys under their doormat - essentially creating a vulnerability which anyone, including bad actors, can exploit.",
      "Digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation said that if Apple had complied with the request, it would have created a backdoor not just for UK users \"but for people around the world, regardless of where they were or what citizenship they had\".",
      "Apple told the BBC in a statement that it had \"never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products, and we never will\".",
      "What protections do Google and Android offer?",
      "Like Apple, Google says it uses standard encryption across a range of its services to protect data as it moves between users' devices, its services and data centres.",
      "The search giant, which owns Android, has provided further protections for Android phone system back-ups since 2018.",
      "It uses a mechanism that generates a random security key on a device, which is encrypted by a user's lock-screen passcode, pattern or pin.",
      "Google says it cannot see this security key and that the passcode-protected information is sent securely to high security chips in its data centres.",
      "But the same protections do not extend to Google Photos or content stored in Google Drive - which are not end to end encrypted.",
      "It also has an Advanced Protection Program for people who want further security for their account.",
      "This relies on using passkeys to verify the account holder.",
      "Some Samsung Galaxy smartphones also have \"enhanced data protection\" which encrypts back-ups of messages, call logs, apps and settings and more end to end.",

      "Apple had urged shareholders to vote against the measure, which the company had argued was  \"inappropriately\" trying \"to micromanage\" its business.",
      "The scrutiny of the firm comes as US President Donald Trump has called for an end to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the government and private sector, including at Apple.",
      "In a social media post the day after the meeting, Trump ramped up the pressure on the company.",
      "\"Apple should get rid of DEI rules, not just make adjustments to them,\" he wrote in a all-capital-letters post. \"DEI was a hoax that has been very bad for our country. DEI is gone!!!\"",
      "Trump's DEI orders have run into legal roadblocks, but many companies in the US, including big names such as Meta, Amazon and Goldman Sachs, have already ended or rolled back their own policies, citing legal risks.",

      "\"As the legal landscape around this issue evolves, we may need to make some changes to comply, but our north star of dignity and respect for everyone and our work to that end will never waver,\" Mr Cook said during a question-and-answer session at the company's annual shareholder meeting.",
      "He noted that Apple did not use \"quotas\" for hiring - a practice that has come in for some of the fiercest criticism - while saying the firm's strength came from a culture where \"people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives come together\".",
      "\"We'll continue to work together to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work,\" he added, saying the company would remain \"committed to the values that have always made us who we are\".",
      "The proposal targeting Apple's DEI policies was backed by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, which had also put forward the proposal at Costco.",
      "It argued that the existence of Apple's diversity and inclusion programmes exposed the firm to \"litigation, reputational and financial risks\", pointing to the wider corporate retreat and noting that recent lawsuits have made it easier for workers to sue over discrimination.",
      "Stefan Padfield of the organisation's Free Enterprise Project, who presented the proposal at Tuesday's meeting, said the risks to Apple had increased after the Trump administration recently ordered staff to investigate DEI in the private sector.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear,\" he said. \"DEI is out and merit is in.\"",
      "Apple's decision to push back against the shareholder proposal, while simultaneously opening the door to changing its policy is an effort to satisfy both sides of the fight, said Angela Jackson, a senior advisor to the Project on Workforce at Harvard University and author of the forthcoming book, The Win-Win Workplace.",
      "But she warned that it left Apple \"playing defence\". She said she wanted to see the company lead by making a more robust business case for the programmes.",
      "\"They've made the right moves. The one step they could go further... is to really say, 'Yes it's our values, we believe it's the right thing to do, but it's also an economic imperative.\"",
      "The fight over DEI in the US has raised questions about whether such policies in other countries will face similar challenges.",
      "Catherine Howarth, chief executive of the responsible investment charity ShareAction, said she thought that Apple - a global, consumer-facing firm - had made the bet that the benefits of pushing back against the shareholder proposal outweighed the risks.",
      "\"It's not popular with consumers and it's not popular with employees to abandon what were supposedly your principles in this area until very recently,\" she said.",
      "\"They think it would go down very badly - and it would - with their global consumer base.\"",

      "Nuclear scientists believe they have found a way to transform the supply of vital material used for scanning cancer patients.",
      "Doctors use so-called radioisotopes to pinpoint the growth of cancer in patients. But the radioactive material is all produced by ageing reactors outside the UK, and sometimes the supply is interrupted.",
      "Dr Tom Wallace-Smith, technical director of Bristol's Astral Systems, said they developed a technique that produces the material here in the UK.",
      "He said this has the potential to \"eliminate the delays that have plagued\" cancer treatments.",
      "The team in Bristol have come up with a whole new approach, using nuclear fusion rather than fission.",
      "And rather than requiring a new nuclear plant, which would cost about \u00a3400m to build, they can develop the material in small plants \"right by hospitals\" for about \u00a31m, Dr Wallace-Smith said.",
      "Every year, radiologists scan about 300,000 patients using these radioactive radioisotopes, with consultants saying they would not be able to do their work without them.",
      "In October, the world of nuclear medicine was hit by a major crisis. Outside the niche speciality, few noticed because doctors and health managers implemented a rapidly assembled rationing system for vital scans.",
      "Britain gets all of its supply from three reactors in Europe. In October two of them shut down for planned maintenance at the same time, and then the third sprung a fault.",
      "\"Something like 75% of our supply was lost,\" said Dr Stephen Harden, from the Royal College of Radiologists.",
      "All patients needing urgent diagnostic scans were seen on time, but thousands of more routine check-ups were delayed.",
      "The interruption only lasted three weeks, but it highlighted what Dr Harden called the \"ageing and fragile\" supply chain.",
      "He explained: \"It makes a really strong case for making these radioisotopes in the UK.\"",
      "In 2017 a UK Government report said six nuclear reactors made 85% of the radioisotopes used worldwide. By 2030, five of them will be retired.",
      "Many of these reactors were built in the 1960s and 1970s.  Building a new one is expensive and takes years.",
      "In North Wales, there are plans to build such a reactor, which will cost \u00a3400m.",
      "Like all nuclear fission plants, they are controversial. Their raw material is uranium, and the radioisotopes they produce are, by design, radioactive.",
      "Astral Systems has developed technology that can now make the same radioisotopes used in hospitals, on demand.",
      "Small reactors could be built for under \u00a31m, less than the price of the scanner that uses the radioactive product.",
      "Now, the team is building a new kind of fusion reactor, which will be able to produce any kind of radioisotope for research or medicine, right by the hospitals that need it.",
      "At the Bristol Royal Infirmary, I watched as a patient lay on the scanner bed, ready for his session. He was fully clothed, but the vital preparation was internal.",
      "\"Three hours before the scan, we inject patients with a tiny amount of radioactivity,\" explained consultant radiologist, Dr Randeep Kulshrestha.",
      "The radioisotope is tagged to substances that will go to whatever area doctors are interested in, for example the bones.",
      "The camera will then pick up the radioactivity in such a way that doctors can see how, for example, a cancer has spread.",
      "Dr Kulshrestha showed me pictures taken from an anonymous patient, where doctors suspected cancer had spread from his prostate to his bones.",
      "Sadly for the person involved, the images are stark. Areas on the bones are lit up orange, where the cancer has grown on their bones.",
      "\"These radioisotopes form a vital part of the diagnostic process\", Dr Kulshrestha told me.",

      "Ofgem is increasing the energy price cap by 6.4%, meaning a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will see their bill rise by \u00a3111 a year, or \u00a39.25 a month, to \u00a31,849.",
      "The cap, which is set every three months and limits the amount suppliers can charge for each unit of energy, affects 22 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland.",

      "The seven bills due to go up in April",
      "The rise in April will hit people's finances at the same time as water and council tax increases, although average wages are also going up.",
      "The regulator said rising wholesale costs and inflation were behind the latest energy price hike - the third consecutive increase in the quarterly cap and more than the 5% analysts had forecast.",
      "While the cost of each unit of gas and electricity is capped, the total bill is not, so bills will vary depending on how much energy is used.",
      "Ofgem illustrates the cap by showing the impact on the annual bill of a household with typical energy usage.",
      "Standing charges - fixed fees to connect to a gas and electricity supply and vary by region - are rising again for gas but dropping for electricity. Some customers in London and the North Wales and Mersey region will see an overall increase of up to \u00a320 a year.",

      "Some of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",
      "In 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, as well as half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.",

      "What is far less well known is that you can drink the sap itself, which is called maple water. Clear in colour, it contains just 2% natural sugars, so it is only slightly sweet.",
      "A small but growing number of producers in Canada are now selling this maple water in bottles or cartons, after first giving it a filter and pasteurisation to kill off any microbes.",
      "\"People feel like they're drinking the wild Canadian forest,\" says Yannick Leclerc of Maple3, a producer of maple water drinks, based in Quebec City.",
      "Advocates point to the fact it is a natural drink, and makers hope that it can steal some sales from the existing similar product \u2013 coconut water. The latter is made from water that naturally forms inside coconuts.",
      "As Canada is far and away the world's largest producer of maple syrup \u2013 accounting for more than 80% of production \u2013 it is understandable that the nascent maple water sector is also Canadian. Furthermore, it is centred on the province of Quebec, which makes 90% of Canada's maple syrup.",
      "Mr Leclerc says that Maple3 is one of the pioneers of the sector. \"Nobody [previously] thought about keeping the sap for its hydration purposes verses just boiling it into syrup.\"",
      "He joined the company back in 2016, three years after it was founded by his business partner St\u00e9phane Nolet. In recent years an increasing number of other producers have entered the marketplace.",
      "Mr Leclerc claims that Maple3 has doubled its annual profits since 2021, with sales not just rising across Canada, but in 12 other countries, including France, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Some 75% of its sales now come from overseas, and it sells both still and sparkling maple water, and fizzy versions with added natural fruit flavourings.",
      "\"It's more than just a local product at this point,\" adds Mr Leclerc.",
      "For the maple water industry as a whole, one recent report predicts big growth. It estimated that global sales in 2024 totalled $506m (\u00a3409m), with that expected to jump to $2.6bn by 2033.",
      "By comparison, worldwide sales of coconut water reached $7.7bn in 2023, with that expected to grow to $22.9bn by 2029. So maple water has a long way to catch up.",
      "Meanwhile, the global value of the maple syrup market was $1.7bn last year, according to one study.",
      "Beth Czerwony, a dietician with the non-profit medical centre Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, says the growing popularity of maple water is linked to its perceived health benefits.",
      "\"When the sap itself is filtered through the tree, it ends up absorbing a bunch of antioxidants,\" she says. \"So they're gonna end up having a better performance and a faster workout recovery.\"",
      "However, one medical study from 2019 concluded that maple water was \"was not superior in rehydration\" to normal water.",
      "Jeremy Kinsella owns The Soda Pop Bros in Windsor Ontario, which sells soft drinks under its own brand name, as well as imports from around the world.",
      "His family have been in the industry for nearly a century, and in his lifetime he has seen a fair share of trends come and go.",
      "He says that if maple water is to go mainstream it needs the financial backing and promotion of one of the huge global soft drinks firms.",
      "\"It will take a larger soda manufacturer for it to really catch on,\" he says.",
      "Mr Kinsella also says that the price of maple water is currently too high. \"When it comes down to it, someone's looking at a can of Coke for a buck and they're looking at a can of maple water for three bucks, they're going to try it a couple of times and go back to Coke,\" he says.",
      "Marketing maple water more would certainly help it increase sales, says John Tomory, who helps run Pefferlaw Creek Farms in Uxbridge, Ontario. He and his brothers have been making maple syrup commercially for almost 10 years, and for the past four they have also been selling the sap to a Canada brand called Sap Sucker. This makes sparkling sap water with different added flavours, from lime to grapefruit, and lemon to orange.",
      "Mr Tomory says he agrees with this approach to make the sap more interesting. \"I know a lot of people have tried just selling the sap as it is, just basic sap from the tree and it's still, but they haven't really caught on,\" he says.",
      "\"So I think carbonating it and adding fruit flavour makes it more interesting. That's the real innovation.\"",
      "Back at Maple3 in Quebec, Mr Leclerc also thinks that the sparkling version of the drink could be the more popular: \"It has perks that a normal sparkling water doesn't have,\" he says, such as a more interesting flavour, without having all the bad stuff that [regular] soda has.\""

    "story": [
      "A 14-year-old boy has lost a court case he brought against his own parents after they moved him from London to Ghana to go to boarding school.",
      "The boy, described in court as shy, articulate, a keen cook and footballer, said his parents had tricked him into going to Africa, saying it was to visit a sick relative.",
      "He said had he known he was being sent to boarding school \"there would have been no way I would have agreed to it\".",
      "But the High Court in London also heard his parents were worried he was being \"groomed\" into criminal activity.",
      "In a written statement to the court, he said: \"I feel like I am living in hell. I really do not think I deserve this and I want to come home, back to England, as soon as possible.\"",
      "In his judgment, High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden said he recognised that \"this is, in many ways, both a sobering and rather depressing conclusion.\"",
      "He said that he was satisfied that the parents' wish for their son to move to Ghana was \"driven by their deep, obvious and unconditional love\".",
      "The boy was at risk of suffering greater harm returning to the UK, he said.",
      "He said that the boy's parents believe \"and in my judgement with reason\" that their son has \"at very least peripheral involvement with gang culture and has exhibited an unhealthy interest in knives\".",
      "The boy's father told the judge the couple did not want their son to be \"yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London.\"",
      "The boy, who had lived in the UK since birth, said he was \"mocked\" and \"never settled in\" at the school in Ghana.",
      "He said he \"could also barely understand what was going on and I would get into fights\".",
      "The boy wrote that he was \"so scared and desperate\" that he emailed the British High Commission in Accra as well as contacting the charity Children and Family Across Borders, who it is believed put him in touch with lawyers at the International Family Law Group.",
      "\"I am from London, England, and I want to go back home,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he had been \"mistreated\" at the school, adding: \"I'm begging to go back to my old school.\"",
      "However the High Court heard that the boy's parents had sent him because they feared for his safety in London.",
      "In a statement, his mother said sending him to Africa was \"not a punishment but a measure to protect him\".",
      "She referred to the murder of Kelyan Bokassa, the 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in Woolwich in January. That was \"every parent's worst nightmare\", she said.",
      "She said she did not believe her son would survive in the UK and did not want to be part of her son's \"destruction\".",
      "Rebecca Foulkes, representing the boy's father, said the boy met 11 of the points on a checklist produced by the children's charity NSPCC to indicate whether a child might have joined a gang or was being criminally exploited.",
      "That included being absent from school, having unexplained money, buying new things, and carrying weapons.",
      "She said it was not only the parents who were worried.",
      "His school claimed it had \"suspicions about him engaging in criminal activities\" and had observed him in expensive clothes and with mobile phones.",
      "The boy said he had never been part of a gang, nor \"involved in gangs in any way\". He said he \"does not know anyone involved in a gang\" and he does not carry a knife.",
      "He acknowledged in his statements that \"my behaviour wasn't the best\" and said he thought that was the reason his parents sent him to Africa.",
      "The case centred on the question of parental responsibility, and whether the parents acted unlawfully by sending their son to boarding school without his consent.",
      "In a statement issued after the judgement, his parents said: \"This has been a really difficult time for us all.\"",
      "They added: \"Our priority has always been protecting our son and our focus now is on moving forward as a family.\"",
      "James Netto from the International Family Law Group, who represented the boy, said the court judgment had been a \"real shock\" to the teenager.",
      "\"He was obviously incredibly disappointed, incredibly upset and is considering his next steps carefully.\"",
      "'I want to have an education'",
      "The boy's barrister, Deirdre Fottrell KC, pointed out the school was not simply far from home - but a completely different jurisdiction.",
      "The boy wrote that his education was suffering. He felt the Ghanaian classes were not as challenging as those in his English school, and he had been out of formal education entirely since last summer, studying online.",
      "He wrote: \"I want to have an education again and grow up like a normal person. I feel like my brain is hurt here. I feel like now I am dumber than people I used to be smarter than.\"",
      "The boy's father has recently visited him in Africa, and he told the court that he and his son had got on well.",
      "He said he would like his son to remain in Ghana, and said they visited a different boarding school where the boy could be considered for a place.",
      "The father said they were both very impressed.",
      "However, questioned by Ms Fottrell, he acknowledged there was no place in that school until September, and that his son had not said he wanted to go there.",

      "\"Teenagers are often placed in exceptionally challenging or vulnerable situations, and are now beginning to turn to the court for protection,\" Mr Netto said.",

      "Scottish education performance falling, says study",
      "Where does Scotland stand with the attainment gap?",
      "The attainment gap between the proportion of school leavers from the most and least deprived areas who had one pass or more in National 5s or equivalent qualifications was 22.7% last year \u2013 up from 20.2% in 2022/23.",
      "The gap in the proportion of school leavers who achieved one pass or more in Highers or equivalent qualifications was 38.4% in 2023/24, up from 36.9% the previous year.",
      "Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth told BBC Scotland News the statistics showed \"positive signs for the future\" despite the attainment gap increase.",
      "The figures also show that 8,084 pupils left school after S4. That accounted for about one in seven of those leaving school, and was the highest number since 2010.",
      "The proportion of pupils who left school last year with one or more pass at National 5s, or equivalent and one or more pass at Higher level or equivalent has also dropped.",
      "Last year 83.5% of school leavers had one pass or more at National 5 level, while 57.4% had one pass or more at Higher level. Both were lower than in 2022/23.",
      "'A deeper problem'",
      "Prof Lindsay Paterson, from Edinburgh University, said the closure of schools during the Covid pandemic was one reason for the attainment gap getting worse in Scotland.",
      "\"Unlike in England and other countries, there has never been a proper programme of educational recovery here,\" he told BBC Scotland News.",
      "\"The harm is greatest to those children who have not been able to get help at home, or whose parents can't afford to pay for extra tutoring.",
      "\"But behind this is a deeper problem. The Scottish government has never had a coherent strategy for dealing with the educational effects of poverty.\"",
      "He added that there was nothing intrinsically wrong with pupils leaving after S4 as long as they have something worthwhile to go to.",
      "Just under 56,000 young people left school last year \u2013 the highest number since 2010.",
      "More than 95% went on to positive destinations such as university, college, employment, some training and voluntary work. This was slightly lower than the previous year but one of the highest levels since 2010.",
      "More than 67% of school leavers last year were in higher or further education three months later.",
      "Gilruth told BBC Scotland News progress on closing the attainment gap was being made, but that the increase was \"disappointing\".",
      "She said: \"It is important to distinguish today's statistics on S4 leavers from overall progress made to close the attainment gap in Scotland.",
      "\"There are clearly positive signs for the future as we are seeing a record low poverty-related attainment gap in primary school literacy and in S3 literacy and numeracy.",
      "\"While it is disappointing that the attainment gap has widened slightly at SCQF Levels 4, 5 and 6, it's important to note that we have reduced the gap between the most and least deprived young people entering positive destinations by two thirds since 2009-10, the second lowest gap on record.\"",
      "Gilruth added that the number of school leavers at S4 had remained stable, and that the government was exploring reasons why teenagers chose to leave school at that time.",
      "Scottish Conservative education spokesman Miles Briggs said: \"After years of insisting that education is their priority, the SNP have been missing in action while ministers have let down pupils and teachers at every turn.",
      "\"Under John Swinney's government, it's our most deprived students who now face the narrowest options and the worst prospects.\""

    "story": [
      "The government has announced the first 750 schools to provide free daily breakfast clubs as part of a pilot scheme ahead of a planned England-wide rollout.",
      "Starting in April, 180,000 pupils in England will be offered \"healthy, varied and nutritious breakfasts\" in schools before class, Labour said - with over a third of schools in the pilot scheme in deprived areas.",
      "But some MPs and head teachers' unions have raised concerns the funding is too low.",
      "Labour campaigned on a promise of free breakfast clubs in every English primary school and later tripled funding to \u00a330m.",
      "Cautious welcome for free school breakfast clubs",
      "Free school meals 'would tackle child poverty'",
      "Parents will be able to drop off children 30 minutes before their usual school time, knowing they will be offered a free breakfast, the government says.",
      "Shadow Education Minister Neil O'Brien told the House of Commons there were \"a number of questions\" about the plans, including \"the difference in the planned spend and the much larger benefits ministers are claiming\".",
      "Analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the funding proposed for the breakfast clubs could be enough to fund all primary school pupils under a food-only model, or 60% of pupils if it had some childcare element.",
      "O'Brien questioned how the education secretary was planning to close that funding gap.",
      "But Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told the House of Commons she was \"confident\" the funding would be adequate.",
      "One in seven schools involved in the pilot had no before-school provision already in place, Phillipson said, and the rest either have paid-for provision or have their numbers capped.",
      "\"These breakfast clubs that we are introducing will be free to every child and every parent who seeks to take them up,\" she said.",
      "Phillipson did not confirm when the national rollout of the scheme would take place, but said it would be \"as soon as possible\".",
      "'Really worried'",
      "The Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Pepe Di'Iasio  said head teachers were \"really worried\"  the basic daily rate of just 60p per pupil was far too low.",
      "\"We strongly urge the government to be more realistic about the costs involved, before it attempts to roll out this policy nationally,\" he said.",
      "The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) has welcomed the news but also voiced concern that funding could fall short.",
      "\"It will be crucial that these concerns are addressed before the programme is rolled out across the country, to ensure that it does not place further pressure on already strained school budgets,\" said NAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman.",
      "Announcing the first 750 schools to join the pilot scheme, the Department for Education said breakfast clubs had \"an important role to play in the government's commitment to remove the stain of child poverty\".",
      "Devon tops the list with 25 schools in the programme, followed by England's largest local authority, Birmingham, with 24.",
      "Both Wales and Scotland have programmes to provide free breakfasts to children in primary schools.",
      "Guidance sent to schools taking part in the pilot scheme says they will receive a set-up payment to cover equipment and material.",
      "Under the scheme, schools will then be reimbursed by the government based on attendance at the clubs - a school with 50% participation in the pilot scheme could get \u00a323,000 a year, the government said.",

    "summary": "The pair, who murdered their wealthy parents in 1989, are pursuing three possible routes that could see them leave prison.",
    "story": [
      "After 35 years behind bars, Lyle and Erik Menendez are closer than ever to a potential second chance at freedom.",
      "The brothers, who were convicted of killing their parents, Jos\u00e9 and Kitty Menendez, in 1989, have long maintained that the murders in their Beverly Hills mansion were driven by years of sexual and physical abuse, rather than hopes of inheriting their fortune.",
      "They are currently serving life in prison without the possibility of parole in California.",
      "A mix of new evidence and public interest has thrown the case, one that has both gripped and divided the nation for decades, upside down.",
      "It's all reached a pivotal moment.",
      "A resentencing hearing is set in March, which could lead to their sentences being reduced - or even their freedom. Separately, California Gov Gavin Newsom has ordered the state's parole board to conduct a risk assessment, a key step toward possible clemency, which could take form in a reduced sentence or a pardon.",
      "The movement in the historic criminal case is significant, but not everyone is happy at the prospect of them potentially walking free.",
      "Three paths to freedom?",
      "There are three possible routes the brothers have been trekking in hopes of gaining their freedom.",
      "1. Clemency from the Governor of California",
      "Clemency could mean a reduced sentence or even a pardon, but it would not overturn the brother's convictions.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered the parole board to conduct a risk assessment to determine if the brothers pose a danger to society. Depending on the results, the governor could grant clemency, commuting their sentences to make them eligible for parole or even releasing them outright.",
      "The probe will examine the factors behind their crimes and their rehabilitation while in prison. It marks the first step in a broader process that could lead to clemency.",
      "2. A new trial",
      "The brothers' defence attorneys have also asked for a new trial.",
      "They pointed to new evidence about the alleged sexual abuse by their father and argued jurors should be able to consider a lesser sentence, such as manslaughter.",
      "But newly elected Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said his office will oppose the request.",
      "3. Resentencing",
      "The last avenue is likely the most significant. The brothers are being vetted for resentencing, a legal process that could reduce their life sentences and grant them eligibility for parole.",
      "A hearing is scheduled for 20 March and 21 March to discuss this possibility.",
      "This effort centres on whether the brothers have rehabilitated after 35 years in prison and whether recent changes in California law apply to their case.",
      "In October 2024, then-LA County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n recommended resentencing for the brothers, citing California's evolving approach to juvenile offenders and abuse survivors.",
      "Shortly after the announcement, he lost a re-election campaign. The decision now rests with current DA Nathan Hochman, who was elected in November, and is examining the case before making a decision on whether to back the effort in court.",
      "One key argument for resentencing stems from a change in California law that allows offenders who were under the age of 26 at the time of their crime to be sentenced as minors rather than adults.",
      "Since Lyle was 21 and Erik was 18 when they killed their parents, their defence attorneys argue that this law should apply to them. If they had been sentenced under today's legal framework, they might have received lighter sentences or had the possibility of parole from the beginning, their attorneys argue.",
      "Why is this happening - 35 years after the killings?",
      "Neama Rahmani, a criminal defence attorney and former federal prosecutor, told the BBC that a \"perfect storm of PR and politics\" has led to the Menendez brothers having a real shot at freedom.",
      "He noted the recent attention the case has gotten from celebrities, a Netflix drama and docuseries on the case, and an \"embattled\" district attorney who was vying to remain in office.",
      "\"You're never going to see another case like this. It's a unicorn.\"",

      "Gasc\u00f3n, who was the top prosecutor in LA at the time, announced just 12 days before a tough re-election in November 2024 that he would back the resentencing request. He has denied the announcement was political and argued it was a long-time coming.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n lost his re-election bid and was replaced by voters with the more moderate Hochman, whose view of the case remains unclear.",

      "They told the court they feared their parents would kill them if they didn\u2019t act first. Lyle and Erik testified they confronted their parents about the sexual abuse and things had become combative in their household and they believed their parents were planning to kill them.",
      "Family members testified about the abuse they witnessed - but none said they saw sexual abuse first-hand.",
      "Their life in prison",
      "Both brothers married while serving life sentences without the possibility of parole.",

      "Two years later, in 2003, he married Rebecca Sneed, a magazine editor. Sneed has remained out of the public eye but has maintained her commitment despite the challenges of prison life.",
      "Erik Menendez also found love behind bars. In 1999, he married Tammi Saccoman after a pen-pal romance developed into a deeper connection.",
      "In 2005, she published a memoir, They Said We'd Never Make It, chronicling their unconventional marriage and the difficulties of loving someone serving a life sentence. She has described their relationship as \"fulfilling and deeply emotional,\" despite never being able to share a traditional life together.",
      "Court records also detail more about their lives behind bars.",
      "A motion filed in support of their resentencing bid details they both received educational degrees. It also details various programmes they launched behind bars that aimed to help other inmates, including those who were victims of childhood trauma and disabled or elderly inmates.",

    "summary": "The Oscar-nominated star is reportedly \"in final talks\" to sign up to play the Hogwarts headmaster.",
    "story": [
      "US actor John Lithgow has said he is \"excited\" to be playing Dumbledore in the forthcoming Harry Potter TV series, adding that the role is \"going to define me for the last chapter of my life\".",
      "The makers of the new show are currently assembling their cast, and while no official announcements have been made yet, the veteran Oscar-nominated star appears to have confirmed he will play the Hogwarts headmaster.",
      "Lithgow is known for starring in sitcom 3rd Rock From the Sun, with other roles ranging from voicing Lord Farquaad in Shrek to playing Winston Churchill in The Crown.",
      "It now looks like he will follow in the footsteps of Richard Harris and Michael Gambon, who played Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter films.",
      "On Tuesday, Lithgow confirmed to ScreenRant that he had said yes to playing the character in the small screen adaptation.",
      "The 79-year-old said the suggestion \"came as a total surprise to me\".",
      "\"I just got the phone call up at the Sundance Film Festival... and it was not an easy decision because it's going to define me for the last chapter of my life, I'm afraid,\" he added. \"But I'm very excited.\"",
      "The Hollywood stalwart has the required combination of gravitas, warmth and levity to make a success of the Dumbledore role, although if the in-depth series does last for a decade, he'd be almost 90 by the time it ends.",
      "He continued: \"Some wonderful people are turning their attention back to Harry Potter. That's why it's been such a hard decision.",
      "\"I'll be about 87 years old at the wrap party, but I've said yes.\"",
      "'Faithful adaptation'",
      "The TV series will feature a brand new cast and is expected to start filming this summer.",
      "It will be \"a faithful adaptation of the iconic books\" by author JK Rowling, and is due to last for a decade, streaming service HBO Max has said.",
      "Lithgow is the first actor to appear to have officially confirmed his involvement, but an open casting call has been held to find the three young stars.",
      "\"We appreciate that such a high-profile series will draw a lot of rumour and speculation,\" HBO told Deadline earlier this month, in response to the reports about Lithgow.",
      "\"As we make our way through pre-production, we will only confirm details as we finalise deals.\"",
      "Who is John Lithgow?",
      "He's been one of the most popular and respected actors in America for several decades, with roles that span both drama and comedy.",
      "Lithgow earned two Oscar nominations in the 1980s (for The World According to Garp and Terms of Endearment) and won three Emmys for playing Dick Solomon in 3rd Rock from the Sun from 1996 to 2001.",
      "He won another Emmy and got a Bafta nomination for playing Churchill in Netflix's The Crown - proving he can master a British accent - with more memorable TV roles in Dexter and Perry Mason.",
      "He has recently been seen as an FBI boss in The Old Man, and as a scheming cardinal in Conclave, which is up for a string of Oscars this year."

    "summary": "When was the last time two musicals were up for best picture? And could Adrien Brody break a record?",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has had another eventful year: Deadpool faced off with Wolverine, Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni sued each other, Inside Out 2 conquered the box office and Joker's sequel emphatically did not.",
      "The Oscars race, meanwhile, played out against the grim backdrop of wildfires which devastated Los Angeles and left thousands of homes destroyed.",
      "Awards season had its fair share of scandal. While The Brutalist's use of AI and Anora's lack of an intimacy co-ordinator were storms in a Twitter teacup, there was one genuine controversy when some historic tweets nearly brought down Emilia P\u00e9rez.",
      "Ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), here are 17 of the quirks, trends, patterns, and record breakers from this year's batch of nominees.",
      "- - - - -",
      "1. This is the first time two musicals have been nominated for best picture in more than five decades.",
      "Wicked and Emilia P\u00e9rez are the first tuneful twosome to be up for the top prize since Funny Girl and Oliver! in 1969.",
      "The musical resurgence is partly down to it being twice as easy to score a best picture nomination nowadays, after the top category was expanded to 10 slots.",
      "The last musical to win best picture was Chicago in 2003.",
      "2. Adrien Brody already holds one Oscars record, and he could break another.",
      "The US star is currently the youngest ever winner of best actor - he was 29 when he won for his performance in 2002's The Pianist.",
      "But Brody wasn't nominated again until this year, with his nod for The Brutalist. If he wins again, he will become the first person to win the leading actor category with his first two nominations.",
      "Only seven other actors currently have a 100% win rate at the Oscars from two or more nominations - Vivien Leigh, Hilary Swank, Kevin Spacey, Luise Rainer, Christoph Waltz, Helen Hayes and Mahershala Ali.",
      "3. But Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is a major threat.",
      "The Dune and Wonka star is Brody's toughest competition in best actor, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.",
      "If he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner. There isn't much in it - Chalamet would be just 10 months younger than Brody was when he won.",
      "4. Netflix's Emilia P\u00e9rez could follow a dubious pattern for streaming films.",
      "It might have the most nominations, but the Spanish-language musical could share the same fate as other recent streaming films which were heavily nominated, but failed to follow through with many wins.",
      "The Irishman (Netflix) won zero Oscars, from 10 nominationsMank (Netflix) won two out of 10The Power of the Dog (Netflix) won one out of 12Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple) won zero out of 10",
      "The Irishman (Netflix) won zero Oscars, from 10 nominations",
      "Mank (Netflix) won two out of 10",
      "The Power of the Dog (Netflix) won one out of 12",
      "Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple) won zero out of 10",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez is strong in a couple of categories, but it's similarly unlikely to sweep the board.",
      "Only one streaming film has ever won best picture - Apple's Coda - which only had three nominations overall.",
      "5. Two Succession stars share a disadvantage.",
      "Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Strong are both nominated for best supporting actor, for their performances in A Real Pain and The Apprentice respectively.",
      "But the pair are the only two nominees in the category who don't come from best picture-nominated films.",
      "A Real Pain's absence in best picture shouldn't stop frontrunner Culkin from winning. The last person to win the category without a best picture nomination was Christopher Plummer in 2012, for Beginners.",
      "Every actor in the category this year is Oscar-nominated for the first time, except Edward Norton, who has three previous nods.",
      "6. The Substance is the first body horror to be nominated for best picture, and only the seventh horror overall.",
      "The other six were The Exorcist, Get Out, The Silence of the Lambs, Jaws, The Sixth Sense and Black Swan.",
      "The Substance is a strong contender in best make-up and hairstyling, a category where the winner often overlaps with the acting winners. That could work in Demi Moore's favour in a tight best actress race.",
      "7. Isabella Rossellini is nominated for an eight-minute performance in Conclave, but that isn't the shortest in Oscars history.",
      "Beatrice Straight won the same category, best supporting actress, for her role in Network, which lasted 5min 02sec.",
      "Dame Judi Dench is only marginally ahead, winning for a performance in Shakespeare in Love which lasted 5min 52sec.",
      "Winners aside, the shortest nominee is thought to be Hermione Baddeley's performance in 1959's Room at the Top, lasting 2min 19sec.",
      "On the subject of durations, The Brutalist (3hrs 35mins including an intermission) would be the fourth-longest best picture winner of all time, after Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur.",
      "8. Sing Sing star Colman Domingo is nominated for best actor, just a year after his last nomination in the same category for Rustin.",
      "Quite an achievement, no doubt. But he has some way to go to catch up with Bette Davis and Greer Garson, who both managed five consecutive Oscar nominations in the 1930s and 40s.",
      "Just behind them are Al Pacino, Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Thelma Ritter and Jennifer Jones, who each scored four back-to-back nods.",
      "Bradley Cooper, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Russell Crowe, Glenn Close, Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson, William Hurt, Richard Burton, Deborah Kerr, Gregory Peck, Ingrid Bergman, Gary Cooper and Spencer Tracy all managed three in a row.",
      "9. All five best actress nominees come from films which are also nominated for best picture.",
      "That might not sound like much, but it's the first time it's happened since 1977.",
      "The historic lack of overlap between the two categories has often been attributed to the Academy being less likely to give female-focused films the top prize.",
      "But that trend has shifted in recent years, with films featuring female leads such as Nomadland, Coda and Everything Everywhere All At Once scoring best picture.",
      "10. Before Sebastian Stan's nomination for The Apprentice, only seven other actors had been Oscar-nominated for playing a US president.",
      "Frank Langella was recognised for his portrayal of Richard Nixon, while Daniel Day-Lewis and Raymond Massey were both nominated for playing Abraham Lincoln.",
      "Sam Rockwell was nominated for playing George W Bush, Alexander Knox for Woodrow Wilson, and James Whitmore for Harry Truman.",
      "Perhaps most notably, Sir Anthony Hopkins has been nominated twice for portraying two different presidents in separate films - once as Nixon and another as John Quincy Adams.",
      "Stan is slightly different in that he portrays Trump in his younger years as a real estate tycoon, rather than during his tenure as president, but we're still chalking that up as worthy of induction into this exclusive club.",
      "11. Robbie Williams' biopic Better Man is nominated for best visual effects, but he also has a connection to two other films in the race.",
      "The British singer's track Swing Supreme features in a pivotal scene of Emilia P\u00e9rez, while his former Take That bandmates feature at the beginning of Anora as a remix of Greatest Day plays in a nightclub.",
      "Its prominence in the film led to the remaining members of Take That performing the song at this year's Bafta Film Awards.",
      "12. Ralph Fiennes could be a good omen for Conclave.",
      "The last two times the British star was nominated for acting, for Schindler's List and The English Patient, his film won best picture.",
      "If Conclave wins, Fiennes would set a record for having appeared in the most best picture winners, becoming the only actor with roles in four (the other being The Hurt Locker).",
      "However, Edward Berger's absence in the best director category significantly weakens Conclave's chances. Only six films have ever won best picture without a corresponding director nomination.",
      "On the plus side, three of those have been in the last 12 years (Argo, Coda and Green Book), suggesting this is less of an obstacle than it used to be.",
      "Why wasn't Berger nominated? One possible factor is that, unlike the five directors who were, he didn't write or co-write his film's screenplay. Conclave was adapted from Robert Harris's novel by British screenwriter Peter Straughan.",
      "13. Diane Warren really wants to win.",
      "The songwriter scored her 16th best original song nomination this year, for writing The Journey, from The Six Triple Eight.",
      "But Warren has never won. With Emilia P\u00e9rez's campaign damaged and potentially splitting votes with two songs in the category, could this finally be her year?",
      "She certainly hopes so. Earlier this month, when a film account on X asked followers: \"Which Oscar winner would make you happiest?\" Warren brilliantly replied: \"Me!\"",
      "14. Wicked has a tall hill to climb to win best picture, having missed both a directing and screenplay nomination.",
      "It did score several technical nods as well as acting nominations for Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, but neither are frontrunners in their category.",
      "The last film to win best picture without a corresponding win in a director, screenplay or acting category was Rebecca in 1942.",
      "15. Two nominees are following in their mothers' footsteps.",
      "I'm Still Here star Fernanda Torres is nominated for best actress - after her mother Fernanda Montenegro became the first Brazilian nominee in the same category in 1999 for Central Station.",
      "Meanwhile, Conclave star Isabella Rossellini's mother, Ingrid Bergman, was nominated for best actress six times in her career, winning twice, and won best supporting actress.",
      "16. Anora's director could become the first person to win four Oscars for the same film.",
      "As Sean Baker was involved in so many aspects of the film's production, he could personally win best picture, editing, director and screenplay.",
      "Nobody has ever done this before.",
      "Walt Disney did win four Oscars in the same night in 1953, but for four different films.",
      "And Parasite's Bong Joon-Ho came incredibly close in 2020, but as the best international film prize technically goes to the country that submitted it rather than the director, he only took home three for his own trophy cabinet.",
      "If Anora does win the top prize, it will be the second consecutive year the director of best picture co-wins with his wife. Baker and wife Samantha Quan would follow Oppenheimer's Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas.",
      "Anora would also be the first 18-rated film to win best picture since The Departed in 2007.",
      "17. It's official: The cat in Flow is named Flow.",
      "The delightful movie about a cat who survives a flood is a dark horse in the animated film category, having beaten box office juggernauts Inside Out 2 and The Wild Robot to the prize at the Golden Globes.",
      "\"While we worked on Flow the cat didn't have a name,\" the film's director Gints Zilbalodis said earlier this month. \"We just called it the cat.",
      "\"I've heard from multiple people that they think that its name is Flow. People have even named their cats Flow now! So I think we can call the cat Flow.\"",

      "Ariana Grande, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Demi Moore were among the Oscar nominees who gathered in Los Angeles on Tuesday for the annual \"class photo\".",

      "17 facts you need to know before the Oscars",
      "17 facts you need to know before the Oscars",
      "The class photo, a highlight of the film calendar, is usually taken much earlier in awards season, at the nominees luncheon, but that event was cancelled this year due to the LA wildfires.",
      "Here are 12 things we spotted in this year's class photo:",
      "1. Ariana and Cynthia held space at the front",
      "Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande have spent the last few months crying, holding space and stroking each other's fingers as they promoted the screen adaptation of Wicked.",
      "The two actresses have redefined the film press tour in recent weeks thanks to their absolute adoration for each other - an energy they will have to recreate later this year when they do it all again for the release of part two.",
      "Before the photo was taken, instead of saying cheese, Erivo shouted: \"Everyone say 'Oscar nominee!'\"",
      "Last week, it was confirmed the pair will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony which will last a reported 10 minutes long.",
      "Wicked is the closest thing the Oscars have this year to a box office smash in the shape of last year's Barbie, and they'll be hoping the medley will recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.",
      "2. We absolutely need this woman's jumper",
      "We're aware the weather is getting warmer and the sun is rising earlier as we hurtle towards Spring, but we are nevertheless always on the lookout for a colourful cosy jumper and we need to investigate the origin of this one as an urgent priority.",
      "The woman with the impeccable sweater selection in the class photo is Maya Gnyp - a producer of I Am Ready, Warden - which is nominated for best documentary short.",
      "The film follows Texas death row inmate John Henry Ramire in his final days.",
      "3. A-listers packed out the front row",
      "Joining Ariana and Cynthia on the front row were fellow acting nominees Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Mikey Madison and Monica Barbaro.",
      "Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.",
      "As a result, her fellow category nominees such as Barbaro, who plays Joan Baez in Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, have had to practise their best \"I'm just happy to be nominated\" faces this year.",
      "Madison, however, is a co-frontrunner in a tight race for leading actress. The Anora star is up against Demi Moore for The Substance in a category seen as a dead heat.",
      "4. James Mangold turned up just in time",
      "James Mangold, nominated this year for A Complete Unknown, is one of Hollywood's most respected and loved directors.",
      "So why is he sitting on an aisle seat in the second-back row, away from all his pals, looking sheepish?",
      "It's probably because he only just made the class photo by the skin of his teeth, arriving late to the event to an affectionate collective groan followed by cheers from his fellow nominees.",
      "Despite a distinguished Hollywood career, Mangold is a first-time nominee in the best director category, as are his fellow nominees Coralie Fargeat, Sean Baker, Brady Corbet and Jacques Audiard.",
      "5. We'd like to be the fifth member of this gang",
      "In a year where disappointingly few of the stars pulled funny faces or made eye-catching hand gestures while the photo was being taken, we applaud the team from Black Box Diaries for joining hands and celebrating.",
      "They are the film's director Shiori Ito (second left), editor Ema Ryan Yamazaki (far right) and producers Hanna Aqvilin and Eric Nyari.",
      "The movie, nominated in the documentary feature category, examines a sexual assault investigation in Japan.",
      "6. The biggest stars were in the back row",
      "Sitting in the back row, so far from the photographer that their faces are somewhat blurry and out of focus, are three of the biggest stars in this year's awards race.",
      "In the centre is The Substance star Demi Moore, nominated for playing an ageing aerobics instructor who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself.",
      "She is joined on either side by supporting actor nominees Guy Pearce (left), who is recognised for his role in The Brutalist, and Edward Norton, who is nominated for playing Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown.",
      "7. Bernie and Brandi appeared without Elton",
      "Also hanging out in the front row were songwriter Bernie Taupin and singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile.",
      "The pair are nominated in the best original song category for writing Never Too Late, the title track from Sir Elton John's recent documentary.",
      "Sir Elton himself wasn't there, however, despite co-writing the song with the pair.",
      "It's likely he will attend the Oscars on Sunday, but he won't be singing his song as the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony this year.",
      "Instead, Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony alongside the Wicked medley.",
      "8. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet looked a little lonely",
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet joined his fellow nominees just days after springing a surprise win at the SAG Awards for A Complete Unknown.",
      "In his speech, the actor talked about his desire to be \"one of the greats\" of Hollywood.",
      "However, the actor has not been campaigning as aggressively as frontrunner Adrien Brody, and for the class photo, Chalamet took an aisle seat, leaned out and put his fist to his chest.",
      "Seated just in front of him are Anora's director Sean Baker and his producer wife Samantha Quan.",
      "9. The leading actors led from behind",
      "Adding further star power to the blurry back row were best actor contenders Adrien Brody, Colman Domingo and Sebastian Stan.",
      "Brody is the frontrunner to win, for his role in the Brutalist as a Hungarian architect who moves to the US after World War Two and is taken under the wing of a wealthy businessman.",
      "Sing Sing star Domingo plays a prison inmate who joins a performing arts programme, while Stan is nominated for portraying a young Donald Trump.",
      "10. Ralph represented for the Brits",
      "The Brits nominated in the acting categories this year are The Brutalist's Felicity Jones, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, and Conclave's Ralph Fiennes.",
      "The actor was on Fiennes form, sitting in the back row alongside Sing Sing's John \"Divine G\" Whitfield.",
      "Fiennes is unlikely to win best actor, but if Conclave wins the top Oscar, he'll become the first actor ever to have appeared in four best picture winners.",
      "11. Some nominees were conspicuous by their absence",
      "Understandably, not every nominee was available to attend the dinner - best supporting actor frontrunner Kieran Culkin was among the stars missing from the class photo.",
      "But others were conspicuous by their absence, most notably Emilia P\u00e9rez star Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n.",
      "The actress is persona non grata in Hollywood at the moment, after some historic tweets she posted resurfaced in recent weeks, severely damaging the film's awards chances in many categories.",
      "However, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself on Sunday - although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.",
      "12. Clarence Maclin knows what time it is",
      "Sing Sing star Clarence Maclin was widely considered the most notable absence in the best supporting actor category this year.",
      "But he is still nominated at the Oscars thanks to his story credit on the film, which means he is recognised in the best adapted screenplay category.",
      "Maclin was one of the real-life inmates at the Sing Sing jail, after being sentenced to 17 years in jail for robbery, aged 29, and was a member of the prison's Rehabilitation Through the Arts (RTA) programme.",
      "In the class photo, Maclin, who plays a version of himself in Sing Sing, is either checking his watch or possibly about to sneeze.",

      "Here is everything you need to know about the show and the real events in the Northamptonshire town that inspired it.",

      "Netflix said Toxic Town focused on mothers who fought a \"David and Goliath battle for justice\".",
      "In 1979, about 10,000 people worked at Corby's steelworks, but, with Britain experiencing a decline in heavy industry, steel production became uncompetitive, leading to the site's closure in 1980.",
      "Thousands were left unemployed, prompting the local council to launch a regeneration project.",
      "The British Steel Corporation demolished the works, and using government and European grants, the council began reclaiming the land.",

      "Years later, concerns arose when mothers living near the reclamation site gave birth to children with upper limb deformities.",
      "A 1999 Northamptonshire Health Authority study found no unusual cluster of birth defects.",
      "However, solicitor Des Collins, after reading about the cases, conducted his own investigation, revealing birth defects in Corby were three times higher than in the surrounding area.",
      "Mr Collins assembled a team of experts, including toxicologists and pollution specialists, to argue that the council's mismanagement of toxic waste had spread contaminated dust throughout the town.",
      "The heavy metal cadmium was identified on the former steel site, and a medical expert cited research linking it to birth defects in animals.",
      "After a three-month civil court hearing, Justice Akenhead ruled in favour of the claimants, marking the first time a UK court recognised airborne pollutants harming unborn babies.",
      "Corby Borough Council disputed the verdict and prepared an appeal, but reached a private settlement with the families in 2010.",

      "At the urology department of Burnley General Hospital, 26-year-old Ryan (not his real name) is having a drug solution inserted through a catheter - part of his treatment for a condition known as ketamine bladder. This procedure will not completely reverse the damage inflicted by Ryan's previous addiction to the Class B drug, but it will help him manage the symptoms.",
      "Ketamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically. However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder. The hospital is watching Ryan for signs of kidney failure, too. He worries about finding a girlfriend and having children. But he is stoical when he talks about passing blood and having to urinate numerous times a day.",
      "\"You could not be a ketamine addict for 30 years, 20 years,\" he says. \"You'd die.\"",
      "He is under the care of consultant urologist Haytham Elsakka, who says he has witnessed a rise in young patients whose bladders have been damaged by ketamine use. \"Some of them are in their 30s, but most of them are 16 to 24,\" says Dr Elsakka. Around half of young patients end up needing surgery, he adds. Other risks from recreational use include liver failure, damage to the urethra, incontinence and impotence.",
      "\"We have seen young people under the age of 25 who've completely lost control of their bladders, who have had to have surgery, including bladder removal,\" says Abigail Wilson, lead clinical pharmacist for national drug and alcohol charity WithYou.",

      "An anonymised 2023 survey of more than 13,000 secondary schoolchildren from 185 schools across England reported 11% of 15-year-olds had been offered ketamine at some point. The same study, conducted for NHS England, suggested the use of ketamine among schoolchildren had more than doubled in the last decade from 0.4% in 2013 to 0.9% in 2023.",
      "The drug came into the spotlight following the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry aged 54, after which a coroner found ketamine had been the primary cause. Doctors and experts subsequently described how the market for the drug in the US has exploded as it has grown in popularity among Hollywood celebrities.",
      "And thousands of miles away, among ordinary young people in UK towns, ketamine \u2013 also known as special K, vitamin K, or kit kat - has also become fashionable. Although highly dangerous, it is often seen as a sociable way to get high, with users buying it in powder form and snorting it.",
      "Now, just 11 years after ketamine was reclassified from Class C to Class B, the UK government is seeking expert advice on whether to make ketamine a Class A drug. This would mean anyone supplying it could be handed a life sentence.",

      "One Saturday afternoon in September 2023, the hottest day of the year, a 16-year-old called Preston McNally took ketamine with three friends in Burnley. High on the drug, he fell into the Leeds and Liverpool canal that flows through the town. Preston's friends had also taken the drug and did not call for help straight away, an inquest was later told.",
      "The coroner said Preston drowned due to ketamine intoxication. The inquest also heard that he had told his sister he was trying to quit just before he died.",
      "Those on the front line are well aware of the scale of the problem. \"The amount of mums that have said to me, 'It's everywhere',\" says Fr Alex Frost from St Matthews Church in the town. He runs a support group for parents of ketamine users. \"It's in the schools, it's in the parks.\"",
      "Across Lancashire, recorded offences for possession and supply of ketamine rose by nearly 70% from 54 in 2023 to 91 in 2024. \"What we have seen, probably within the last 12 months, is the upturn in the use, particularly around children,\" says Insp Matt Plummer of Lancashire Police. \"Sometimes the parents have no idea.\"",
      "Once ketamine was known as a party drug, associated with the club scene. But there's evidence to suggest that has changed. In a 2024 report into drug trends in Greater Manchester, school-aged children recounted how they used it with friends to \"chill\" in the local parks or at home.",
      "Those who go on to use it away from social settings are often doing so \"to self-medicate unmet mental health support needs such as anxiety and trauma\", says the author of the report, Robert Ralphs, a professor of criminology and social policy at Manchester Metropolitan University.",
      "'Everybody else is doing it'",
      "One mother, who we are calling Claire, told the BBC she was oblivious to the fact that her 14-year-old daughter Lexi (not her real name) was addicted to ketamine until the teenager ended up in hospital with severe stomach cramps.",
      "Lexi, who lives on a neat, well-cared-for street in Burnley, loved sport and dancing. But after she started secondary school, she says, a friend introduced her to ketamine.",
      "\"I knew it was illegal\u2026 and it was a horse tranquiliser,\" says Lexi. \"That's all I knew. I didn't really want to do it, but I just thought, well, everybody else is doing it and I didn't really want to be the odd one out.\"",
      "One reason that so many young people are gravitating towards ketamine is they can buy it for pocket-money prices, according to Lexi. \"It were easy to get \u2013 like, really easy,\" she says.",
      "In Burnley, friends will chip in for the \u00a315 to \u00a330 it costs for a gram and share it.",
      "To feed her habit, Lexi would ask her mum for a couple of pounds for the bus or some make-up - or sometimes she would steal a \u00a310 note. If Lexi had been coming home drunk or smelling of weed, her mother Claire would have twigged. Claire says: \"I was absolutely gobsmacked, just distraught, really, thinking: how did I not know?\"",
      "'You're doing stupid amounts'",
      "What makes ketamine especially dangerous is that lots of people, particularly young people, wrongly see it as a lower-risk drug, says Mrs Wilson of the WithYou charity.",
      "At lower doses, she says, it has a similar effect to alcohol. \"The effects can wear off from about 40 minutes to just over an hour after taking it,\" she adds. \"If you want to keep those effects, then repeat dosing is required to continue them.\"",
      "And this means users' habits can escalate rapidly, according to Aaron (not his real name), who lives in a small town outside Burnley and took his first snort of ketamine when he was just 16.",
      "\"Your tolerance goes up extremely quickly and within the first month you're doing stupid amounts,\" he says. Soon he was spending \u00a3200 month on the drug.",
      "Higher doses can lead to a state known as a K-hole, \"which is where you become completely detached from reality and also paralysed\", says Mrs Wilson.",
      "Then there is the psychological impact. The WithYou charity is helping Lexi recover from dependence on the drug, but also trauma and self-harm. Once, when she was high, she was the victim of a sexual assault. When kids are on ketamine, they are extremely vulnerable.",
      "'Extremely dangerous'",
      "Some of the families of ketamine addicts the BBC has spoken to want the drug reclassified as Class A. But this would also mean children caught in possession of ketamine could face up to seven years in jail rather than five. Putting ketamine in the same bracket as heroin and cocaine \"may increase the stigma and make young people less likely to discuss their use and seek help\", warns Prof Ralphs.",
      "The government is currently seeking expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) on whether the drug should be reclassified. \"Ketamine is an extremely dangerous substance and the recent rise in its use is deeply concerning,\" says Dame Diana Johnson, the policing minister. \"It is vital we are responding to all the latest evidence and advice to ensure people's safety and we will carefully consider the ACMD's recommendations before making any decision.\"",
      "Families in the Burnley area say the authorities also need to do more to help those suffering as a result of what Fr Frost calls an \"epidemic\" of ketamine use.",
      "In response, Lancashire County Council says it is \"dedicated to supporting children and young people affected by ketamine use in our community\" and that it \"will continue to work tirelessly to address the challenges posed by ketamine use and to provide the necessary support to those in need\".",
      "'The urge is always there'",
      "There is scepticism from those on the frontline that increased enforcement will solve the issue.",
      "\"It's not a case that we can just arrest our way out of the ketamine issue,\" says Insp Plummer. \"You could arrest 10, 15 people a day for the possession of ketamine if you found them, but it's not going to change the cycle, particularly with kids.\" He adds that generally children caught with ketamine are given informal words of advice and referred for support, not charged.",
      "And some experts query how effective reclassification would be.  These include Prof Ralphs, who observes that the 2014 shift from Class C to Class B has not prevented the recent rise in usage among young people. He also suggests that would have no impact on people's decisions to supply it either, as most ketamine dealers already supply Class A substances as well. He adds that reclassification \"will not deter young people from using it if their underlying mental health and wellbeing needs continue to be unmet\".",
      "In the meantime, no one yet knows what the long-term effects will be for children who start taking ketamine at 12, 13 or 14. Community leaders and the families the BBC spoke to say they cannot wait for change, and that urgent action is needed now to try to prevent more young people suffering.",
      "Lexi says she is trying to move forward with her life. Since the doctors at the hospital told Lexi where her life could be heading, she has not used ketamine.",
      "Getting the drug out of her head is still not easy. She insists she will never take another dose of ketamine. But, she says, \"the urge is always there for me to do it again\".",

      "UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has met US President Donald Trump during his first visit to the White House.",
      "Here are some of the key moments as the pair took questions from reporters before and after the talks.",
      "1. A surprise letter to Trump from King Charles",
      "Sir Keir did not turn up to the meeting empty-handed.",
      "Part way through their opening remarks, the prime minister reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles III - an invitation for a second state visit.",
      "Trump appeared to be genuinely taken back for a few seconds, asking: \"Am I supposed to read it right now?\"",
      "After taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country.",
      "He added that King Charles was a \"beautiful man, a wonderful man\".",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he met King Charles's mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, during a three-day state visit in 2019.",
      "Sir Keir said Thursday's invitation to host Trump once more for a second full state visit was \"unprecedented\".",
      "2. Trump wanted to take charge",
      "While cordial, the initial meeting in the Oval Office between Sir Keir and Trump left no doubt that the US president hoped to be firmly in charge.",
      "The meeting was a pattern we've now seen six times with foreign leaders at the Trump White House, including with French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week: Trump taking control of the room and using the opportunity to get his own messages, both domestic and international, across to the reporters there.",
      "Analysis: Starmer charms Trump, but any deals will have to wait",
      "Analysis: Starmer charms Trump, but any deals will have to wait",
      "During their half-hour session, Trump leaned forward and slightly towards Sir Keir - wearing a nearly identical, but slightly different coloured tie to Trump's -  dominating the conversation and taking charge of calling on reporters.",
      "A joint afternoon news conference later began with a slightly more diplomatic and matter-of-fact tone, with both Trump and Sir Keir standing at their respective lecterns and going to considerable lengths to lavish praise on the other.",
      "Trump joked he would have been president 20 years ago with Sir Keir's \"beautiful\" accent.",
      "At one point, Sir Keir was asked about Trump's controversial call to make Canada \u2013 a member of the Commonwealth \u2013 the 51st state of the US.",
      "\"I think you're trying to find a divide that doesn't exist,\" Sir Keir replied.",
      "Trump interjected quickly with the words \"that's enough\" before moving on \u2013 again taking control of the room as he stood next to a visibly surprised Sir Keir.",
      "3. The similarities between Starmer and Trump",
      "To put it gently, Sir Keir and Trump are from different schools of politics - both in their style and substance.",
      "But asked to name their similarities Trump said: \"He loves his country, and so do I.\"",
      "What else do they share? Trump said \"we like each other, frankly, and we like each other's country\".",
      "But the \"common thread\" between the two men was that \"we love our country\", Trump said.",
      "4. Starmer a 'tough negotiator'",
      "Sir Keir had a number of tricky topics to raise with Trump - from trade to US security guarantees for Ukraine - and at the beginning of their news conference he called his counterpart \"a very tough negotiator\".",
      "Asked if the prime minister had convinced him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK, Trump said \"he tried\", adding: \"He was working hard, I'll tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.\"",
      "But he has said there was \"a very good chance\" of a trade deal \"where tariffs wouldn't be necessary\".",
      "Such a deal, Trump said, could be made \"pretty quickly\".",
      "Sir Keir spoke of a \"new economic deal with advanced technology at its core\".",
      "5. Trump 'minded' to accept UK's Chagos deal",
      "Trump said he was \"inclined to go along with\" the UK's Chagos Islands deal.",
      "The UK is in talks with Mauritius about handing over the territory but continuing to lease one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which contains a UK-US military airbase.",
      "The agreement has been mired in uncertainty after Trump's re-election as US president, given several US Republicans have argued it could deliver a potential security boost to China.",
      "But during the meeting, Trump said he had a \"feeling\" the deal was going to \"work out very well\".",
      "6. 'Did I say that?' Trump walks back comments on Zelensky",
      "Last week, Trump made headlines by calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \"dictator\" in a social media post, echoing Russian claims about Kyiv's cancelled elections.",
      "An election was scheduled for May 2024, but it was suspended because Ukraine has been under martial law since Russia began its full-scale invasion.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason about his use of the word \"dictator\", Trump replied: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.\"",
      "In the news conference later, Trump also appeared to have softened his attitude to Zelensky, praising him as \"very brave\" and saying the pair got on \"really well\".",
      "Talking about the potential for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, Trump said \"progress towards peace\" would continue when Zelensky visits the White House on Friday. The two are expected to sign a major minerals deal.",
      "7. Starmer hits back at free speech criticism",
      "At the Munich Security Conference last week, US Vice President JD Vance attacked the UK and other European democracies, warning that \"free speech is in retreat.\"",
      "Asked about the comments, Trump called on his deputy to defend himself. Vance argued \"there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British\" but also \"American technology companies and by extension, American citizens\".",
      "That led to Sir Keir cutting in, saying \"we've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom - and it will last for a very, very long time\".",
      "He rejected Vance's claim, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there\"."

      "The MP said that, because he was terrified and the other man's \"arms were swinging\", he felt he had no option but to \"defend\" himself.",
      "But the judge told him the CCTV pictures revealed a very different story.",
      "\"In reality, you told the police a pack of lies. Nothing more, nothing less,\" he said.",

      "Under parliamentary rules, if an MP receives a custodial sentence a \"recall petition\" is triggered.",
      "After hearing from Chester Crown Court, the Speaker of the House of Commons will contact the returning officer for Amesbury's Runcorn and Helsby constituency.",
      "Constituents will then have six weeks to ask for their MP's removal by registering at 10 nominated places.",
      "If at least 10% of them vote to remove Amesbury, a by-election will be called.",
      "It would be the first by-election since Labour came to power following the July 2024 general election.",
      "Having first been elected as a Labour MP in the Cheshire constituency of Weaver Vale in 2017, Amesbury comfortably won the Runcorn and Helsby seat which was created following boundary changes.",
      "He secured 53% of the vote and  enjoyed a majority of more than 14,000.",

      "\"But further action is needed to address the review's shocking finding that graphic strangulation is increasingly appearing in pornography, despite being illegal, and is becoming normalised in real life.",
      "\"We will urgently ensure that platforms, law enforcement and prosecutors take all necessary steps to tackle this disturbing harm.\"",

      "Measures to increase regulation of pornography, including to prevent children accessing explicit content, are already part of the Online Safety Act, which became law in October 2023.",

    "story": [
      "A second runway at Gatwick Airport has been backed by government, providing measures to reduce noise are put in place.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was \"minded to approve\" the expansion. Some MPs, local authorities and residents are strongly opposed.",
      "The airport wants to move its northern runway, which is currently only used for taxiing or as a back up, and make it operational by the end of the decade.",
      "The transport secretary's support does not guarantee the expansion will go ahead as it would still need planning permission.",
      "If permission is granted, work would start almost immediately, the BBC understands. The \u00a32.2bn expansion will be funded through private investment.",
      "\"I am issuing a minded to approve decision that provides some additional time to seek views from all parties on the provisions, prior to a final decision,\" Alexander said in a written ministerial statement on Tuesday.",
      "Gatwick has until 24 April to respond to demands for it to include measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport, in its overall plans before a final decision will be made in October.",
      "Stewart Wingate, Gatwick Airport chief executive, said following the latest announcement that the government has \"outlined a clear pathway to full approval later in the year\" and that the airport would \"engage fully\" in the process.",
      "The Transport Secretary's support for expansion comes as the government is looking at ways to boost economic growth in a bid to boost living standards, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves backing a third runway at Heathrow last month.",
      "Gatwick, in West Sussex, is Europe's busiest single runway airport, with more than 40 million passengers using it last year.",
      "On Tuesday, Alexander told industry leaders aviation was good for economic growth and said she was \"not some sort of flight-shaming eco warrior\".",
      "The growth arguments for expanding Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's two largest airports, differ with the former catering for more freight traffic relating to international goods trade.",
      "An extra runway at Gatwick would see capacity increased for holidaymakers and business travellers, particularly for short-haul destinations, as opposed to Heathrow's longer-haul flights.",
      "Gatwick managers have said that with 55 take-offs and landings in a busy hour, the airport is \"full\".",
      "Being able to use both runways could increase the number of departures by 50,000 a year by the end of the 2030s, the airport argued.",
      "It said some 30,000 of those flights are planned to depart from the north runway which will only be used for departures and not landings.",
      "But there is strong opposition to any expansion, particularly from climate campaigners.",
      "Greenpeace UK policy director Douglas Parr said the extension would not drive economic growth. \"The only thing it's set to boost is air pollution, noise, and climate emissions,\" he added.",
      "Alex Chapman, senior economist at left-of-centre think tank New Economics Foundation, also argued the move would not create new jobs, but would just shift them from other parts of the country.",
      "\"People are already perfectly able to catch cheap flights on holiday or travel for business,\" he added.",
      "Union Unite general secretary Sharon Graham backed Gatwick having a second runway, but warned it would need \"to come with guarantees of well paid, unionised jobs and proper facilities for workers\".",
      "Bronwen Jones, development director at Gatwick, said a second runway would be \"a win for everyone\".",

      "\"We can't keep ignoring climate change and it would be wrong to allow a new 'bucket and spade' runway, as we put it, at the expense of residents and the economy,\" she said.",
      "The group would take legal action through a judicial review if the expansion goes ahead, she added.",
      "Gatwick said it has committed to reducing noise levels to below those of 2019 - which CAGNE says was one of the worst years for noise.",
      "On Wednesday the government's independent advisers, the UK climate change committee (UKCCC), recommended that to meet the country's climate goals the amount of planet-warming gases released by the country's aviation sector needed to fall by 17% compared to 2003 levels.",
      "Some of the pollution from flying, it said, could be reduced by switching planes to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and by capturing the planet-warming gases released.",
      "But experts think it could be challenging to obtain the feedstock, like corn grain or food waste, needed to make SAF.",
      "The UKCCC said the best way to reduce the industry's impact on climate change would be to significantly slow the demand for flying.",

    "summary": "The prime minister announced the UK will reallocate aid funds to boost military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027.",
    "story": [
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has challenged Sir Keir Starmer over the hike in defence spending, after the PM said the rise amounted to \u00a313.4bn.",
      "The PM announced the UK will reallocate aid funds to boost military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, following President Trump's demand that all European allies increase their defence contributions.",
      "The decision comes as Sir Keir is set to fly to the US for talks with Trump in the White House, to discuss the war in Ukraine, later.",
      "Badenoch questioned Sir Keir over the exact amount, which Defence Secretary John Healey said could be calculated as \u00a36bn when inflation was taken into account, and whether the Chagos deal would be funded from it.",
      "Chris Mason: PM confronts Europe's new reality",
      "Will Starmer's defence hike win over Trump?",
      "Can Europe still count on the US coming to its defence?",
      "At Prime Minister's Questions, Badenoch asked whether any of the new funding would be going towards the multi-billion pound Chagos deal twice.",
      "The UK plans to hand over the territory to Mauritius, but under the terms of the deal, the UK will continue to lease one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which contains a UK-US military airbase, for a period of 99 years.",
      "The PM responded saying the increase in defence spending that was announced on Tuesday was for \"our capability on defence and security in Europe\", adding: \"The Chagos deal is extremely important for our security and for US security.\"",
      "Badenoch focused her questions to the prime minister on which figure for the defence rise - his initial \u00a313.4bn or \u00a36bn, which Healey said was the increase \"in real terms\"  - was correct.",
      "Sir Keir responded: \"If you take the numbers for this financial year and then the numbers for the financial year 2027-28, that's a \u00a313.4bn increase.",
      "\"That's the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the Cold War which will put us in a position to ensure the security and defence of our country and of Europe.\"",
      "Badenoch pressed him again, saying: \"The IFS said today that the government is playing silly games with numbers. How does he find this difference in numbers?\"",
      "Repeating himself, the PM then said they had already been \"going through the same question over and over again\" at previous PMQs and said \"if you ask again I'll give the same answer again\", to loud cheers from his backbenchers.",
      "Objecting, Badenoch pointed out that \"being patronising is not the same as answering the question\".",
      "When Badenoch suggested Sir Keir had listened to her advice on using international aid money for defence, he said: \"I'm going to have to let the leader of the opposition down gently... She didn't feature in my thinking at all.",
      "\"I was so busy over the weekend I didn't even see her proposal.",
      "\"She has appointed herself I think saviour of the western civilisation in a desperate search for relevance.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey urged the prime minister to back the idea of a European rearmament bank \"so that we can finance a big increase in manufacturing capacity without the need to cut Britain's vital soft power\".",
      "The prime minister replied that there was \"an ongoing discussion\" with allies about future funding and he would share details with MPs \"as it evolves\".",
      "Earlier, a former defence chief of staff said he believed the decision to hike UK defence spending has been \"accelerated\" by President Donald Trump's actions on Ukraine.",
      "General Sir David Richards said the decision to raise defence spending over the next two years was a sound strategic move, but one that \"almost certainly would not\" be happening if not for Trump.",
      "\"It was going to happen, it's now been accelerated by Donald Trump's actions, and all of us, I think, would say not before time,\" he told  BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "Lord Richards stressed the British Army was currently \"very hollowed out indeed\" and suggested the \"army isn't big enough\" currently for British troops to be part of a rotation of European peacekeeping forces.",
      "Questions have been raised about the Labour government's U-turn on its manifesto pledge to raise international development funding to 0.7% of gross national income, with unease among some Labour MPs about the move.",
      "Speaking at PMQs, Labour backbencher Diane Abbott suggested the decision could increase the risk of conflict abroad, telling the PM that \"there is also a view that taking money from aid and development to spend on armaments and tanks makes people less safe, not more safe, because the desperation and poverty that so often leads to warfare is what aid and development money is supposed to counter.\"",
      "The PM defended the decision in the chamber, and earlier Healey had said \"hard power is now more important than soft power\".",
      "Asked whether the increase announced on Tuesday is linked to Sir Keir's visit to the White House, Healey told the Today programme: \"President Trump, over the last two weeks, has been very direct in his challenge.",
      "\"He's reinforced the imperative and the importance of Britain making this commitment and helping other European countries to step up in a similar way.\"",
      "The US has been warning European leaders it wants to see a significant increase in their defence contributions to Nato for at least a decade.",
      "Trump's rapprochement with Russia's Vladimir Putin, and the US siding with Russia on a UN resolution on Ukraine, has sent shockwaves through European allies.",
      "Asked whether he believed the UK increasing its defence contribution would bring Trump on side, Healey said that the PM could now tell Trump: \"You are challenging Europe and the UK to step up on European security, on Ukraine, on defence spending, on reinforcing our industrial base.",
      "\"We are, and we will step up further.\"",

      "It concluded that the fire was the result of a chain of failures by governments, \"dishonest\" companies and the fire service, which lacked a strategy for dealing with high rise cladding fires.",
      "Rayner, who is also deputy prime minister, said the Grenfell Inquiry had uncovered \"serial incompetence and negligence, complacency and inaction, and blatant dishonesty and greed\" which led to the fire.",

      "\"That means greater accountability, stronger regulation, and putting residents at the heart of decision-making,\" she added, saying it was owed \"to the memory of those who lost their lives\".",

      "Industrial hubs in outer London, plans for rent-controlled key-worker homes and public transport upgrades, will be part of the plans, the mayor said.",
      "City Hall's Conservatives said the mayor had so far \"suffocated\" economic ambition in London and that it took the figures in the plans with a \"pinch of salt\".",
      "According to the London Growth Plan, the first priority is to increase the growth productivity rate to 2% (from the current 0.12%) each year until 2035, providing an extra \u00a327 bn in tax revenue for the Treasury.",

      "Harnessing sectors such as as AI, life sciences, robotics, clean tech, quantum computing, as well as the creative industries, will help to achieve this, the mayor added.",

      "The NCA originally wanted to prevent the inquiry hearing any evidence about the company, saying \"other contracts could be selected\".",
      "It then asked for 26 witness statements written by its staff to be withheld, and an order to be made preventing certain questions about the firm to be asked in the inquiry room in a public session.",
      "It argued those restrictions should include the identity of any person under investigation; evidence relating to the opinion of any government official concerning PPE Medpro's contracts; and evidence about payments to the company and who ultimately benefited.",
      "In its submission, it said there was a \"realistic possibility that criminal charges against one or more individuals will flow from the investigation\".",

      "Farmers protesting at government changes to agricultural inheritance tax rules have briefly disrupted a minister's speech at a national conference.",
      "Environment Secretary Steve Reed was met with horns from tractors parked outside and protesters who silently unfurled banners in front of him as he outlined farming reforms, which included plans to focus on food production and make the industry more resilient to disruption.",
      "Reed told the hundreds gathered at the National Farmers' Union (NFU) conference that he could not give them \"the answer many of you want on inheritance tax\" but he understood the strength of feeling in the room.",
      "NFU president Tom Bradshaw told the annual conference on Tuesday the inheritance tax changes were \"morally wrong and economically flawed\".",
      "Under the government's planned changes, from April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will be liable to the tax at 20% - half the usual inheritance tax rate.",
      "Other allowances could mean a couple who are married or in a civil partnership could pass on a farm worth as much as \u00a33m.",
      "The government has previously said that the changes will only impact the wealthiest 500 farms each year, a number disputed by farmers unions which estimate up to 70,000 farms could be affected overall.",
      "Mr Bradshaw, whose speech was also briefly interrupted by two protesters who appeared to be urging people to be vegan, said the government had broken promises made before the election and had increased the mental health pressures on farmers, calling for it to correct the tax policy \"urgently'.",
      "\"We will fight this family farm tax until ministers do the right thing,\" he said.",
      "\"Frankly, this government needs a reset moment with farming, where they face up to the reality of how much the industry is struggling.\"",
      "Many farmers argue that while they are asset rich, for example in terms of their land or livestock, they are cash poor and the proposed changes would mean they would have to sell up in order to pay the tax.",
      "What is inheritance tax, who pays it and what's changing for farmers?",
      "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",
      "In his speech, Reed had also outlined plans for a 25-year farming roadmap and food strategy, which would put food production at its core and make farm businesses more resilient to challenges such as severe flooding, drought and animal disease.",
      "He said it would ensure farming is a \"sector which recognises restoring nature is not in competition with sustainable food production, but is essential to it\".",

      "Police will be given new powers to search homes without a warrant for stolen mobile phones under major legislation which targets theft, street crime and anti-social behaviour.",
      "The Crime and Policing Bill is at the heart of what the government calls its \"Safer Streets mission\" and ministers want it to become law by the end of the year.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC the bill would address an \"epidemic of street theft\", including a rise in phone and bag snatching and shoplifting, and introduce new \"Respect Orders\" with restrictions similar to Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (Asbos).",
      "The Conservatives say the plans have been \"copied and pasted from the last government's announcements\".",
      "Child exploitation and cuckooing to be criminal offences",
      "'Not the ministry of fun': Troubling issues clatter onto Yvette Cooper's desk",
      "Will Keir Starmer be able to meet his pledges?",
      "The bill, unveiled in Parliament on Tuesday, pulls together many measures set out in Labour's general election manifesto.",
      "But they come amid questions over whether police have the funding to make the government's plan work.",
      "Under the bill, police would gain the power to enter and search a property without a court warrant for a stolen mobile phone or other items that have been electronically tracked, such as laptops or Bluetooth-tagged bikes.",
      "The power would mean that victims of mobile phone thefts who track their device while it is in the hands of a criminal could call on police to recover it quickly.",
      "Cooper told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she understood the \"incredible frustration\" of phone theft victims who say \"I can track it, I can see where it is - it's in this particular house, it's in this particular location\".",
      "\"And yet the police can't act fast enough to be able to track it down,\" she added.",
      "Cooper said \"we have to have the stronger powers and action [and] the police say they welcome this\".",
      "Asked about the reliability of locator apps, where people can use another device to help track down the location of their missing or stolen phone, being used in police searches, Cooper told BBC Breakfast: \"Police will have to make decisions [and] it will need to be signed off by a police inspector, and [they will] need to make decisions about where the evidence is good enough for them to be able to act.\"",
      "She added that the bill would include scrapping a \"ludicrous\" \u00a3200 threshold for shoplifting, which meant lower value thefts were not currently prioritised by police.",
      "Shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins told Sky News she was \"deeply concerned\" that no longer treating shoplifting below \u00a3200 as a summary-only offence would have significant long-term effects on crown courts, saying \"victims of rape will find it even harder and longer to get their day in court\".",
      "But Cooper said addressing lower value thefts which were not likely to lead to prison would stop criminal behaviour escalating to the stage where such sentences would apply.",
      "The bill also includes the government's proposed \"Respect Orders\" - court-imposed restrictions that will be similar to the Asbo developed in the Tony Blair era, then scrapped by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats coalition a decade ago.",
      "While Asbos were popular with voters, critics say the restrictions often became unworkable or poorly enforced.",
      "The proposed Respect Orders allow courts to impose restrictions on an individual's behaviour, just like an Asbo.",
      "But they would also be able to compel them to attend programmes such as addiction treatment or anger management courses to change their ways.",
      "Other measures previously announced in the bill include:",
      "An offence of assaulting a shop worker - also a Conservative commitment before the 2024 General Election.A new police power to seize without warning off-road bikes or e-scooters.A new offence of spiking drinks, separate to current assault laws.Giving judges the power to issue a Stalking Prevention Order against a suspect, even if they are not convicted of a crime.",

      "Restaurant and retail bosses have written to Cooper to warn the bill \"stops short\" of protecting delivery riders under the plans. They want the new offence of threatening or assaulting a shop worker in their place of work to include couriers on journeys to and from customers.",
      "Cooper refused to be drawn on whether introducing new criminal offences would add unwelcome extra pressure on police, prisons, and the court system.",
      "Several police forces across England and Wales have previously warned they will have to make cuts to existing officers this year despite receiving extra funding, and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said in December that prisons were at risk of running out of space.",
      "Cooper told the Today programme that a boost in police spending and increasing \"early prevention action\" would help prevent crimes escalating and prison sentences needing to be imposed, while community measures like tagging and curfews would also be strengthened.",
      "The Home Office says the bill's aims will be delivered by recruiting 13,000 additional neighbourhood officers by 2029 - and the department has pledged \u00a3200m specifically towards that.",
      "The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC ) said last year that forces faced a \u00a31.3bn funding gap, and the available cash was not being shared evenly between forces due to outdated rules.",
      "The Home Office has since confirmed it is putting \u00a31.1bn extra into policing up to April 2026.",
      "But the NPCC has warned that if it is to deliver the \"Safer Streets\" plan, forces would need a pay settlement that would help them to attract and retain the best possible officers.",

Senior health sources have indicated that the organisation had a degree of autonomy at the time, and the top job she then took on in 2021 was different to what was now envisaged by the Labour Government.",

      "NHS England said Amanda Pritchard had decided it was the right time to stand down, now that the NHS has turned a corner on recovery from the pandemic and the foundations are in place to make further changes to support the NHS.",
      "Ms Pritchard said in a statement: \"We always knew the recovery period after a once-in-a-century pandemic was going to be incredibly challenging, and whilst the timeliness and experience of care is still not good enough for too many people, the NHS has achieved a great deal in the face of historic pressure thanks to a relentless focus on innovation and reform.\"",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting thanked her for her integrity and unwavering commitment.",
      "He said: \"Amanda can be enormously proud of the leadership she has given in the face of the biggest health emergency for our country in modern history, as well as steering NHS England during turbulent political waters and six secretaries of state in her time as chief executive.\"",
      "Richard Meddings, chairman of NHS England, described it as \"a huge loss\" for the NHS.",

      "Last week, when challenged on the issue, she told BBC Breakfast \"we're not all brilliant performers at committee hearings, but it's absolutely right that we are scrutinised by Parliament.\"",

      "Sir James, a highly experienced NHS trust boss, will be known as transition chief executive with no time limit set on how long he will serve. It's understood that no appointment process has been set up to look for a replacement for Ms Pritchard."

    "story": [
      "The first round of cross-party talks on social care in England have been postponed, BBC News has learned.",
      "The meeting was due to take place on Wednesday but those due to attend were emailed on Monday evening to say it was off and would be rescheduled.",
      "Government sources have pointed to the difficulty of arranging a meeting at which representatives of five different parties can agree to attend at the same time.",
      "Conservative sources suggested those being invited ought to have been given more notice about the date and a clearer agenda of what would be talked about in the meeting.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting had promised the talks would begin this month and all of the main opposition parties have insisted they want to take part.",
      "The Tories, Liberal Democrats, Reform UK and the Green Party had been invited by the Department of Health and Social Care to join a discussion later this week involving Baroness Louise Casey.",
      "The baroness - who previously led a landmark review of the Metropolitan Police - will chair the independent commission, which is expected to begin work in April.",
      "The government has said that the commission would make \"clear recommendations\" for how to rebuild the adult social care system in a way that could achieve cross-party and national support.",
      "But critics have previously said the timescale set out by the government lacks sufficient urgency.",
      "The commission's work will be split into two phases, with the first due to report back in mid-2026 on critical issues in the system and with some medium-term improvements.",
      "However, the second phase - on the broader issues of organising care services and their long-term funding - will not report back until 2028.",
      "Last month, Sarah Woolnough - chief executive of health think-tank The King's Fund - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that timescale \"feels far too long\".",
      "She urged the government to look at measures that could be implemented sooner.",
      "Streeting has previously said the government's aim is to set up a \"National Care Service\" that is capable of catering for an ageing population for decades to come.",
      "He said the government would \"finally grasp the nettle on social care reform\" but that it \"would take time\" to devise a model fit for the future.",
      "Social care covers a broad range of services for people who are older or living with a physical or mental illness.",
      "The King's Fund estimates local authorities in England spent \u00a328.4bn on social care in 2022/23.",
      "It also reported 818,000 people received publicly funded long-term social care in 2021/22, with a further 224,000 people receiving short-term care.",
      "Meanwhile, campaigners who say the government's changes to national insurance contributions for employers will damage the social care sector were due to hold a demonstration in Westminster on Tuesday.",
      "They say the tax policy - which will see employer contributions increase by 1.2 percentage points and the threshold where levy kicks in slashed by \u00a34,100 from April - will leave social care providers \"facing a struggle to survive this spring\".",
      "The government has said the changes raise \u00a326bn a year and point towards a \u00a33.7bn \"funding boost\" for the sector.",

      "Sir Keir suggested Trump had \"created an opportunity\" to end the war, in a speech to an international summit on supporting Ukraine in Kyiv.",
      "The prime minister also appeared to contradict President Trump by saying \"Russia does not hold all the cards in this war\".",
      "Sir Keir said the West \"must increase the pressure even further\" on Russia and announced the UK would impose a new round of sanctions on the country.",
      "The prime minister said more sanctions could push President Vladimir Putin \"to a point where he is ready not just to talk, but to make concessions\".",
      "On Monday the UK government said it had imposed more than 100 new sanctions on those who continued to aid the invasion, including companies in China, which is the largest supplier of critical goods for Russia's military.",
      "Meanwhile, the Home Office has announced a move to widen travel sanctions for Kremlin-linked elites.",
      "The government has described the announcement, which also includes measures against North Korean generals accused of sending troops to fight Ukraine in Russia, as the UK's largest sanctions package since the early days of the invasion.",
      "Sir Keir said the G7 \"should be ready to take on more risk\" and a larger role in sanctioning Russian's oil giants, before speaking to leaders of the group of wealthy countries.",
      "The speech comes ahead of Sir Keir's meeting with President Trump at the White House on Thursday.",
      "He is expected to discuss the importance of Ukraine's independence, US security guarantees and European involvement in peace talks when he speaks to Trump.",
      "It is a high-stakes visits as European leaders scramble to put forward their own proposals for ending the war and keeping Russia at bay.",
      "President Trump has been pushing for a quick deal to end the war in Ukraine, and US and Russia have held initial talks, which excluded Ukraine and European countries.",
      "Trump has said he believes Russia has \"the cards\" in any peace talks to end the war because its military has \"taken a lot of territory\".",
      "There have been diplomatic tensions since President Trump called Volodymyr Zelensky a \"dictator without elections\" last week.",
      "Ukraine's elections are suspended under martial law, which has been in place since Russia's full-scale invasion was launched in February 2022.",
      "The prime minister talked about extra sanctions as one way to \"deliver an enduring peace\" in Ukraine.",
      "He said the other two ways were stepping up UK military support to Ukraine and bringing \"our collective strength to the peace effort\".",
      "\"President Trump has changed the global conversation over the last few weeks,\" Sir Keir said.",
      "\"And it has created an opportunity. Now, we must get the fundamentals right.\"",
      "He said Ukraine \"must have a seat at the table\" of peace talks and \"a US backstop will be vital to deter Russia from another invasion\".",
      "Sir Keir has spoken on the phone to French President Emmanuel Macron, who is meeting Trump in Washington on Monday.",
      "In the phone call on Sunday, Sir Keir and Macron \"compared notes\" on how best to approach President Trump, government sources told the BBC.",

      "European leaders and Trudeau in Ukraine for show of support on invasion anniversary",
      "Trump 'very frustrated' and Zelensky must strike minerals deal, says adviser",
      "Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned",
      "Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who will join Starmer on his trip to the White House, said the new sanctions \"underscore the UK's commitment to Ukraine\".",
      "\"Every military supply line disrupted, every rouble blocked, and every enabler of Putin's aggression exposed is a step towards a just and lasting peace,\" he told the House of Commons.",
      "Conservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said her party backed the government giving Ukraine \"everything they need\" - including weapons, hardware, and diplomatic muscle - to \"decide its own future.\"",
      "Patel pressed the government to exceed her party's manifesto pledge of spending 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2030, and \"lead\" a charge for Nato nations to boost their military budgets.",
      "Earlier, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged President Zelensky to secure Ukraine's future by signing a minerals deal with the US.",
      "Johnson said he believed Ukraine would sign a \"promising\" agreement to give the US access to valuable minerals, in return for security guarantees.",
      "Zelensky had rejected a \u00a3400bn ($500bn) demand for mineral wealth, but over the weekend, US officials said they expected to sign a deal this week.",
      "In a post on X on Monday, Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine's deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, said the Ukrainian and US teams were \"in the final stages of negotiations regarding the minerals agreement\".",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Johnson - a Zelensky ally who was prime minister when the invasion started - said claims by some Americans that Ukraine had provoked the war were \"a complete inversion of the truth\".",
      "He described Trump's comments as \"Orwellian\", and said he might as well have blamed the US for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during World War Two.",
      "But Johnson said it was important to focus on a minerals deal, which he called \"the great prize\" and suggested could be signed this week.",
      "He rejected suggestions the deal was a \"rip-off\" and said \"what the Ukrainians get from this is a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".",

    "summary": "Sir Keir Starmer's meeting with the US president comes at a pivotal moment for Europe, our political editor writes.",
    "story": [
      "A big moment and a big decision, ahead of a big meeting.",
      "The government's announcement that it will crank up defence spending and shrivel the international aid budget amounts to a big shift in strategy, posture and political positioning.",
      "Take a look at the Labour Party's election manifesto, written less than a year ago, if you would like proof of that.",
      "On page 125, it says: \"Labour is committed to restoring development spending at the level of 0.7 per cent of gross national income as soon as fiscal circumstances allow.\"",
      "The party is now committing to doing the precise opposite \u2013 cutting development spending by the same amount by which it had promised to raise it.",
      "There is nothing like an outspoken American president and an imminent visit to the White House to sharpen the mind \u2013 and hey presto, along came this announcement just as the prime minister packs his shirts for his trip across the Atlantic.",
      "Along came the thumbs-up from the Trump administration not long later.",
      "But it is also true that there has been a growing recognition for some time and across several parties that more money had to be spent on defence.",
      "The prime minister has taken to recalling how the Berlin Wall coming down made him feel. \"It felt as if we were casting off the shackles of history, a continent united by freedom and democracy,\" as he puts it - contrasting that with the reality of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "A wider critique along these lines has been crystallising for some time: the sense that the 1990s were a holiday from history, as Jonathan Freedland called it, and that the end of the Cold War had created a peace dividend where defence budgets could atrophy and the money could be spent on hospitals and schools, for instance.",
      "Instead, not only is there war in Europe, there is an occupant of the White House with seemingly little regard for the American security umbrella this continent has relied upon since World War Two.",
      "Little wonder, then, that we have seen a blitz of the jitters in European capitals as presidents and prime ministers try to work out what it may or may not mean.",
      "The task facing Starmer - the second strand of the European tag team of leaders to visit Washington, after President Emmanuel Macron on Monday - is to attempt to mould President Donald Trump's position.",
      "Over the coming weeks and months, can a deal be done where the war stops, Ukraine does not feel defeated, Europe does not feel imperilled and transatlantic relations are as near to conventional as possible?",
      "It is not going to be easy.",
      "The prime minister's trip to the White House is but one building block in developing answers to these questions.",
      "And then, over the following weekend, Starmer will host a gathering of European leaders to reflect on where the conversations so far have taken us.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 20:53:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The prime minister has set out plans to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer's promise to increase defence spending will have several consequences.  It may one day actually strengthen the UK's ability to defend itself. More immediately it will mean billions less spent on foreign aid.",
      "But what will it buy the prime minister diplomatically in Washington?",
      "In times past visiting dignitaries would give emperors gifts and tributes. Starmer  will now turn up at the White House on Thursday with a large goodie bag marked \"more defence spending\".",
      "Donald Trump is just the latest in a long line of US presidents urging European powers to spend more on their own defence.",
      "The prime minister will be able to say to the president that he has heard the call and acted. He might not want Trump to ask too many detailed questions: What does an added 0.2% of GDP mean in real money? When will the UK actually spend 3% on defence?",
      "But Starmer will want to land the idea that the UK is responding to Trump's agenda.",
      "Early signs are positive. Peter Hegseth, the US Secretary of Defence, said he had spoken to his UK counterpart, John Healey, and described the increase as \"a strong step from an enduring partner\".",
      "So Starmer's announcement may well get his foot in the door at the White House and a hearing from the president.",
      "But will it help him make the case for the security of Ukraine and Europe? Will Trump now be more amenable to allowing both a seat at the negotiating table? Will Trump be more open to the idea that the United States should play a role guaranteeing post-war Ukraine's security, giving air, logistics and intelligence cover to European forces helping to keep the peace on the ground?",
      "The answer to those questions is not clear cut. The prime minister may suggest the UK is showing leadership, pointing the way for other European allies to follow suit.",
      "He may also argue that the defence hike shows the UK will not have to make what he calls the \"historic mistake\" of having to choose between Europe and the US, something made much harder by the US decision to vote with Russia against Ukraine and Europe at the United Nations on Monday.",
      "Starmer cuts aid to fund hike in defence spending",
      "What is Nato and why isn't Ukraine a member?",
      "How much do Nato members spend on defence?",
      "The problem is that Trump and his administration have made it clear that their security priority is China and Europe will just have to do more to look after itself.",
      "Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the Royal United Services Institute, told the BBC: \"The reality is that whatever we do on defence, the US is going to pivot elsewhere, it is not going to take the lead role in European security that it has done for more than half a century.\"",
      "In that context, the government's promised increase in defence spending may be seen as a short-term tactical move ahead of Starmer's visit to Washington, rather than an historic response to the existential geopolitical changes posed by Trump's election.",
      "European diplomats told me they were underwhelmed by the UK defence offer, saying it was not enough to have a real impact. They said the UK would have to spend at least 3% of national wealth soon to give itself a chance to develop the capability it would need.",
      "To do that, the government would have to do more than raid the development budget. Aid charities noted that their spending was a soft target compared to those of massive spending departments such as welfare, health and education.",
      "But few politicians of any political colour appear prepared to start making an argument for a transformation of the post-war European welfare model and prepare voters for a massive change in defence spending.",
      "For now, the government is cutting foreign aid and international charities are furious.",
      "The reduction from 0.5% of national income to 0.3% means \u00a36bn less will be spent on foreign aid each year. Given that billions of this budget still pays for asylum seekers' hotels here in the UK, the actual amount spent on aid overseas will be about 0.15%.",
      "The prime minister said the UK would use this remaining aid money to help Sudan, Ukraine and Gaza, tackle climate change, and support multinational efforts on global health.",
      "Aid charities were stunned. Save the Children said it was betrayal of the world's most vulnerable children. The One campaign said it would create huge problems for the delivery of vital humanitarian assistance. The aid network BOND said there would be devastating consequences for millions of marginalised people.",
      "All this after Donald Trump froze America's development spending arm, USAID.",
      "By cutting foreign aid, the government has broken a manifesto commitment to protect the budget. It has also damaged its policy of using aid to engage more closely with countries in the global south.",
      "David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee and former Labour foreign secretary, said the cut was \"a blow to Britain's proud reputation as a global humanitarian and development leader\".",

    "summary": "What could happen when Sir Keir Starmer visits the White House next Thursday?",
    "story": [
      "The next seven days really matter.",
      "\"The most negative thing would be a gruesome sell-out of Ukraine and we get slapped with tariffs,\" says a source involved in working out the best moves for No 10 as Sir Keir Starmer prepares to head to the White House to meet President Donald Trump.",
      "\"The better version is Trump returns to a bit more robust behaviour with the Russians, Britain gets patted on the back for making a move on defence spending and we avoid all the tariffs \u2013 a Trumpportunity.\"",
      "With Whitehall-style understatement, a different official predicts the PM \"has a really big decision to make about what to say to Trump in private\" \u2013 remember, just this week the president accused Sir Keir of \"doing nothing\" to try and stop the Ukraine conflict.",
      "So what options does Sir Keir have?",
      "A decision on defence spending is the big focus. The drumbeat of demands for the UK to boost spending was getting louder even before Trump moved into the White House.",
      "The government hasn't yet committed to when it will hit its target of spending 2.5% of the size of the economy, let alone if it will go a lot further as military leaders, Nato, Trump, and now even the Liberal Democrats are calling for.",
      "A senior government source says the PM is \"pushing the system\" to get to a stronger position on spending, but in recent days it's suggested the Treasury's still asking about the spending consequences. The dilemma is obvious: public money is tight as a drum, and Downing Street doesn't want to take cash from the NHS or other priorities at home.",
      "But a Treasury source acknowledged \"the world is changing\", and sources describe a \"phenomenal\" opportunity to take the European lead and please Trump with cash promises.",
      "A Trump backer warns against anything lukewarm: \"a proper commitment, not just a road map, or a path \u2013 be more specific, say 'Yes we'll hit it by this date,' and throw in some more\".",
      "\"He's going to have to do 3% [or more],\" one Whitehall insider suggests, \"so the choice is, does it do it now, for the right reasons, make a virtue of it, or does he end up getting browbeaten into it by Trump?\"",
      "I'm told that there is no final decision on what to say \u2013 and crucial meetings are planned between ministers, officials and military advisers at the start of next week to decide.",
      "What next for Ukraine?",
      "Ukraine is, clearly, central to the talks, and the question looms over what happens if Trump gets the ceasefire he wants.",
      "In the last week UK and French military planners have been working on options, all of which are at an early stage. One idea is  that a \"reassurance\" force of perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 UK and French troops could be deployed after a ceasefire around Ukrainian infrastructure, ports, nuclear power stations, even in some of the key cities.",
      "The model of a joint UK-French force already exists \u2013 the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force, a deal signed by the two countries several years ago. Another source suggests the best option for a monitoring force would be under the badge of the UN, if the Russians could be persuaded to accept that, with Ukraine's allies stepping up training and support for Ukraine inside the country.",
      "These options in broad terms, given a public airing by Sir Keir Starmer this week, aren't new, one adviser says, and have been suggested in private for a long time. Another source in government says the plan for 30,000 troops is \"not yet an actual thing\" \u2013 there's no detailed blueprint.",
      "But European leaders know they have to prove to Trump they are serious about contributing to a lasting peace, rather than leaving it to the United States.",
      "I'm told when French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump and Zelensky met in the margins of the fanciest international get together of recent times, the reopening of Notre Dame, Trump said that he'd get Russia to the table, Zelensky said that he would go to the negotiating table, and Macron promised he'd make sure Europe played a real part.",
      "It's worth noting that Trump said \"that's great, I'm all for that\", when asked earlier this week about the idea of European troops being deployed was mentioned.",
      "'We know who the goodies are'",
      "But as the talks approach, uncertainty about the US' true view is the fundamental, and some in government are nervous. Does Trump really believe that Zelensky is a \"dictator\" \u2013 or, as Trump's Ukraine envoy suggested yesterday, a \"courageous leader\"? Does Trump want the \"sugar rush\" of a quick deal that might favour Russia asks one former defence minister, more than achieving something long-term?",
      "A Trump backer said it is \"obscene\" to suggest that the president is a Putin sympathiser, pointing to his previous decisions to approve the sale of Javelin missiles to Ukraine.",
      "In No 10, \"we don't think there is a cut and run\", a senior source says. In private, US figures have reassured the UK that the United States is not about to turn its back on Ukraine.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "In Brussels last week the US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth made headlines when he signalled the US would reduce its support for Ukraine \u2013  but a source in the room during the private talks after his controversial public remarks told me Hegseth said \"we know who the goodies are and who the baddies are\".",
      "There is though anxiety in government that Trump might be tempted to just force a deal to end the conflict, then Russia could \"just reload then go again\", according to another source.",
      "But there is a shaky faith \u2013 perhaps more accurately a fervent hope \u2013 that whatever the president's public remarks, that the US will try to involve Ukraine in the talks and does think the peace has to be a deal that lasts, with a force that looks credible, potentially with some form of American support.",
      "Emmanuel Macron, and then Sir Keir, will try to persuade Trump that a deal with security guarantees for Ukraine is the only true victory for the White House.",
      "Remember why all this matters so much back home. What Trump decides to do about the conflict has an effect not just on the security of our continent but our prosperity too: the Ukraine war has shaken our economy through the effect it's had on energy bills.",
      "There is also, of course, the simple and awful human cost of lives lost \u2013 Ukrainians and Russians \u2013 hundreds of thousands of casualties, with terrible suffering on the edge of Europe. Thousands of families in the UK opened their homes to Ukrainian refugees at the start of the war.",
      "The former defence minister notes: \"Sometimes when there is all this noise, we have to still find a way to keep supporting them. Who knows when it is going to end, the only thing we know is they are still being attacked.\"",
      "As the war's three-year anniversary approaches you can expect to hear this message from government too.",
      "And of course what happens matters enormously to the fortunes of this government. Sir Keir might have a huge majority, but he has battled to retain political momentum and his popularity has plunged since taking office.",
      "He may even want to bring other things to the famous Resolute desk beyond defence and Ukraine: Trump is, a senior government source says, notoriously unpredictable and may swerve off topic.",
      "A source familiar with Trump's thinking suggests the PM could turn Trump's freewheeling style to his advantage by putting other issues on the table \u2013 an offer to buy more American Liquid Natural Gas perhaps, revising the deal on the Chagos Islands, a tougher position on China, or a discussion about tech regulation perhaps, with Apple in a huff with the UK government.",
      "Starmer might not have chosen \u2013 few prime ministers do \u2013 to have to confront complicated foreign policy tangles early in office. But one Whitehall observer notes \"kudos to No 10 for handling Trump\" so far, not reacting to his every outburst.",
      "And Brexit, ironically, helps Sir Keir the Remainer carve out a separate role to the rest of Europe.",
      "Working with Trump might be like handling a live firework. But the international jeopardy does present opportunities for the PM, as one former senior official suggests.",
      "If \"you don't have much of a compelling agenda, your social policy is looking hard, your economic policy is looking hard, you can see why he might think,  do you know, the air miles are starting to look pretty attractive\".",

      "It is the only known case of human tissue - or any organic material - turning to glass naturally.",
      "\"We believe that the very specific conditions that we have reconstructed for the vitrification [the process of something turning into glass] of the brain make it very difficult for there to be other similar remains, although it is not impossible,\" Prof Guido Giordano from Universit\u00e0 Roma Tre told BBC News.",

      "A fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter, also called a pyroclastic flow, followed, burying the area.",

      "The process of glass formation requires very specific temperature conditions and rarely occurs naturally.",
      "For a substance to turn to glass, there must be a huge temperature difference between the substance and its surrounding.",
      "Its liquid form has to cool fast enough not to crystallise when it becomes solid, and it must be at a much higher temperature than its surroundings.",
      "The team used imaging with x-rays and electron microscopy to conclude that the brain must have been heated to at least 510C before cooling rapidly.",
      "No other parts of the man's body are believed to have turned to glass.",
      "Only material containing some liquid can turn to glass, meaning that the bones could not have vitrified.",
      "Other soft tissues, like organs, were likely destroyed by the heat before they could cool down enough to turn to glass.",

    "summary": "The energy giant has announced its strategy after rivals also rowed back on green energy plans.",
    "story": [
      "BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production.",
      "The energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been lower than its rivals.",
      "BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).",
      "The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.",
      "Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".",
      "He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.",
      "He said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.",
      "Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.",
      "Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.",
      "BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.",
      "The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.",
      "BP shareholders want it to make money, not climate policy",
      "BP set to scale back green investments as profits drop sharply",
      "BP to cut 4,700 jobs to reduce costs",
      "'Science hasn't changed'",
      "Mr Auchincloss is under pressure to boost profits from some shareholders, including the influential activist group Elliot Management, which took a near \u00a34bn stake in the \u00a370bn company to push for more investment in oil and gas.",
      "In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year.",
      "However, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production.",
      "Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables.",
      "The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".",
      "Alexander Kirk from Global Witness added BP \"cannot be trusted to deliver the clean energy transition\", adding that it was \"focusing on short-term profits to shareholders while energy prices are high, with the rest of the world picking up the tab from its climate-wrecking products\".",
      "Global Witness drove a lorry around central London with messages criticising BP's decision.",
      "Sir Ian Cheshire, who has held many executive roles at companies such as B&Q owner Kingfisher and Barclays bank, questioned whether BP's latest move would work.",
      "\"I do wonder whether this sort of decision will look right in 10 years,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,\" he said.",
      "'Not just down to one company'",
      "Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.",
      "She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.",
      "According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,",
      "\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told the Scottish Affairs committee of MPs.",
      "\"It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.\"",
      "The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to \"capital-light partnerships\" in other green energy such as wind and solar.",
      "BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.",
      "Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.",
      "But in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.",
      "In the five years since former chief executive Bernard Looney first unveiled his strategy, shareholders have received total returns including dividends of 36%.",
      "In contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively.",
      "BP's under performance has prompted speculation that it may be a takeover target or may consider moving its main stock market listing to the US where oil and gas companies command higher valuations.",

      "The best chance to see as many planets as possible will be just after sunset on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.",
      "Four of the planets - Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Mars - will be visible to the naked eye. Saturn will be harder to see because it will be low in the horizon. You will need a telescope to spot the other two planets - Uranus and Neptune.",
      "A good view of the horizon and clear skies will offer the best chance of spotting them all. However, the window to see all seven planets will be very brief.",
      "Dr Edward Bloomer, astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich said: \"There's a rare opportunity to have seven planets in essentially a convenient place for you to look for them.\"",
      "As the sun sets, Saturn and Mercury will also be setting, making them particularly difficult to see.",
      "\"You really only have a few minutes after sunset to catch them before they drop below the horizon. After that, you'll still be able to see Venus, Jupiter, and Mars clearly for a much longer time,\" Dr Bloomer added.",
      "The planets in our solar system orbit the Sun within roughly the same flat plane as the Earth.",
      "As they orbit at different speeds and distances from the Sun, there are moments when they appear to line up from Earth's perspective creating a spectacular visual display, although the planets remain separated by vast distances in space.",

      "To improve your chances of seeing as many planets as possible, Dr Bloomer advises heading to a location with a clear view of the horizon and minimal light pollution.",
      "\"If you just pop out of your kitchen into your back garden, you will take time to adjust to the light levels. Give it a bit of time - your eyes take about half an hour to fully adjust,\" said Dr Bloomer.",
      "\"Avoid looking at your phone, get comfortable, and ensure you have an unobstructed view of the horizon.\"",
      "While this is an exciting opportunity, Dr Bloomer encourages people to make a habit of gazing at the night sky.",
      "\"See how things change,\" he said, adding that observing the heavens is \"a chance to witness the ongoing mechanics of the solar system at work.\"",
      "Will the skies be clear enough to see them all this week?",
      "On Wednesday night, skies will be generally cloudier with showery rain at times.",
      "By Thursday, expect a drier, clearer view of the night sky. Earlier in the evening is best, as mist and fog patches may develop further into the night.",
      "For Friday high pressure is expected to dominate, keeping dry conditions for most with clear spells. Soon after sunset is most favoured as mist and fog patches may develop later.",

    "summary": "Since a potentially hazardous asteroid was detected in December, tens of others objects have come close to Earth.",
    "story": [
      "A large asteroid known as 2024 YR4 has grabbed headlines this week as scientists first raised its chances of hitting earth, then lowered them.",
      "The latest estimate says the object has a 0.28% chance of hitting Earth in 2032, significantly lower than the 3.1% chance earlier in the week.",
      "Scientists say it is now more likely to smash into the Moon, with Nasa estimating the probability of that happening at 1%.",
      "But in the time since 2024 YR4 was first spotted through a telescope in the desert in Chile two months ago, tens of other objects have passed closer to Earth than the Moon, which in astronomical terms sounds like a near miss.",
      "It is likely that others, albeit much smaller, have hit us or burned up in the atmosphere but gone unnoticed.",
      "This is the story of the asteroids that you never hear about \u2013 the fly-bys, the near-misses and the direct hits.",
      "The vast majority are harmless. But some carry the most valuable clues for unlocking mysteries in our universe, information we are desperate to get our hands on.",
      "Asteroids, also sometimes called minor planets, are rocky pieces left over from the formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.",
      "Rocks routinely orbit close to Earth, pushed by the gravity of other planets.",
      "For most of human history, it has been impossible to know how close we have come to being struck by a large asteroid.",
      "Serious monitoring of objects near Earth only started in the late 20th century, explains Professor Mark Boslough from the University of New Mexico. \"Before that we were blissfully oblivious to them,\" he says.",
      "We now know that quite large objects - 40m across or more - pass between Earth and the Moon several times a year. That's the same size of asteroid that exploded over Siberia in 1908 injuring people and damaging buildings over 200 square miles.",
      "The most serious near-miss, and the closest comparison with YR4, was an asteroid called Apophis which was first spotted in 2004 and measured 375 meters across, or around the size of a cruise ship.",
      "Professor Patrick Michel from French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) tracked Apophis and recalls it was considered the most hazardous asteroid ever detected.",
      "It took until 2013 to get enough observations to understand that it was not going to hit Earth.",
      "But he says there was one big difference with YR4. \"We didn't know what to do. We discovered something, we determined an impact probability, and then thought, who do we call?\" he says. Scientists and governments had no idea how to respond, he says.",
      "A large asteroid strike could be catastrophic if it hits an area where humans live.",
      "We don't know exactly how big YR4 is yet, but if it is at the top end of estimates, about 90m across, it would likely remain substantially intact rather than break up as it enters the Earth's atmosphere.",
      "\"The surviving asteroid mass could create a crater. Structures in the immediate vicinity would likely be destroyed and people within the local region (dozens of kilometers) would be at risk of serious injury,\" explains Professor Kathryn Kunamoto from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Some people could die.",
      "But since Apophis, there have been huge advances in what is called planetary defence.",
      "Prof Michel is part of the international Space Mission Planning Advisory Group.",
      "Its delegates advise governments on how to respond to an asteroid threat and run rehearsal exercise for direct hits. There is one going on right now.",
      "If the asteroid was on course for a town or city, Dr Boslough compares the response to preparations made for a major hurricane, including evacuations and measures to protect infrastructure.",
      "The Space Mission Planning Advisory Group will meet again in April to decide what to do about YR4.",
      "By then most scientists expect the risk to have almost entirely gone, as their calculations of its trajectory become more precise.",
      "We do have options beyond \"taking a hit\", as Dr Kumamoto puts it.",
      "Nasa and the European Space Agency have developed technologies to nudge dangerous asteroids off course.",
      "Nasa's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) successfully slammed a spacecraft into the asteroid Dimorphos to change its path.",
      "However scientists are sceptical if that would work in the case of YR4 due to uncertainty about what it is made of and the short window of time to successfully deflect it.",
      "And what about the asteroids that do hit Earth? An awkward truth for scientists is that a direct strike on land far from humans is the ideal scenario for asteroids.",
      "That gives them actual pieces from distant objects within of our solar system, as well as insights into Earth's impact history.",
      "Nearly 50,000 asteroids have been found in Antarctica. The most famous, called ALH 84001, is believed to have originated on Mars and contains minerals with vital evidence about the planet's history, suggesting it was warm and had water on its surface billions of years ago.",
      "In 2023 scientists detected an asteroid called 33 Polyhymnia which could have an element denser than anything found on Earth.",
      "This superheavy element would be something entirely new to our planet. 33 Polyhymnia is at least 170 million kilometers away, but it's an indication of the incredible potential of asteroids for our understanding of science.",
      "Now that the chances are higher that YR4 will hit the Moon, some scientists are getting excited about that.",
      "An impact could give real-world answers to questions they have only been able to simulate using computers.",
      "\"To have even one data point of a real example would be incredibly powerful,\" says Prof Gareth Collins from Imperial College London.",
      "\"How much material comes out when the asteroid hits? How fast does it go? How far does that travel?\" he asks.",
      "It would help them test the scenarios they have modelled about asteroid impacts on Earth, helping create better predictions.",
      "YR4 has reminded us that we live on a planet vulnerable to collisions with something the solar system is full of \u2013 rocks.",
      "Scientists warn against complacency, saying it is a matter of when, not if, a large asteroid will threaten human life on Earth, although most expect that to be in the coming centuries rather than decades.",
      "In the meantime, our ability to monitor space keeps improving. Later this year the largest digital camera ever built will begin working at the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, able to capture the night sky in incredible detail.",

      "Its construction is predicted to require a workforce of 7,900 people, with about two thirds moving from outside the area, and some people in nearby Leiston have claimed \"landlords are cashing in\" by raising rents.",
      "Linda Druce, director and founder of Druce Estate & Letting Agents, said: \"I have been in the area for 21 years now and this is the first time we have seen such a significant jump, particularly in rental prices.\"",
      "Leiston, located between the more affluent coastal towns of Aldeburgh and Southwold, had traditionally been viewed as a more affordable place to live.",
      "But one sales negotiator, who did not want to be named, said family homes in the area that were normally rented for \u00a31,500 a month were now costing as much as \u00a33,000.",
      "It is a claim which was corroborated by Ms Druce.",
      "\"It is mainly because of Sizewell C contractors and those looking to be working here over the next year or two who are looking to rent,\" she said.",
      "\"The core of our clients are not likely to jump into wanting to get higher rents but we are seeing more people from out of the area who are buying buy-to-let properties.",

      "\"But that doesn't factor in the number of landlords we have who do not want to increase their rent and are actually really good.",
      "\"The problem is a lot of landlords see pound signs and then the floodgates open and so, at the moment, if I put a house up for sale in Leiston, nine times out of 10 the viewing will be with someone who wants to buy it and rent it out per room.\"",
      "Elsewhere in the town, another three-bedroom home is being advertised at a cost of \u00a33,100 a month including bills, while a two-bedroom apartment is being let at a rate of \u00a33,045 a month, including utility bills.",
      "The current cost of renting in the area has raised eyebrows, not least given the average rent in Leiston is \u00a3773, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "Sizewell C said 2,400 of the workers at the new power station will be based on site, while 500 others will live at Pontins Pakefield, near Lowestoft.",
      "The remaining contractors, however, will have to move into local properties.",
      "Alison Downes, from the campaign group Stop Sizewell C, said: \"If Sizewell C goes ahead thousands more workers from outside the area will need accommodation and if those numbers increase, like at Hinkley Point C, where they are going up to a staggering 15,000, the people of Leiston will face many years more pain.\"",
      "It is not just landlords who could capitalise on the influx of workers heading into the area.",
      "Residents in Leiston who have spare rooms or spaces can apply to East Suffolk Council for a Sizewell C Housing Grant, which range from \u00a33,000 to \u00a37,000, as the authority looks to provide an additional 1,200 bed spaces during the construction.",
      "\"[These] provide funding to help local people bring latent accommodation back into use or upgrade their spare rooms to rent for extra income at a time when the cost of living is still a real challenge for a lot of people,\" said a Sizewell C spokesperson.",
      "Despite this, the suggestion Sizewell C could be driving up prices does not sit well with tenants who currently live in the area.",
      "'Money talks'",
      "Louise Smith, 54, said it was \"unfair\" local people might no longer be able to afford to live in Leiston \"because of Sizewell\".",
      "She added: \"The rents will go up and up and up because everyone is jumping on the bandwagon and the landlords are cashing in on it.",

    "story": [
      "Four in five cars should be electric and half of homes should have heat pumps within 15 years, say the government's independent climate advisers.",
      "By law the UK must reach \"net zero\" - no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - by 2050.",
      "UK greenhouse gas emissions have more than halved since 1990, largely thanks to less electricity coming from fossil fuels and more from renewables. But the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says that to reach the 2050 target we will also need to change how we drive and heat our homes.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the government would consider the advice and respond in due course.",
      "\"We owe it to current generations to seize the opportunities for energy security and lower bills, and we owe it to future generations to tackle the existential climate crisis,\" he said.",
      "Under UK law, the CCC provides independent advice on how much the UK should emit over five-year periods, known as \"carbon budgets\", and how it might get there.",
      "Each carbon budget is a stepping stone to net zero by 2050. The latest advice is that by 2040, emissions should be 13% of their 1990 levels, for the UK to stay on track.",
      "The CCC advice is not policy, but the government has historically accepted it. If it does, the target will become legally binding, but government will still decide how to achieve it.",
      "Meeting these long-term goals will mean significant changes in the years ahead. One-third of emissions cuts between now and 2040 need to come from households making low-carbon choices, the CCC says.",
      "This will mainly be through switching from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles and from fossil fuel boilers to heat pumps, making use of growing supplies of clean electricity. Smaller contributions will come from other choices, such as eating less meat and dairy.",
      "As the graph below shows, these changes are ambitious. But they are deliverable, argues the CCC, without people having to scrap their existing boiler or car early.",
      "Other emerging technologies, like mobile phones and internet connections, have achieved similar rates of increases previously.",
      "\"For electric vehicles, the market is already pretty much at parity with internal combustion engine vehicles, so we think just naturally that will start to be a choice people make,\" Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of the CCC, told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"For heat pumps, we're saying it's different, the costs are still higher than a fossil fuel boiler and the government will need to act to help people get those technologies.",
      "\"But the rollout rate that we've looked at is similar to what happened to our neighbours in Ireland but also to much colder countries in Europe.\"",
      "Emissions cuts will be needed in other areas too, such as farming and flying, two of the hardest sectors to decarbonise.",
      "The CCC no longer directly advises against net airport expansion, which it has previously. But it warns the costs of decarbonising aviation will need to be picked up by airlines, which will probably drive up ticket prices.",
      "It says we will need to eat less meat and dairy too. In the CCC's pathway, sheep and cattle numbers fall by 27% by 2040, and the area covered by woodland rises from 13% to 16%.",
      "Cost of net zero",
      "The costs of tackling climate change have become highly politicised in recent years.",
      "The CCC estimates most of the expense will be borne by the private sector and calculates the savings from moving to more efficient technologies should outweigh costs by the early 2040s.",
      "\"We are crystal clear in this analysis, in this carbon budget, for the first time we start to see the economy making savings from this investment, and they make savings over and above what we would do if we stay dependent on fossil fuels,\" Ms Pinchbeck told BBC News.",
      "This should improve energy security and filter down to lower bills in the long term, the CCC argues, provided the government acts to make electricity cheaper.",
      "It advises removing policy costs \u2013 funding for social and environmental schemes \u2013 from electricity bills. That would cut them by about 19% based on expected 2025 prices, the CCC says, making it more cost-effective for people to switch to electric vehicles or heat pumps.",
      "These costs could instead sit on gas bills or general taxation.",
      "\"Regardless of what you think about climate change, what we are laying out today is a massive industrial revolution,\" said Ms Pinchbeck.",

    "story": [
      "BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production.",
      "The energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been lower than its rivals.",
      "BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).",
      "The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.",
      "Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".",
      "He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.",
      "He said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.",
      "Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.",
      "Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.",
      "BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.",
      "The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.",
      "BP shareholders want it to make money, not climate policy",
      "BP set to scale back green investments as profits drop sharply",
      "BP to cut 4,700 jobs to reduce costs",

      "Mr Auchincloss is under pressure to boost profits from some shareholders, including the influential activist group Elliot Management, which took a near \u00a34bn stake in the \u00a370bn company to push for more investment in oil and gas.",
      "In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year.",
      "However, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production.",
      "Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables.",
      "The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".",
      "Alexander Kirk from Global Witness added BP \"cannot be trusted to deliver the clean energy transition\", adding that it was \"focusing on short-term profits to shareholders while energy prices are high, with the rest of the world picking up the tab from its climate-wrecking products\".",
      "Global Witness drove a lorry around central London with messages criticising BP's decision.",
      "Sir Ian Cheshire, who has held many executive roles at companies such as B&Q owner Kingfisher and Barclays bank, questioned whether BP's latest move would work.",
      "\"I do wonder whether this sort of decision will look right in 10 years,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,\" he said.",
      "'Not just down to one company'",
      "Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.",
      "She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.",
      "According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,",
      "\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told the Scottish Affairs committee of MPs.",
      "\"It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.\"",
      "The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to \"capital-light partnerships\" in other green energy such as wind and solar.",
      "BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.",
      "Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.",
      "But in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.",
      "In the five years since former chief executive Bernard Looney first unveiled his strategy, shareholders have received total returns including dividends of 36%.",
      "In contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively.",
      "BP's under performance has prompted speculation that it may be a takeover target or may consider moving its main stock market listing to the US where oil and gas companies command higher valuations.",

      "The Trump Factor",
      "How Canada should respond to what many have dubbed an \"existential threat\" from US President Donald Trump has unsurprisingly dominated the agenda at both debates.",
      "Trump has said he plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian exports, with the exception of energy that would be tariffed at a lower 10% - a move that economists say would be devastating for Canada while increasing prices for Americans.",
      "He has also repeatedly proposed that the US should annex Canada, which has been met with alarm and anger from large swathes of the Canadian population.",
      "Freeland, a former top minister who served during Trump's first term, positioned herself as an experienced negotiator who has fought - and won - against the US president and his previous tariffs.",
      "But Carney warned that the Trump of today was not the Trump of the past. \"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\"",
      "Gould, the youngest candidate, suggested that Canada should \"put everything on the table\" to protect its sovereignty, and that the federal government should help businesses diversify their portfolios to depend less on the US.",
      "Baylis, meanwhile, said Canada needed to forge closer economic ties with the UK, New Zealand and Australia, saying all four were like-minded countries with shared values, culture, and government systems.",
      "How Canada can fix its economy",
      "Trump's threats are made more alarming by Canada's current economic situation.",
      "Canadians have voiced frustrations over the stubborn high cost of living.",
      "Carney - an economist by trade - promised a plan that would balance Canada's operational budget in three years and proposed that Canada rethink the way it spends its money.",
      "But he has also noted his support for key Liberal programmes, like affordable childcare and dental care.",
      "As the former finance minister, Freeland defended her track record, saying the country's finances were still \"very strong\". She added that Canada should capitalise on the surge of patriotism in the face of Trump's threats, using that momentum to support Canadian industries and promote job growth.",
      "Baylis drew on his expertise as a businessman to say that Canada should work on building its productivity.",
      "Gould, on the other hand, said the Liberal Party should be \"realistic with Canadians\" and that balancing the budget in three years was not possible without significant cuts, which she did not support. She said Canada should instead focus on \"modernising its social safety net\" to help those who are struggling.",
      "\"We are facing extreme threats from the US, so we have to be able to invest in our people and in our businesses to protect them,\" Gould said.",
      "Defeating Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre",
      "The four candidates were debating with each other but they often presented a united front against their shared opponent, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is favoured in the polls as the most likely to form Canada's next government.",
      "Liberal leadership hopefuls threw several jabs at Poilievre throughout the debate. Gould called him \"our little version of Trump here at home\" while Freeland said Poilievre was looking to \"imitate\" Trump.",
      "Carney criticised Poilievre as \"irresponsible\" and added that Canada could \"not afford\" to have him as prime minister.",
      "Poilievre, who has enjoyed a sizable lead in the polls ahead of an unpopular Trudeau, has had to pivot his pitch to Canadians since Trudeau's resignation.",
      "His message changed from criticising the sitting prime minister for leading a \"broken\" Canada to putting \"Canada First\" in the face of threats from the US. He has also shifted his focus to attacking Carney, who is favoured to win the Liberal leadership race.",
      "Poilievre is still polling ahead nationally, but some polls suggest that the lead between him and the Liberals has shrunk since Trudeau's exit.",
      "Supporting Ukraine and Nato",
      "Responding to shifting US policy on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, all four candidates affirmed their commitment to continuing Canada's support for Ukraine.",
      "All of them also backed the need for Canada to hit its 2% military spending target as set out in its commitments to the Nato alliance, though they disagreed on the timeline and how to get there.",
      "Freeland said Canada should hit the target by 2027, and should do so by investing in the \"next generation of warfare\". Baylis and Carney have said their plan would be for Canada to reach that target by 2030.",
      "Both Freeland and Carney said Canada needed to invest that money into Canadian military ventures instead of into the US.",
      "Freeland noted that Canada should reduce its reliance on the US, and should look to work with the EU and other Nato partners on security assurances.",
      "A rethink of the consumer tax on carbon",
      "A tax on carbon for consumers and businesses has been the cornerstone of the Trudeau government's policy on climate change.",
      "But that tax has proven to be unpopular with Canadians, forcing Carney and Freeland to promise that they would ditch the policy.",
      "Carney, a former UN special envoy on climate action and finance, has long been a proponent of the carbon tax. In the debates, however, he acknowledged the tax on consumers had become divisive, and said he would instead focus on taxing big polluters and growing clean energy projects in Canada.",

    "story": [
      "Amazon has become the third tech giant in as many months to announce a breakthrough in quantum computing - a technology that promises vast processing power but is beset by technical difficulties.",
      "The firm has unveiled Ocelot a prototype chip built on \"cat qubit\" technology - an approach that derives its name from the famous \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\" thought experiment.",
      "The chip seeks to address one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the development of quantum computers - making them error free.",
      "Amazon says, taken alongside other recent breakthroughs in the industry, its work means useful quantum computers are likely to be with us sooner than previously thought.",
      "But how quickly these machines will be powerful enough to be practically useful for a range of commercial applications is a matter of debate among experts.",
      "Oskar Painter of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing at the California Institute of Technology, where the work was carried out, told the BBC that recent progress meant an \"aggressive date\" of a decade was now \"looking more and more realistic\".",
      "\"Five years ago I would have said maybe 20 or 30 years\", he said but added \"this timeline's come in quite a bit.\"",
      "Ultimately AWS, which provides cloud computing services, would like to offer quantum computing services to its customers, but Mr Painter also said he believed the advanced machines could eventually help optimise the vast global logistics of Amazon's retail business.",
      "\"You know, a company like Amazon, you make a one percent improvement in that and you're talking large dollars right? Quantum computers could enable you to do that more effectively, more real time - and that's the real value there,\" he explained.",

      "Quantum computers solve problems by exploiting the strange properties of matter and energy at very small scales, as described by the science of quantum physics.",
      "Quantum computers won't replace so-called \"classical\" computers, but promise to be able to solve problems even the most powerful modern computers cannot - yielding new discoveries such as better batteries and new medicines.",
      "But that potential is being held up by the problem of errors.",
      "Quantum computers are extremely sensitive to noise in their environment - vibrations, heat, electromagnetic interference from mobile phones and WIFI networks, or even cosmic rays and radiation from outer space can all cause them to make errors, which then need to be corrected.",
      "Cat qubits are one attempt at solving this problem by engineering error resistance into the design of the qubits it uses.",
      "Qubits are the fundamental elements of quantum computers, the equivalent of bits in the computers most of us use today.",

      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",

      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",

      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",

      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",

      "In 2020, Duarte Dias, a Portuguese software engineer, accepted a job offer to work in Microsoft's Dublin subsidiary.",
      "A little over a year later, he joined a team at Microsoft's headquarters in Seattle, where he still works.",
      "Even though he misses the Portuguese laid-back approach to life, and the family-like team spirit of the work environments there, he does not regret, not for one second, his choice of pursuing an international career.",
      "Mr Dias's decision was made easier by all the financial impact of moving.",
      "The verdict of the spreadsheet was clear: staying in Portugal would be financially ruinous.",
      "\"I did simulations of how much money I would save a year in Portugal, and I quickly realised that I wouldn't be able to have a comfortable life financially, even if I got one of the most well-paying jobs available in engineering for my experience level,\" says.",
      "A two-year job experience in Portugal while Mr Dias was concluding his masters at Lisbon's Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico cemented his conviction: his yearly income amounted to \u20ac35,000 ($36,000; \u00a329,000).",
      "But his take home salary was much, much less.",
      "His income placed him in a tax bracket which meant up to 40% of this gross salary went to the state.",
      "\"Financially it was bad. It would be very hard to save money if I didn't live with my parents,\" he recalls.",
      "Moving to Ireland meant an immediate hike in his salary prospects, almost doubling to \u20ac60,000.",
      "The money is even better in the US, where he now earns upwards of $160,000 before a 20% income tax rate, much lower than at home.",
      "Mr Dias intends to return to Lisbon in two years' time with \"with many more savings\".",
      "Keeping skilled workers like Mr Dias in Portugal has been a concern for recent governments.",
      "In 2020, the administration led by the Socialist Party's Antonio Costa launched IRS Jovem, a programme of tax reductions for workers less than 30 years old and tiered by level of education.",
      "In 2022, 73,684 taxpayers benefitted from this incentive, according to official data.",
      "After a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels.",
      "The proposal, passed by the Portuguese parliament in late November, is due to benefit up to 400,000 workers, according to the Portuguese Ministry of Finance.",
      "But specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad.",
      "\"It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under \u20ac28,000,\" says S\u00e9rgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Law.",
      "He points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average worker's salary than most richer nations.",
      "Known as the tax wedge, the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker without children and the corresponding total labour cost for the employer, stands at 42.3% in Portugal.",
      "That's the 8th highest among the 38 member countries of the OECD.",
      "\"This is a tax regime that is an enemy of qualified work and professional success. This regime will not solve this problem,\" adds Mr Vasques.",
      "Mr Vasques, also a former secretary of state for tax affairs in the early 2010s, adds: \"I also cannot imagine a young professional deciding to move to Portugal just because of an extra couple hundred euros at the end of the year.",
      "\"Not even a low-skilled worker will make a decision based on that. Portuguese food works probably better as an incentive to move here than that tax regime\".",
      "Rita de La Feria, chair of tax law at the University of Leeds, reminds that the exodus of young people isn't just a Portuguese problem, and that Europe is grappling with the challenges of young emigration.",
      "According to a study requested by the Portuguese Parliament, as of July, in the European Union Portugal, Poland and Croatia had special tax regimes based on the taxpayers' ages.",
      "\"The challenges are very obvious: worker mobility is higher. The problem is that the country spends very large amounts on training for them to leave for other countries as soon as they enter the workforce,\" she said.",
      "Ms de La Feria, who moved to the UK at a young age, told the BBC that when she left Portugal she did not intend to \"leave for good: many leave their countries of origin thinking they will come back at some point. But once they form a family, it's almost impossible to return.\"",
      "Antonio Almeida, a software engineer like Mr Dias, left Portugal during the pandemic in late 2020 for a job in Berlin, right after finishing his degree. He would change the German capital for Brussels two years later. All his work experience was done abroad.",
      "\"Back in 2020, we were offered monthly salaries of \u20ac1,300, gross, in Lisbon. Berlin offered me \u20ac4,200 for a junior role.\"",
      "Even with a 40% income tax rate in Germany, there was a considerable net gain. \"It wasn't a difficult decision,\" says Mr Almeida.",
      "Now in Belgium - where taxes are higher, he stresses - returning to his homeland isn't a priority. \"I think of returning eventually, mainly for family reasons.",
      "\"But at the moment my life standards are very high and I like the way of life of central Europe. And the main problem in Portugal is low salaries, not taxes.\"",
      "Mr Almeida does not consider the Portuguese tax changes as a major factor when thinking of the pros and cons of coming back home.",
      "\"Up until today I never thought about it.\"",
      "Mr Dias agrees: \"Salaries outside Portugal will always be higher, and all those who don't have any personal or familial connections to the country won't have any kind of financial or career incentive to stay there\".",

    "story": [
      "British-American influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate - who are facing trial in Romania on charges including human trafficking - have arrived in the US after Romanian prosecutors lifted a two-year travel ban.",
      "Andrew, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, have strongly denied the allegations against them. The two departed Bucharest on a private jet early on Thursday and arrived in Florida hours later, with Andrew telling reporters they are \"misunderstood\".",
      "Romanian prosecutors stressed the case against them had not been dropped and that they remain \"under judicial control\" - meaning they have to regularly report to authorities and are expected to return to Romania.",
      "However their exit has sparked concerns that prosecutors felt political pressure from the Trump administration. The US president said he knew nothing about the Tate brothers being released from Romania.",
      "The Tate brothers are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape.",
      "In the US they also face a civil case from a woman who alleges the brothers coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities.",
      "The brothers also face separate charges in the UK of rape and human trafficking. They deny all the allegations against them.",
      "Upon arrival, Andrew Tate told reporters: \"We live in a democratic society where it's innocent until proven guilty and I think my brother and I are largely misunderstood.\"",
      "\"There's a lot of opinions about us, a lot of things that got around about us on the internet,\" he said, adding that they are \"yet to be convicted of any crime in our lives ever\".",
      "The brothers declined to answer questions about their release and Trump's role in them being allowed into the US.",
      "A lawyer for the Tate brothers, Joseph McBride, said they will return to Romania at the end of March to meet the prosecutor before returning to the US.",
      "\"They feel secure in America for several reasons, the primary one being that Donald Trump is the president. As a result, they are excited to call America their home again,\" Mr McBride said in a statement.",
      "Speaking in the White House after their plane landed, Trump said he knew nothing about the Tate brothers being released from Romania.",
      "Asked if his administration pressured the Romanian government to release them, he said: \"I know nothing about that. I don't know, you're saying he's on a plane right now?\"",
      "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who was sitting next to Trump in the White House, said: \"There's an English element here, so obviously it's important justice is done, and human trafficking is obviously, to my mind, a security risk.\"",
      "On Thursday, the brothers arrived at Fort Lauderdale in Florida around 11:00 local time (16:00 GMT) and were seen disembarking the aircraft.",
      "Their arrival follows comments made by Trump administration figures earlier this month.",
      "The Tates have regularly posted messages in support of Trump, and Tristan Tate has said his brother's role in persuading \"millions of young men\" to back him \"cannot be overlooked\".",
      "Romania's Foreign Minister has also told Romanian TV that Trump's envoy for special missions had raised the brothers during a conversation at the Munich Security Conference in Germany a fortnight ago.",
      "Emil Hurezeanu said his discussion with Richard Grenell had been informal and he did not consider the approach \"a form of pressure\". Grenell told the Financial Times his support for the brothers was evident from his \"publicly available tweets\".",
      "However, women who have brought sexual abuse allegations against the Tate brothers said last week they were \"extremely concerned\" by reports that US officials had asked Romania to relax travel restrictions for the men.",
      "Andrew Tate is a self-described misogynist who has attracted millions of followers online, despite being previously banned from social media platforms for expressing his views.",
      "He and his brother were first arrested in Romania in December 2022, with Andrew accused of rape and human trafficking and Tristan suspected of human trafficking.",
      "They both denied the charges and spent several months under house arrest. A year later, in August 2024, they faced new allegations including sex with a minor and trafficking underage persons, all of which they deny.",
      "A former kickboxer who had appeared on UK TV show Big Brother, Andrew had moved from the UK to Romania several years ago. However police in Bedfordshire are still seeking his extradition on separate and unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking, as well as tax evasion.",

      "\"We are in disbelief and feel re-traumatised by the news that the Romanian authorities have given into pressure from the Trump administration to allow Andrew Tate to travel around Europe and to the US,\" the women said in a statement.",
      "Elena Lasconi, who is running for the Romanian presidency in May's elections, six months after they were controversially cancelled, has called for the immediate resignation of the head of Romania's organised crime investigations directorate DIICOT, which made the decision to let the brothers leave.",
      "\"I am outraged!\" she wrote on social media, \"as a woman, a human being and a Romanian.\" Lasconi said prosecutors should explain publicly whether their decision had come as a result of external pressure.",
      "Prosecutors from DIICOT have emphasised that the judicial conditions for the brothers have not changed.",
      "Any violation of those obligations made in bad faith \"may lead to the replacement of judicial control with a higher measure of deprivation of liberty\", it said in a statement in Romanian.",
      "Following a successful court appeal on Wednesday, the brothers also had multiple assets returned to them which had originally been seized by authorities - including six properties, six cars, and frozen bank accounts.",
      "This comes after court limitations were \"modified in order to allow the brothers to travel to the USA,\" the statement from the Tates' representative said.",
      "The Tates are understood to be required to return to Bucharest at the end of March to satisfy the prosecutors' terms, however it is too early to say whether they will comply with them.",

Romanian intelligence services said far-right candidate Calin Georgescu had been supported by a flurry of TikTok accounts engineered by Russia.",

      "Trump had announced the plans for 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada for 4 February unless the two nations increased border security.",
      "He paused the measures for a month at the last minute after the two countries agreed to increase border funding and talk more about how to combat drug trafficking.",
      "On social media on Thursday, Trump wrote that he did not think enough action had been taken to address the flow of fentanyl to the US.",
      "\"Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,\" he wrote, adding that \"a large percentage\" of the drugs were made in China.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, at a press conference from the country's National Palace, said in response: \"As we know, [Trump] has his way of communicating.\"",
      "She added: \"I hope we can reach an agreement and on 4 March we can announce something else.\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said his country was working hard to reach a deal, warning tariffs from the US would prompt an \"immediate and extremely strong response\".",
      "Trump's threats against Mexico and Canada have raised widespread alarm, as the North American economy is closely connected after decades of operating under a free trade agreement.",
      "Leaders of the two countries have previously said they would impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States if the White House went ahead with its plans.",
      "Tariffs are a tax collected by the government and paid for by the business bringing the goods into the country.",
      "China, Mexico and Canada are America's top three trade partners, together accounting for more than 40% of imports into the US last year.",
      "Economists have warned tariffs on goods from the three countries could lead to higher prices in the US on everything from iPhones to avocados.",
      "Trump's call for an additional 10% levy on goods from China - which he said would also go into effect on Tuesday - had not been previously announced, though during his presidential campaign he backed border taxes on Chinese products of as much as 60%.",
      "Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, said his country was already working with the US to address the concerns about fentanyl, and had made \"visual progress\" in areas such as information exchange, case cooperation and online advertisement cleanup.",
      "\"Reducing domestic drug demand and strengthening law enforcement cooperation are the fundamental solutions,\" he said in a statement, which warned that Trump's tariff moves were \"bound to affect and undermine future counternarcotics cooperation between the two sides\".",
      "\"The unilateral tariffs imposed by the US will not solve its own problems, nor will it benefit the two sides or the world.\"",
      "Trump's comments, which called for drug flow to stop or be \"severely limited\", seemed to set the stage for Mexico and Canada to negotiate, said trade expert Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Washington University.",
      "On Thursday, as tariff talks intensified, two imprisoned alleged leaders of the violent Zetas cartel long sought by the US - Miguel Angel Trevino Morales and his brother Oscar - were extradited.",
      "Mexican media said they were part of a larger group of drug lords sent from Mexico to the US - a major step in terms of US-Mexico security relations.",
      "Ms McDaniel said Trump's demands of China were less clear, raising the likelihood that those measures will come into effect.",
      "Trump's initial round of tariffs on China was eclipsed by his threats against Canada and Mexico. But the potential for further duties raises questions about how businesses will respond.",
      "Ms McDaniel said she expected the hit to be felt more in China.",
      "\"It's not costless for the US, but so far it seems more costly for China,\" she said.",
      "The impact of tariffs, if they go into effect, is expected to be felt more in the Canadian and Mexican economies, which count on the US as a key export market.",
      "But analysts have warned that the threat of the levies, even if they are never imposed, is still likely to have a chilling effect on investment, including in the US.",
      "China has already responded to the first round of tariffs from the US with its own tariffs on US products, including coal and agricultural machinery.",
      "Trump has dismissed fears about damage to the American economy."

    "summary": "The report says the military \"failed in its mission to protect Israeli civilians\" during Hamas's attack.",
    "story": [
      "Israel's military has published its first official account of the mistakes that led to its failures during Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack, which triggered the Gaza war.",
      "The report concludes that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) \"failed in its mission to protect Israeli civilians\".",
      "The 19-page report contains much that is already known about what led to catastrophic loss of about 1,200 lives when approximately 5,000 gunmen from Hamas and other Palestinian groups stormed into Israel, also taking 251 hostages in the process.",
      "There are no dramatic revelations, but it is still sobering to see the military's conclusions about how it misjudged Hamas's intentions and underestimated its capabilities laid out in black and white.",
      "Six hours at hands of Hamas - new accounts reveal how Israeli base fell on 7 October",
      "They were Israel's 'eyes on the border' - their warnings went unheard",
      "How Hamas built a force to attack Israel on 7 October",
      "The report says the military regarded Gaza as a secondary security threat, with priority given to Iran and Hezbollah. Its policy towards Gaza, it says, was \"paradoxical: Hamas was illegitimate, yet there was no effort to develop an alternative\".",
      "The military had chosen a \"conflict management\" approach to dealing with Gaza, it says. And had assumed that Hamas was \"neither interested [in] nor preparing for a large-scale war\" - a perception reinforced by Hamas's own deception tactics.",
      "Evidence from 2018 onwards suggesting that Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist group by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - was indeed developing an ambitious plan was interpreted as \"unrealistic or unfeasible\", reflecting \"Hamas's long-term aspirations rather than an actionable threat\".",
      "The report says that in the months leading up to the war, the Military Intelligence Directorate began to develop a new assessment, suggesting that Hamas's plan was not merely a vision but \"a concrete framework for operational planning\".",
      "However, this emerging assessment was not brought to the attention of senior officials in military intelligence.",
      "The report identifies a broad streak of complacency within the military about Hamas's intentions and how to deal with the threat it posed.",
      "\"There was no deep discussion of the question: What if we are wrong?\" the report says.",
      "Over time, \"a significant and continuous gap between the intelligence assessments of Hamas and reality\" had developed.",
      "The report also highlights what it says was \"a decline in deep familiarity with the enemy's different worldview, including its culture, religion, language and history\".",
      "It calls for deep reform of the intelligence directorate's culture, \"fostering intellectual openness, scepticism, listening, learning, debate, and constructive disagreement\".",
      "It says the desire to protect highly valuable intelligence sources contributed to the military's failure to raise the alert level immediately before 7 October.",
      "The Gaza Division, it says, \"was effectively defeated for several hours\" on 7 October, significantly impairing its ability to understand what was going on and respond effectively.",
      "It says the Air Force responded quickly, but that \"there was significant difficulty distinguishing between IDF troops, civilians and terrorists\".",
      "The report also says that in some incidents, wounded soldiers were evacuated before civilians.",
      "After presenting the findings to commanders on Monday, the IDF's outgoing chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said he took full responsibility for the failures.",
      "\"I embrace my responsibility. It is mine. I was the commander of the army on 7 October and I have my responsibility and I have all of your responsibility. I see that as mine too. And I see that in every command of mine that went wrong, there is also a part of me,\" he said in a video.",
      "Last month, the general announced his resignation over the failures and called for a commission of inquiry to carry out a broader investigation that would help prevent another attack.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has not acknowledged any responsibility for what happened on 7 October, has said such a state inquiry should wait until the end of the war.",
      "His critics accuse Mr Netanyahu of being unwilling to admit any personal fault.",
      "Israel responded to the 7 October attack by launching an air and ground campaign in Gaza, during which at least 48,365 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 03:19:03 GMT",
    "summary": "The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.",
    "story": [
      "The Cook Islands may be small but the ambitions of its leader are mighty.",
      "A range of deals Prime Minister Mark Brown signed with China without consulting the public or New Zealand \u2013 an ally to which the Cooks is closely tied \u2013 has caused increasing irritation and concern.",
      "The agreements are the first of their kind with a country that is not a traditional ally. They cover infrastructure, ship-building, tourism, agriculture, technology, education and, perhaps crucially, deep-sea mineral exploration.",
      "Brown says his decisions will be based on the \"long-term interests\" of the Cook Islands, which are remote, resource-rich and vulnerable to climate change.",
      "Not everyone agrees with him. The new, wide-ranging deals with Beijing have led to protests on Rarotonga - the largest Cook Island - and a vote of no confidence against Brown in parliament, which he survived earlier this week. They have also worried Australia, another powerful ally.",
      "New Zealand said it was \"blindsided\" by the China deals, but Brown believes his country is independent and does not need to consult Wellington on issues he says are of no concern to them.",
      "He has, nevertheless, tried to reassure Australia and New Zealand that the deals with China don't replace their relationships. But the apparent snub comes at a time when the West's grip on the Pacific seems to be loosening.",
      "The rise of China in the Pacific isn't new. Whether it's bagging a security deal in the Solomon Islands or providing medical services in Tonga, China's presence in the region has been growing. And the US and its allies have made a consistent effort to counter that.",
      "But now there is a new dynamic at play as the Trump administration upends relationships with allies such as Ukraine and appears increasingly unpredictable.",
      "Mining the Pacific \u2013 future proofing or fool's gold?",
      "A rare behind the scenes look at the Pacific power tussle",
      "The Cook Islands has had what's known as a \"free association\" relationship with New Zealand, a former coloniser, since the 1960s - meaning Wellington helps on issues like defence and foreign affairs, and that Cook Islanders hold New Zealand citizenship.",
      "The two countries are very close. There are around 15,000 Cook Islanders living in the Pacific island nation, but as many as 100,000 live in New Zealand and Australia. Culturally, Cook Island M\u0101ori - who make up the majority of the population - are also closely related to, but distinct from, New Zealand M\u0101ori.",
      "The deals with China aren't the only sign that Brown wants to pull away from New Zealand which have caused concern. He recently abandoned a proposal to introduce a Cook Islands passport following a public outcry.",
      "\"[The relationship with NZ] connects us politically and connects us to our brothers and sisters of Aotearoa [the M\u0101ori word for New Zealand] \u2013 they left our shores to sail to Aotearoa. We need to remember that,\" said Cook Islander Jackie Tuara at a recent demonstration against Brown's deals with China.",
      "In a nation that is not used to huge displays of protest, several hundred people gathered outside parliament in Rarotonga, holding up placards that read: \"Stay connected with NZ\". Others waved their New Zealand passports.",
      "\"Let us stand in partnership with countries that have the same democratic principles as we are a democratic nation, are we not?\" Ms Tuara said. \"We don't want to see our land and our oceans sold to the highest bidder. Those resources are for us \u2013 for our children, for their future.\"",
      "But for all those who are opposed to Brown's recent moves away from New Zealand, there are plenty of Cook Islanders who back him.",
      "China specialist Philipp Ivanov, in apparent agreement with the prime minister, says that \"the Pacific island nations have their own agency, their own motivations and their own capabilities\".",
      "He believes that the recent developments in the Cook Islands are \"all part of that little great game that's going on between Australia and China and New Zealand in the Pacific. It's a whack-a-mole kind of game.\"",
      "Testing the waters",
      "While the US has long been a dominant force in security and military in the region, China has tried to strengthen its ties with the small but strategic Pacific Island nations through aid, infrastructure and security deals.",
      "In response, the likes of the US and the UK have beefed up their diplomatic presence across the region. Australia too has made it clear it will redouble its support. But it's unclear to what extent US President Donald Trump will continue his predecessor's commitments in the region to counter China - and Beijing is taking advantage of that.",
      "Last week, planes flying between New Zealand and Australia were diverted after China conducted military exercises involving live fire. Both Australia and New Zealand had been trailing the three Chinese warships that were making their way down the eastern coast of Australia in what experts say is an escalation and unexpected show of power.",
      "\"It's a pretty efficient way of testing the diplomatic response in both the Australia-China and New Zealand-China bilateral relationship, and what the US is prepared to say in defence [of its allies],\" says defence analyst Euan Graham, from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.",
      "\"It's also making the point that in the numbers game, China will always be ahead of smaller countries with smaller navies and Australia's navy is at a historic low.\"",
      "China's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, told national broadcaster ABC that Beijing's actions had been appropriate and he won't apologise for it.",
      "Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been keen to emphasise that no international laws were broken and that the drills were carried out in international waters. Indeed, many have pointed out that Australia and its allies often sail warships through the South China Sea.",
      "\"I'd see it as China wanting to capitalise on the chaotic effect that Trump is having right now,\" says Mihai Sora, director of the Pacific Islands programme at Australia's Lowy Institute. \"China is taking advantage of that moment to [say], look Australia, you are actually alone. Where is the United States in all of this?\"",
      "A balancing act",
      "Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong freely admits \"we are in a permanent state of contest in our region, that is the reality\".",
      "In speaking out about the warships last week, Australia's government was trying to reassure the public about China's intentions, while also wanting to tell Australians that it's all in hand. That is not a coincidence as Australia heads towards a federal election in the coming months.",
      "\"[Opposition leader Peter] Dutton comes from this national security and home affairs background, so the government doesn't want to give him any air to criticise Labor,\" Philipp Ivanov says. \"Being weak on China would be disastrous for them, given what's going on in the US and given our own elections.\"",
      "But it also brings into focus the dilemma this part of the world faces.",
      "\"Canberra will be contesting every single move that Beijing tries to make \u2026 and it reflects the fact that Canberra and Beijing have diverging strategic interests,\" says James Laurenceson, the director of Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney.",
      "But, he adds, they also have \"enormous commonalities\" - China is Australia's largest  trading partner - and New Zealand's - for instance.",
      "\"So you've got to be able to ride both these horses at the same time.\"",
      "It's not an easy relationship - it never has been. The bigger surprise is that of the US, a traditional ally.",
      "Although many in the Trump administration still describe China as a grave threat, US allies are unsure what to expect from the Washington-Beijing relationship.",
      "And now, as Trump threatens steel and aluminium tariffs and a withdrawal of foreign assistance, Australia feels more isolated than ever. The recent activity of China's warships in the Tasman Sea serves to highlight that isolation.",
      "\"I wouldn't think of them as military acts, so much as political acts using military hardware,\" Mr Ivanov says.",
      "\"I think the political act is to say, look, we can do this anytime we want. You can't do anything about it, and the United States is not doing anything about it, because they're busy tearing down the global system.\"",

      "China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur population and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang. Beijing denies all of the allegations.",

      "The Thai government later said it had decided to send the 40 Uyghurs back to China because it was not right that they had been held for more than a decade, but that no other third country had stepped forward offering to take them. That includes Turkey, which has given Uyghurs asylum in the past.",
      "Eight Uyghurs remain in Thailand, including five who are serving jail terms for crimes they committed while in detention.",

    "summary": "In many cases, courts criticised the police for lapses in investigation, even \"falsely implicating\" people.",
    "story": [
      "Five years after deadly religious riots engulfed India's capital Delhi, there is no legal closure in sight for the people involved.",
      "A BBC Hindi analysis has found that more than 80% of the cases related to the violence where courts gave decisions have resulted in acquittals or discharges.",
      "More than 50 people, mostly Muslims, were killed after clashes broke out between Hindus and Muslims over a controversial citizenship law in February 2020. The violence - the deadliest the city had seen in decades - stretched on for days, with hundreds of homes and shops set on fire by violent mobs.",
      "The BBC had earlier reported on incidents of police brutality and complicity during the riots. The police have denied any wrongdoing and in their investigation, alleged that the violence was \"pre-planned\" as a part of a larger conspiracy to \"threaten India's unity\" by the people who were protesting against the law.",
      "They registered 758 cases in connection with the investigation and arrested more than 2,000 people. This included 18 student leaders and activists who were arrested in a case that came to be known as the \"main conspiracy case\". They were charged under a draconian anti-terror law that makes it nearly impossible to get bail. Only six of them have been released in five years, and some like activist Umar Khalid are still in jail, waiting for a trial to begin.",
      "BBC Hindi examined the status of all the 758 cases filed in relation to the riots and analysed the 126 cases in which the Karkardooma court in Delhi had given decisions.",
      "More than 80% of these 126 cases resulted in acquittals or discharges as witnesses turned hostile, or did not support the prosecution's case. Only 20 of these cases saw convictions.",
      "Under Indian law, an accused is discharged when a court closes a case without a trial because there isn't sufficient evidence to go ahead. An acquittal is when the court finds the accused not guilty after a full trial.",
      "In 62 of the 758 cases that were filed on charges related to murder, there was only one conviction and four acquittals, data accessed by the BBC through India's Right to Information law shows.",
      "A detailed analysis of the 126 orders also showed that in dozens of cases, the court came down heavily on the Delhi police for lapses in investigations. In some cases, it criticised the police for filing \"predetermined chargesheets\" that \"falsely implicated\" the accused.",
      "In most of the 126 cases, police officials were presented as witnesses to the events. But for various reasons, the court did not find their testimonies credible.",
      "Judges have pointed out inconsistencies in the police statements, delays in identification of the accused by the police and, in some instances, cast doubts over whether policemen were even present when the violence broke out.",
      "In two orders, the judge said that he could not \"restrain\" himself from saying that when history looked back at the riots, the \"failure of the investigating agency to conduct a proper investigation\" would \"torment the sentinels of democracy\". The court was hearing cases filed against three men on charges of arson and looting - but concluded they had been arrested without any \"real or effective investigation\".",
      "The Delhi police did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. In a report filed last April, the police had told the court that all investigations were carried out in a \"credible, fair and impartial\" way.",
      "Testimonies from some of the accused and even the court's own observations, however, raise questions about the investigation.",
      "Shadab Alam, who spent 80 days in jail, says he can never forget the terror of the riots.",
      "He had taken shelter on the rooftop terrace of a medicine store where he worked with a few others.",
      "Just hours earlier, the police had arrived at the shop and asked them to shut it because of ongoing arson.",
      "\"Suddenly, they [the police] came again and took a few of us into their van,\" he told the BBC.",
      "When he asked the police why he was being taken, he said, they accused him of participating in rioting.",
      "\"They asked us our names and beat us up. Almost all of us arrested were Muslims,\" Mr Alam said. He added that he submitted his medical report before the court that confirmed three injuries.",
      "In its official report, the police charged Mr Alam and 10 other Muslims of burning down a shop. But the court discharged all of them even before the trial could begin.",
      "In its observations, the court criticised the police investigation saying that the witness's statements could have been \"artificially prepared\", and that \"in all probabilities\" the shop was burnt by a \"mob of persons from the Hindu community\".",
      "It said the police did not pursue the case in that direction, despite being present when the incident happened.",
      "Mr Alam had to wait four years for the case to be officially closed.",
      "\"All this happened during Covid-19 pandemic. There was a lockdown. We were in a state of frenzy,\" said Dilshad Ali, Alam's father.",
      "\"In the end, nothing was proved. But we had to spend so much time and money to prove our innocence.\"",
      "He said the family wanted monetary compensation for their losses. \"If the police made a false case against my son, then action should be taken against them,\" he added.",
      "In another case, the court acquitted Sandip Bhati, who was accused of dragging and beating a Muslim man during the riots.",
      "The police had submitted two videos to show Mr Bhati was the culprit. But in court, his lawyer said that the police had submitted an incomplete clip to frame his client.",
      "In the full video, which the BBC has verified, Mr Bhati is seen saving the Muslim man instead of beating him up.",
      "In its order in January, the court ruled that the police \"manipulated\" the video to \"frame\" Mr Bhati instead of tracing the \"actual culprits\".",

      "Such faults are detected by testing electricity and signal strength transmitted through cables.",
      "\"There may be 3,000 volts in a cable and suddenly it drops to 50 volts, this means there's a problem,\" explains Loic Wallerand, the ship's chief of mission.",
      "There are local teams with the capacity to deal with faults in shallow waters, but if they are detected beyond a depth of 50m (164ft), the ship is called into action. Its crew can fix cables deeper than 5,000m below sea level.",
      "The repair witnessed by the BBC off Ghana took over a week to deal with, but most internet users did not notice as traffic was redirected to another cable.",
      "The nature of every repair depends on the part of the cable that is damaged.",
      "If the fibreglass at the core breaks, it means the data cannot travel along the network and needs to be sent to another cable.",
      "But some African countries have only one cable serving them. This means a cable damaged this way leaves the affected area without the internet.",
      "At other times, the protective layers of the fibre could be damaged, meaning data transmission still occurs, but with a lower efficiency. In both cases, the crew must find the exact location of the damage.",
      "In the case of broken fibreglass, a light signal is sent through the cable and through its point of reflection, the crew can determine where the break is.",
      "When the problem is with the cable's insulation - known as a \"shunt fault\" - it becomes more complicated and an electrical signal has to be sent along the cable to physically track where it is lost.",
      "After narrowing down the possible area for the fault, the operation moves to the ROV team.",
      "Built like a bulldozer, the ROV, weighing 9.5 tonnes, is lowered under water from the ship where it is guided down to the ocean floor.",
      "About five crew members work with a crane operator to deploy it - once it is released from its harness, called the umbilical cord, it floats gracefully.",
      "\"It doesn't sink,\" says Mr Heald, explaining how it uses four horizontal and vertical thrusters to move in any direction.",
      "The ROV's three cameras allow the team onboard to look for the precise location of faults as it moves to the ocean bed.",
      "Once found, the ROV cuts the affected part using its two arms, then ties it to a rope that is dragged back to the ship.",
      "Here the faulty section is isolated and replaced by splicing and joining it to a new cable - a process that looks like welding and which took 24 hours in the case of the operation witnessed by the BBC.",
      "Afterwards the cable was carefully lowered back to the ocean bed and then the ROV made one final journey to inspect that it was well placed and take coordinates so maps could be updated.",
      "When an alert is received about a damaged cable, the L\u00e9on Th\u00e9venin crew is ready to sail within 24 hours. However, their response time depends on several factors: the ship's location, the availability of spare cables and bureaucratic challenges.",
      "\"Permits can take weeks. Sometimes we sail to the affected country and wait offshore until the paperwork is sorted,\" Mr Wallerand says.",
      "On the average, the crew spends more than six months at sea every year.",
      "\"It's part of the job,\" says Captain Thomas Quehec.",
      "But talking to the crew members between tasks, it is hard to ignore their personal sacrifices.",
      "They are drawn from different backgrounds and nationalities: French, South African, Filipino, Malagasy and more.",
      "Adrian Morgan, the ship's chief steward from South Africa, has missed five consecutive wedding anniversaries.",
      "\"I wanted to quit. It was difficult to stay away from my family, but my wife encouraged me. I do it for them,\" he says.",
      "Another South African, maintenance fitter Noel Goeieman, is worried he may miss his son's wedding in a few weeks if the ship is called out to another mission.",
      "\"I've heard we might go to Durban [in South Africa]. My son is going to be very sad because he doesn't have a mum,\" says Mr Goeieman, who lost his wife three years ago.",
      "\"But I'm retiring in six months,\" he adds with a smile.",
      "Despite the emotional toll, there is camaraderie onboard.",
      "When off-duty, crew members are either playing video games in the lounge or sharing meals in the ship's mess hall.",
      "Their entry into the profession is as diverse as their background.",
      "While Mr Goeieman followed his father's footsteps, chief cook, South African Remario Smith, went to sea to escape a life of crime.",
      "\"I was involved in gangs when I was younger,\" Mr Smith says, \"My child was born when I turned 25, and I knew I had to change my life.\"",
      "Like the others onboard he is appreciative of the role the ship plays on the continent.",

      "Mr Ishihara wasn't giving away too much ahead of the event but says the company's long-term goal is to \"enrich both the real world and the virtual world\".",
      "Pok\u00e9mon GO - the company's successful mobile phone app that works with a device's GPS to place monsters in the real world - is an example of this.",
      "\"This is what I think is the biggest strength of Pok\u00e9mon, and it's important for us to come up with this kind of idea,\" he says.",

      "Gaming companies have long had an issue with the second-hand market, and Mr Ishihara says it \"prevents new products from being sold\".",
      "\"When the second hand market becomes more valuable because of rarity, that is problematic because our business is affected.\"",
      "Fans have suggested The Pok\u00e9mon Company could produce a greater volume of hard-to-find or limited-run items but Mr Ishihara says it cannot do much to control the resale market.",
      "\"Those items are seen to be valuable because they're rare or seen as vintage \u2013 and it's not our place to say that they're not,\" he says.",
      "On the topic of counterfeit products Mr Ishihara is more direct, and says the company's legal teams have fought \"rigorously\" against clones and fakes since the beginning.",
      "It recently won a long legal battle against the Chinese company behind a copycat mobile app.",

      "Israeli TV channels carried a live feed of the scenes and - after a private burial - the public eulogies by relatives, with crowds gathering to watch on large screens in Tel Aviv's Hostages' Square.",
      "\"This trio settled in my heart, and I believe in all of our hearts,\" a woman called Neta told Channel 12. She said she had come from the north to pay her final respects to the Bibas family at the procession.",
      "\"I set out this morning at 04:30. I saw that I couldn't fall asleep, so I headed south. I wanted to come here to be as close as possible to the Gaza border communities, to be part of this farewell.\"",
      "Kfir, aged nine months, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, was the youngest of the 251 hostages snatched in the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attacks. His brother, Ariel, was just four.",

      "There was deep anguish in Israel at the sight of Yarden Bibas, Shiri's husband, being released by Hamas at the start of this month without his immediate family.",

      "The Bibas boys were dead, their identities confirmed by DNA tests. The Israeli military spokesman said pathological exams and intelligence showed they had been murdered by their captors \"with their bare hands\".",
      "In addition, the remains of Shiri Bibas were not found in the coffin labelled with her name that had been handed to the International Committee of the Red Cross.",
      "This was said to contain the remains of a Palestinian woman from Gaza instead.  Hamas suggested that there may have been a mix up in the aftermath of the Israeli bombardment.",
      "Two days later, the Bibas family announced that Shiri's body had been returned to Israel and that she too had been murdered in captivity.",
      "The upsetting confusion over the bodies, along with the grim handover ceremony for the dead hostages staged by Hamas, were among what Israel said were truce violations, leading it to postpone the agreed release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners last Saturday.",
      "Hamas responded that this was a \"serious violation\" by Israel which threw the ceasefire process into a new crisis.",
      "Hours before the funeral, Israeli and Hamas officials said the crisis had been resolved by mediators, with the bodies of another four Israeli hostages now expected to be returned later on Wednesday or on Thursday at the same time as the Palestinian prisoners are freed.",
      "However, the fallout triggered fresh anxiety for the relatives of some 60 remaining hostages who remain unsure if their loved ones - or their bodies - will ever be returned from Gaza.",
      "A pledge by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to avenge the Bibas family's deaths only increased their relatives' worries.",
      "The family have criticised the Israeli media and Netanyahu for ignoring their wishes not to release more details of the circumstances of their loved ones' deaths.",
      "In a Facebook post on the eve of the funeral, Ofri Bibas Levy, the sister of Yarden Bibas, told the prime minister to \"shut up\" after he repeatedly described the murders. She said publication of the information was \"outright abuse of a family that has gone through 16 months of hell and still has the worst ahead\".",
      "The Bibas funeral came a day after that of Oded Lifshitz, who was also from Nir Oz and was 83 when he was abducted. His body was also returned last week. Netanyahu has said he was murdered in captivity by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.",
      "Shiri Bibas and her children were buried in a single casket next to the final resting place of her parents, Yossi and Margit Silberman, who lived in the same kibbutz and were killed there on 7 October.",
      "In total, some 1,200 people were killed on Israel's deadliest ever day. It ignited the deadliest ever war in Gaza, in which more than 48,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "At the funeral, Ofri Bibas Levy called on Israeli officials seeking forgiveness for their failure to protect Shiri, Ariel and Kfir that day to instead hold themselves accountable.",

    "summary": "His comments came as shareholders rejected a call for the firm to consider ending its diversity practices.",
    "story": [
      "Apple boss Tim Cook has said his company may have to change its diversity practices as the US legal landscape shifts.",
      "His comments came just minutes after a majority of shareholders rejected a proposal calling on the tech giant to consider ending its diversity policies, such as the use of race and sex in hiring decisions.",
      "Apple had urged shareholders to vote against the measure, which the company had argued was  \"inappropriately\" trying \"to micromanage\" its business.",
      "The scrutiny of the firm comes as US President Donald Trump has called for an end to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the government and private sector, including at Apple.",
      "In a social media post the day after the meeting, Trump ramped up the pressure on the company.",
      "\"Apple should get rid of DEI rules, not just make adjustments to them,\" he wrote in a all-capital-letters post. \"DEI was a hoax that has been very bad for our country. DEI is gone!!!\"",
      "Trump's DEI orders have run into legal roadblocks, but many companies in the US, including big names such as Meta, Amazon and Goldman Sachs, have already ended or rolled back their own policies, citing legal risks.",
      "Apple's decision to fight the shareholder proposal had bucked that tide.",
      "Shareholder measures opposed by companies rarely succeed, so the outcome of Tuesday's vote was expected.",
      "It marked the second high-profile defeat of shareholder proposal targeting DEI, after a similar rejection at retailer Costco.",
      "However, despite the vote, Mr Cook on Tuesday acknowledged that the firm may have to alter some of its practices.",
      "\"As the legal landscape around this issue evolves, we may need to make some changes to comply, but our north star of dignity and respect for everyone and our work to that end will never waver,\" Mr Cook said during a question-and-answer session at the company's annual shareholder meeting.",
      "He noted that Apple did not use \"quotas\" for hiring - a practice that has come in for some of the fiercest criticism - while saying the firm's strength came from a culture where \"people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives come together\".",
      "\"We'll continue to work together to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work,\" he added, saying the company would remain \"committed to the values that have always made us who we are\".",
      "The proposal targeting Apple's DEI policies was backed by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, which had also put forward the proposal at Costco.",
      "It argued that the existence of Apple's diversity and inclusion programmes exposed the firm to \"litigation, reputational and financial risks\", pointing to the wider corporate retreat and noting that recent lawsuits have made it easier for workers to sue over discrimination.",
      "Stefan Padfield of the organisation's Free Enterprise Project, who presented the proposal at Tuesday's meeting, said the risks to Apple had increased after the Trump administration recently ordered staff to investigate DEI in the private sector.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear,\" he said. \"DEI is out and merit is in.\"",
      "Apple's decision to push back against the shareholder proposal, while simultaneously opening the door to changing its policy is an effort to satisfy both sides of the fight, said Angela Jackson, a senior advisor to the Project on Workforce at Harvard University and author of the forthcoming book, The Win-Win Workplace.",
      "But she warned that it left Apple \"playing defence\". She said she wanted to see the company lead by making a more robust business case for the programmes.",
      "\"They've made the right moves. The one step they could go further... is to really say, 'Yes it's our values, we believe it's the right thing to do, but it's also an economic imperative.\"",
      "The fight over DEI in the US has raised questions about whether such policies in other countries will face similar challenges.",
      "Catherine Howarth, chief executive of the responsible investment charity ShareAction, said she thought that Apple - a global, consumer-facing firm - had made the bet that the benefits of pushing back against the shareholder proposal outweighed the risks.",
      "\"It's not popular with consumers and it's not popular with employees to abandon what were supposedly your principles in this area until very recently,\" she said.",
      "\"They think it would go down very badly - and it would - with their global consumer base.\"",
      "Shareholders also rejected proposals that would have required Apple to report about its AI privacy practices, charitable giving and policies to combat child sex abuse.",
      "They backed the board members supported by the company, as well as its executive compensation, including a pay package for Mr Cook worth more than $74m."

      "A one-year prison sentence and a six-year ban on holding public office might seem like a heavy penalty for a politician.",
      "But the Bosnian-Serb leader Milorad Dodik made light of the verdict at the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina.",
      "The president of the country's majority-Serb Republika Srpska region told supporters at a rally in the regional capital Banja Luka there was \"no reason to worry\".",
      "His conviction on charges of ignoring the rulings of the international High Representative was \"nonsense\", he said.",
      "Dodik said he had \"learned to deal with more difficult things\" and called on the crowd in Republika Srpska's de facto capital to \"be cheerful\".",
      "The verdict was the culmination of a long-running conflict between Dodik and the international High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Christian Schmidt.",
      "Schmidt is still the supreme authority in Bosnia, 30 years on from the Dayton Agreement which ended the Bosnian War of the 1990s.",
      "The high representative has the power to impose or annul laws \u2013 and sack officials ranging from judges to political leaders.",
      "One former holder of the post, Paddy Ashdown, the former leader of the UK's Liberal Democrats, sacked almost 60 Bosnian-Serb officials in a single day in 2004, in a crackdown on their protection of war criminals.",
      "But the high representative's powers have been used much more sparingly in subsequent years, as Bosnia's international supporters stepped back in the hope that local leaders would work together to create a viable and prosperous country.",
      "The strategy has not been a success. Ethno-nationalist leaders remain entrenched in a country which is divided into two \"entities\" \u2013 the majority-Serb Republika Srpska and the Federation, where the population are mostly Bosniaks and Croats.",
      "The central government is weak \u2013 and there is little incentive for parties to cooperate. Instead, their guiding philosophy is simple and self-interested: divide, rule and profit.",
      "As a result, the country is struggling with low wages, a sluggish economy and a constant flow of emigration by talented people seeking a better future elsewhere.",
      "\"Bosnians of all ethnicities are united by their disdain for their own leaders,\" says Toby Vogel, co-founder of the Democratisation Policy Council think tank.",
      "\"They would love not to vote for these guys, but it's structurally almost impossible for cross-community politicians and parties to emerge.\"",
      "Instead, leaders like Dodik get elected, time after time. The leader of the SNSD party has previously served as the Serb representative of the three-person national presidency and first became prime minister of Republika Srpska in 1998.",
      "A constant theme of his leadership has been the threat to trigger the secession of the majority-Serb region.",
      "Dodik and his government have consistently worked to undermine Bosnia's national institutions, introducing a series of laws to withdraw Republika Srpska from the armed forces, judiciary and tax system.",
      "Such efforts eventually pushed the high representative to take action and annul the secessionist legislation.",
      "Christian Schmidt warned that a renewal of conflict was possible, but insisted that he would \"not sit still while others seek to dismantle [decades] of peace, stability and progress\".",
      "Dodik apparently viewed that as a challenge. He approved a law declaring that Republika Srpska would no longer recognise Schmidt's rulings. The high representative had already annulled the legislation \u2013 and made it a criminal offence to contradict his decisions.",
      "That led to the prosecution of the Bosnian-Serb leader \u2013 with prosecutors calling for a maximum five-year prison sentence and 10-year ban from holding elected office. Dodik warned he would take \"radical measures\" if found guilty.",
      "His conviction has not brought any fireworks so far. At this point, Dodik is insisting that he will not appeal. Instead, Republika Srpska's government is once again proposing legislation to withdraw from national institutions \u2013 including the court which passed the guilty verdict.",
      "But Dodik is facing problems beyond Bosnia's borders. The US and UK have imposed sanctions on him and his family for corruption - threatening the unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina - and connections with Russia.",
      "Toby Vogel believes that is more likely to threaten the Bosnian-Serb leader than the court conviction.",
      "\"The conflict with the high representative will intensify,\" he says. \"But Dodik might well be running out of road.\"",
      "\"He is running out of cash to pay his bloated administration\u2026 and he can no longer raise money on international markets. So, he is in very deep trouble indeed.\"",
      "None of this will be much comfort to the long-suffering people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. They are still enduring the interminable wait for the prosperity promised by ethno-nationalists like Dodik. This latest court battle shows how distant that prospect remains."

That basically means India's wealthy population is not really growing in numbers, even though those who are already rich are getting even wealthier.",

      "The report's findings bolster the long-held view that India's post-pandemic recovery has been K-shaped - where the rich have got richer, while the poor have lost purchasing power.",
      "In fact, this has been a long-term structural trend that began even before the pandemic. India has been getting increasingly more unequal, with the top 10% of Indians now holding 57.7% of national income compared with 34% in 1990. The bottom half have seen their share of national income fall from 22.2% to 15%.",

      "The country's central bank has also cracked down on easy unsecured lending that propped up demand after the Covid pandemic.",
      "Much of the consumption spending of the \"emerging\" or \"aspirant\" class of Indians was led by such borrowing and \"turning off that tap will definitely have some impact on consumption\", says Pai.",
      "In the short run, two things are expected to help boost spending - a pick-up in rural demand on the back of a record harvest and a $12 billion tax give-away in the recently concluded budget.

      "Andrew Tate, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, are dual US-UK citizens who claim to have made millions from their social media empire.",
      "Their online output was controversial even before their legal troubles, with the pair attracting frequent criticism over offensive statements about women.",

      "The brothers had been under a travel ban in Romania for more than two years while they were under investigation.",
      "Speculation that they would leave Romania had been mounting ahead of their journey, after the pair went quiet on social media.",
      "They left from a Bucharest airport at around 03:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on a private jet bound for Florida, sources have told the BBC.",
      "Prosecutors said the travel ban had been lifted, and the pair's US passports had been returned to them, but investigations into their alleged crimes have not been dropped and they are expected to return to Romania.",

      "A separate, civil case has been opened against the Tates in the US.",
      "Separately, lawyers for four women who claim they were assaulted by Andrew Tate said they were bringing a civil case at the High Court in the UK for \"damages for injuries they suffered as a result\".",
      "A representative for the Tate brothers said in response that they \"unequivocally deny all allegations\".",

      "Some of their assets \"remain under precautionary seizure\", the spokesperson said, but described the ruling as a \"significant step toward justice.\"",
      "What have Tate's alleged victims said?",
      "Four women who allege they were sexually abused by Andrew Tate have said they are in \"disbelief and feel re-traumatised\" by news of him leaving Romania.",
      "In a joint statement, the four said: \"It is clear that he will now not face criminal prosecution for his alleged crimes in Romania; he will use it as an opportunity to harass further and intimidate witnesses and his accusers, and he will continue to spread his violent, misogynistic doctrine around the world.\"",
      "They also urged British authorities to \"finally take action, do something about this terrifying unfolding situation and ensure he faces justice in the UK\".",
      "Matthew Jury, a lawyer representing the four alleged victims, told the BBC the Trump administration was \"interfering in due process\" in Romania and the UK.",

      "In a crowded control centre, surrounded by dozens of TV screens, the Taliban's police force proudly shows off its newly-acquired network of 90,000 CCTV cameras  - used to watch over the day-to-day lives of millions of people.",
      "\"We monitor the entire city of Kabul from here,\" says Khalid Zadran, a spokesperson for the Taliban police chief, pointing to one of the screens.",
      "The authorities say such surveillance will help fight crime, but critics fear it will be used to clamp down on dissent and to monitor the strict morality code enforced by the Islamist Taliban government under their interpretation of Sharia law.",
      "The BBC are the first international journalists allowed to see the system in action.",
      "Inside the control room, police officers sit in rows watching the live streams from thousands of cameras, keeping tabs on the lives of the six million people who live in Kabul.",
      "From car licence plates to facial expressions, everything is monitored.",
      "\"In certain neighbourhoods, when we notice groups of people and suspect they might be involved in drug use, criminal activities, or something suspicious, we quickly reach out to the local police,\" says Zadran.",
      "\"They arrive swiftly to investigate the nature of the gathering.\"",
      "Under the previous government, Kabul was threatened daily with attacks from the Taliban and so-called Islamic State militants, as well as high profile kidnappings and car-jackings. When the Taliban retook power in 2021, they promised to crack down on crime.",
      "The dramatic increase in the number of surveillance cameras in the capital is a sign of growing sophistication in the way the Taliban enforce law and order. Before their return, just 850 cameras were in place in the capital, according to a spokesman for the security forces that were driven from power.",
      "However, in the past three years, the Taliban authorities have also introduced a range of draconian measures limiting people's rights and freedoms, especially those of women. The Taliban government has not been formally recognised by any other country.",
      "The surveillance system the BBC is shown in Kabul features the option to track people by facial recognition. On the corner of one screen images pop up with each face categorised by age range, gender, and whether or not they have a beard or a face mask.",
      "\"On clear days, we can zoom in on individuals [who are] kilometres away,\" says Zadran, highlighting a camera positioned up high that focuses on a busy traffic junction.",
      "The Taliban even monitor their own personnel. At a checkpoint, as soldiers popped open the trunk of a car for inspection, the operators focused their lenses, zooming in to scrutinise the contents within.",
      "The interior ministry says the cameras have \"significantly contributed to enhancing safety, curbing crime rates, and swiftly apprehending offenders\". It adds the introduction of CCTV and motorcycle controls have led to a 30% decrease in crime rates between 2023 and 2024 but it is not possible to independently verify these figures.",
      "However, rights groups are concerned about who is being monitored and for how long.",
      "Amnesty International say installing cameras \"under the guise of 'national security' sets a template for the Taliban to continue their draconian policies that violate fundamental rights of people in Afghanistan - especially women in public spaces\".",
      "By law women are not allowed to be heard outside their houses, although in practice this is not being strictly enforced. Teenage girls are prevented from accessing secondary and higher education. Women are barred from many forms of employment. In December, women training as midwives and nurses told the BBC they had been ordered not to return to classes.",
      "While women continue to be visible on the streets of cities like Kabul, they are required to wear a face covering.",
      "Fariba*, a young graduate who lives with her parents in Kabul, has been unable to find work since the Taliban came to power. She tells the BBC there is \"significant concern that surveillance cameras may be used to monitor women's hijabs [veils]\".",
      "The Taliban say only the city police have access to the CCTV system and the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice Ministry \u2013 the Taliban's morality police - does not use it.",
      "But Fariba is concerned the cameras will further endanger those opposed to Taliban rule.",
      "\"Many individuals, especially ex-military members, human rights advocates and protesting women, struggle to move freely and often live in secrecy,\" she says.",
      "\"There is significant concern that surveillance cameras will be used to monitor women's hijabs too,\" she says.",
      "Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, says Afghanistan does not have the data protection laws in place to regulate how the collected CCTV footage is held and used.",
      "The police say the data is kept only for three months, while, according to the interior ministry, the cameras do not pose a threat to privacy as they \"are operated from a special and completely confidential room by a specific and professional person in charge\".",
      "The cameras appear to be Chinese-made. The control room monitors and branding on the feeds the BBC saw carried the name Dahua, a Chinese government-linked company. Earlier reports that the Taliban were in talks with China's Huawei Technologies to buy cameras were denied by the company. Taliban officials refused to answer BBC questions about where they sourced the equipment.",
      "Some of the cost of installing the new network is falling on ordinary Afghans who are being monitored by the system.",
      "In a house in central Kabul the BBC spoke to Shella*, who was asked to pay for some of the cameras installed on the streets near her home.",
      "\"They demanded thousands of afghanis from every household,\" she says. It's a large amount in a country where those women who have jobs may earn only around 5,000 afghanis ($68; \u00a354) a month.",
      "The humanitarian situation in Kabul, and in Afghanistan in general, remains precarious after years of war. The country's economy is in crisis, but international aid funding has been largely stopped since the Taliban came back to power.",
      "According to the United Nations, 30 million people are in need of aid.",

      "But many of them are now stranded in Myanmar in makeshift camps because the process of assessing them and arranging flights back to their own countries is so slow.",
      "The armed militia groups who are holding them have a very limited capacity to support so many people \u2013 more than 7,000. One of them has said they have stopped freeing people from the compounds because they are not being moved to Thailand fast enough.",
      "The BBC understands that conditions in the camps are unsanitary, food barely sufficient, and many of the freed workers, like Mike, are in poor health. He is suffering from panic attacks, after working for a year in a scam centre where he was routinely beaten.",

      "\"It was the worst experience of my life. Of course I was beaten. But believe me I have seen a lot worse done to other people.\"",
      "Mike is one of an estimated 100,000 people who are believed to have been lured to work in the scam operations along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of them run by Chinese fraud and gambling operatives who have taken advantage of the lawlessness in this part of Myanmar.",
      "Despite horrifying accounts of abuse from those who escaped in the past, thousands still come from parts of the world where good jobs are scarce, enticed by promises of good money.",
      "China, where many of the scam victims come from, has acted to shut down scam operations along its own border with Myanmar, but until this year neither China nor Thailand had done much about the Thai-Myanmar border.",
      "Ariyan, a young man from Bangladesh, has come back to Thailand to try to help 17 friends who are still there. He said he made a promise to himself to do this after his own gruelling escape from one of the most notorious scam centres last October.",
      "He showed us a brief, shaky video of the compound, still under construction in a remote, forested valley, where he was held, and remembers the terrible treatment he and his friends suffered at the hands of their Chinese boss.",
      "\"They gave us a target every week, $5,000. If not, they gave us two electric shocks. Or they put us in a dark room, with no windows. But if we earned a lot of money, they were very happy with us.\"",
      "Ariyan had to approach men in the Middle East and lure them into transferring funds to fictitious investments. Using AI, the scammers made him appear on the screen to be an attractive young woman, altering his voice as well.",
      "He says he hated doing it. He remembers one man who was willing to sell his wife's jewellery to fund the fraudulent investment, and wishing he could warn him. But he said the bosses monitored all their calls.",
      "The release of the scam workers started more than two weeks ago after Thailand, under pressure from China and some of its own politicians, cut power and telecommunications links to the compounds on the border.",
      "It limited banking access to the scam bosses and issued arrest warrants for some of the militia leaders who had been protecting the business.",
      "That hit the business, but it also hit the ordinary Karen people who live nearby even harder, putting pressure on the militia commanders to show willingness in ending the abuses in the scam centres. They began helping those trying to escape, and completely evacuating some compounds.",
      "The camp Mike is housed in is now being guarded by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, a breakaway insurgent faction of the ethnic Karen community.",
      "Until recently, it was protecting the many scam compounds which have sprung up in its territory. You can see them easily as you drive along the Moei River which divides the two countries - unlikely expanses of new buildings over in war-torn Karen State contrasting with the rural landscape on the Thai side of the border.",
      "Thailand insists it is moving as fast as it can to process the former scam workers and get them home.",
      "A group of 260 freed workers were brought over the Moei River on a raft earlier this month. And around 621 Chinese nationals were flown straight back to China with a police escort on chartered planes. Otherwise, the movement of freed workers to Thailand seems to have stalled.",
      "The problem is that they are from many different countries, some of which are doing little to help get their people home. Around 130 of the first 260 who came over are from Ethiopia, which does not have an embassy in Bangkok.",
      "The BBC has been told that some other African countries will only fly their people home if someone else pays. Most of the freed workers have nothing; even their passports were withheld by the compound bosses.",
      "Thailand fears bringing over thousands of people it will then have to look after indefinitely. It also wants to screen them to find out which are genuine victims of human trafficking and which may have committed criminal acts, but does not have the capacity to do this with such a large group of people.",
      "Different ministries and agencies, including the army, are involved in managing this problem, and have to agree who does what. It does not help that several senior police and immigration officers have been transferred over their alleged involvement in the scam business.",
      "\"If this issue is not resolved, then we will not stop working on it \u2013 we must work seriously,\" said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday in Bangkok. But she was referring to the wider problem of the scam business, not the growing humanitarian crisis among the freed workers.",
      "\"Unfortunately, it seems we're in a bit of a standstill,\" says Judah Tana, an Australian who runs an NGO which has for years been helping the victims of trafficking in the scam centres.",
      "\"We are hearing distressing information about the lack of sanitation and toilets. Many of the 260 who already came were screened for TB and tested positive. We are hearing from those who are still inside that people are coughing up blood. They are very happy that they have been liberated from the scam compounds, but our worry is that we're not engaging fast enough.\"",

    "summary": "A Ukrainian official says Kyiv has agreed to the terms of a deal which would give the US access to mineral deposits.",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet US President Trump in Washington on Friday to sign an agreement that would give the US access to its deposits of rare earth minerals.",
      "Zelensky said he hoped the \"preliminary\" agreement with the US \"will lead to further deals\", but confirmed no American security guarantees have been agreed yet.",
      "Trump said a deal would help American taxpayers \"get their money back\" for aid sent to Ukraine throughout the war but said the responsibility of Kyiv's security should fall to Europe.",
      "What are the terms of the deal?",
      "Key details have not yet been made public, but on Wednesday Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine and the US had finalised a version of the agreement.",
      "Speaking to Ukrainian TV, Shmyhal said the preliminary agreement envisages that an \"investment fund\" would be set up for Ukraine's reconstruction.",
      "Kyiv and Washington would manage the fund on \"equal terms\", the prime minister added.",
      "He said Ukraine would contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas to the fund, and the fund would then invest in projects in Ukraine itself.",
      "Zelensky has acknowledged the fund but told the BBC on Wednesday it was \"too early to talk about money\".",
      "The New York Times reported, citing a draft document, that the US would own the maximum amount of the fund allowed under US law, but not necessarily all of it.",
      "Disagreement over the terms of a minerals deal formed part of what was seen as a deepening rift between Trump and Zelensky in recent weeks.",
      "The Ukrainian president had rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (\u00a3395bn) in mineral wealth, but media reports say this demand has now been dropped.",
      "\"The provisions of the deal are much better for Ukraine now,\" a source in Ukraine's government told the BBC.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump said the US had given Ukraine between $300bn (\u00a3237bn) and $350bn (\u00a3276bn) in aid, and that he wanted to \"get that money back\" through a deal.",
      "But German think tank the Kiel Institute estimates the US has sent $119bn in aid to Ukraine.",
      "Does the deal include a security guarantee?",
      "Zelensky has been pushing for a deal to include a firm security guarantee from the US.",
      "But on Wednesday, Ukraine's leader said no such guarantee had been made.",
      "\"I wanted to have a sentence on security guarantees for Ukraine, and it's important that it's there,\" he said.",
      "Asked by the BBC if he would be prepared to walk away from the agreement if Trump did not offer the guarantees he wanted, Zelensky said: \"I want to find a Nato path or something similar.",
      "\"If we don't get security guarantees, we won't have a ceasefire, nothing will work, nothing.\"",
      "Despite this, Shmyhal said on Wednesday the US supported \"Ukraine's efforts to obtain security guarantees to build lasting peace\".",
      "He said Ukraine would not sign the deal until Zelensky and Trump \"agree on security guarantees\" and decide on how to \"tie this preliminary agreement\" to a US security guarantee.",
      "Trump said on Wednesday that the US would not provide security guarantees \"beyond... very much\", saying responsibility for this fell to Europe.",
      "But he added that the presence of American workers on Ukrainian soil would provide \"automatic security\".",
      "The prospect of a minerals deal was first proposed by Zelensky last year as a way to offer the US a tangible reason to continue supporting Ukraine.",
      "Trump said on Tuesday that Ukraine would get \"the right to fight on\" in return for access to its minerals and suggested the US would continue to supply equipment and ammunition \"until we have a deal with Russia\".",
      "The US president has also said Russia is open to accepting European peacekeepers in Ukraine, but Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Kremlin would not consider this as an option.",
      "When will the deal be signed?",
      "Shmyhal said the US and Ukraine have prepared a final version of the agreement, which Ukraine's government will authorise for signing on Wednesday.",
      "Zelensky said he would be \"very direct\" with Trump by asking whether the US would continue supporting Ukraine or not.",
      "Trump has confirmed he will be meeting Zelensky in Washington on Friday to sign the agreement.",
      "What minerals does Ukraine have?",
      "Kyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.",
      "This includes some 19m tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Ukraine also has significant deposits of titanium, lithium and rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.",
      "But some of the country's mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",
      "There are warnings too that a deal allowing the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth cannot happen unless the country addresses its problem with unexploded mines.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62e36jm4jro",
    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 22:32:33 GMT",
    "summary": "Tamil Nadu\u2019s iron artefacts may predate Turkey's Anatolia, reshaping early Iron Age history.",
    "story": [
      "For over 20 years, archaeologists in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu have been unearthing clues to the region's ancient past.",
      "Their digs have uncovered early scripts that rewrite literacy timelines, mapped maritime trade routes connecting India to the world and revealed advanced urban settlements - reinforcing the state's role as a cradle of early civilisation and global commerce.",
      "Now they've also uncovered something even older - evidence of what could be the earliest making and use of iron. Present-day Turkey is one of the earliest known regions where iron was mined, extracted and forged on a significant scale around the 13th Century BC.",
      "Archaeologists have discovered iron objects at six sites in Tamil Nadu, dating back to 2,953\u20133,345 BCE, or between 5,000 to 5,400 years old. This suggests that the process of extracting, smelting, forging and shaping iron to create tools, weapons and other objects may have developed independently in the Indian subcontinent.",
      "\"The discovery is of such a great importance that it will take some more time before its implications sink in,\" says Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti, a professor of South Asian archaeology at Cambridge University.",
      "The latest findings from Adichchanallur, Sivagalai, Mayiladumparai, Kilnamandi, Mangadu and Thelunganur sites have made local headlines such as \"Did the Iron Age Begin in Tamil Nadu?\" The age marks a period when societies began using and producing iron widely, making tools, weapons and infrastructure.",
      "Parth R Chauhan, a professor of archaeology at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (ISSER), urges caution before drawing broad conclusions.  He believes that iron technology likely emerged \"independently in multiple regions\".",
      "Also, the \"earliest evidence remains uncertain because many regions of the world have not been properly researched or archaeological evidence is known but has not been dated properly\".",
      "If the Tamil Nadu discovery is further validated through rigorous academic study, \"it would certainly rank amongst the world's earliest records\", Mr Chauhan says. Oishi Roy, an archaeologist at ISSER, adds that the find \"suggests parallel developments [in iron production] across different parts of the world\".",
      "Early iron came in two forms - meteoritic and smelted. Smelted iron, extracted from ore, marked the true beginning of iron technology with mass production. The earliest known iron artefacts - nine tubular beads - were made from meteoritic iron, which comes from fallen meteorites.",
      "Identifying iron-bearing rocks is the first challenge. Once located, these ores must be smelted in a furnace at extremely high temperatures to extract the metal. Without this process, raw iron remains locked within the rock. After extraction, skilled ironsmiths shape the metal into tools and implements, marking a crucial step in early ironworking.",
      "Most sites in Tamil Nadu where iron has been found are ancient habitation areas near present-day villages. Archaeologists K Rajan and R Sivanantham say that excavators have so far explored a fraction of over 3,000 identified Iron Age graves containing sarcophagi (stone coffins) and a wealth of iron artefacts. In the process, they uncovered hoe-spades, spears, knives, arrowheads, chisels, axes and swords made of iron.",
      "At burials excavated at one site, over 85 iron objects - knives, arrowhead, rings, chisels, axes and swords - were found inside and outside burial urns. More than 20 key samples were robustly dated in five labs worldwide, confirming their antiquity.",
      "Some finds are particularly striking.",
      "Historian Osmund Bopearachchi of the Paris-based French National Centre for Scientific Research highlights a key discovery - an iron sword from a burial site, made of ultra-high-carbon steel and dating to 13th\u201315th Century BC.",
      "This advanced steel, a direct evolution of Iron Age metallurgy, required sophisticated knowledge and precise high-temperature processes.",
      "\"We know that the first signs of real steel production date back to the 13th Century BC in present-day Turkey. The radiometric dates seem to prove that the Tamil Nadu samples are earlier,\" he said. Ms Roy adds that the early steel in Tamil Nadu indicates the people there \"were iron makers, not just users - a technologically advanced community evolving over time\".",
      "Also, in a site called Kodumanal, excavators found a furnace, pointing to an advanced iron-making community.",
      "The furnace area stood out with its white discolouration, likely from extreme heat. Nearby, excavators found iron slag - some of it fused to the furnace wall - hinting at advanced metalworking techniques. Clearly the people at the site were not just using iron, but actively producing and processing it.",
      "To be sure, the Tamil Nadu excavations are not the first in India to uncover iron. At least 27 sites across eight states have revealed evidence of early iron use, some dating back 4,200 years. The latest Tamil Nadu digs pushes back the antiquity of Indian iron by another 400 years,\" archaeologist Rajan, who has co-authored a paper on the subject, told me.",
      "\"The Iron Age is a technological shift, not a single-origin event - it develops in multiple places independently,\" says Ms Roy, noting earlier discoveries in eastern, western and northern India.",
      "\"What's clear now,\" she adds, \"is that indigenous iron technology developed early in the Indian subcontinent.\"",
      "Experts say the excavations in Tamil Nadu are significant and could reshape our understanding of the Iron Age and iron smelting in the Indian subcontinent. Also, \"what these digs testify is to the existence of a distinctly sophisticated style of civilisation,\" notes Nirmala Lakshman, author of The Tamils - A Portrait of a Community.",
      "However, archaeologists caution that there is still a lack of excavations needed to collect fresh data from all over India. As one expert put it, \"Indian archaeology is in silent mode outside Tamil Nadu.\"",
      "Katragadda Paddayya, a leading Indian archaeologist, said this was \"just the starting point\".",
      "\"We need to delve deeper into the origins of iron technology - these findings mark the beginning, not the conclusion. The key is to use this as a premise, trace the process backward and identify the sites where iron production truly began.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0w0x28yxo",
    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 00:59:59 GMT",
    "summary": "As Syria's interim leader plans its future, Kurds in the north-east are battling Turkish-backed forces.",
    "story": [
      "To reach north-east Syria, we cross a rickety floating bridge over the River Tigris. Our minibus rattles as it takes us from Iraqi Kurdistan through Syrian oil fields, where jacks pumping crude oil line the roads.",
      "This part of Syria is controlled by Kurds, who call it Rojava - meaning western Kurdistan. Since 2012, after the outbreak of civil war, they have run it as a self-declared autonomous region, protected by Kurdish-led armed forces.",
      "But Bashar al-Assad's regime never recognised it and, despite his fall from power, its future remains uncertain.",
      "As well as more than a decade of civil war, the Syrian Kurds have faced years of conflict with its northern neighbour, Turkey - a battle they are still fighting.",
      "The fight against IS",
      "A decade ago, the Islamic State group (IS) swept through this region, capturing cities and villages with little resistance - until it reached the city of Kobane, next to the Turkish border, in September 2014.",
      "IS militants didn't manage to enter the city, but they imposed a brutal siege that lasted for months.",
      "Kurdish-led factions, supported by the US-led military coalition, broke the siege in early 2015. This January, I join the city's residents as they mark the 10-year anniversary.",
      "At the entrance to Kobane, women in their 50s, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, guard the checkpoints. Women played a crucial role in the fight against IS - many volunteered in the all-female Women's Protection Units (YPJ).",
      "As we drive around the city, the scars of war are still visible, along with posters of young men and women who lost their lives.",
      "But in the main square, the mood is festive. Young girls and boys, dressed in colourful Kurdish outfits dance hand in hand, singing as they celebrate.",
      "For the older generation, though, it is a bittersweet moment. \"Last night I lit candles for my martyred brother and others killed in Kobane,\" says Newrouz Ahmad, a 45-year-old mother of four. \"It is a joyful day, but also a painful one. I wish he was here to see it.\"",
      "Conflict with Turkey",
      "The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared victory over IS in north-east Syria in 2019. But freedom from IS hasn't brought lasting peace.",
      "Turkey and a coalition of Turkish-backed rebel groups known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) have launched several military operations against SDF-controlled territories since 2016, and captured a swathe of territory running along hundreds of kilometres of the border.",
      "Turkey considers the largest component in the SDF - the People's Protection Units (YPG) - an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish rights in Turkey for decades and is listed by Ankara as a terrorist organisation. The country wants to push the SDF back from its border.",
      "As the Assad regime collapsed in late 2024, the Turkish-backed SNA launched a new offensive to capture territory west of the River Euphrates from the SDF.",
      "Now battles have reached areas near Kobane. A Kurdish commander in the city quietly tells me: \"Don't film here, we have built tunnels beneath the city to prepare for another siege.\"",
      "In the city, the smell of gasoline fills the air, and the deafening sound of generators can be heard everywhere. Locals tell me that most of the power stations, refineries, and even telecommunications antennas have been destroyed by Turkish air strikes over the past two years.",
      "Newrouz Ahmad says that having \"defeated IS in Kobane\u2026 we won't allow Turkey and its proxies to occupy our city, we will defeat them too\".",
      "At a restaurant, the moment people realise we are not locals, they surround us. I ask an old man with grey hair and a stick in his hands how old he is. I guess he is about 80, but the answer he gives embarrasses me. \"I am 60,\" he says.",
      "It's clear that people here have been exhausted by war, having witnessed so much death and bloodshed.",
      "And now the threat of another battle is looming.",
      "Reported attacks on civilians",
      "Turkish-made drones and Turkish jets have targeted SDF positions and supply routes around the city. Even civilians protesting have been hit.",
      "In a regional hospital, I find one of the wounded - Lea Bunse, a 28-year-old German peace activist who has been volunteering at a women's shelter in Rojava for over two years.",
      "She shows me a video of an attack on a demonstration she says she was part of in January. The footage shows two projectiles dropping from the sky and hitting a crowd of people dancing.",
      "The protest was held near the strategic Tishreen Dam, where fighting has been ongoing.  The SDF says six civilians were killed, and dozens more injured.",
      "\"An old man next to me was also injured,\" she tells me from her bed.",
      "\"I lost some blood\u2026 but when we got into the ambulance, another drone attack was carried out next to our ambulance,\" she adds.",
      "Human Rights Watch has condemned an attack that hit a Kurdish Red Crescent ambulance as an \"apparent war crime\" by the Turkish-SNA coalition.",
      "The Turkish foreign ministry told the BBC that \"reports claiming Turkey is involved in the attacks against civilians and critical infrastructure do not reflect the truth\" adding that the SDF sends civilians to a \"conflict-ridden area on purpose\" to use them as \"human shields\u2026 in order to not to lose control on the said dam\".",
      "It accused the SDF of using \"violence and terror\" to pursue \"its own separatist agenda\", violating a ceasefire and stopping technical teams from getting access to the dam for repairs.",
      "The Damascus dilemma",
      "Syria's new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, is stuck between a rock and a hard place.",
      "The interim president - whose Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad - has been promising to form an inclusive government in Damascus, and he has asked all armed factions to lay down their weapons. Negotiations are reportedly being held with the SDF to find a solution for the north-east.",
      "But the inclusion of the Kurdish factions puts Sharaa in a difficult position with one of his main allies \u2013 Turkey.",
      "And when Sharaa opened a conference for national dialogue on Syria's future on Tuesday, the Kurdish autonomous administration was absent - it said it had not been invited.",
      "Speaking to me from a discreet location near an American base in Hassakeh province in the north-east of Syria, SDF commander Gen Mazloum Abdi tells me he has met Sharaa in Damascus before.",
      "But the two sides have still not reached an agreement.",
      "\"In reality, we are still at war with Turkey and its proxies. Turkish jets and drones continue to bomb us,\" he says, adding: \"In Damascus, it remains unclear what steps the new government will take. Their statements are positive, but they are under pressure from Turkey to act against the areas under our control.",
      "\"But the US, France, and some Arab nations are pushing them to recognize Kurdish rights,\" he says.",
      "For the US, SDF fighters have been the most reliable allies in the fight against IS.",
      "Today, hundreds of US troops remain in Kurdish-controlled areas, to counter IS sleeper cells.",
      "But the Kurds now fear President Donald Trump might withdraw these troops, leaving the region vulnerable to any Turkish military operation, and a possible IS resurgence.",
      "It's estimated that there are still about 40,000 IS family members and up to 10,000 jihadist fighters held in SDF-controlled camps and prisons in the north-east, says Gen Abdi.",
      "\"If Turkey attacks, we will have no choice but to redirect our forces,\" he warns. \"That would give IS an opportunity to attack prisons and free its fighters.\"",
      "Uncertain future",
      "There is further uncertainty for the women who fought against IS in the all-female YPJ ranks.",
      "The walls in the office of 29-year-old YPJ spokesperson Roksana Mohamed are covered with pictures of fellow female commanders killed in battle.",
      "\"So far, we haven't seen any roles given to women in Damascus' new leadership,\" she says. \"Why shouldn't a woman be defence minister?\"",
      "Ms Mohamed says women fought for their rights in this region. They have been actively involved in every aspect of political, social, and military life.",
      "\"If our rights are not respected, how can we be expected to lay down our arms?\" she asks.",
      "So while some believe stability in Syria is on the horizon, for the Kurds, the future remains unclear. Will they be recognised as partners in a new Syria, or face another existential battle?"

    "summary": "The Liberal Party of Canada will soon choose a leader that will replace Justin Trudeau and become Canada's next prime minister.",
    "story": [
      "After back-to-back debates in both English and French, the candidates to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in Canada have made their case to voters.",
      "Card-holding Liberals will now choose between former governor of the banks of Canada and England Mark Carney, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, House government leader Karina Gould and businessman and former MP Frank Baylis.",
      "Whoever wins the vote on 9 March will become Canada's next prime minister and will lead the Liberals in the forthcoming general election, which must be held on or before 20 October of this year.",
      "A big focus of the debates has been how Canada should respond to US President Donald Trump, who has threatened steep tariffs on America's northern neighbour and has suggested that Canada become the \"51st state.\"",
      "Here are five big takeaways from the two Liberal leadership debates.",
      "The Trump Factor",
      "How Canada should respond to what many have dubbed an \"existential threat\" from US President Donald Trump has unsurprisingly dominated the agenda at both debates.",
      "Trump has said he plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian exports, with the exception of energy that would be tariffed at a lower 10% - a move that economists say would be devastating for Canada while increasing prices for Americans.",
      "He has also repeatedly proposed that the US should annex Canada, which has been met with alarm and anger from large swathes of the Canadian population.",
      "Freeland, a former top minister who served during Trump's first term, positioned herself as an experienced negotiator who has fought - and won - against the US president and his previous tariffs.",
      "But Carney warned that the Trump of today was not the Trump of the past. \"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\"",
      "Gould, the youngest candidate, suggested that Canada should \"put everything on the table\" to protect its sovereignty, and that the federal government should help businesses diversify their portfolios to depend less on the US.",
      "Baylis, meanwhile, said Canada needed to forge closer economic ties with the UK, New Zealand and Australia, saying all four were like-minded countries with shared values, culture, and government systems.",
      "How Canada can fix its economy",
      "Trump's threats are made more alarming by Canada's current economic situation.",
      "Canadians have voiced frustrations over the stubborn high cost of living.",
      "Carney - an economist by trade - promised a plan that would balance Canada's operational budget in three years and proposed that Canada rethink the way it spends its money.",
      "But he has also noted his support for key Liberal programmes, like affordable childcare and dental care.",
      "As the former finance minister, Freeland defended her track record, saying the country's finances were still \"very strong\". She added that Canada should capitalise on the surge of patriotism in the face of Trump's threats, using that momentum to support Canadian industries and promote job growth.",
      "Baylis drew on his expertise as a businessman to say that Canada should work on building its productivity.",
      "Gould, on the other hand, said the Liberal Party should be \"realistic with Canadians\" and that balancing the budget in three years was not possible without significant cuts, which she did not support. She said Canada should instead focus on \"modernising its social safety net\" to help those who are struggling.",
      "\"We are facing extreme threats from the US, so we have to be able to invest in our people and in our businesses to protect them,\" Gould said.",
      "Defeating Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre",
      "The four candidates were debating with each other but they often presented a united front against their shared opponent, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is favoured in the polls as the most likely to form Canada's next government.",
      "Liberal leadership hopefuls threw several jabs at Poilievre throughout the debate. Gould called him \"our little version of Trump here at home\" while Freeland said Poilievre was looking to \"imitate\" Trump.",
      "Carney criticised Poilievre as \"irresponsible\" and added that Canada could \"not afford\" to have him as prime minister.",
      "Poilievre, who has enjoyed a sizable lead in the polls ahead of an unpopular Trudeau, has had to pivot his pitch to Canadians since Trudeau's resignation.",
      "His message changed from criticising the sitting prime minister for leading a \"broken\" Canada to putting \"Canada First\" in the face of threats from the US. He has also shifted his focus to attacking Carney, who is favoured to win the Liberal leadership race.",
      "Poilievre is still polling ahead nationally, but some polls suggest that the lead between him and the Liberals has shrunk since Trudeau's exit.",
      "Supporting Ukraine and Nato",
      "Responding to shifting US policy on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, all four candidates affirmed their commitment to continuing Canada's support for Ukraine.",
      "All of them also backed the need for Canada to hit its 2% military spending target as set out in its commitments to the Nato alliance, though they disagreed on the timeline and how to get there.",
      "Freeland said Canada should hit the target by 2027, and should do so by investing in the \"next generation of warfare\". Baylis and Carney have said their plan would be for Canada to reach that target by 2030.",
      "Both Freeland and Carney said Canada needed to invest that money into Canadian military ventures instead of into the US.",
      "Freeland noted that Canada should reduce its reliance on the US, and should look to work with the EU and other Nato partners on security assurances.",
      "A rethink of the consumer tax on carbon",
      "A tax on carbon for consumers and businesses has been the cornerstone of the Trudeau government's policy on climate change.",
      "But that tax has proven to be unpopular with Canadians, forcing Carney and Freeland to promise that they would ditch the policy.",
      "Carney, a former UN special envoy on climate action and finance, has long been a proponent of the carbon tax. In the debates, however, he acknowledged the tax on consumers had become divisive, and said he would instead focus on taxing big polluters and growing clean energy projects in Canada.",
      "Freeland, who resigned from Trudeau's government because of disagreements with the prime minister on spending, said that history would judge his climate action favourably despite his policies' unpopularity. But she, too, vowed to scrap the carbon tax.",
      "\"Democracy is about listening to people, and Canadians were very clear with us that they did not think that policy worked for them,\" she said.",
      "Gould and Baylis, on the other hand, said they would keep some version of the consumer tax on carbon in place, saying that fighting climate change comes with a price.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 01:47:56 GMT",
    "summary": "As the first European leader to visit Trump since his inauguration, Macron navigated potentially testing talks.",
    "story": [
      "Relations between Europe and the US are unquestionably in crisis, so merely keeping things together as French President Emmanuel Macron did at the White House on Monday stands as an achievement.",
      "He did that by praising, flattering and gently cajoling the US president as they took questions in the Oval Office and held a joint news conference. This is a playbook that many leaders around the world now see as more productive than outright plain speaking or criticism of Trump.",
      "Macron managed to navigate what could have been a tricky day in Washington without conceding or revealing too much.",
      "He spoke of both countries wanting peace, and while he gently corrected one of Trump's claims on Europe's support for Ukraine, he also agreed that Europe needed to take more responsibility for its own security.",
      "But Macron did make one important concession \u2013 that Trump was right to re-establish some kind of relationship with Russia's Vladimir Putin.",
      "That is in sharp contrast to the view up until now in London, Paris and Berlin, which have all pursued a policy of isolating Putin and slapping sanctions on Russian industries and individuals.",
      "\"There is good reason for President Trump to re-engage with President Putin,\" Macron said, adding that the new administration represented \"a big change\".",
      "Peace must not mean surrendering Ukraine, Macron saysZelensky says he hopes to end Ukraine war 'this year'Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned",
      "Peace must not mean surrendering Ukraine, Macron says",
      "Zelensky says he hopes to end Ukraine war 'this year'",
      "Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned",
      "Macron held out the prospect of European countries such as France and the UK being willing to play a leading role in ensuring the security of a post-truce Ukraine, possibly in the form of air power and troops stationed away from the frontline.",
      "But at the same time, he stressed the importance of having an American backstop.",
      "Macron, however, did not get a commitment of US back-up from his meeting in the Oval Office. And if he was looking for a scintilla of criticism of the Russian president from Trump, then he did not get that either.",
      "What he did get was, at least to some extent, Europe's voice back at the table and he, along with other European leaders, will take some heart from that.",
      "It is clear however, that the ambitions for re-establishing the kind of close relationship that Europe and the US have had since the end of World War Two are not on anyone's roadmap.",
      "That is why Macron himself has been working on the idea of a more strategically autonomous Europe for some time, toying with ideas of combined European defence forces.",
      "His sense that Europe needs to adapt given the dramatic shift in the US position is shared by Friedrich Merz, who will be Germany's next chancellor.",
      "Merz has already said that he believes the US under Donald Trump is indifferent to Europe's fate, and that the continent needs to be independent of the US in terms of security.",
      "\"My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,\" Merz said.",
      "But France, the UK and Germany have also got to be cognisant of the fact that not all European powers are so hostile to the US view on Ukraine.",
      "The rise of far-right nationalist parties in Europe, most notably in places like Germany where the AfD came second in Sunday's elections, suggests some European citizens are also sceptical about the continent's continued support for Kyiv.",
      "Later this week, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who has been closely co-ordinating with his French counterpart, will come to Washington to reinforce their case on Ukraine.",
      "He, like Macron, believes his country has a special relationship with the US which can open doors and get a fair hearing.",
      "The problem is that Washington in the shape of Donald Trump is on transmit mode at the moment \u2013 pushing an agenda that leaves little room for the opinion of others.",
      "And while America has always had the ability to flex its muscles and get its way, Europe for the most part has not been on the receiving end. The fact that has changed is a sign of just how serious this rupture in established alliances has become.",

    "summary": "Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, known as IBB, has got Nigeria talking about the past and what might have been.",
    "story": [
      "Nigeria's former military ruler Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, known as IBB, has released a new autobiography including several revelations about the turbulent times while he was in charge of the country from 1985 to 1993.",
      "A Journey In Service has got Nigerians talking and reflecting on what might have been if things had turned out differently - especially the controversial decision to annul the 1993 elections, and the execution of a childhood friend.",
      "Babangida has a mixed record. While some praise him for the infrastructural development Nigeria he oversaw, others say there was massive corruption during his time.",
      "Here are four takeaways from the book:",
      "The 1993 elections annulment",
      "This is the biggest talking-point as it touches on a topic which many believed altered Nigeria's history. Some say the country still has not really recovered from the annulment of the 1993 presidential elections.",
      "In the book, Babangida, now 83, for the first time expressed deep regret for cancelling that election.",
      "The poll was supposed to bring an end to military rule after 10 years and the cancellation of the outcome threw the country into turmoil.",
      "The date of the vote - 12 June - is now remembered in Nigeria as Democracy Day.",
      "Moshood Abiola, widely believed to have won the election, was later imprisoned and his wife assassinated.",
      "Gen Babangida acknowledged that Abiola, who died in 1998, had won the vote.",
      "However, in 1993 as results were being collated, the military government abruptly stopped the process - an action that triggered widespread protests and a political crisis.",
      "\"That accident of history is most regrettable. The nation is entitled to expect my expression of regret,\" Babangida writes.",
      "At the time, he cited the issue of vote-buying, as well as the need to protect the country\u2019s judiciary as reasons for the annulment.",
      "Gen Babangida was forced to resign several months later.",
      "Nigeria's current President, Bola Tinubu, said at the book launch that Gen Babangida had shown courage by admitting what took place.",
      "Abiola\u2019s son Jamiu said the acknowledgment by Gen Babangida that his father had won the election came as a welcome surprise to him and some of his family members.",
      "\"Perhaps General Babangida was looking for peace,\u201d he told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.",
      "Civilian rule was eventually restored in 1999, 11 months after the death of another military ruler Gen Sani Abacha. He had seized power towards the end of 1993 in the wake of the annulled elections.",
      "Execution of a childhood friend",
      "General Mamman Vatsa and Babangida grew up together, were in the same class in school and rose alongside each other in the military. His execution in 1986 after he was convicted of a coup plot is another major talking-point of Babangida's presidency.",
      "\"We were very close friends,\" Babangida recalls.",
      "\"We had grown up together in Minna and had been classmates in Bida. We did several things together as peers. My wife recalled that we used to share a room as bachelors. We would reach out for whatever shirt was available, irrespective of whose it was, and just wear it and head out! We were that close.\"",
      "However, he says now realises that Vatsa had been jealous since when they were teenagers.",
      "\"With the benefit of hindsight now, I recall that a constant part of our relationship as teenagers and young men was a continuous and recurrent peer jealousy on his part towards me. He was always envious of my achievements, especially when he thought I was progressing better than him, either in school or our military career path.\"",
      "Vatsa and nine others were executed in March 1986. They were said to have planned a coup, which according to Babangida would have plunged the country into darkness.",
      "\"I had to choose between saving a friend's life and the nation's future,\" he writes.",
      "Nigeria's first coup",
      "Another contentious issue has been the 1966 coup which overthrew Nigeria's first government following independence from the UK. Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa was killed, along with other high-ranking national and regional leaders.",
      "The fact most of the coup plotters were from south-eastern Nigeria meant the coup became known as an \"Igbo coup\" - a label Babangida rejects.",
      "He highlighted the role of Major John Obienu, an ethnic Igbo officer, who played a key role in quelling the coup, revealing that many senior Igbo officers were also killed in the mutiny.",
      "The book also sheds light on the involvement of members of other ethnic groups, notably Yorubas, many of whom he said had participated in the military takeover.",
      "The former leader confirmed that the original intention of the coup plotters was to release politician Obafemi Awolowo from detention and install him as president.",
      "Babangida writes: \"It was a terrible time for the Nigerian military. As I have said elsewhere, as a young officer who saw all of this from a distance, probably, ethnic sentiments did not drive the original objective of the coup plotters.",
      "\"For instance, the head of the plotters, Major Kaduna Nzeogwu, was only 'Igbo' in name. Born and raised in Kaduna, his immigrant parents were from Okpanam in today's Delta State, which, in 1966, was in the old mid-western region. Nzeogwu spoke fluent Hausa and was as 'Hausa' as any! He and his original team probably thought, even if naively, that they could turn things around for the better in the country.\"",
      "The association of Igbos with the coup led to attacks on members of that community around the country and ultimately to the civil war in which some Igbo leaders tried to secede from Nigeria in 1967. At least a million people were killed in what became known as the Biafran war.",
      "Remembering the Biafra war that many prefer to forget",
      "Remembering the Biafra war that many prefer to forget",
      "The love story with Maryam Babangida",
      "Many Nigerians see Babangida's wife Maryam as the country's most iconic and influential first lady. From 1985 to when they left office in 1993, their love story captivated a lot of people. She died in 2009 and the ex-head of state has never remarried.",
      "\"She was stunning. Her ebony beauty set off enchanting eyes, and her dazzling smile showed off a lovely set of teeth; when she smiled - and she often smiled - her face lit up, and her eyes danced,\" he writes.",
      "\"We both saw our marriage as our freedom and agreed to sort things out ourselves if we quarrelled. We were very compatible; indeed, I can only recall two occasions on which we quarrelled, and neither of us was afraid to apologise to the other. In all our years of marriage, it was never necessary for anyone to mediate between us over a misunderstanding because of that original meeting of minds.",
      "\"I never imagined that Maryam would pass away before I did, but the gift of life is in Allah's hands, not in humanity's. I am grateful for the life Maryam and I shared and for the fruit of our union. Coping without her has not been easy, but it has been made much less demanding by the memories of our life together and the length of her shadow,\" Babangida says.",
      "He describes Maryam as a devoted wife, mother, homemaker, and passionate advocate for rural women. Above all, he saw her as a true partner.",

      "That \"firewall\" - Brandmauer in German - has worked since the end of World War Two, but AfD joint leader Tino Chrupalla says: \"Anyone who erects firewalls will get grilled behind them.\"",
      "There is a determination among all of Germany's main parties to keep that block in place - and the German public backs them up: 69% see the AfD as a threat to democracy, according to voters surveyed on Sunday.",
      "Friedrich Merz, who won the election for the conservatives, believes the only reason the AfD exists is because of problems such as migration and security that need to be addressed: \"We need to resolve these problems... then that party, the AfD, will disappear.\"",
      "The AfD won 20.8% of the vote nationally, and as the light blue areas of the map show, it was dominant in the five states in the east, securing 34%.",
      "\"East Germans have made it very clear they no longer want a firewall,\" said Tino Chrupalla.",
      "Friedrich Merz will now go into talks on forming a government with the Social Democrats, who came third.",

      "Voters have not been put off by the fact that Germany's domestic intelligence classifies parts of the AfD as right-wing extremist - or that the party has now embraced a policy called \"remigration\".",
      "The AfD argues that remigration means deporting immigrants convicted of crime, but the term has been used by the extreme right to mean mass deportations.",
      "One of the big issues for the Christian Democrats is how to get their voters back and stop losing more.",
      "Merz has already flirted with the AfD in parliament, relying on their votes to push through a motion on migration.",

      "Germany's chancellor-in-waiting is unlikely to try that again, especially if he forms a government with the centre-left.",

    "story": [
      "Two-time Oscar winner Gene Hackman, 95, and his wife, classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, 64, and their dog were found dead Wednesday afternoon in their home outside Santa Fe, New Mexico, authorities said Thursday.",
      "The deaths were found to be \"suspicious enough in nature\" to require a thorough investigation, a search warrant filed in New Mexico says.",
      "In an email to CBS News early Thursday, the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office said, \"Foul play is not suspected as a factor in those deaths at this time. However, (the) exact cause of death has not been determined.\"",
      "\"This is an active and ongoing investigation by the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office,\" the statement added.",
      "Hackman and Arakawa had been dead for some time and their bodies were found by deputies in different rooms, according to a search warrant obtained by CBS News. Hackman was found in a mudroom and Arakawa was found in a bathroom next to a space heater, and there was an open prescription bottle and pills on the counter near Arakawa, the warrant said.",
      "Hackman's daughters and granddaughter released a statement Thursday confirming the deaths.",
      "\"He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just Dad and Grandpa,\" Elizabeth, Annie and Leslie Hackman said in the statement. \"We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss.\"",
      "Hackman was a consummate actor renowned for playing complicated figures in such classics as \"The French Connection,\" \"The Conversation\" and \"Unforgiven,\" and who also delighted superhero fans as the comical villain Lex Luthor in three \"Superman\" films.",
      "Hailed as one of the best actors of the era before retiring from the screen in 2004, Hackman moved easily among genres, from heart-wrenching family stories (\"I Never Sang for My Father\"), crime dramas (\"Bonnie and Clyde,\" \"Mississippi Burning\"), thrillers (\"The Conversation,\" \"No Way Out\"), and triumphant tales of sports (\"Hoosiers\") to comedies (\"Get Shorty,\" \"The Royal Tenenbaums\").",
      "Rough-hewn and flinty, a movie star without stereotypical movie-star looks, Hackman gave even his humorous roles a slightly sinister, unpredictable edge.",
      "The quality of Hackman's performances and the charisma that the shy ex-Marine would bring to the screen were praised by famed stage director Ulu Grosbard, who'd once hired him for a small role in Arthur Miller's \"A View from the Bridge.\" In a 2004 Vanity Fair profile, Grosbard described the actor as \"a complex guy. Very intelligent. A generosity of spirit. Socially charming. A lot going on in him. A certain sense of being tormented with past ghosts and things. That's part of what he brings to his work.\"",
      "\"Ghosts and things\" were likely evoked in three of Hackman's most heralded performances, in movies that redefined their genres. In William Friedkin's \"The French Connection\" (1971), Hackman played \"Popeye\" Doyle, a New York City detective unbound by rules, who constantly crossed the line between law officer and law breaker while tracking down the head of a drug ring. Dangerous and unpredictable, his Doyle was brash, vindictive and colorful, whether it was chasing down a suspect while wearing a Santa Claus costume or recklessly driving a car in pursuit of an assassin through the streets of Brooklyn.",
      "In Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Conversation\" (1974), he starred as Harry Caul, a surveillance expert whose wiretapping of his subjects leads to increased paranoia about his own safety when he believes he's uncovered evidence of a murder plot; and in Clint Eastwood's revisionist Western \"Unforgiven\" (1992), Hackman played \"Little\" Bill Daggett, the brutal sheriff of a Wyoming town who confronts Eastwood's bounty-hunting gunslinger.",
      "\"There was no finer actor than Gene,\" Eastwood said in a statement following Hackman's death. \"Intense and instinctive. Never a false note. He was also a dear friend whom I will miss very much.\"",
      "In a 2001 New York Times interview, Hackman noted that his scene in which he brutally beats up a bounty hunter played by Richard Harris was fueled by the disappointment that Harris hadn't remembered working with Hackman on the 1966 film \"Hawaii.\"",
      "\"I just took that disappointment and did this kind of transference,\" Hackman said.",
      "Hackman was less \"method-y\" than some of his peers, though he admitted that the ways in which he would behave on-screen and off as he inhabited a character \u2014 fueled by memories of his dysfunctional family growing up and the slights he faced during his struggling early years \u2014 took their toll. Temper tantrums earned him a nickname: \"Vesuvius.\"",
      "''I don't mean to live my roles,'' he told The Times. ''But sometimes I suppose it's not comfortable to be around me.''",
      "His success as an actor was merely one facet of Hackman's biography. He also raced sports cars, flew planes, deep-sea dived, painted, designed houses, and wrote or co-authored adventure and historical novels \u2014 living a life as varied and challenging as the roles for which he became famous. \"I need the diversity,\" he explained to CBS's \"Sunday Morning\" in 2000.",
      "\"One could say, you know, that I've achieved some manner of success,\" Hackman said. \"But it's like the difference between being a doctor and a lawyer, and being, maybe, a laborer. I feel that, in some ways, my efforts of being an actor are so all-instinctive, and that I haven't really paid my dues in terms of my contribution to the firmament.\"",
      "From character actor to star",
      "A shy and itinerant acting student, Hackman washed out of classes at the Pasadena Playhouse with the worst grades ever. He had several TV credits (including \"Naked City,\" \"The Defenders\" and \"Route 66\") and was featured in several light comedies on Broadway before appearing in the 1964 Warren Beatty film \"Lilith.\" After Hackman co-starred in \"Hawaii,\" \"A Covenant of Death\" and the war film \"First to Fight,\" Beatty hired him to play Buck Barrow, the older brother of bank robber Clyde Barrow, in the 1967 classic \"Bonnie and Clyde.\"",
      "The film, directed by Arthur Penn and produced by Beatty, was a shot across the bow of the studio system in its glamorous and violent dramatization of a pair of Depression Era lovers who robbed banks and killed people. After initially receiving lukewarm reviews over its blend of blood and sardonic humor, \"Bonnie and Clyde\" quickly garnered a reappraisal, spearheading Hollywood's own \"New Wave\" of filmmaking that revolutionized the industry in the late 1960s and '70s.",
      "It earned 10 Oscar nominations, including one for Hackman for best supporting actor.",
      "His film resume grew as a result, to include \"Riot,\" \"The Gypsy Moths,\" \"Downhill Racer,\" \"Marooned,\" and \"I Never Sang for My Father,\" earning Hackman his second Oscar nod for supporting actor, playing the son of a dominating parent (Melvyn Douglas).",
      "\"The French Connection\" would cement Hackman's position as a movie star. The film's brash, documentary-style production perfectly captured Hackman's character, a seething, sadistic NYC cop seeking to bust a ring of heroin smugglers \u2014 like Ahab on the hunt for the white whale.",
      "Although much of the film's heralded chase scene \u2014 in which Doyle, in a car, pursues an assassin who has hijacked an above-ground subway train \u2014\u00a0 featured stunt driver Bill Hickman, Hackman as Doyle did drive for some of it, crashing his car into a wall.",
      "At times during production, Hackman was unsure about his performance and asked to be fired. And then, after the film proved to be a hit, winning five Oscars \u2014 including for best picture, best director and best actor \u2014 he feared that he would be typecast as a determined cop thereafter. Hackman would return to the role in the 1975 sequel, \"French Connection II,\" in which he gave a grueling portrayal of Doyle suffering withdrawal from heroin addiction.",
      "His star power led him to both big-budget studio fare, headlining an all-star cast in the 1972 disaster film \"The Poseidon Adventure,\" and small character dramas such as \"Scarecrow,\" opposite Al Pacino, and \"Zandy's Bride,\" co-starring Liv Ullman. Other 1970s appearances included playing a private eye in the film noir \"Night Moves\"; a horseman competing in a cross-country race in the Western \"Bite the Bullet\"; a rum-runner in the Prohibition Era comedy \"Lucky Lady\" (opposite Burt Reynolds and Liza Minnelli); a contract killer in the conspiracy thriller \"The Domino Principle\"; and a World War II general in \"A Bridge Too Far.\"",
      "One of his most memorable turns was an unbilled cameo in Mel Brooks' \"Young Frankenstein,\" playing a blind hermit who spills hot soup into the lap of Peter Boyle's monster.",
      "Then came \"Superman\" (1978), in which Hackman, as Lex Luthor, faced off against Christopher Reeve's Man of Steel in a scheme that involved nuking the San Andreas Fault, which would make much of California slide into the ocean and turn Luthor's worthless desert land into prime seaside real estate.",
      "Hackman's criminal mastermind was wily, vain, cantankerous, and a bit too sure of himself. He told the BBC in 1986 that playing Luthor was great fun: \"He's kind of a flamboyant character and deranged, and all the things that actors love to play.\"",
      "Still, director Richard Donner had to go to lengths to coax Hackman into taking the job (a $2 million paycheck helped), and when the actor refused to shave off his mustache (let alone shave his head), Donner agreed to shave off his own mustache if Hackman got rid of his. Once the actor put a razor to his upper lip, Donner ripped off his own mustache \u2014\u00a0 a fake.",
      "He continued playing Luthor for the sequel (shot concurrently with the first film), but when Donner was fired by the producers and replaced for the remainder of what would be released as \"Superman II,\" Hackman walked. A body double and dubbed voice filled in for him. He later returned to the role in 1987's \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.\"",
      "\"Getting to be somebody\"",
      "Eugene Alden Hackman was born January 30, 1930 in San Bernadino, California. His father, a pressman for newspapers, moved the family several times during Hackman's youth before they settled in Danville, Illinois. It was there, when Gene was 13, that his father left the family with just a wave goodbye.",
      "Seeking escape from an uneasy family life, Gene was entranced by the movies. He idolized James Cagney and Errol Flynn, and vowed to become an actor himself. \"I loved the idea that somebody could convince me that they were a sea captain without being phony,\" he told Vanity Fair in 2004. \"I think because I was shy I felt insecure, and acting seemed like a way of maybe getting around that. Getting to be somebody.\"",
      "He dropped out of school and lied about his age to get into the Marine Corps, where he spent four and a half years. He got a taste of performing as an announcer on Armed Forces Radio, but injuries from a motorcycle accident led to his departure from the Marines, just in time to avoid fighting in the Korean War.",
      "He tried his hand at acting with classes at the Pasadena Playhouse, where his fellow students voted him (along with classmate Dustin Hoffman) \"Least Likely to Succeed.\" He picked up and moved to New York City, where he existed in a stream of menial jobs as he tried to create a path toward an acting career, aided and abetted by a circle that included Hoffman and Robert Duvall. Married, Hackman even shared his apartment with Hoffman for a time, as they experienced disappointments that would have crushed others.",
      "\"It was more psychological warfare, because I wasn't going to let those f*****s get me down,\" Hackman told Vanity Fair. \"I insisted with myself that I would continue to do whatever it took to get a job. It was like me against them, and in some way, unfortunately, I still feel that way. But I think if you're really interested in acting there is a part of you that relishes the struggle. It's a narcotic in the way that you are trained to do this work and nobody will let you do it, so you're a little bit nuts. You lie to people, you cheat, you do whatever it takes to get an audition, get a job.\"",
      "The rejections, he said, \"create a resolve in you that, no matter what kind of part you're given, you can do anything. Give me the challenge, I can do it. The scarier the better.\"",
      "\"He is incapable of bad work\"",
      "In the 1980s, his marriage with Faye Maltese, with whom he'd had three children, ended in divorce. Uncomfortable with life in Los Angeles, he contemplated retirement, though his desire for acting continued.",
      "His credits included \"All Night Long,\" \"Reds,\" \"Under Fire,\" \"Uncommon Valor,\" \"Twice in a Lifetime\" (a rare romantic role), \"Power,\" \"Hoosiers,\" \"No Way Out,\" \"Split Decisions,\" \"Bat*21,\" \"Another Woman,\" \"Postcards From the Edge,\" \"Narrow Margin\" and \"Class Action.\"",
      "In 1988's \"Mississippi Burning,\" Hackman's FBI agent scrapes against the by-the-book attitude of his colleague (played by Willem Dafoe) as they investigate the kidnapping and death of civil rights activists in 1964 Mississippi. Hackman earned his fourth Oscar nomination for his performance.",
      "Alan Parker, the film's director, said of Hackman, \"He is incapable of bad work. Every director has a short list of actors he'd die to work with, and I'll bet Gene's on every one.\"",
      "The '90s gave him further latitude to explore his considerable range, from John Grisham legal thrillers (\"The Firm,\" \"The Chamber,\" \"Runaway Jury\") to westerns (\"Unforgiven,\" \"Geronimo: An American Legend,\" \"The Quick and the Dead,\" \"Wyatt Earp\"). He brought heft and authority to the thrillers \"Crimson Tide,\" \"Extreme Measures,\" \"Absolute Power,\" \"Enemy of the State,\" \"Under Suspicion,\" \"Heist,\" and \"Behind Enemy Lines,\" and winking humanity to the comedies \"The Birdcage,\" \"Heartbreakers,\" \"The Royal Tenenbaums,\" and \"Welcome to Mooseport,\" his last film appearance.",
      "In 1992, he starred on Broadway in \"Death and the Maiden\" with Glenn Close and Richard Dreyfuss, under the direction of Mike Nichols.",
      "Hackman the writer",
      "He retired from the screen in 2004 and would only return as narrator on a pair of documentaries about the Marines. He lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico, with his second wife, Betsy Arakawa, and pursued his interests in art and writing.",
      "When he met up with Daniel Lenihan for some scuba lessons, the two got to talking about adventure books they grew up with and decided to try writing one \u2014 a pirate story. Hackman wrote his chapters longhand in spiral notebooks; the two would then meet up at a caf\u00e9 to go over their work. \"I would have some pages, he would have some pages,\" Hackman told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"We would trade. And we'd read them over while we were ordering and eating, and by the end of that couple of hours, we would have critiqued each other's work and decided where we were going to go from there.\"",
      "\"The Wake of the Perdido Star,\" a tale of shipwrecks and piracy set in 1805, was published in 1999. It sold well but received mixed reviews. The acclaimed actor now faced a new audience. He told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"The fact that you're being judged on your intelligence and your skill as a writer, and your skill as a storyteller, that was very tense for me \u2014 and being criticized, and finding that you're vulnerable to the critics, in a way that I hadn't experienced before.\"",
      "Hackman and Lenihan later collaborated on the crime drama \"Justice for None\" (2004) and the historical novel \"Escape From Andersonville\" (2008). Hackman then authored two books solo: a Western, \"Payback at Morning Peak,\" and a police thriller, \"Pursuit.\"",
      "His interest in writing may have been inherited from his grandfather, a reporter, and he'd explored that avenue of expression as far back at the 1980s when he'd optioned a crime novel by Thomas Harris that he'd hoped to adapt, direct and star in. But his screenplay grew distressingly overlong and he let the option slide. The book: \"The Silence of the Lambs.\"",
      "Hackman regularly refused interviews in his later years but in 2021, to mark the 50th anniversary of \"The French Connection,\" he shared with the New York Post the revelation that he'd only watched the film once. \"Filmmaking has always been risky \u2014 both physically and emotionally \u2014 but I do choose to consider that film a moment in a checkered career of hits and misses,\" he wrote in an email.",
      "As for the car chase, he added, \"There was a better one filmed a few years earlier with Steve McQueen,\" tipping his hat to the 1968 film \"Bullitt.\"",
      "Maybe. But at the conclusion of \"The French Connection\" chase, Hackman's \"Popeye\" Doyle, like so many of his other characters, refused to let his prey get the better of him.",

      "\"Wicked,\" the film version of the long-running Broadway musical (which was itself based on Gregory Maguire's 1995 novel), is a prequel to \"The Wizard of Oz,\" and tells of the friendship and falling-out between Glinda (the most popular student at Shiz University) and Elphaba (an outcast who would go on to become the Wicked Witch of the West).",
      "This tale of frenemies is anchored by best actress Oscar nominee Cynthia Erivo, whose performance echoes the pain of being seen as different (she was born green) and of being targeted by an authoritarian power (which she has dared to stand up to), resulting in her using her new-found power to thwart capture.",
      "In this scene, having decided that she must leave the Emerald City as the nefarious forces of the Wizard close in on her, Elphaba parts ways with Glinda (best supporting actress nominee Ariana Grande), and expresses her wish for freedom, with the song \"Defying Gravity\":",
      "Asked what she brought to the role of Elphaba, Erivo told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"The vulnerability, her humanity.\" She described that vulnerability for herself, personally, as \"always wanting to do well and not wanting to fail, not wanting to let family down. Those are the insecurities. Finally owning how I look.\"",
      "What do you mean?\u00a0 \"Well, I think we're not necessarily told that, you know, dark-skinned Black girls are the prettiest girls,\" Erivo said. \"And the only person that really is telling you, thankfully, is your mother.

      "Erivo, who won a Tony Award, a Grammy and an Emmy for her role as Celie in the 2015 Broadway revival of \"The Color Purple,\" was previously nominated for two Academy Awards, for best actress and best original song, for the 2019 drama \"Harriet,\" about abolitionist Harriet Tubman.",
      "Erivo's performance as Elphaba is notable not just for her singing, which is astounding, but for singing live on set, rather than acting to pre-recorded vocal tracks. She said it allowed her to play, and change her performance, moment to moment: \"It means that you can act on impulse. \u2026 You have more breath, more space.\"",
      "She told \"CBS Mornings\" that she did change the character slightly from the original Broadway show (which was originated by Tony-winner Idina Menzel), in order to inform Elphaba with her own experience. \"I definitely felt like I had a responsibility to the character and to the piece because I didn't want to remove it so far away that you just didn't recognize her anymore,\" she said, \"but I also wanted to find out what the truth was for me playing this character.

      "The operatic crime film \"Emilia Perez\" leads this year's Oscar nominations, with 13, including best picture, director and screenplay. Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, who plays the title character, became the first transgender woman to be nominated for an Academy Award for best actress.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n is introduced in the film as Juan \"Manitas\" Del Monte, a Mexican drug lord who kidnaps Rita, an attorney (best supporting actress Oscar nominee Zoe Salda\u00f1a), to hire her for an unusual task: Manitas wants to become a woman. A fake death is staged, Manitas' wife and children are relocated to Europe, and Manitas becomes Emilia P\u00e9rez.",
      "Flash forward to London, where, in this scene, Rita and Emilia are reunited:",
      "Emilia's desire to reconnect with her wife and children leads to an arrangement whereby Emilia pretends to be a distant relative. Tragedy follows. Written and directed by Jacques Audiard, the film is a highly theatrical musical that earned its four leads (Gasc\u00f3n, Salda\u00f1a, Selena Gomez and Adriana Paz) a shared best actress award at the Cannes Film Festival.",
      "In May, Gasc\u00f3n told the Associated Press, \"I want to get to the point where trans actresses are not limited to only playing trans characters. Just because you're trans doesn't mean you can't also play a lady going to the bakery. Just because you're trans doesn't mean you can't play a philosopher. Trans people are normal and ordinary just like anyone else. Not every trans person is engaged in prostitution on the street and if they do pursue it's because society rejects them, not necessarily because they wanted to do it. So, the opportunity for me to play these two roles is a gift from the universe. \u2026 It's marvelous to be able to find myself with roles like these.\"",
      "After Gasc\u00f3n's Oscar nomination was announced (she was also nominated for a BAFTA, Golden Globe, C\u00e9sar, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards), she received backlash over a series of offensive and racist social media posts she'd made several years earlier. In one, from 2021, she slammed the Academy Awards ceremony as something akin to \"an Afro-Korean festival, a Black Lives Matter demonstration or [International Women's Day].\" Other posts attacked Islam, Christianity, Catholicism, and George Floyd.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n apologized, and deleted the posts. But she was dropped from Netflix's promotional tour for \"Emilia P\u00e9rez,\" was absent from Spain's Goya Awards\u00a0and Britain's BAFTAs, and had a book cancelled. The film's director disavowed her, telling Deadline, \"I haven't spoken to her, and I don't want to.\"",
      "On February 9, at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, Selena Gomez commented on the controversy swirling around \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" and Gasc\u00f3n's posts: \"Some of the magic has disappeared, but I choose to continue to be proud of what I've done, and I'm just grateful. I live with no regrets,\" she said, adding, \"I would do this movie over and over again if I could.\"",

      "Mikey Madison, \"Anora\"",
      "Sean Baker's \"Anora,\" which won the top prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival, is a sly and at times uproarious comic-drama of a Brooklyn sex worker who enters into a Cinderella romance and marriage with the flighty son of Russian oligarchs. Mikey Madison portrays Anora (preferred name: Ani) as a woman older than her 25 years, but still young enough to believe in the sanctity of elopement, when she and her immature lover, Ivan (Mark Eydelshteyn), decide to tie the knot in Las Vegas.",
      "In this scene, Ani takes a stand about the working conditions at her club \u2013 she will not countenance rudeness from the DJ! (Note: Graphic language):",
      "In this scene, Ivan makes his proposal, to a young woman not quite sure whether to believe the guy (Note: Graphic language):",
      "Madison told Variety that it was a long, engaged process for her to get into the world Ani inhabited: \"It was a character that felt so far away from home in every single way. It was very intimidating at first; how do I empathize with her? I was like, I just need to start small. I did quite a bit of pole training. I did this stripper boot camp where I was taught how to give lap dances, how to twerk. And I would know everything about her \u2014 what cigarettes she smokes, what her school life was like.\"",
      "Madison, whose credits include Quentin Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood,\" \"Scream,\" and the TV series \"Better Things,\" told \"CBS Mornings\" that she \"absolutely fell in love\" with Ani when she read the character. \"She's such a complicated woman. There's so much nuance to who she is. She's so vulnerable on the inside, but she presents herself as this very fierce, tough person. And she has such a fighting spirit, and I was excited to explore all the different parts of what that would be.\"",
      "Baker, whose past films include \"The Florida Project,\" \"Tangerine\" and \"Prince of Broadway,\" told Madison he would write the character of Ani expressly for her if she agreed to be in his movie. \"It's very surreal, and I am very lucky, because I dreamed of working with someone like Sean my entire career as an actress,\" she said.",
      "Madison's accent in particular was key to her getting the character. She moved into the Brighton Beach neighborhood of Brooklyn a month before shooting, in order to absorb the sound of the locals. Luna Sof\u00eda Miranda, who plays Ani's best friend, Lulu, and who is herself a stripper, also instructed Madison on the vernacular of the world of \"gentlemen's clubs.\" \"She is amazing and was so sweet, and made me [two] PowerPoint presentations,\" Madison said. \"One of them was just stripper memes, and then another one was lingo and slang.\"",
      "What was some of the slang? \"Brick.\u00a0Oh, it's brick outside, which means it's cold. And then another one, I think, was a whale, which means a very wealthy, powerful person who comes into the club, someone who has a lot of money.\"",
      "Madison told the Hollywood Reporter that one of the lessons she learned from Baker was, \"He really made it clear that he cared about my ideas and what I was bringing to the film. The most important thing I learned from him is that my opinion and my voice matter.\"",
      "She returned to Brighton Beach since the film was released and found everything to be exactly the same. \"That's one of the things I love about Brighton Beach, is that it's such a time capsule. It's basically been the same for 30 years,\" she told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "This is Madison's first Academy Award nomination. She won the BAFTA, was nominated for Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Awards, and received best actress honors from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association (tying with Marianne Jean-Baptiste for \"Hard Truths\").",

      "Demi Moore, \"The Substance\"",
      "In the darkly comic body horror film \"The Substance,\" Demi Moore plays an aging TV star who discovers a sinister-looking potion that can give her a younger, more perfect version of herself, but at a terrible price.",
      "Moore, who has been a Hollywood fixture \u2013 and a target of the tabloid press \u2013 since the 1980s, told \"Sunday Morning\" that she recognized the story's message about the pains those in the public eye would go through to meet supposed social standards. \"I put so much pressure on myself,\" she said, when discussing the value she had placed on her attractiveness in the past. \"And I did have experiences of being told to lose weight. And all of those, while they may have been embarrassing and humiliating, it's what I did to myself because of that.\"",
      "In this scene, Moore's character, preparing for a date, looks in the mirror, applies makeup, then purposely smears it. She said the process of shooting that scene was difficult. \"Emotionally, that idea that I think many of us have been where we're trying to make something better, and then we just keep making it worse,\" she said. \"For me, it's one of the most heart-wrenching moments in the whole film. And it was at least 15 takes each time. And so, by the end, my face was raw.\"",
      "Asked what she thinks when she looks in a mirror, Moore replied, \"Uhm, it fluctuates. Some days I look and I'm like, Wow. That's pretty good. \u00a0And some days, I catch myself dissecting, hyper-focusing on, you know, things that I don't like.",
      "\"The difference is, now I can catch myself. I can go, Yeah, I don't like that loose skin. But, you know, it is what it is. So, I'm gonna make the best of what is, as opposed to chasing what isn't.\"",
      "Moore endured hours of body prosthetics, and spent much time naked on-screen. She told \"CBS Mornings,\" \"The interesting thing for me was the exploration of that violence we have against ourselves, the harshness of how we can sit in judgment \u2013 that heavily comparing and dissecting. That for me was something that really resonated, because I felt that was so human.\"",
      "She broke out in such films as \"St. Elmo's Fire\" and \"No Small Affair,\" and starred in \"The Seventh Sign,\" \"Ghost,\" \"A Few Good Men,\" \"Indecent Proposal,\" \"Striptease,\" \"G.I. Jane,\" and \"Margin Call.\"\u00a0 \"The Substance,\" which marks her first Oscar nomination, won Moore a Golden Globe for best motion picture actress (musical or comedy) and the Screen Actors Guild Award.",
      "\"Thirty years ago, I had a producer tell me that I was a popcorn actress,\" she said, accepting her Golden Globe. \"And at that time, I made that mean that this wasn't something that I was allowed to have. And so today, I celebrate this as a marker of my wholeness and of the love that is driving me. And for the gift of doing something I love and being reminded that I do belong.\"",
      "\"The Substance\" is in theaters and available on Mubi and via VOD.",
      "Fernanda Torres, \"I'm Still Here\"",
      "Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres won the Golden Globe for best motion picture actress (drama) for her performance as Eunice Paiva, the wife of politician Rubens Paiva, who opposed Brazil's military dictatorship in the 1960s and '70s. In 1971 Rubens was kidnapped by the military, tortured and killed.",
      "The film, directed by Walter Salles (\"Central Station,\" \"The Motorcycle Diaries\"), is based on the 2015 book \"I'm Still Here,\" written by Marcelo Rubens Palva, about his parents. \"[The book is] when we really discovered Eunice,\" Torres told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \"The book is about the son in his adulthood discovering that the real hero of the family was not the father, not him, but it was this amazing woman called Eunice Paiva.\"",
      "It was a story almost lost to history. Following her husband's murder, Eunice \u2013 a housewife and mother of five \u2013 not only fights to protect her children, but also fights to confront a repressive system. She returned to university and became a lawyer, and eventually led efforts to protect the rights of Indigenous people in Brazil and for protection of the Amazon rain forest. But her contributions were never fully acknowledged by the public.",
      "\"It's like a woman who always fights the right fight, and she never had the will to be recognized by this, which is kind of strange nowadays,\" Torres said. \"She was a woman who never felt like it was important for [herself] to be recognized.\"",
      "In this scene, Eunice \u2013 alerted to the death of the family dog in front of their home \u2013 confronts two mysterious men parked across the street, who have been spying on her:",
      "Torres has appeared in more than 60 films and TV productions, including \"Love Me Forever or Never,\" \"The Invisible Woman,\" \"Foreign Land.\" She is the second Brazilian actress to be nominated for an Academy Award. The first? Her mother, Fernanda Montenegro, nominated for \"Central Station.\"",
      "Torres told W Magazine, \"I was raised in the wings of theaters. My father, Fernando, is also an actor and producer. And they named me Fernanda. So, I couldn't escape, you see? I paid a lot of hours in shrinks, and I really don't know how I did it, but I did it. I started working as an actress from the time I was 13 years old. \u2026 I find it a miracle. Isn't it a miracle? Even now, to be here with this film. The other day, I saw Judi Dench saying that there is a lot of luck involved in this business, and I think she's right.\"",
      "\"My mother reminded me a lot of Eunice \u2013 the intelligence, a kind of woman that is down-to-earth and courageous,\"\u00a0she told Interview Magazine. \"It's a form of femininity. It has so much to do with my childhood that I think it became universal because of that.",
      "\"It's a tragic story,\" she said. \"In tragedy, you face the unfaceable. You restrain, and you endure. That was very clear, and I never worked in anything like that, where I have restraint and change through the restraint. She was just like a sketch of what she could be, and after the disappearance of the man, she becomes herself, which is a beautiful tale.\"",
      "\"I'm Still Here\" has become a sensation in Brazil, where the nation's collective memory about the hundreds who disappeared under the dictatorship, and the 20,000 estimated to have been tortured under military rule across two decades, is being revived through the story of Eunice and her family. But the film also met with universal acclaim outside of Brazil, and earned Torres the Golden Globe for best motion picture actress (drama).",
      "Commenting on the packed category of actresses, Torres talked with \"Entertainment Tonight\" about her \"Cinderella night,\" at the Golden Globes, saying, \"Everybody deserves it. Everybody. So I don't know why they choose this street dog that speaks Portuguese, but I'm so glad!\"",
      "Like Gascon, Torres has been made to address her past, in her case a performance from 2008 in the Brazilian sketch comedy series \"Fantastico,\" in which she appeared in blackface. She told Deadline, \"At that time, despite the efforts of Black movements and organizations, the awareness of the racist history and symbolism of blackface hadn't yet entered the mainstream public consciousness in Brazil. Thanks to better cultural understanding and important but incomplete achievements in this century, it's very clear now in our country and everywhere that blackface is never acceptable.\"",
      "\"I'm Still Here,\" released by Sony Pictures Classics, is also nominated for best picture and best international feature film.  It is screening exclusively in theaters.",

      "Trachtenberg, a child actor who grew up in Brooklyn, appeared in her first commercials at age 3, according to the\u00a0movie database\u00a0IMDb. At 8 years old, she landed a role as Nona Mecklenberg on Nickelodeon's \"The Adventures of Pete & Pete,\" which ran from 1994 to 1996.",

      "Adrien Brody, \"The Brutalist\"",
      "In 2003 Adrien Brody became the youngest best actor Oscar-winner in history for his performance in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist,\" as Wladyslaw Szpilman, a musician struggling to survive in the Jewish ghetto during the Nazi occupation of Poland. It was a role for which he virtually starved himself, losing 30 pounds, all while learning the piano so that he could play Chopin.",
      "Twenty-two years later, Brody is back with his second Oscar nomination for \"The Brutalist,\" Brady Corbet's lacerating tale of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, a Hungarian Jewish architect who emigrates to the United States, and his efforts both to resume his career and to assimilate in a society where antisemitism and classism are rife.",
      "T\u00f3th  is hired by a wealthy Pennsylvania industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2013 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete. In this scene, T\u00f3th  \u2013 who is working a construction site in Pennsylvania \u2013 is discovered by Harrison Lee Van Buren (best supporting actor nominee Guy Pearce), who sees in T\u00f3th a talent for which he wants to be the patron.",
      "T\u00f3th  accepts a commission. But once his wife Erzs\u00e9bet (best supporting actress nominee Felicity Jones) arrives from Europe, T\u00f3th\u00a0 feels caught between his artistic impulses and the realities of working in an America that, in many cases, is closed to the foreign born:",
      "Brody, whose mother and grandparents fled Hungary during the 1956 revolution, said their sacrifices informed his performance. \"There was so much unknown, and a lot of loss,\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"And all of those sacrifices have kind of laid the foundation for my own existence and what has been accessible to me.\"",
      "He also heard the voice of his Hungarian grandfather in T\u00f3th. \"I remember my grandfather's accent was very, very heavy,\" he said. \"I conjure it up. I also knew every bad word in Hungarian as a kid. So, I infused some of that in it that's not in the script!\"",
      "In this extended interview with \"Sunday Morning,\" Brody believes that empathy helped shape his own choices as an actor, \"trying to find films that have social relevance, or to represent people who don't have a voice and to give them that through me in some respect.\"",
      "Brody won the New York Film Critics Circle Award, the Golden Globe for best motion picture actor (drama), and the BAFTA for \"The Brutalist.\" The film received 10 Oscar nominations, including best picture and best director (Brady Corbet).",

      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet earned his first best actor Oscar nomination at age 22 for \"Call Me By Your Name,\" as a teenage boy who becomes the target of an older man. In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Chalamet plays the iconic singer-songwriter Bob Dylan during the years when he made a name for himself as a folk artist and as a rock star who, to a segment of his fans, left the roots of folk music behind.",
      "In this scene Dylan is introduced by Pete Seeger (best supporting actor nominee Edward Norton) for his first appearance at New York's Folk City, where he performs \"I Was Young When I Left Home\":",
      "Prior to shooting, Chalamet travelled to Minnesota to research Dylan's roots and his formative days. He returned to the state for a screening of the finished film in Minneapolis. In December\u00a0Chalamet told CBS Minnesota station WCCO, \"I think he's very proud of his Minnesota heritage, and I think, in some ways, the way I relate to him is, I think the iron ore in his songs and the iron ore in his voice \u2014 as a New Yorker, as a 28-year-old New Yorker, I don't think my path would have really brought me out here, ever.",
      "\"So, the first time I got here I thought, 'Wow, what a gift, Bob Dylan, being in this guy's worldview.'\"",
      "The actor was first attached to the project in 2019, but shooting was repeatedly delayed due to COVID and then the actors' strike. In the intervening years, Chalamet learned how to play the guitar. \"I don't know if I'll ever get this much time to work on something in advance,\"\u00a0he told The Hollywood Reporter. He also gained 20 pounds prior to shooting, to better match the folk singer's physique.",
      "He said the role marked the furthest that he'd stretched himself. \"And it became so biblical to me in terms of this man's life and his work that I felt if I let my focus err for a second, that I'd be self-loathing about it for years to come. I had three months to play Bob Dylan, and the rest of my life I don't get to be about that, so why not give it my all?\"",
      "To connect with what the reclusive Dylan represented, the actor told \"60 Minutes\" he disconnected from his own life for the two-and-a-half months of filming. He did not use his cellphone, or have visitors on set. \"I've never approached a character so intensely as Bob, 'cause I have such respect for the material,\" Chalamet said. \"And I knew I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I remembered that I was lazy on a day when something went wrong.\"",
      "In addition to learning how to play the guitar and the harmonica, the actor told \"60 Minutes\" he learned to perform about 40 Bob Dylan songs \u2014 far more than were originally called for in the script. But while Chalamet pre-recorded all the Dylan songs he'd sing in the movie (to be played back on set during filming), he said they sounded \"too clean,\" and so he tried performing live on set, doing so the first time in a scene in which Dylan visits his terminally ill hero, folk artist Woody Guthrie, in a New Jersey hospital.",
      "Director James Mangold said he knew Chalamet nailed \"Song to Woody\" on his first take: \"There's a moment in that scene right at the last stanza where he holds a note \u2013 that would never have happened if we'd used the playback track,\" Mangold said.",
      "Chalamet also examined video of the singer, including footage taken of a Dylan performing a duet of \"It Ain't Me Babe\" with Joan Baez, which he played at a reduced speed. \"That was when I really slowed down, 'cause it's fascinating the way Bob observes her,\" he said. \"And how he refuses eye contact in that video.\"",
      "In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Chalamet and Barbaro perform \"It Ain't Me Babe\":",
      "Speaking of the finished film, Chalamet said, \"I was honored and counting my lucky stars that we got to bring this to life. Because nothing's a given. No opportunity is a given. No career is a given. I talked a lot about this with Edward Norton: the gift to work on something where every day \u2014 whether listening to the musicians we were playing, or the musicians that inspired them, or reading the authors that inspired them \u2014 you learn more about yourself.\"",
      "Chalamet told \"60 Minutes\" he's not sure what he'd say to Dylan if he ever did meet him \u2013 but maybe not even mention the movie, and only talk about the weather: \"What his favorite sandwich is, or something like that ... I would play it super cool, you know? 'Cause I feel like he's probably used to so much hyperbole and praise.\"",

He earned his first Oscar nomination last year for playing civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in \"Rustin.\"",
      "He talked about his recent success on \"CBS Mornings\"\u00a0last November: \"I feel that it's been a long time in my journey, where suddenly the roles are sort of meeting my skill set and what I'm curious about and what I can do. So, it just feels like I'm a journeyman actor. I've been working for 34 years, and it just feels like, I never knew what this time would be like.\"",
      "Last March, on the day of the Oscars, Domingo posted a picture of himself on Instagram as a child, writing, \"His dream came true. Not easily. With dedication, hard work, hardships, triumphs, pitfalls, detours, reroutes and love and faith. Today is a good day for this kid. He already won. And as you can tell he always loved a pop of color. Got it from his parents.\"",
      "That \"pop of color\" led to Domingo being asked by Anna Wintour to co-chair the 2025 Met Gala. \"She actually said, 'I'm not sure if you'd be interested in something like this or if you have time,'\" Domingo laughed. \"I said, 'I think I have time!'\"",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 14:44:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Lisa Jeanine Findley pleaded guilty to a charge of mail fraud in a plot to defraud Elvis Presley's family by trying to auction off his Graceland mansion and property.",
    "story": [
      "A Missouri woman pleaded guilty Tuesday to a federal charge accusing her of concocting a brazen plot to defraud Elvis Presley's family by trying to auction off his Graceland mansion and property before a judge halted the mysterious foreclosure sale.",
      "During a hearing in front of a Memphis federal judge, Lisa Jeanine Findley pleaded guilty to a charge of mail fraud related to the scheme. She previously pleaded not guilty to the two-count indictment, which also includes a count of aggravated identity theft that will now be dropped.",
      "When asked by the judge if Findley was admitting guilt and accepting responsibility, she said \"Yes.\" Findley will be sentenced on June 19. She would have faced up to 20 years if convicted, but she is expected to receive less than that under the plea deal.",
      "\"We are grateful for the hard work of the federal investigators and prosecutors who secured this conviction,\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said in a statement. \"Graceland matters so much to so many people around the world \u2013 just go to Memphis during Elvis Week and listen to all the different accents and languages of fans who make the pilgrimage. All of Tennessee is glad that Graceland remains safely in the possession of Elvis's heir and that it will remain a celebrated Memphis landmark for generations to come.\"",
      "Findley, of Kimberling City, falsely claimed Presley's daughter Lisa Marie Presley borrowed $3.8 million from a bogus private lender and had pledged Graceland as collateral for the loan\u00a0before her death in January 2023, prosecutors alleged when she was\u00a0charged in August 2024. She then threatened to sell Graceland to the highest bidder if Presley's family didn't pay a $2.85 million settlement, according to authorities.",
      "Findley posed as three different people allegedly involved with the fake lender, fabricated loan documents, and published a fraudulent foreclosure notice in a Memphis newspaper announcing the auction of Graceland in May 2024, prosecutors said. A judge stopped the sale after Presley's granddaughter Riley Keough sued.",
      "Experts were baffled by the attempt to sell off one of the most storied pieces of real estate in the country using names, emails and documents that were quickly suspected to be phony.",
      "In May, a public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre estate said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owes $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Keough inherited the trust and ownership of the home after the death of her mother, Lisa Marie Presley.",
      "Keough filed a lawsuit claiming fraud, and a judge halted the proposed auction with an injunction. Naussany Investments and Private Lending \u2014 the bogus lender authorities say Findley created \u2014 said Lisa Marie Presley had used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Keough's lawsuit alleged that Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and that Lisa Marie Presley never borrowed money from Naussany.",
      "Kimberly Philbrick, the notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents, indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley nor notarized any documents for her, according to the estate's lawsuit. The judge said the notary's affidavit brings into question \"the authenticity of the signature.\"",
      "The judge halted the foreclosure sale of the beloved Memphis tourist attraction, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing that a company's attempt to auction Graceland was fraudulent.",
      "Elvis bought Graceland in 1957 and died there in 1977, and about five years later, the mansion was opened to the public as a museum and tourist attraction. Hundreds of thousands of tourists visit the 17,552-square-foot mansion each year, which was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Visitors can then stop at the large Presley-themed entertainment complex across the street.",
      "Elvis and other members of the Presley family, including Lisa Marie Presley and her son, Benjamin Keough, who died by suicide in 2020, are buried on the mansion's grounds.",
      "Keough, who starred in the television series hit \"Daisy Jones and The Six,\" said in a 2024 interview\u00a0with CBS News that she plans to continue running the beloved property and keep the mansion in the family. Keough and her husband Ben Smith-Peterson have a\u00a0daughter, Tupelo,\u00a0who is Elvis' first great-grandchild.",
      "\"I think, like, my instinct with everything is always to do what my mother would have wanted. Which is to keep it a home,\" Keough told CBS News last year. \"It was our family's home.\"",

      "Roberta Flack, the Grammy-winning singer and pianist whose intimate vocal and musical style on \"Killing Me Softly with His Song,\" \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" and other hits made her one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after, died Monday, her publicist confirmed to CBS News. She was 88.",
      "She died at home surrounded by her family, publicist Elaine Schock said in a statement. Flack announced in 2022 she had ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and could no longer sing.",
      "Little known before her early 30s, Flack became an overnight star after Clint Eastwood used \"The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face\" as the soundtrack for one of cinema's more memorable and explicit love scenes, between the actor and Donna Mills in his 1971 film \"Play Misty for Me.\" The hushed, hymn-like ballad, with Flack's graceful soprano afloat on a bed of soft strings and piano, topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972 and received a Grammy for record of the year.",
      "\"The record label wanted to have it re-recorded with a faster tempo, but he said he wanted it exactly as it was,\" Flack told The Associated Press in 2018. \"With the song as a theme song for his movie, it gained a lot of popularity and then took off.\"",
      "In 1973, she matched both achievements with \"Killing Me Softly With His Song,\" becoming the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record.",
      "She was a classically trained pianist discovered in the late 1960s by jazz musician Les McCann, who later wrote that \"her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known.\" Versatile enough to summon the up-tempo gospel passion of Aretha Franklin, Flack often favored a more reflective and measured approach.",
      "For Flack's many admirers, she was a sophisticated and bold new presence in the music world and in the social and civil rights movements of the time, her friends including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Angela Davis, whom Flack visited in prison while Davis faced charges \u2014 for which she was acquitted \u2014 for murder and kidnapping. Flack sang at the funeral of Jackie Robinson, Major League Baseball's first Black player, and was among the many guest performers on the feminist children's entertainment project created by Marlo Thomas, \"Free to Be ... You and Me.\"",
      "Roberta Cleopatra Flack, the daughter of musicians, was born in Black Mountain, North Carolina, and raised in Arlington, Virginia. A gospel fan as a child, she was so talented a piano player that at age 15 she received a full scholarship to Howard, the historically Black university.",
      "Flack's other hits from the 1970s included the cozy \"Feel Like Makin' Love\" and two duets with her close friend and former Howard University classmate Donny Hathaway, \"Where Is the Love\" and \"The Closer I Get to You\" \u2014 a partnership that ended in tragedy. In 1979, she and Hathaway were working on an album of duets when he suffered a breakdown during recording and later that night fell to his death from his hotel room in Manhattan.",
      "\"We were deeply connected creatively,\" Flack told Vibe in 2022, upon the 50th anniversary of the million-selling \"Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway\" album. \"He could play anything, sing anything. Our musical synergy was unlike (anything) I'd had before or since.\"",
      "She never matched her first run of success, although she did have a hit in the 1980s with the Peabo Bryson duet \"Tonight, I Celebrate My Love\" and in the 1990s with the Maxi Priest duet \"Set the Night to Music.\" In the mid-90s, Flack received new attention after the Fugees recorded a Grammy-winning cover of \"Killing Me Softly,\" which she eventually performed on stage with the hip-hop group.",
      "Overall, she won five Grammys (three for \"Killing Me Softly\"), was nominated eight other times and was given a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2020, with John Legend and Ariana Grande among those praising her.",
      "\"I love that connection to other artists because we understand music, we live music, it's our language,\" Flack told songwriteruniverse.com in 2020. \"Through music we understand what we are thinking and feeling. No matter what challenge life presents, I am at home with my piano, on a stage, with my band, in the studio, listening to music. I can find my way when I hear music.\"",
      "In 2022, Beyonc\u00e9 placed Flack, Franklin and Diana Ross among others in a special pantheon of heroines name-checked in the Grammy-nominated \"Queens Remix\" of \"Break My Soul.\"",
      "Flack was briefly married to Stephen Novosel, an interracial relationship that led to tension with each of their families, and earlier had a son, the singer and keyboardist Bernard Wright. For years, she lived in Manhattan's Dakota apartment building, on the same floor as John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who became a close friend and provided liner notes for a Flack album of Beatles covers, \"Let It Be Roberta.\" She also devoted extensive time to the Roberta Flack School of Music, based in New York and attended mostly by students between ages 6 to 14.",
      "Flack had taught music in D.C.-area junior high schools for several years in her 20s, while performing after hours in clubs. She sometimes backed other singers, but her own shows at Washington's renowned Mr. Henry's attracted such celebrity patrons as Burt Bacharach, Ramsey Lewis and Johnny Mathis. The club's owner, Henry Yaffe, converted an apartment directly above into a private studio, the Roberta Flack Room.",
      "\"I wanted to be successful, a serious all-round musician,\" she told The Telegraph in 2015. \"I listened to a lot of Aretha, the Drifters, trying to do some of that myself, playing, teaching.\"",
      "Flack was signed to Atlantic Records and her debut album, \"First Take,\" a blend of gospel, soul, flamenco and jazz, came out in 1969. One track was a love song by the English folk artist Ewan MacColl: \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" written in 1957 for his future wife, singer Peggy Seeger. Flack not only knew of the ballad, but used it while working with a glee club during her years as an educator.",
      "\"I was teaching at Banneker Junior High in Washington, D.C. It was part of the city where kids weren't that privileged, but they were privileged enough to have music education. I really wanted them to read music. First, I'd get their attention. (Flack starts singing a Supremes hit) 'Stop, in the name of love.' Then I could teach them!\" she told the Tampa Bay Times in 2012.",
      "\"You have to do all sorts of things when you're dealing with kids in the inner-city,\" she said. \"I knew they'd like the part where ('The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face') goes 'The first time ever I kissed your mouth.' Ooh, 'Kissed your mouth!' Once the kids got past the giggles, we were good.\"",

      "Not long ago, soap operas ruled daytime TV. The casts of shows like \"General Hospital,\" \"All My Children\" and \"Days of Our Lives\" became part of daily life in the United States.",
      "For the first time in more than 25 years, a new daytime soap opera will debut and it is already making\u00a0history.",
      "\"Beyond the Gates\" focuses on the Dupree family, a prominent Black family living in a gated community outside Washington, D.C. Leading the cast are actors Clifton Davis and Tamara Tunie with Daphn\u00e9e Duplaix and Karla Mosley portraying their daughters.",
      "\"It's fresh, it's innovative, it's exciting,\" Duplaix said during production in December.",
      "\"This is 2025,\" added Tunie. \"The writers came out swinging. The first episode is just like 'Pfooom!'\"",
      "Those writers are making their own history with the show.",
      "\"It appears to be that we're the first Black female executive producers in all of daytime drama,\" said Sheila Ducksworth, an executive producer and president of this CBS/NAACP production.",
      "Ducksworth partnered with Michele Val Jean, who serves as executive producer, head writer and showrunner.",
      "\"I'd say it's been a couple of decades in the making that I've wanted to actually produce and make a soap opera,\" Ducksworth said. \"But what I felt was missing was one that centered on the Black experience.\"",
      "Val Jean shared a similar vision: \"I just wanted to see people that looked like me. I didn't want downtrodden Black people. I wanted rich, messy Black people that carry the stories.\"",
      "That inclusive approach extends behind the camera.",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 10:09:04 -0500",
    "summary": "The game is simple: can one player outwit, outplay and outlast 17 others isolated on a South Pacific island to win the $1 million prize? \"Sunday Morning\" travels to Fiji to go behind-the-scenes of a pioneer of reality TV with host Jeff Probst.",
    "story": [
      "Divide 18 strangers into three \"tribes\"; drop them on remote islands with little food and no shelter, and have them outwit and outplay one another until the last competitor standing is crowned the winner of a $1 million prize. When the adventure reality game show \"Survivor\" debuted on CBS in May 2000, nothing like it had been seen on American television before.",
      "Asked to describe the series, \"Survivor\" host and showrunner Jeff Probst said, \"It is a social experiment, in that it takes a group of people who don't know each other, and forces them to rely on each other, while playing this game where you vote each other out.\"",
      "Probst invited \"Sunday Morning\" to watch this experiment for ourselves, in Fiji, as he began taping Season 48, which premieres on CBS and Paramount+ this Wednesday.",
      "Asked if he still gets nervous hosting the series for the 48th time, Probst replied, \"I don't get nervous on 'Survivor.' It's weird. I've never gotten nervous. I lean into it. I love the uncertainty.\"",
      "And it's this uncertainty that's made \"Survivor\" one of the most popular shows on television for a quarter of a century. The show averages around 6 million viewers an episode. In the past 24 years, fans have collectively watched ten-and-a-half billion hours.",
      "\"When I knew 'Survivor' was going to be interesting was the first day of the first season,\" said Probst, \"when we abandoned everybody on the beach, and Richard Hatch \u2013 who ended up winning the first season \u2013 got up in a power position in a tree. And he was looking down on everyone, and he said, 'I think we should all talk!'\u00a0 And Sue Hawk, a truck driver from Wisconsin, looked up and said, 'Where I'm from, we work while we talk.'\"",
      "While Probst had no doubt, \"Survivor\" almost didn't happen. Mark Burnett, the British TV producer behind hits like \"The Apprentice\" and \"Shark Tank\" (and now President Trump's newly-appointed special envoy to the United Kingdom), re-imagined a Swedish reality series (\"Expedition: Robinson\") and took his idea to just about every U.S. TV network.",
      "\"And every network said, 'No. That's a crazy idea. We don't wanna do it,'\" said Probst. \"But Mark is not easily deterred. So, he went out and got sponsors for the entire show.\"",
      "At the time, Probst hosted music shows on cable TV (including VH1's \"Rock & Roll Jeopardy!\"). \"I was literally the last person hired,\" he said. \"I heard Mark talking about 'Survivor' on a radio interview. And he described the show. I knew when I heard it; I told all my friends, 'This is my show, this is what I've been waiting for.'\"",
      "Today, Probst (now also the showrunner) has his hands in every aspect of production, including combing through more than 15,000 audition tapes that arrive each year. \"I know within 30 seconds, honestly, within 30 seconds, I'm pretty sure you're gonna be on the show or not,\" he said. \"Some people are compelling immediately.\"",
      "People like Stephanie Berger, a technical product manager from New York City, and one of this season's chosen ones. Asked in Fiji what her strategy for the game will be, Berger replied, \"In my, like, day-to-day life, everyone will tell you that I get to be the alpha, like, I like to be in charge. I like control. And I know that I cannot come out here and do that.\"",
      "Kyle Fraser is a contestant from Roanoke, Virginia. \"When I first started watching 'Survivor,' I knew that this game was for me,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"Are you willing to lie? Like, where do you draw the line in your game?\"",
      "\"Listen, I am gonna have to lie,\" Fraser said. \"You know, I'm not gonna tell people I'm a lawyer.\"",
      "Contestants not only need to build trust through any means possible; they have to win mental and physical challenges from the moment they arrive, or risk getting voted off.",
      "Probst says what we see is never staged or scripted, including tribal councils, where he grills contestants off-the-cuff, a skill he's developed over time.",
      "I said, \"You're a student of psychology and anthropology.\"",
      "\"Without the degrees!\" Probst laughed. \"I've always loved all of that. I just never formally applied it. I didn't want to be a psychologist; I wanted to be a storyteller.\"",
      "What does make it on television is carefully selected from thousands of hours worth of video shot around the clock for 26 days, in what is one of the largest television productions on Earth. \"It's a great trick, because when you're watching 'Survivor' it does feel intimate, and it is,\" Probst said. \"When the tribes are on the beaches, there's just a small handful of crew there and producers. But when you get to a challenge or tribal council, you know, there's cameras everywhere. We have roughly 400 people that are our international crew. Then we have another 400 Fijians who work with us as well. So, we're close to 1,000 people.\"",
      "Each season films in the summer, with crews arriving months in advance, turning a resort into a production village.",
      "Roberta Limjap, who works in the art department, said, \"It's not only work, it's family.\"",
      "All of the materials, equipment and props are produced here. \"Everything is made from scratch,\" she said. \"You can't buy this.\"",
      "Dozens of young production assistants test every detail of the challenges while crews plot camera angles.",
      "I had my chance. And yes, it's much harder than it looks. And tribal members often compete exhausted and hungry. They are not fed when the cameras are off.",
      "I tried my hand at survival. Opening up a coconut is not easy. \"You know what I'm afraid of? Taking off my thumb,\" I laughed.",
      "Co-executive producer Jimmy Quigley coached me through starting a fire, while on my first try with a spear gun, I caught a fish. Beginner's luck!",
      "What isn't luck is \"Survivor\"'s staying power. \"That freedom to play is what keeps us out here in the middle of Fiji,\" said Probst, who \u2013 after 47 seasons \u2013 is the ultimate survivor.",
      "\"It sounds like you're in this until the end?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm in it now,\" Probst replied. \"I don't have any thoughts of not being in it. But I mean, yeah, if you're saying at 86, I mean, maybe I'm too old then! But I never really look at it that way. I feel like I'm a part of a team. And I've said to the people I work with, 'As long as you all keep showing up, I'll keep showin' up.'\"",

    "summary": "With 18 galleries around the globe, he's been called \"the biggest art dealer in the history of the world.\" Larry Gagosian talks about his estimated billion-dollar-a-year business and why, at age 79, he's still energized by the hustle.",
    "story": [
      "On any night, he can have art openings in Paris, in London, or at his flagship gallery in New York. With 18 galleries around the globe, Larry Gagosian has more exhibition space than most museums. His annual revenues are estimated at over a billion dollars, which (as The New Yorker put it) may make Gagosian \"the biggest art dealer in the history of the world.\"",
      "In 2022, when Andy Warhol's \"Shot Sage Blue Marilyn\" set an auction record for a 20th century artist at Christie's, the winning bidder was Larry Gagosian. The final price, with fees: $195 million.",
      "I asked, \"That must have been a crazy moment?\"",
      "\"When you're bidding at that level,\" Gagosian said, \"your adrenaline is \u2026 it's very exciting.\"",
      "\"It's a brutal business.\"",
      "\"It's a blood sport.\"",
      "\"What do you love about this most?\" I asked.",
      "\"I love the challenge,\" Gagosian smiled. \"I love winning.\"",
      "Gagosian represents more than 100 artists, and shows the works of Picasso, Warhol, and de Kooning. His clients include billionaire mega-collectors like New York Mets owner Steve Cohen, music mogul David Geffen, and cosmetics heir Leonard Lauder. Gagosian said, \"That's why New York is such a great city for an art dealer, because you have all these super-competitive rich guys trying to (you know, in a certain way) outdo each other \u2013 'I got one.' 'Oh, I got one better.'\"",
      "Gagosian, who grew up in an Armenian family in Los Angeles, never had any formal art training. In the 1970s, he was working as a parking attendant. Then he saw somebody selling posters on the street. \"I saw that and I said, 'Jeez, I could do that.' And so, I bought basically the same posters, I literally paid a dollar apiece, and then put a little aluminum frame on them and put 'em on a peg board and tried to get as close to twenty bucks as I could, which is a pretty good profit margin.\"",
      "He built it into a business, and started having shows. In 1981, a young New York artist caught his eye: Jean-Michel Basquiat. Gagosian bought three of his paintings on the spot. \"And sadly, I sold them all. Wish I still owned them!\"",
      "He'd give Basquiat his first West Coast exhibition, which put Gagosian's gallery on the map. \"It was a big deal in L.A.,\" he said. \"We did the show and it was, like, mobbed. The buzz was \u2013 I'd never experienced anything like that in my gallery.\"",
      "But Gagosian knew that New York was the center of the art world, and in 1985, he relocated.",
      "How was he received in the New York art world? \"They didn't like me,\" he said. \"I guess they thought I was gonna, you know, cause some trouble.\"",
      "\"Well, you kinda did!\" I said.",
      "\"I'd rather not go into that litany, but I was roughed up quite a bit by competitors, I think very unfairly.\"",
      "He earned a nickname, \"Gogo,\" which he says actually started when he was young. \"When I was kid, my friends had a hard time pronouncing my name, Gagosian. And that's really where it started. But then it became, people associate it with something else.\"",
      "But Gagosian made an important ally, the esteemed dealer Leo Castelli. On a walk together one day, Castelli stopped a non-descript man in the street: \"And so I said, 'Well, who was that?' 'Oh, that's Si Newhouse.' And I'll never forget his very words: 'He can buy anything.'\"",
      "Newhouse, who owned the Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine empire, would become Gagosian's first big client. At Sotheby's 1988 auction of Jasper Johns' painting \"False Start,\" they sat side-by-side: \"He didn't want to be seen bidding,\" said Gagosian. \"So, he would literally nudge me when he wanted to bid. And I bid, I think it was $17 million. And he got the painting.\"",
      "It was a record for a living artist at the time. \"It was, you know, like, jaw-dropping,\" Gagosian said.",
      "But that price seems almost quaint today.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think there's a billion-dollar painting out there?\"",
      "\"Maybe; I don't see why not,\" Gagosian replied. \"A young artist, if he's really talented, can sell for a million dollars.\"",
      "I asked Gagosian about the comments of one of his former rivals, Arne Glimcher of Pace Gallery, who said five years ago, \"This market has nothing to do with art. It's all about how fast one can make money.\"",
      "\"You know, there's a certain truth to what he's saying,\" Gagosian said, \"but I don't think it's just about money at all. I don't think, if people didn't love art, you know, I think they wouldn't buy it at that level. I don't think it's just an asset class. And it's not just about money. It's just gotten more expensive to buy really great art.\"",
      "\"Do you think in any way it distances ordinary people from loving art?\"",
      "\"No. I think it actually makes art seem more interesting. Wow! Somebody spent X amount of money for a painting? Wow, that's fascinating!\"",
      "Gagosian \u2013 who's had some high-profile romances, is single, and has no children \u2013 is still energized by the hustle. \"I guess to a degree I thrive on it,\" he said. \"It gives you something to go for.\"",
      "\"Why do you thrive on it?\"",
      "\"Cause I'm tenacious. And because I like to win.\"",
      "\"What's the win for you?\"",
      "\"The win is to keep it going. The win is to survive at the top. There's no real finish line.\"",
      "But there is, of course. Gagosian turns 80 in April. And the man who GQ magazine called \"The closest thing the art world has to a Caesar,\" still has no plans of succession for his empire.",
      "So, can there be a Gagosian without Gagosian? \"I don't know; that's the question,\" he said. \"I don't want to think it's an impossibility. I think it's a serious challenge. But I'm not ready to pass the reins. I enjoy it too much.\"",
      "I asked, \"Are you ever gonna be, do you think?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"Well, it kind of means you're, like, never at rest.\"",
      "\"Well, there's no time to rest, really. It's overrated!\" he laughed.",

      "\"We're all left trying to understand what is going on. Why was this meeting canceled? It's an important meeting. What's the plan for flu vaccines this year,\" Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA advisory committee and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News.",
      "Offit said he received the notification that the meeting was canceled shortly after 4 p.m. The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee was supposed to meet on March 13 to discuss how to update the shots for the next flu season, Offit said.",
      "Some of the other committee members said they had not received any notification about the upcoming meeting being canceled. Offit said the email he received was addressed to all of the committee's members.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed Thursday that the meeting had been canceled.",
      "\"The FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season,\" the spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, said in a statement.",
      "It is possible for the FDA to make the pick for flu shots without consulting the panel, a former federal health official said, though it would be unprecedented in recent history.",
      "The panel often largely adopts the WHO's recommendations without changes. However, the committee's input has also spurred major changes in recent years, like a push to abandon use of a now-extinct flu strain in the shots.",
      "The companies that manufacture influenza vaccines rely on the FDA each year to pick out the strains to use in shots made for the American market. The specific strains are chosen each year based on predictions of what flu variants will be circulating in the coming winter.",
      "That selection is usually done by the committee in early March, drawing in large part on recommendations from a meeting of the World Health Organization's advisers reviewing data on influenza from across the Northern Hemisphere.",
      "\"Because the vaccine is grown in eggs, for the most part, it requires six months to produce. So March is six months before September, which is when these vaccines roll out,\" said Offit.",

These estimates of effectiveness against hospitalization, released Thursday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, are considered high for flu vaccines.",
      "But another metric of the shot's effectiveness, looking at protection against infections that result in outpatient visits to places like urgent care clinics or emergency rooms, was worse.

    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 11:33:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Arline Geronimus' research shows how societal pressures like institutional racism, classism, financial stressors or the environmental can impact not just the length of life, but also the quality of life for marginalized communities suffering chronic diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Forty years ago, the public was outraged.\u00a0 It seemed there was a wave of teenage girls, particularly Black teenage girls, getting pregnant. \"This was a new idea, this new deviant class of people, and it was portrayed in these terms that were really not accurate: babies having babies,\" said Arline Geronimus.",
      "Geronimus was at the time a graduate student.\u00a0 The prevailing wisdom was that high rates of infant mortality in the Black community were because women were having children when they were too young. \"I had worked in a school for pregnant teens. And none of what I was hearing, and had taken as common sense myself, was what I was seeing,\" she said.",
      "Geronimus looked at the numbers and found that, actually, younger mothers were having more successful pregnancies. She said, \"For the Black women, the lowest risk ages were in the teens and the late teens. And then they went straight up, so that by the 20s, and certainly by the mid-to-late 20s, there was substantially more risk of infant mortality if you had a baby, compared to if you were 18 or 19. And by 35, things were off the charts.\"",
      "How did people react to what she found? \"Not very well!\" Geronimus said. \"People thought I was promoting teen childbearing. The papers wrote columns where they called it things like, 'Research Queen Says Let Them Have Babies.'\u00a0 I got death threats.\"",
      "Geronimus became a professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan, where she teaches to this day. She lowered her profile, but also widened her perspective, examining indicators like the lower life expectancy of Black Americans (72.8 years) compared to white Americans (77.5).",
      "She developed a theory: that stress caused by racism and other societal pressures contributes to poor health. She named it \"Weathering.\"",
      "\"The idea of weathering was connoting sort of how a rock, for example, would be weathered by hundreds of years of rain and wind,\" she said. \"It's gonna affect it [and] absolutely wear it down. I like the word weathering in particular, because it also has another meaning, which is that you weather the storm.\"",
      "The weathering theory deals with not just length of life, but quality of life. For example, while on average Black women outlive white men (76.5 years versus 75.1), Geronimus found that Black women faced shorter active life expectancies (59 years) than white men (64) \u2013 that is, Black women become disabled at earlier ages.",
      "After decades of working on the theory, she pulled it all together in a book called, \"Weathering: The Extraordinary Stress of Ordinary Life in an Unjust Society\" (Little, Brown Spark).\u00a0 She defines weathering as the way that structural racism makes life very hard. But there are a lot of different factors. \"This is not something that just affects people of color; it can be a class issue as well?\" I asked.",
      "Geronimus said, \"It can be a class issue, it can be a stigmatized group issue; anybody who's human is capable of becoming weathered, and will become weathered to some degree, if they're also oppressed or marginalized or suffering endless stressors, whether it's environmental or material hardships or hunger, or whether it's the fact that you're not affirmed or valued, and you have to question where you belong, and what it's safe to do or say in different situations.\"",
      "Dr. Kimberlydawn Wisdom has spent much of her career putting Geronimus' theories into practice, trying to overcome the impacts of weathering: \"She endured a lot for this work. And we just have to applaud her. Her courage is remarkable.\"",
      "Wisdom is the senior vice president of community health and equity at Henry Ford Health in Detroit. She also served as Michigan's first surgeon general.",
      "She notes how day-to-day stress actually changes the body down to the cellular level, leading to premature aging. \"The body keeps score,\" she said. \"So, take diabetes, take hypertension, take cardiovascular disease, infant mortality, maternal mortality \u2013 just multiply the poor outcome by two or by three, and that's what you see in the populations of color. So, it's like the Caucasian population can catch a cold, but populations of color actually develop pneumonia.\"",
      "For example, the latest studies show infant mortality rates for Black Americans that are more than double those of white Americans (10.9 versus 4.52).",
      "To take on the challenge, Dr. Wisdom founded the WIN Network, which stands for the Women-Inspired Neighborhood Network. Expectant mothers are given health care, guidance and support through pregnancy and beyond, which has led to maternal and infant deaths falling, and birthweights rising.",
      "Courtney Anderson said the experience of having her third child, Kalani, through WIN was great. \"She's a happy baby. Most happiest baby I got,\" Anderson said.",
      "Anderson had her first child, Kamrine, before she was in the WIN Network. He was followed a year later by his brother, Kristian. \"With my first child \u2026 I had my hands full, kind of stressed. Kind of bummed out. Post-partum depression.\" But she says the support she received through WIN was a major improvement, increasing her happiness, which in turn has impacted her children positively. \"It's going to affect them really well to know that their mom's happy,\" Anderson said. \"When mom is happy, they get it, and they have a lot more.\"",
      "I asked Wisdom, \"What would you say to people who would kind of maybe blow this off and say, 'Everybody has stress, everybody has things to deal with, what's the big deal? Take care of it yourself. Be responsible for your own health'?\"",
      "\"Yes, people should eat healthy, have healthy behaviors, but yet we see the weathering, when we look through the lens of what's really happening in a society,\" Wisdom replied. \"You can do all those things and have a poor outcome. See, the typical narrative is you eat healthy, you go to school, you get a college degree, you have a good life and you live to 80 or 90.\u00a0 That happens with one population. When you find another population that eats healthy, goes to college, gets an education, gets her Ph.D., and dies of maternal mortality, something is wrong.\"",
      "When asked if the concept of \"weathering\" could be seen as another way of making Black people into victims, or building in another stereotype, Geronimus said, \"That couldn't be farther from the truth. Even if you go back to slavery, no one was working harder, or doing more. But the people who pronounce on 'Black people's poverty is self-inflicted 'cause they're too lazy or too irresponsible,' they're just wrong.\"",
      "At the end of the day, it got me thinking about my own family.\u00a0 My parents died in their 70s. Two siblings died in their early 60s \u2026 all of them much too soon.\u00a0 There were certain ailments \u2013 diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure \u2013 that were expected almost, or that just kind of comes with the territory. And Wisdom says it shouldn't come with the territory \u2013 or that the reason it came with the territory was due to weathering.",
      "Wisdom said, \"Many people of color, families say that, 'Oh, we all get diabetes. We all get cancer. I mean, that's part of the natural course of life. That's the life course.' That is not the life course.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-gold-card-eb5-visa-5-million-immigration-oligarch-cbs-news-explains/",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 19:54:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump is floating the idea of a new \"gold card\" visa that would be sold to wealthy foreigners for $5 million.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday unveiled a new pathway to residency: a \"gold card\" aimed at wealthy foreigners willing to pay millions for the right to live in the U.S.",
      "That term is a play on the green card, more officially known as a permanent residency card, which allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the U.S. Green cards are most frequently awarded to foreigners who marry U.S. citizens or to those who receive one through their employer, with the latter process taking an average of three years to complete, according to the Cato Institute.",
      "The new program comes as the Trump administration moves to change the country's rules for who can legally live, work and gain citizenship in the U.S. That includes tightening restrictions on many types of immigration in the U.S. and pushing to\u00a0end birthright citizenship, the constitutionally protected right to citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.",
      "The U.S. already opens the door to wealthy non-U.S. citizens who want residency through what is known as an EB-5 visa. But that program, launched in 1990, has long been cited for potential\u00a0abuses, including one prominent case from almost a decade ago that involved owners of a Vermont ski resort embezzling millions from foreign investors who hoped to score visas through the program.",
      "Yet both the new gold card and the EB-5 program have a common goal: Attracting foreign capital by allowing rich non-citizens to ante up in exchange for a U.S. residency visa.",
      "\"It's going to be a route to citizenship, and wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card, they'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday.",
      "Here's what to know about the gold card plan.",
      "What is Trump's gold card?",
      "The gold card will offer a new route for rich non-U.S. citizens to gain a valid visa to live and work in the U.S., according to Mr. Trump, who spoke Tuesday about the new visa with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick from the Oval Office.",
      "The cost of each new visa will be $5 million, Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"We're going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million, and that's going to give you green card privileges, plus,\" the president added.",
      "Green cards allow recipients to live permanently in the U.S. and work for whomever they choose. By comparison, some immigrants, such as those on H-1B visas, are locked into working for the employer that sponsored their visa.",
      "Green card holders can also travel in and out of the U.S. without restriction, and are able to start the process to become a U.S. citizen.",
      "When will the gold card be available?",
      "Lutnick said the gold cards would be available starting in about two weeks.",
      "Will the gold card replace the EB-5 visa?",
      "Yes, with Lutnick on Tuesday describing the EB-5 program as \"full of nonsense, make believe and fraud.\"",
      "\"So the President said, rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program, we're going to end the EB-5 program,\" Lutnick said in joining Mr. Trump to outline the gold card program from the Oval Office. \"We're going to replace it with the Trump Gold Card, which is really a Green Card Gold.\"",
      "One major difference between the gold card and the EB-5 visa \u2014 the cost, with the latter requiring applicants to invest about $1 million in the U.S., typically by putting the money into a business. But the EB-5 visa also comes with a host of other requirements, such as documenting that the investment will create or preserve 10 permanent full-time jobs for U.S. workers.",
      "How much money could the gold card raise for the U.S.?",
      "Mr. Trump suggested that the the U.S. could \"sell maybe a million of these cards, maybe more than that.\"",
      "At $5 million each, selling 1 million gold cards could raise $5 trillion, he said.",
      "\"And if you sell 10 million of the cards, that's a total of $50 trillion,\" Mr. Trump added. \"We have $35 trillion in debt. That'll be nice, so we'll see.\"",
      "Typically, the number of annual applicants for EB-5 visas is far lower than what Mr. Trump projects for the gold card. About 8,000 people obtained investor visas in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, according to the Homeland Security Department's most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics.",
      "If roughly 8,000 people received gold cards each year, the U.S. would raise about $40 billion annually through the program.",
      "The U.S. is a top immigration destination for rich investors, according to Henley & Partners, a company that provides immigration advisory services. The group estimated\u00a0that the U.S. had the second-biggest net influx of millionaires in 2024, following the United Arab Emirates, at about 3,800 foreign millionaires moving stateside last year.",
      "Who could qualify for a gold card?",
      "Aside from having $5 million to pay the U.S. government, gold card applicants would also have to meet other criteria, Lutnick said.",
      "\"They'll have to go through vetting, of course, we're going to make sure they're wonderful world class global citizens,\" he said, without providing details.",
      "Asked by reporters if Russian oligarchs could qualify for the visa, Mr. Trump responded, \"Possibly.\"",
      "He added, \"Hey, I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people. It's possible. They're not as wealthy as they used to be. I think they could afford \u2014 I think they could afford $5 million.\"",
      "Do other nations offer gold cards?",
      "Yes, investor visas are common around the world. More than 100 countries offer \"golden visas\" to wealthy individuals, including the U.S., United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy, according to Henley & Partners.",
      "Does the gold card need congressional approval?",
      "Congress determines qualifications for citizenship, but Mr. Trump said gold cards would not require congressional approval.",
      "\"We have it all worked out from the legal standpoint. It's totally legal to do,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's somewhat like a green card, but at a higher level of sophistication \u2014 it's a road to citizenship for people, and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in, meaning companies will pay for people to get in and to have long, long term status in the country.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tax-refund-status-2025-irs/",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 17:40:40 -0500",
    "summary": "IRS data shows that the average refund check so far is about $2,200, or $1,000 less than a year earlier. Here's what experts say.",
    "story": [
      "With tax season well underway, early data on the average tax refund shows that Americans are receiving about one-third less than they did a year earlier.",
      "The average refund check in 2025 stood at $2,169 as of Feb. 14, about 32% below the average $3,207 refund issued at the same time last year, the IRS said in its most recent tax update. The agency began accepting tax returns on Jan. 27 and will continue to do so until April 15 except for taxpayers who request an extension.",
      "Those numbers don't necessarily mean that individual taxpayers will get a smaller refund, experts note. Refunds are typically smaller at the start of the tax season because low- and middle-income workers with simpler tax returns are often the first to file, while higher-income Americans or people with more complicated taxes tend to wait until closer to the April 15 deadline to file their returns.",
      "\"Many employees, all they have is a W2 \u2014 they have smaller refunds or smaller amounts to pay because they have withholding through their jobs,\" Keith Hall, CEO of the National Association for the Self-Employed (NASE) and a certified CPA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "At the same time, Hall said some small business owners are reporting receiving financial tax forms, such as dividend or brokerage account statements, later than in past years. That often leads businesses to hold off on filing with the IRS until they've gathered all their tax documents.",
      "So far, fewer Americans have filed their taxes in the season's opening weeks when compared with 2024, the IRS data shows. About 33 million returns had been submitted through through Feb. 14, a 5% decline from the same period a year ago.",
      "The IRS also noted that tax data tends to \"even out as more tax returns come in.\" In its most recent data release, the agency said it expects tax return filings to \"level out in future weeks as the April filing deadline approaches.\"",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "Taxpayers should file as soon as possible because that will enable them to get their refund faster, Hall said. Other tax experts are also urging consumers to file quickly because of concerns that IRS job cuts ordered by the Trump administration could add to challenges in getting tax returns processed this year.",
      "Most refunds are issued in fewer than 21 calendar days if you file your taxes electronically, according to the IRS. Taxes filed on paper require more time because human IRS agents must process those returns, which can add weeks to getting a refund.",
      "Taxpayers can monitor the status of their 2025 refund using the IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund?\u00a0tool, with e-filers able to check on their return 24 hours after filing. People who file on paper won't be able to see their refund status for four weeks after they mail their return to the IRS, the agency says.",
      "About half of Americans intend to file their taxes by the end of February, with the other half planning to finish their returns in March and April, according to the National Retail Federation's annual tax return survey. About half of taxpayers say they expect a refund this year, it found.",

    "summary": "Consumers still coping with high food costs face scalding hot coffee prices, with retail costs up 75% in recent years.",
    "story": [
      "It's not only the surging cost of eggs that is making breakfast pricier these days \u2014 the price of coffee is also spiking because of a confluence of factors.",
      "The cost of wholesale arabica beans \u2014 the most popular on the planet \u2014 surpassed $4 a pound for the first time this month and have doubled over the past year, running up from less than two bucks a pound in January 2024 to a record $4.30 a pound on February 13, 2025, according\u00a0to\u00a0futures contracts traded in New York.",
      "For consumers still grappling with high food costs, that means soaring prices in the grocery aisle. The retail price of ground coffee hit an all-time high of $7 a pound in January, up 75% from $4 in January 2020, government data\u00a0shows.",
      "Coffee drinkers are likely to see even steeper prices over the next three or four months, with Andrea Illy, chairman of Italian roaster and global retailer Illycaff\u00e8, recently\u00a0predicting\u00a0that bean prices could climb 25% this year.",
      "Unlike some products, coffee is viewed as essential by many consumers, making them more willing to pay up for their java fixes. Without a direct substitute for coffee, retailers and suppliers generally have greater room to raise their prices.",
      "\"Coffee, as we all know, it's a pass-through category,\" J.M. Smucker CEO Mark Smucker said in an earnings\u00a0call in November. \"We've been very pleased with our performance in the quarter, despite the fact that we continue to see significant inflation,\" said the executive, whose company's brands include Folgers and Cafe Bustelo.",
      "Cost of climate change",
      "As with the cost of other global commodities, supply and demand are a large part of the equation. Getting caffeinated is likely to become an ever-costlier proposition because of rising temperatures, droughts and excessive rains striking Brazil and Vietnam, the world's two biggest producers.",
      "The 2024 coffee growing season saw a drought followed by August frost in Brazil, and flooding in October came in the wake of a drought in Vietnam. Brazil's coffee exports during the month were down 7.4% year-over-year and Vietnam's December export fell nearly 40%, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from the International Coffee Organization.",
      "\"When the crop in Brazil does not produce as much coffee as expected in the year, that causes the prices to shoot up,\" Gregory Zomfotis, founder and CEO of Gregory's Coffee, told CBS News.",
      "\"Some of the major producers have really not seen the production levels that were expected and quite far from it, so that's caused a severe spike in the price of coffee,\" added Zomfotis, whose company operates more than 50 stores nationwide and expect to purchase up to 700,000 pounds of coffee this year.",
      "Amid those supply constraints, global demand for coffee in growing. For example, consumption is up 150% over 10 years in China \u2014 the world's most populous country, according\u00a0to\u00a0the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Other factors also are contributing to the pricing pressures, including politics. President Trump on Tuesday vowed to proceed next week with his previous threats of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. A levy on Mexico, whose largest coffee export market is the U.S., would likely push prices up further.",
      "Separately, a new European Union law that is now set to take effect in December prohibits the sale of products, including coffee, if companies can't show they are not linked to deforestation\u00a0 \u2014 a bid to lessen greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss. That effort to address the climate crisis could further tighten supplies of coffee beans.",
      "Geopolitical conflicts are also a factor in rising coffee costs. Fighting between Israel and Hamas has caused havoc in the Red Sea, which carries 30% of the world's container traffic, including coffee from Vietnam. Slowdowns in the Red Sea and the Suez Canal meant as many as 5 billion bags of coffee had not yet arrived in Europe, the International Coffee Organization reported in December.",

It bills itself as the most \"advanced internet system,\" providing access to users in remote locations.

      "Asked by CBS News whether Musk's involvement could pose a conflict of interest given that the FAA regulates SpaceX and his companies are a major user of the airspace, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier this month that the entrepreneur isn't involved in setting agency policy.",
      "\"I was very conscious of anyone who comes in \u2014 I don't want to see conflicts of interest,\" Duffy said on Feb. 19 from the FAA's ATC Command Center in Warrenton, Virginia. \"So [Musk] was talking to air traffic controllers, didn't plug into the system, but looked at the terminals that they use... They had a back and forth about what works well for you, what doesn't work well.\"",
      "\"[T]hey spoke freely about these are the problems that we have. And so it was nothing about the way that SpaceX uses the airspace. It was about how do controllers do their job,\" Duffy added.",

      "When will the Starbucks drink menu change?",
      "The Starbucks menu changes will go into effect on March 4.",
      "The company offers recommendations for fans of the soon-to-be eliminated drinks to try instead. For example, a spokesperson encouraged Iced Matcha Lemonade fans to try the Green Tea Lemonade, which will remain on the menu.",
      "For fans of the Royal English Breakfast Latte, the London Fog Latte shares similar sweet floral notes, a spokesperson said.",
      "Peter Cohan, associate professor of management practice at Babson College, lauded the coming menu changes as a step in the right direction for the coffee company, but said this move alone won't be enough to turn the brand around.",
      "\"I think about Starbucks and the amount of frustration people have when they're ordering and want to pick something up and it's not ready; there's a lot of confusion,\" he said. \"And Brian Niccol is good at figuring out how to uncomplicate things and speed up operations by getting rid of things that are not working.\"",
      "As far as the menu changes go, while a small share of customers might miss the beverages that are being eliminated, Starbucks probably \"did the math and figured the cost of keeping them on the menu was greater than the benefits,\" Cohan said.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Sales data show many Europeans, seemingly angry with Elon Musk as he navigates his close relationship with President Trump to influence U.S. policy, may be choosing to steer clear of Tesla vehicles. A sharp decline in sales comes as anti-Musk ads appear in the U.K. and other countries alluding a comparison to Adolf Hitler.",
      "Tesla new vehicle sales fell across the continent by nearly half in January, plunging by 45% year-on-year, according to data compiled by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA). In hard numbers, Tesla sold just under 9,950 vehicles in Europe in January. For the same month in 2024, the company sold just over 18,100 new vehicles.",
      "The drop in sales has hurt Tesla's share price, which had nearly doubled in the first month after Mr. Trump's election victory to a record high. Most of those gains have since been lost, and Tesla's market cap has plunged below the $1 trillion mark. The stock, which as of early Wednesday traded for roughly $305 in the U.S., remains up 54% over the last 12 months, buoyed by the company's ambitious plans for self-driving cars and humanoid robots.",
      "In Germany, Tesla sales fell nearly 60% in January year-on-year as would-be buyers voted with their wallets \u2014 possibly angered by Musk's purported meddling in the country's federal elections last weekend, which saw the far-right AfD party he backed become the country's second most popular.",
      "In France, Tesla's sales in January fell 63%. The plunge came after Musk backed far-right parties in that country and attacked left-leaning ones, although the impact of his political activities on Tesla's financial performance is hard to gauge and could reflect other factors, such as mounting competition from other EV makers.",
      "Tesla sales in the U.S. have also been declining, falling 1% in 2024 compared to the prior year \u2014 the automaker's first annual sales decline in 12 years despite global EV sales rising 7.3%. As CBS News' MoneyWatch reported this week, Wall Street analysts have said Musk's political activities could alienate consumers previously loyal to the brand, and protests have erupted at a number of Tesla dealerships in the U.S.",
      "\"Musk's DOGE related actions and more powerful alliance with Trump clearly could alienate some consumers to move away from the Tesla brand,\" analysts for the U.S. financial services firm Wedbush wrote in a Tuesday company report on the automaker. \"There is some momentum around this effort in Europe and pockets of the U.S. as well since November. That said, we view this as containable brand issues for Tesla for now that are not a major cause for concern.\"",
      "A similar trend has been seen in Europe. While Tesla's European sales numbers plunged in January, ACEA data show sales of electric vehicles overall surged by 34%, with buyers increasingly eyeing options from China and the continent's own automakers.",
      "In the U.K., after Musk attacked Prime Minister Keir Starmer and called for the release of a jailed far-right activist, January sales fell a comparatively gentler 12% year-on-year, but anger at Musk has been visible on British roadsides after an activist group called \"Everybody Hates Elon\" pasted over bus stop ads with posters showing Musk making a hand gesture that strongly resembled a Nazi salute at one of Mr. Trump's inauguration events.",
      "Musk has neither admitted nor denied his intent with the gesture, but he mocked the criticism of it, saying in a message on his social media platform X that, \"the 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.\"",
      "On the protest group's posters, the words \"0 to 1939 in three seconds\" appear above the image of Musk, alluding to the start of World War II.",

      "Apple shareholders on Tuesday rejected a proposal to end the iPhone maker's diversity, equity and inclusion program.",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, had called on Apple to follow other major companies in backing off from DEI, which has come under fire from Republicans and from President Donald Trump.",
      "\"DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,\" according to the\u00a0proposal offered by the group. It offered a similar proposal at Costco's annual meeting in January that shareholders also\u00a0rejected.",
      "\"The risks to Apple stemming from continuing to push these divisive and value-destroying agendas is only increasing in light of President Trump's recent executive order focusing the Department of Justice on rooting out illegal discrimination being carried out in the name of DEI,\" Stephen Padfield, executive director of the National Center for Public Policy Research's Free Enterprise Project, said in a prerecorded statement played to Apple shareholders on Tuesday.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear, DEI is out and annual merit is in,\" Padfield said.",
      "In responding to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple defended its diversity program as an integral part of its corporate culture, crediting the policies in part for making the technology giant the most valuable company in the world.",
      "\"We've never had quotas or targets for Apple. Our strength has always come from hiring the very best people and then providing a culture of collaboration,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a question-and-answer period at the meeting, while conceding the company may need to revise aspects of its diversity policies \"as the legal landscape\" around DEI evolves.",
      "\"But our North Star of dignity and respect for everyone, and our work to that end, will never waver,\" he said.",
      "Apple disclosed in 2022 that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees; early two-thirds of its employees were men.",
      "Mr. Trump slammed the decision by Apple shareholders to reject the proposal to end the company's DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Apple should get rid of DEI rules, not just make adjustments to them. DEI was a hoax that has been very bad for our country. DEI is gone!!!\" he wrote in a social media post on Wednesday.",

      "But that trend has reversed of late, with Ford,\u00a0Google, McDonald's, Meta,\u00a0Target, Walmart and other large corporations scaling back their diversity initiatives under pressure from conservative activists emboldened by court rulings and by President Trump, who has banned DEI programs across the federal government.",
      "Shifting DEI landscape",
      "Certain forms of DEI have become more legally risky than just a few years ago, yet practices such as employers posing standardized questions in recruitment to mitigate implicit bias are legally sound, according to David Glasgow, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law and executive director of its Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.",
      "\"DEI is a really broad umbrella term covering things like disabilities, parental leave and flexible work. The anti-DEI folks have done a good job of driving the narrative that it's all about racial quotas and preferences,\" which in reality is just a narrow slice of such initiatives, Glasgow told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some companies' response to the current legal and political climate is a matter of rebranding, Glasgow said. Businesses may ditch the terms diversity, equity and inclusion, while substituting references to \"welcoming\" and \"belonging.\"",
      "\"[I]t's more about getting anti-DEI activists off their back,\" Glasgow said.",
      "Critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. By contrast, advocates of these policies say that supporting inclusivity doesn't inhibit companies from rewarding top-performing employees, while also helping organizations create a respectful workplace culture.",
      "Despite the pushback on diversity, roughly half of corporate leaders who were surveyed after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration said they weren't considering rolling back their DEI programs, according to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0of 350 C-suite executives from Littler, a law firm focused on labor and employment issues.

      "Elon Musk has long been Tesla's public face, convincing consumers to pay premium prices for electric vehicles that promised to help combat climate change. But as Musk has navigated toward conservative politics and emerged as a close adviser to President Trump, some Tesla owners say they are reconsidering their loyalty to the brand.",
      "Wall Street analysts worry the Tesla brand is showing some cracks, with sales falling 1% in 2024 from the prior year \u2014 the automaker's first annual sales decline in 12 years, even as global EV sales rose 7.3%. They also say Musk's political activities risk alienating consumers, while protests have erupted at a number of\u00a0Tesla dealerships across the U.S. over his proximity to the Trump administration.",
      "\"It would seem that potential consumers for Tesla EVs might be turning away from the company because they don't appreciate Elon Musk's close relationship to President Trump and the administration's tariff policies,\" Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, the carmaker's stock has dropped 17% due to the \"visible perceived downside impact\" of Musk's involvement with the White House, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a Feb. 19 research note.",
      "The inextricable link between Musk, the world's richest person, and Tesla's brand illustrates both the opportunities and risks of tying a company's fortunes to the personality of a single executive. Musk has led Tesla from its days as a scrappy startup to the world's biggest producer of EVs, growing its valuation to more than $1.2 trillion, making it one of the world's most valuable businesses.",
      "But Musk's recent\u00a0inflammatory public statements\u00a0and his role leading Mr. Trump's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency,\u00a0or DOGE, appear to be turning off some Americans. Consumers' political leanings can play into their decision to buy an electric vehicle, with Democrats three times more likely to buy an EV than Republicans, according to a 2024 Pew Research Center poll.",
      "Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about the impact of Musk's political activities on the automaker.",
      "Customer dissatisfaction",
      "Among the one-time Tesla fans who have had second thoughts is Minah Oh, 40, of Massachusetts, who told CBS MoneyWatch that Musk's political activities led her to sell her Tesla Model X, which she had owned since 2015, in October.",
      "\"I got it because it was great for the environment, and at the time he was more on the liberal side of politics,\" Oh told CBS MoneyWatch about Musk. But, she added, she felt that Musk by last fall had become \"volatile and turned radically right.\"",
      "Oh also said she was concerned that driving a Tesla could signal to others that she's aligned with Musk's political opinions.",
      "\"I wouldn't want people to think I was a Trumper or that I am associated with Elon, because he is so tied to the brand,\" Oh said. \"I am so happy I sold it, because if I was driving it today, in the current climate I would be so embarrassed.\"",
      "Jake Nickell is another former Tesla owner who has distanced himself from the car company because of Musk's evolving reputation. An early EV fan, the Chicago-based entrepreneur bought the first of three Tesla vehicles he eventually purchased, a Roadster sportscar, in 2006.",
      "\"It was super fun to see an electric car company come up and be viable,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. He sold the car for a profit when it was no longer practical for his growing family, replacing it with a Tesla Model S and later a Model X.",
      "But Nickell said he sold the Model X in 2021 because he was unhappy with the vehicle and because of Musk's changing public persona. He replaced it with a car from rival EV maker Rivian.",
      "\"We were not happy with how [Musk] was acting on many levels. It was a slow slide. He started getting into the 'bro' startup culture of cryptocurrency at time, and there were signs that he was sliding into right-wing politics. We didn't want anything to do with that anymore,\" Nickell said of why he sold his family's Model X.",
      "Asked if he'd ever buy a Tesla again, Nickell responded, \"Absolutely not.\" He's now helping his son buy a car and is considering a Toyota Prius or an EV from Volkswagen.",
      "Musician Sheryl Crow is another former Tesla owner who recently distanced herself from the brand, writing in an Instagram\u00a0post\u00a0that she sold her vehicle because of Musk's recent political activities.",
      "\"There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla,\" she wrote, adding that she was donating the proceeds of the sale to NPR because the Trump administration wants to cut its federal funding.",
      "Wall Street analysts have voiced concern about the impact of Musk's reputation on the company's sales. That includes in Europe, where Tesla sales in Germany, a key market, fell roughly 60% last month, according to Reuters.",
      "\"Musk's DOGE related actions and more powerful alliance with Trump clearly could alienate some consumers to move away from the Tesla brand,\" Ives, who remains bullish on the company's prospects, said in his Feb. 19 report. \"There is some momentum around this effort in Europe and pockets of the U.S. as well since November.\"",
      "Tesla's \"net favorability rating,\" which measures consumers' perception of the brand based on survey responses, is at all-time lows, according to Stephen Gengaro, an analyst for investment advisory firm Stifel, who believes that Musk could be hurting the brand's score. Researchers asked consumers if they had a \"favorable\" or \"unfavorable\" impression of Tesla, ranging from \"very favorable\" to \"very unfavorable,\" to determine the rating. Respondents could also reply that they'd never heard of the brand, or that they had no opinion.",
      "Tesla's favorability rating sank to 3%, a six percentage point decline, for the week ended Jan. 28, compared with 9% in January 2024, according to data from Stifel Think Tank Group, the firm's research and analysis arm. In January 2018, the company's favorability rating stood at 33%.",

      "Partisan divide",
      "More than half of Americans held a negative view of Musk, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted between Jan. 27 and Feb. 2. Views were starkly divided based on political party, with about 7 in 10 Republicans saying they had a favorable view of him, while more than 8 in 10 Democrats said they viewed him unfavorably.",
      "Those changing perceptions may be rubbing off on car buyers, with a February Morning Consult poll finding that about 32% of U.S. buyers \"would not consider\" buying a Tesla, a five percentage point increase compared with a year earlier, according to a recent CNN report.",
      "In states that voted Democratic in the last four presidential elections, the share of repeat Tesla buyers dropped seven percentage points over the past year, falling from 72% at the end of 2023 to 65% by the fourth quarter of 2024, according to additional data provided to CNN by S&P Global Mobility. Repeat buyers in states that voted Republican barely inched higher, rising from 47.6% to 48.2% over the same period.",
      "In California, the country's largest market for electric vehicles, total driver registrations for Tesla's cars fell 11.6% percent in 2024, according to data from Experian automotive. Registrations for all other brands increased 1.4%, California New Car Dealers Association NCDA wrote in a January\u00a0report.",
      "Could Musk's ties to Trump actually help Tesla?",
      "At the same time, some on Wall Street say there are potential upsides to Musk's alliance with Mr. Trump. Perhaps most important, the Trump administration may seek to weaken or eliminate federal rules governing Tesla's self-driving vehicle technology, a major initiative for Tesla.",
      "Musk has long had ambitions to launch full self-driving vehicles powered by AI. The company plans to launch autonomous ride hailing in Austin in June, Musk\u00a0confirmed. Yet such efforts have been slowed by federal investigations into vehicle crashes involving Tesla's\u00a0\"Full Self-Driving\" system and by existing safety regulations.",
      "\"Trump's election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that's been stifling Tesla,\" Ives told the Associated Press.",
      "If the Trump administration eases regulations for self-driving cars, it would be \"a significant tailwind for Tesla's autonomous and AI vision heading into 2025,\" he added.",
      "Meanwhile, the dip in consumer perceptions of Tesla's brand could simply be a short-term headwind, Gengaro said. And long-term, the company's development of robotaxis and self-driving vehicles could provide much more of Tesla's growth than vehicle sales to consumers, he added.",
      "Tesla's sales struggles also could be based on other issues besides Musk, including mounting competition for EVs from other automakers. And Tesla's sales decline in Germany could be due to a preference among consumers there for electric cars made by homegrown automakers such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen.",

      "\"This index says that consumers are rattled. Their current situation is not so bad, but a growing do not feel so good about the future,\" analysts with High-Frequency Economics said in report. \"The decline in consumer sentiment since the November election might not be a coincidence,\" they added.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is apparently nearing a deal with Ukraine that could grant the U.S. access to mineral resources in exchange for security guarantees.",
    "story": [
      "Exactly three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and under pressure from President Trump, a senior Ukrainian official said negotiations over a deal that would give Washington access to Ukraine's vast mineral reserves were \"in the final stages.\"",
      "Ukraine's leaders have voiced hope that such an agreement might serve as the foundation of a long-term security guarantee for the country against any future Russian aggression, but the Trump administration has thus far remained non-committal, framing access to the resources as a way for Ukraine to pay the U.S. back for its support over the last three years.",
      "\"The negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalized,\" Olga Stefanishka, Ukraine's Vice President for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said in a Monday\u00a0social media post, written in English. \"We are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature. We hope both US and UA leaders might sign and endorse it in Washington the soonest to showcase our commitment for decades to come.\"",
      "Often called Europe's \"breadbasket\" thanks to its massive agriculture sector, Ukraine is also one of the continent's most resource-rich nations. Much of Ukraine's mineral reserves remain untapped, however, due to difficult access, old and undeveloped infrastructure and a lack of investment \u2014 all exacerbated by Russia's ongoing offensive military campaign, which initially started in 2014 with its invasion and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula.",

The occupied territory includes a significant portion of Ukraine's mineral reserves, including highly sought-after rare earth elements used in defense, aerospace, technology and energy production.",
      "The ground beneath Ukraine is believed to hold about 5% of the world's total reserves of rare earth elements. The U.S., which covers about 12 times as much ground, is estimated to have only 1-2% of the world's rare earths, by comparison.",
      "According to the Institute for the Study of War, about half of Ukraine's rare earth element reserves lie in territory currently occupied by Russia.",
      "Ukraine also has one of Europe's biggest reserves of titanium. The strong, lightweight metal is a vital component in modern aircraft, missiles and countless other civilian and military hardware, from satellites to bicycles. Ukraine's reserves are largely found in the northwest and central regions of the country, which have remained firmly under Kyiv's control.",

I think we've made a lot of progress,\" Mr. Trump said during a joint news conference at the White House on Monday with visiting French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "\"I think this discussion (a potential mineral deal) is a very important one,\" said Macron. \"First, because it's important for the U.S. and it will be a good occasion for a first very important meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. Second, I think it's \u2014 there is a lot of economic upside on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has characterized U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals as a way for the country to pay back Washington for the military assistance provided over the past three years.",
      "U.S. industry currently relies largely on China, which is the world's biggest source of rare earths and other minerals, for its raw materials. An increase in the supply of those materials from Ukraine could eventually mean a decrease in minerals purchased from China \u2014 and less concern from a national security standpoint.",
      "While the details of the deal said to be taking shape have not been shared, Zelenskyy earlier refused to sign an agreement that reportedly would have given the U.S. access to about $500 billion worth of his nation's mineral wealth \u2014 about half of its estimated future value.",
      "\"I won't sign a document that 10 generations of Ukrainians will pay for,\" Zelenskyy said over the weekend. He has stressed that any agreement to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals must come with security guarantees\u2014\u00a0 including, he suggested Tuesday, the possibility of American forces deploying to protect American investments.",
      "Zelenkyy's chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, said Monday that Kyiv was considering investment opportunities with both the U.S and European countries, \"which includes minerals, their development and extraction,\" calling his country's natural resources \"a very important element that can work in the general structure of security guarantees \u2014 military guarantees and others.\"",

    "summary": "The Social Security Administration is offering payouts to employees who voluntarily resign from the federal agency, ahead of what they warn will be \"significant workforce reductions.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration is offering financial incentives ranging from $15,000 to $25,000 to employees who choose to voluntarily resign from the federal agency, ahead of what they warn will be \"significant workforce reductions.\"",
      "A message sent out to employees Thursday stated that the agency will soon implement restructuring that includes workforce cuts and \"massive reorganizations.\"",
      "The SSA said that wholesale \"abolishment of organizations and positions\" could happen, as well as reassignments and staff cuts.",
      "Earlier this week, the Office of Personnel Management advised agencies to submit \"reorganization plans\" by March 13 and prepare for \"reductions in force.\"",
      "Thursday's message offers all Social Security employees three options ahead of the agency's expected cuts: voluntary reassignment \"to a mission critical position,\" voluntary early retirement, if eligible, or \"voluntary separation incentive payments,\" if eligible.",
      "Those who would take the voluntary separation incentive payment must opt in by March 14 and leave the agency no later than April 19. The option echoes the \"fork in the road\" or deferred resignation program from OPM, in which eligible federal employees could resign from their positions and retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The incentive payments offered the SSA is dependent on an employee's classification, or where they stand on the federal payscale. Those with a GS-8 or under would get $15,000, while those classified with GS-9 to GS-12 would receive $20,000. Those with a GS-13 or higher would receive $25,000.",
      "SSA notes that employees who opt in may be put on administrative leave through April 19 and must not have already opted into the buyout program offered by OPM earlier this year.",
      "Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS News they fear employees may opt in to get the separation payment, and that it could already strain the benefits agency she said is in need of more investment to shorten wait times and open more field offices, not cuts.",
      "\"If people don't take it, then they're going to be constantly looking over their shoulder, looking through their email waiting to see if they get fired,\" Altman said. \"It's going to add stress, chaos and uncertainty.\"",
      "Altman added that employees should first see if their severance pay from a potential termination could be more than what the SSA is offering for voluntarily resigning.",
      "Jill Hornick, a 33-year Social Security employee, noted that public-facing employees who work in field offices and handle claims at Social Security's 1-800 number were told by former acting SSA Commissioner Michelle King that they were exempt from OPM's buyout offer.",
      "\"[King] knew it would hurt public service\" if these hires were allowed to take the offer, said Hornick, who is also an administrative director at an Illinois local chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees, which nationally represents hundreds of thousands of federal workers. \"Because we're at a 25-year staffing low.\"",
      "Now that this separation incentive is available to them, Hornick said she has \"no doubt\" these frontline employees will take it, and warned that processing times for claims could \"go through the roof.\"",
      "\"I have been trying to reassure [these] employees to take a deep breath. They're terrified, scared to death they will not have a job tomorrow, and put a roof over their head. It's just been one thing after another this week,\" Hornick added.",
      "The incentive payments offer does not apply to probationary employees, who generally have less than a year on the job, and must have worked in the executive branch for at least three years.",
      "Those looking to retire early must opt in between March 1 and Dec. 31. To be eligible for early retirement, an employee must be at least 50 years old and have 20 years of \"creditable service,\" or have 25 years of creditable service at any age.",
      "The SSA has seen several changes in recent weeks. Acting SSA Commissioner Leland Dudek was appointed to the role after the previous commissioner, King, was resistant to allowing staff with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, get access to sensitive agency data.",
      "Earlier this week, two SSA offices were closed \u2014 the Office of Transformation and the Office of Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity \u2014 which resulted in 190 staffers being put on administrative leave.",

    "story": [
      "The State Department confirmed Thursday it plans to end more than 90% of USAID contracts around the world, while keeping in place contracts for the most crucial food and health programs.",
      "The department claims its cuts would allow the agency to tighten its belt by $58.2 billion in unspent funds on multi-year awards, but it provided no documentation to support its claim. It's also not clear that the department is funding the initiatives it claims it's supporting.",
      "USAID disbursed nearly $9 billion around the world in 2024 on public health initiatives. A State Department spokesperson said Thursday the agency spared critical USAID awards, including for food assistance, and life-saving medical treatments for diseases such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis.",
      "But Lucica Ditiu, the executive director of the Stop TB Partnership, said her global nonprofit, which focuses on tuberculosis, lost funding.",
      "\"That is not correct, absolutely not true,\" she said of the claim that life-saving treatments were spared.",
      "She said her organization would survive without U.S. assistance, but it will have to downsize weeks after securing what she was led to believe would be a five-year commitment.",
      "The U.S. government has been the largest government-to-government donor in the effort to end tuberculosis, a preventable and curable disease that is the leading cause of death globally from a single infectious agent.",
      "The Stop TB Partnership provides grants using USAID funds to 140 grassroots tuberculosis treatment and prevention organizations around the world, some of which perform the risky task of going door-to-door in search of people suffering from the infectious disease.",
      "The State Department has not specified exactly which programs have been cut, and which have been spared. USAID, which represents a fraction of 1% of the federal budget, has been targeted for elimination by the White House's cost cutters, most notably the world's richest man Elon Musk. The agency he championed, DOGE, has posted a \"wall of receipts\" that purports to show where cuts are being made. It's been marked by inaccuracies, miscalculations and unsubstantiated claims of budget cutting.",
      "Musk himself acknowledged that mistakes have been made during a White House Cabinet meeting Wednesday.",
      "\"One of the things we accidentally canceled very briefly was Ebola prevention.\" Musk said, before adding \"there was no interruption\" in services.",
      "Even that was apparently a misstatement. The Associated Press reported that day that a USAID official said no funds for fighting the deadly virus had been released since President Trump's Jan. 20 funding freeze on foreign aid.",
      "A State Department spokesperson said a review of its contracts and grants was geared toward eliminating all but the ones that make America stronger, safer and more prosperous. The agency's cuts are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to drastically shrink the federal workforce and budget.",
      "Ditiu questioned whether cutting funds designed for tuberculosis prevention would do that. She said \"thousands and thousands\" of people working to treat and prevent the disease globally stand to be laid off. She worries about work being interrupted in Mozambique, where there's an \"extremely drug resistant strain.\"",
      "\"TB is airborne. You can wear a condom, you can sleep under a bed net, you can run and exercise and eat just kale all your life. As long as you breathe, you can get TB,\" Ditius said. \"You can get it on a plane, in a taxi ride \u2026 it's not enough to close the borders.\"",
      "She predicted that as organizations recalibrate and rebuild without American funds, they'll take their purchasing power elsewhere, buying diagnostic tools and medicine from international competitors such as China.",
      "\"I honestly don't think that anyone took the time, or wanted to listen, to explain what it means for the U.S.,\" Ditiu said.",
      "Randy Chester, a USAID staffer and vice president of the American Foreign Service Association, warned that the cuts not only hurt those abroad, but they're going to affect Americans \u2014 and not just the government workers who are being fired.",
      "\"Every year we spend $2 billion on agriculture products in the U.S. from Midwestern farmers,\" Chester said. \"That's a patriotic thing to do, helping Americans connect to new markets and helping them sell their products to new markets.\"",

He spent the day supporting colleagues who were allotted small time windows, some as brief as 15 minutes, to clear out the desks where many had spent their careers. He said they were devoted to serving their countries.",

    "story": [
      "During a news conference with President Trump, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday that his country is ready to put \"boots on the ground\" to support a peace deal in Ukraine as Starmer said they had a \"very good and productive visit.\"",
      "Achieving lasting peace in Ukraine and ending Russia's full-scale invasion was top of the agenda for Starmer and Mr. Trump in Starmer's first visit to the White House since Mr. Trump took office, as Mr. Trump said Thursday that he trusts Russian President Vladimir Putin to keep his word on any peace agreement they reach.",
      "\"We discussed a plan today to reach a peace that is tough and fair, that Ukraine will help shape, that's backed by strength, to stop Putin coming back for more,\" Starmer said. \"I'm working closely with other European leaders on this, and I'm clear that the U.K. is ready to put boots on the ground and planes in the air to support a deal, working together with our allies, because that is the only way that peace will last.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called Starmer a \"very tough negotiator.\" Starmer, for his part, called his visit a \"very good and very productive\" one, noting Mr. Trump's family roots in Scotland.",
      "The conciliatory words were in contrast to larger disagreements they have had, especially on the war in Ukraine. Mr. Trump has broken with many European allies and has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator\" but has declined to give the same label to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Starmer said the two are working to end the \"barbaric\" war in Ukraine, acknowledging what Mr. Trump and his top administration officials have largely ignored \u2014 that Russia is the aggressor.",
      "\"It can't be peace that awards the aggressor,\" Starmer said, adding, \"we agree history must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader.\"",
      "But in what is likely a concession to Mr. Trump, Starmer said the U.K. will be giving more aid to Ukraine this year than it has in any other year in the past, and will be increasing its defense spending as a part of its gross domestic product, also known as GDP.",
      "Mr. Trump said he thinks progress is being made on ending the Russia-Ukraine war, and that an agreement will \"either be fairly soon or it won't be at all.\"",
      "Starmer said the U.S. and U.K. will be working together on a lasting peace agreement in Ukraine.",
      "The U.K. prime minister also said the two administrations will work on reaching an economic deal between the two countries. Mr. Trump said Starmer tried very hard to persuade him not to impose tariffs on imports from the U.K.",
      "\"He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" Mr. Trump said of Starmer.",
      "Mr. Trump said there is a \"great chance\" they could reach a trade deal \"where tariffs wouldn't be necessary.\"",
      "Trump accepts invitation to visit U.K. in the \"near future\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Thursday he'll visit the United Kingdom in the \"near future\" and accepted an invitation for a state visit from King Charles.",
      "\"It's a great honor to have Prime Minister Starmer in the Oval Office,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's a very special place and he's a special man. And the United Kingdom is a \u2014 is a wonderful, this is a wonderful country that I know very well. I'm there a lot. And I'll be going, I'll be going there and we expect to see each other in the near future. We'll be announcing it.\" Both leaders emphasized the \"special relationship\" between the two countries, forged during World War II.",
      "Mr. Trump said he and Starmer would discuss Russia and Ukraine, as the president seeks an end to the war started when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. In a break with many European allies \u2014 including Britain \u2014 Mr. Trump has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator\" but has declined to give the same label to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\"Did I say that?\" Mr. Trump said, asked to repeat his characterization of Zelenskyy. \"I can't believe I said that. Next question.\"",
      "Starmer thanked Mr. Trump for changing the conversation on Ukraine, according to reporters in the room, and said he believes an \"historic deal\" can be achieved.",
      "Mr. Trump, however, disagreed with a previous assessment by Starmer that there is a risk Putin could invade Ukraine again after a deal is reached, saying he trusts Putin to keep his word.",
      "\"No. I don't think so,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think when we have a deal, it's going to be the deal.\"",
      "\"I think he'll keep his word,\" Mr. Trump said, calling it a \"trust and verify\" situation.",
      "\"We had to go through the Russian hoax together, that was not a good thing,\" Mr. Trump said, adding he's known Putin for a long time.",
      "Mr. Trump said they'll see if there are parts of Ukraine taken by Russia that could be given back to Ukraine, although he didn't specify where.",
      "\"There are a lot of areas that were taken,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Yeah, we've talked about it. A lot of the sea line has been taken. And we'll be talking about that. And we're going to see if we can get it back, or get a lot of it back for Ukraine, if that's possible.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the two will also be discussing trade, as he imposes new tariffs on allies and adversaries alike.",
      "Starmer said ahead of the meeting that the U.S. and Britain \"want to strike a new partnership. We share the view that our best days lie ahead.\"",
      "\"Taking out a chainsaw isn't quite my style, but we are stripping away red tape and bureaucracy,\" he said, at once taking a gentle jab at Musk while also attempting to appeal to Mr. Trump's passion for a slimmed down government. \"We are reforming, permitting, getting things built, reducing barriers to investment and growth, and we're open for business, open for investment, and we're determined to help U.S. innovators thrive in the United Kingdom.\"",
      "Starmer presented the president with a letter from King Charles, and Mr. Trump read it in real time. Mr. Trump called the British king a \"beautiful man and a wonderful man.\"",
      "Britain, the U.S., and collective security via NATO",
      "Starmer didn't arrive in Washington empty-handed. He flew in on the wings of an announcement just days earlier that his government was planning to bump U.K. defense spending from the current 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027, which his office has billed as Britain's biggest sustained defense spending increase since the Cold War. Starmer has left open the possibility of that defense spending rising further, to 3%, after the next U.K. general election.",
      "The timing of the prime minister's announcement was notable, coming just two days before his meeting with Mr. Trump. A White House official said ahead of the meeting that the Trump administration was \"very pleased\" with Starmer's announcement, but that it still wants to see America's NATO allies increase defense spending further, towards 5% of their respective national GDPs. That would be more, proportionally, than even the U.S. spends on defense, which in 2023 amounted to roughly 3.4% of the United States' GDP.",
      "Mr. Trump has implied that the U.S. could break from the historic collective defense agreement of NATO, known as Article 5, which essentially says that if any member is attacked it will be treated as an attack on all, if other member countries do not boost their defense spending.",
      "\"I think that that means there's got to be security guarantees,\" said Starmer, acknowledging the pressure for higher spending, but also indicating that he will ask the White House to provide clear commitments to help defend Ukraine against any future Russian attack if a ceasefire is reached to halt the ongoing war. \"I've indicated that we will play our full part. There has to be U.S. backing, because otherwise I don't think it will deter Putin. We are working on that. I'm having extensive discussions about it.\"",
      "A White House official said the U.S. appreciated Starmer's willingness to consider sending British troops to help with peacekeeping efforts to enforce a potential peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, but Mr. Trump has made it clear that any and all security guarantees for Ukraine may have to come from Europe.",
      "\"I'm not going to make security guarantees beyond, very much,\" Mr. Trump said this week. \"We're going to have Europe do that, because we're talking about, Europe is their nextdoor neighbor, but we're going to make sure everything goes well.\"",
      "U.S.-British trade",
      "Mr. Trump's tariff threats were also the agenda during Thursday's White House meeting. A 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imported into the U.S. is set to kick in on March 12, ordered by Mr. Trump, he said, to protect American companies. Starmer may seek an exemption.",
      "Mr. Trump implied weeks ago that a unilateral trade agreement could be worked with the U.K. If that does not happen, there's concern that some of the estimated 40,000 British jobs directly linked to steel and aluminum production could be lost and entire plants could close.",
      "After Starmer's meeting with Mr. Trump, he's scheduled to meet back in London with several European leaders on Sunday, including the heads of state from Germany, Italy and Poland. Starmer will no doubt brief them on his talks with the U.S. president.",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy may join them, after he meets with Mr. Trump in Washington on Friday, where he's expected to sign a financial deal to share his country's mineral wealth with Washington, which Mr. Trump has called \"payback\" for U.S. aid to Ukraine over the past three years.",

      "\"OPM does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute in the history of the universe,\" to hire or fire any employees but its own, he said.",
      "Alsup handed down the order on a temporary restraining order sought by labor unions and nonprofits in a lawsuit filed by the coalition filed last week.",
      "The complaint filed by five labor unions and five nonprofit organizations is among multiple lawsuits pushing back on the administration's efforts to vastly shrink the federal workforce, which Trump has called bloated and sloppy. Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired and his administration is now aiming at career officials with civil service protection.",
      "The plaintiffs say the Office of Personnel Management had no authority to terminate the jobs of probationary workers who generally have less than a year on the job. They also say the firings were predicated on a lie of poor performance by the workers.",
      "Lawyers for the government say the Office of Personnel Management did not direct the firings, but asked agencies to review and determine whether employees on probation were fit for continued employment. They also say that probationary employees are not guaranteed employment and that only the highest performing and mission-critical employees should be hired.",
      "There are an estimated 200,000 probationary workers \u2014 generally employees who have less than a year on the job \u2014 across federal agencies. About 15,000 are employed in California, providing services ranging from fire prevention to veterans' care, the complaint says.",
      "Lee Saunders, president of AFSCME, one of the unions involved in the lawsuit, said in a statement, \"We know this decision is just a first step, but it gives federal employees a respite. While they work to protect public health and safety, federal workers have faced constant harassment from unelected billionaires and anti-union extremists whose only goal is to give themselves massive tax breaks at the expense of working people. We will continue to move this case forward with our partners until federal workers are protected against these baseless terminations.\"",

Thousands of transgender troops are currently serving, and are fully qualified for the positions in which they serve. No policy will ever erase transgender Americans' contribution to history, warfighting, or military excellence. Transgender service members have a unique fighting spirit and will continue to defend the constitution and American Values no matter what lies ahead.\"",
      "Transgender people have faced a roller coaster of changing policies on military service in recent years, with Democratic administrations seeking to permit them to serve openly, while Mr. Trump has repeatedly sought to keep them out of the ranks.",
      "The U.S. military lifted a ban on transgender troops in 2016, during then-President Barack Obama's second term.",
      "Under that policy, trans troops already serving were permitted to do so openly, and transgender recruits were set to start being accepted by July 1, 2017.",

      "Mr. Trump's controversial restrictions \u2014 which underwent changes in response to various court challenges \u2014 eventually came into force in April 2019 following a protracted legal battle that went all the way to the nation's top court.",
      "Mr. Trump's successor, former President Joe Biden, moved to reverse the restrictions just days after he took office in 2021, saying all Americans qualified to serve should be able to do so.",
      "After returning to office in January, Trump issued an executive order that again took aim at transgender military service, saying: \"Expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 19:16:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk's speculation about dead or fictitious employees comes after numerous federal workers were told to ignore an email asking them to justify their jobs. Previous government reviews found no evidence of widespread payroll fraud.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk suggested Wednesday that a number of federal employees who did not respond to an email requesting a summary of their achievements from the previous week could be \"dead\" or \"not real people,\" but offered no facts to back it up.",
      "\"We think there are a number of people on the government payroll who are dead, which is probably why they can't respond, and \u2014 and some people who are not real people,\" Musk said.",
      "President Trump echoed Musk's claims moments later to reporters ahead of a cabinet meeting.",
      "\"Maybe we're paying people that don't exist,\" he said.",
      "There is no evidence that the federal payroll includes scores of dead or non-existent people. The White House declined to provide evidence for the claim to CBS News.",
      "Federal laws mandate audits and verification processes to maintain accurate employment records, and the lower rate of response to the email is no doubt due to multiple agencies instructing staff to not reply.",
      "At least half of all federal employees have not responded to the email, which was sent by the Office of Personnel Management on Saturday and came with a deadline of 11:59 p.m. Monday. The heads of numerous agencies, including the Justice Department, the FBI, the State Department, the Pentagon, the Department of Energy, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, told employees to ignore the email. Those agencies have over 537,000 employees, according to September 2024 employment numbers.",
      "The personnel office allowed agencies to decide how they wanted to handle the email, despite Musk warning that those who did not respond would lose their jobs.",
      "CBS News has not received responses for requests for information about Musk's claims from the Office of Personnel Management or the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.",
      "How the federal government keeps track of its workers",
      "Federal employees must verify their identity and employment authorization by filling out an I-9 before being hired and often have their fingerprints taken. Federal law requires that agencies keep \"complete and accurate records\" of the hours their employees work and establish work schedules.",
      "While there are occasional instances of fraud, the Government Accountability Office found in 2020 that cases are rare. Between fiscal years 2015 to 2019, agency inspectors general substantiated only 100 allegations of employee time and attendance misconduct or fraud out of a federal workforce of around 2.1 million employees (the GAO report did not include postal workers). The report did not mention any instances of dead or fictitious employees getting paid.",
      "The report noted several checks and balances in place to prevent and detect fraud, including the use of timesheets, badge in-out data, video surveillance, network login information and government-issued routers, GAOs report said.",
      "Pattern of false claims about dead people",
      "Previously, Musk and Mr. Trump had falsely claimed that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old were collecting Social Security payments.",
      "But acting Social Security Administration commissioner Lee Dudek said people who are listed as over 100 years old in the Social Security system are \"not necessarily receiving benefits.\" Instead, those individuals \"are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record,\" Dudek said.",
      "Unless you qualify for survivor benefits, collecting Social Security payments for a deceased person is illegal. While there have been documented instances of payments to deceased beneficiaries, they do not occur near the scale the Trump administration suggested.",
      "In total, improper payments at the agency \u2014 including all accidental overpayments and underpayments \u2014 accounted for just under 1% of the $8.6 trillion in total payments from 2015 to 2022, according to a 2024 audit.",
      "Mr. Trump also has a long history of making false claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election by people who cast ballots in the name of dead people \u2014 claims which have been repeatedly debunked.",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of staffers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, were laid off Thursday as the Trump administration and its newly-created Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, continue slashing the federal workforce.",
      "A congressional source told CBS News the layoffs affected 880 NOAA employees. An administration official told CBS News about 5% of the agency's staff was let go, and nobody who was deemed critical to NOAA's responsibilities, such as National Weather Service meteorologists, was affected. A source at the National Weather Service disputed this, however, telling CBS News some meteorologists were included in the cuts.",
      "Laid off staffers who were considered probationary employees received an email Thursday, which read in part, \"OPM has advised that '[p]robationary periods are an essential tool for agencies to assess employee performance and manage staffing levels.' (4) In light of that guidance, the Agency finds that you are not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and/or skills do not fit the Agency's current needs.\"",
      "Some 400 employees at the National Weather Service were in a probationary period, a NWS source told CBS News, but it's not clear how many of them were included in the layoffs.",
      "Tom DiLiberto, who until Thursday had worked as a Climate and weather scientist and public affairs specialist, told CBS News he started as a contractor for NOAA back in 2010, but became a federal employee less than two years ago. His probationary period was set to end on March 13, 2025, two weeks from the day he was terminated.",
      "\"You're seeing the whittling away of scientists, and the people who got fired today are some of the best people you can imagine,\" DiLiberto said. \"These people have dedicated their lives to help others. There's no politics in this. When we forecast, or think of the oceans and keep them clean, we're not thinking about the politics. This is an insult on science and all that's good.\"",
      "DiLiberto had been a forecaster for El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a and, as a public affairs specialist in the office of communications, said he wrote for the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation blog for a decade. He published his final blog for the service the same day he was let go. He said he has been given no information on any next steps or if he would be receiving severance.",
      "Congressional Democrats had been worried DOGE and billionaire Elon Musk, who is classified as a \"special government employee,\" had their eyes set on NOAA for deep cuts. Former NOAA officials told CBS News earlier this month that current employees had been told to expect budget cuts of 30% and a 50% reduction in staff.",
      "Prior to Thursday's cuts, NOAA had about 12,000 staffers across the world, including 6,773 who are scientists and engineers, according to the agency's website.",
      "Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington State Democrat who chairs the Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard, which oversees NOAA, said the job cuts \"jeopardize our ability to forecast and respond to extreme weather events like hurricanes, wildfires, and floods\u2014putting communities in harm's way. They also threaten our maritime commerce and endanger 1.7 million jobs that depend on commercial, recreational and tribal fisheries, including thousands in the State of Washington. This action is a direct hit to our economy, because NOAA's specialized workforce provides products and services that support more than a third of the nation's GDP.\"",
      "House Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Jared Huffman, a Democrat who represents California's 2nd Congressional District, called Thursday's cuts a \"betrayal of the American people.\"",
      "\"Musk and his fake officials, the DOGE tech bros, have been rummaging through our most sensitive data without authority in violation of the law for weeks now,\" Huffman said in a statement. \"And this has come with sweeping, indiscriminate layoffs of nonpartisan public servants. Park rangers, firefighters, scientists \u2013 all of these people, whose purpose is to serve everyday Americans, have had the rug pulled out from under them. And we will all be worse off for it.\"",
      "\"Musk's sham mission is bringing vital programs to a screeching halt,\" Huffman continued. \"People nationwide depend on NOAA for free, accurate forecasts, severe weather alerts, and emergency information. Purging the government of scientists, experts, and career civil servants and slashing fundamental programs will cost lives.\"",
      "Congressional aides previously told CBS News that lawmakers had received multiple complaints about DOGE staff coming into NOAA offices earlier this month.",
      "Former NOAA officials, who spoke directly with current staffers, also previously confirmed to CBS News they saw members of the DOGE team at NOAA headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, and the Hoover Building, in Washington, D.C., where NOAA's parent agency, the U.S. Commerce Department is located.",
      "The NOAA runs the National Weather Service, which issues vital weather warnings \u2014 such as hurricane and tornado warnings \u2014 and the National Marine Fisheries Service. It is also responsible for monitoring the health of the oceans and the warming of the climate.",
      "House Science Committee ranking member Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat who represents California's 18th congressional district, said in a statement, \"This will cost American lives.\"",
      "\"Protect lives and property; that is NOAA's mission,\" Lofgren said. \"Firing the employees that allow the agency to carry out that mission will bring about dire consequences. People will die and face great hardship thanks to the recklessness of Co-Presidents Trump and Musk.\"",
      "Dr. Juan Declet-Barreto, senior social scientist for climate vulnerability in the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, also criticized the cuts, saying Thursday in a statement, \"NOAA's data and science are used routinely by weather forecasters, mariners, farmers, emergency responders, businesses and everyday people across the country. Everyone in the United States relies on NOAA in their daily lives whether they realize it or not, something that will come into focus for many in the weeks and months ahead.\"",
      "President Trump has nominated Neil Jacobs to lead the agency. Jacobs, who was acting director of the NOAA for a time during Mr. Trump's first term, was reprimanded for ethics violations after Mr. Trump held up a hurricane forecast map with black marker appearing to extend the storm's potential path into Alabama \u2014 an incident that became known as \"Sharpie-gate.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration unexpectedly canceled an annual meeting of its advisers to update next season's influenza vaccines, an adviser on the panel and multiple officials tell CBS News, upending the usual process to start manufacturing next winter's flu shots.",
      "\"We're all left trying to understand what is going on. Why was this meeting canceled? It's an important meeting. What's the plan for flu vaccines this year,\" Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA advisory committee and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News.",
      "Offit said he received the notification that the meeting was canceled shortly after 4 p.m. The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee was supposed to meet on March 13 to discuss how to update the shots for the next flu season, Offit said.",
      "Some of the other committee members said they had not received any notification about the upcoming meeting being canceled. Offit said the email he received was addressed to all of the committee's members.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed Thursday that the meeting had been canceled.",
      "\"The FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season,\" the spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, said in a statement.",
      "It is possible for the FDA to make the pick for flu shots without consulting the panel, a former federal health official said, though it would be unprecedented in recent history.",
      "The panel often largely adopts the WHO's recommendations without changes. However, the committee's input has also spurred major changes in recent years, like a push to abandon use of a now-extinct flu strain in the shots.",
      "The companies that manufacture influenza vaccines rely on the FDA each year to pick out the strains to use in shots made for the American market. The specific strains are chosen each year based on predictions of what flu variants will be circulating in the coming winter.",
      "That selection is usually done by the committee in early March, drawing in large part on recommendations from a meeting of the World Health Organization's advisers reviewing data on influenza from across the Northern Hemisphere.",
      "\"Because the vaccine is grown in eggs, for the most part, it requires six months to produce. So March is six months before September, which is when these vaccines roll out,\" said Offit.",
      "Last year, the FDA asked the committee to meet on March 5 to decide on how to update the influenza shots for the 2024 to 2025 season.",
      "The agency usually announces these meeting dates around a month in advance. Next month's meeting had not yet been publicly disclosed.",
      "Which strains are picked to be targeted by the vaccines can have a significant impact on how effective the shots are.",
      "Early data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's testing suggests that this past season's vaccine may have been a poor match for one of the common strains of the virus. More data on the effectiveness of the vaccine is expected to be released Thursday.",
      "The cancellation is just the latest federal vaccine meeting to be disrupted.",

      "Washington \u2014 Congress is barreling toward a deadline to avert a government shutdown in just over two weeks, with Democrats and Republicans at odds over whether there should be guardrails on President Trump's ability to withhold funding approved by Congress.",
      "Democrats want to insert language in the funding bill to ensure that the administration implements the spending directed by Congress, a reaction to Mr. Trump and top adviser Elon Musk's work to downsize large swaths of the executive branch. But Republicans have made it clear that they won't accept those terms.",
      "Government funding expires on March 14, and keeping the government open past the deadline will likely require bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. Republicans control 53 seats in the Senate, but a funding measure requires 60 votes for passage. In the House, Republicans are operating with a razor-thin majority and a divided conference in which conservatives regularly vote against government spending bills.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Wednesday that a continuing resolution that funds the government at the current levels is the \"most reasonable thing to do to ensure that the government is not shut down.\"",
      "It has yet to be determined whether disaster relief for the California wildfires would be included in the funding measure, but Johnson told reporters it likely would not include language to codify cuts spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, the Musk-led task force that is slashing programs across the executive branch.",
      "\"It probably is as close to a clean CR as possible,\" he said of the potential path forward.",
      "Johnson's comments came after a meeting with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and Mr. Trump at the White House on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "But in an interview with CNN later in the evening, Johnson noted that the CR might include some \"anomalies,\" opening the door to spending cuts that would alienate most Democrats.",
      "\"You can increase some spending, you can decrease some spending. You can add language that says, for example, the dramatic changes that have been made to USAID would be reflected in the ongoing spending,\" Johnson said. \"It would be a clean CR, mostly, I think, but with some of those changes to adapt to the new realities here.\"",
      "Thursday evening, Mr. Trump announced his support for a \"a clean, temporary\" continuing resolution, telling Congress, \"Let's get it done!\"",
      "Democratic leaders have said the blame for any shutdown would lie squarely with Republicans, who control the House, Senate and the White House. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said Tuesday that Democrats don't want a shutdown and are at the table negotiating in good faith to fund the government.",
      "\"But Republicans are the majority in the House and in the Senate. If they want our votes, they need to work with us,\" Murray said, noting that appropriators are \"close\" on topline spending.",
      "\"We need to know Republicans are willing to work with us to protect Congress' power of the purse,\" Murray said. \"That is the absolute bare minimum, and it's frankly not asking a whole lot.\"",

      "\"That's a no-go, that's a red line that we're not changing our position on and they know that \u2014 that's been communicated consistently,\" Cole said.",
      "Johnson said Democrats have \"had completely unreasonable conditions assigned to this.\"",
      "\"They want us to limit the power of the executive branch, they want us to stipulate in the appropriations bills for the first time in history that certain agencies in the executive branch would have to have a specific number of employees, all sorts of just unreasonable \u2014 what I think are unconstitutional \u2014 demands,\" Johnson said. \"It would be a violation of separation of powers. So we're pretty far apart right now, but it is not because of Republicans, it's because of the Democrats.\"",
      "The funding fight comes as Republicans in Congress have also been moving ahead on a separate budget resolution, which serves as a blueprint for approving Mr. Trump's agenda on issues ranging from border security to energy and taxes. Though the two issues are distinctly separate, the focus on the budget has taken center stage in recent weeks, appearing to sideline progress toward government funding.",

    "summary": "The increase in the range of people who can be targeted by the U.S. military dismantles Biden-era mandates that included more safeguards.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has rolled back constraints on American commanders to authorize airstrikes and special operation raids outside conventional battlefields, broadening the range of people who can be targeted, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the policy shift.",
      "The quiet but seismic recalibration dismantles Biden-era mandates and signals a return to more aggressive counterterrorism policies Trump first instituted in his first term.",
      "During his first overseas trip earlier this month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in a meeting with senior U.S. military leaders from U.S. Africa Command in Germany, signed a directive easing policy constraints and executive oversight on airstrikes and the deployment of American commandos.",
      "The move prioritizes flexibility by giving commanders greater latitude to decide whom to target while relaxing the multi-layered centralized control former President Joe Biden implemented over airstrikes and raids by American special operation forces, U.S. officials told CBS News on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about national security matters.",
      "One senior Defense Department official told CBS News that Biden's warfare policies were carbon copies of those established during former President Barack Obama's second term. During Biden's tenure, airstrikes typically focused on the senior leadership of terrorist organizations.",
      "The official added that Mr. Trump's approach carries both risks and rewards because the streamlined process can potentially degrade foreign terrorist organizations capabilities faster, given the lower threshold required to strike and widened target selection, but it inherently raises the risk of flawed decisions and unintended civilian casualties.",
      "The Islamist armed group Al-Shabaab in Somalia and the Houthis in Yemen were discussed as potential targets, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the meeting. It's not clear if the other U.S. combatant commands around the world were also given the same directive.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Pentagon and U.S. Africa Command on Tuesday, but has not received a reply.",
      "American military airstrikes fall into two broad categories \u2014 deliberate and defensive, according to U.S. Africa Command's website. Deliberate strikes adhere to a multi-layered process of regulations and high-level vetting, which under the Biden administration ran through the Joint Staff and the executive branch.",
      "Throughout the deliberate strike process, military lawyers review the compiled intelligence to determine if individuals are legal combatants under the law of armed conflict, to reduce the risk of civilian casualties and avoid targeted killings of innocent people mistaken for terrorist suspects.",
      "Defensive airstrikes are used \"in limited circumstances where U.S. or specifically designated partner forces are in imminent danger from hostile forces,\" according to U.S. Africa Commands website. These types of airstrikes are typically authorized by the combatant command, and the executive branch does not need to approve these strikes.",
      "A leaked classified study from 2013, obtained by The Intercept, details how the U.S. government authorized drone strikes in Yemen and Somalia between 2011 and 2012 following presidential approval during the Obama administration \u2014 policies similarly implemented under Biden.",
      "Before launching a strike, military commanders had to ensure it met a number of strict criteria and obtain approvals from seven decision makers \u2014 including the president.\u00a0 The individual targeted had to be confirmed as a member of an approved terrorist organization using two independent forms of intelligence. Civilian casualties had to be projected as minimal. And there could be no \"contradictory intelligence\" muddying the waters.",
      "The process became a high-stakes roundtable. The task force that assembled the target package, the combatant commander, the CIA chief of mission, and the host nation all had to sign off on the airstrike. A single dissent along the way meant the operation would be halted.",
      "It's not clear if these same provisions are included in the new directive. However, they did exist during Mr. Trump's first term, with some exceptions on approval by the host nation in countries such as Afghanistan.",
      "The directive to U.S. Africa Command comes at a tumultuous time inside the Pentagon, following the firings by the Trump administration of the top judge advocate generals for the Air Force, Army and Navy. Traditionally seen as apolitical positions, these top uniformed Pentagon officials encompass a broad range of responsibilities, from overseeing criminal cases involving the rank-and-file to ensuring the top brass adhere to international laws of armed conflict.",
      "Speaking to reporters on Monday, Hegseth defended the removals, stating that they were necessary to ensure there were no \"roadblocks to orders given by a commander-in-chief.\"",
      "He added, \"Ultimately, I want the best possible lawyers in each service to provide the best possible recommendations, no matter what, to lawful orders and are given, and we didn't think those particular positions were well suited, and so we're looking for the best.\"",

      "Several female athletes who stood next to President Trump three weeks ago to celebrate an executive order banning transgender participation in women's sports were not invited to a White House event Thursday for a briefing on women's sports after they criticized the National Collegiate Athletic Association's new policy, sources told CBS News.",
      "Among those who didn't get asked back for the briefing on Title IX issues were Riley Gaines, a former NCAA swimmer; Sia Liilii, captain of the University of Nevada's women's volleyball team; and Kaitynn Wheeler, a former NCAA swimmer at the University of Kentucky.",
      "Some of the athletes have publicly clashed with the White House's preferred messaging by openly criticizing the NCAA in social media posts and other public statements.",
      "\"It's absolutely not a win at all and we need to demand for better,\" Wheeler told CBS News.",
      "White House officials told CBS that Thursday's Title IX event is for state attorneys general and is an effort to encourage them to use sex discrimination authorities already in place in their states to protect women and girls in athletics.",
      "Sports figures whose stories haven't yet been highlighted by the Trump administration were invited, they said. Some athletes from Maine, whose Democratic governor has said she will fight Mr. Trump's order in court, will be there, one of the officials said.",
      "After Mr. Trump earlier this month signed the executive order titled \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,\" the NCAA \u2014 the nonprofit that governs college sports \u2014 issued a new policy stating a \"student-athlete assigned male at birth may not compete for an NCAA women's team.\"",
      "White House officials said they think the NCAA policy is a victory for Mr. Trump because the organization is not accepting amended birth certificates and is being more aggressive than other sporting organizations such as the Ladies Professional Golf Association, National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, and the International Rugby League.",
      "However, some of the women athletes and advocates at the photo opportunity with Mr. Trump have since argued the NCAA policy has major loopholes and continues to allow male athletes to compete in women's sports.",
      "Payton McNabb, a 17-year-old who was injured during a collision with a transgender female athlete during a volleyball game, was initially invited to Thursday's event, but it was unclear if she would attend, people familiar with the matter said. Liilii was invited and later asked not to come, they said.",
      "Jennifer Sey, a former gymnast and business executive who has been an advocate for keeping transgender women out of women's sports, said the sports governance landscape is complicated - multiple bodies govern various corners of sports. Olympics and independent events such as the Boston Marathon can claim they're outside the executive order because they don't receive federal funding, she said.",
      "\"It's very fractured \u2014 there was no way an EO was going to be able to solve the entire problem. It was a great first step,\" Sey said. \"But in the meantime, I think the NCAA policy is wildly insufficient.\"",
      "Sey, who was invited to the White House for the executive order event but not Thursday's briefing, said she and others hope Mr. Trump will pressure the NCAA to redo it. \"It should be thrown in the garbage,\" she said.",
      "May Mailman, Mr. Trump's senior policy strategist who has been coordinating the policy and the events, told CBS the White House is closely watching the NCAA and if men are allowed in women's sports, that won't be acceptable.",

Rand Paul of Kentucky was the sole Republican to vote against her nomination, while three Democrats \u2014 Sens. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Tim Kaine of Virginia \u2014 voted in favor. GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska did not originally cast a vote, but the committee later allowed her to record herself as a \"yes.\"",
      "Paul said he would oppose her because of her previous support for pro-labor policies. Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three Republicans who supported the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, in the last Congress, which did not advance past introduction. The bill would have made it easier for workers to unionize. During her confirmation hearing last week, the former lawmaker addressed her prior support for the bill, saying it was \"imperfect\" and she backs right-to-work laws, which allow workers to choose whether or not to join a union.",

      "Roberts, who oversees requests for emergency relief arising from cases in the District of Columbia, acted alone in halting the decision from a federal district judge issued Tuesday. The judge, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali, gave the State Department and USAID until 11:59 p.m. Wednesday to pay its bills to contractors for work that had been completed before Feb. 13. The Trump administration had earlier in the night asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the dispute involving frozen foreign assistance funds.",
      "Roberts gave the State Department and USAID contractors until noon Friday to respond to the Trump administration's request.",
      "Separately, the State Department cut more than 9,100 foreign assistance grants and contracts, totaling roughly $58.4 billion, a State Department spokesperson confirmed to CBS News. The cuts at USAID amount to a 92% decrease in grants and awards.",
      "In the bid for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said Ali's order covers an estimated $2 billion and said his Wednesday night deadline \"moved the goalposts.\"",
      "\"It is not tailored to any actual payment deadlines associated with respondents' invoices or drawn-down requests, or anyone else's. And it has thrown what should be an orderly review by the government into chaos,\" she wrote.",
      "Harris said that officials at the \"highest levels of government\" are involved in the matter and told the Supreme Court that the Trump administration is \"undertaking substantial efforts to review payment requests and release payments.\"",
      "\"The Executive Branch takes seriously its constitutional duty to comply with the orders of Article III courts,\" she wrote.",
      "But she warned that the district court's deadline \"makes full compliance impossible,\" in part because restarting funding related to canceled or suspended agreements requires multiple steps, multiple agencies and documentary evidence.",
      "The acting solicitor general requested an administrative stay, which would maintain the status quo, \"to ensure that the agencies are not placed in the position of violating a federal court order requiring payments on thousands of requests within a 30-some-hour deadline, despite their efforts, while this court reviews the merits of their challenge.\"",
      "The Trump administration had already appealed the district judge's order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and asked it to pause the lower court's decision. But the D.C. Circuit had yet to act by Wednesday evening. Harris said the administration was seeking the Supreme Court's intervention \"in light of that extraordinary circumstance.\"",
      "But shortly after the Trump administration formally asked the high court for emergency relief, the appeals court declined the Trump administration's request to pause the district court's decision. The three-judge panel on the D.C. Circuit said Ali's orders could not be appealed.",
      "Ali, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden in 2024, is overseeing the case brought by a group of companies, nonprofits and other organizations that receive money from the State Department and the USAID. He\u00a0issued a temporary restraining order earlier this month that prevented the Trump administration from freezing foreign aid funds for contracts and other awards while proceedings continued.",
      "But the contractors told Ali earlier this week that foreign aid funding was still not flowing despite his order, and sought prompt payment for work they completed weeks ago. The international development groups said they were owed millions of dollars for invoices and reimbursements, and warned the Trump administration's failure to reinstate the funding forced them to furlough workers and end critical programs overseas.",
      "Ali granted their motion to enforce his earlier order and gave the State Department and USAID 36 hours to pay the bills related to foreign aid contracts and grants.",
      "Justice Department lawyers said in a separate filing that they estimated the payments covered by Ali's order approached $2 billion, and for the challengers alone, the amount at issue was at least $250 million.",
      "\"This new order requiring payment of enormous sums in less than 36 hours intrudes deeply into the prerogatives of the Executive Branch and the president's obligation under Article II to take care that the laws are faithfully executed,\" they wrote in a filing to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "Peter Marocco, director of foreign assistance at the State Department, said in a declaration that the administration is undertaking an \"individualized review\" of contracts and grants, and warned determining the course of those awards is a \"cumbersome, multi-step process.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A Tajik man living in New York was arrested and charged with conspiring to provide material support to the ISIS and ISIS-K terrorist groups, according to court documents unsealed Wednesday.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged that Mansuri Manuchekhri, a Tajik national who was illegally living in Brooklyn, facilitated the transfer of over $70,000 to ISIS-affiliated individuals in Turkey and Syria between December 2021 and June 2023, including to one person who was arrested in Turkey for attacking a church in Istanbul in 2024. ISIS-K, or ISIS-Khorasan, is one of the terrorist group's most dangerous branches and publicly claimed responsibility for the attack.",
      "Manuchekhri was taken into custody after a close family member reported him to a New York terrorism tip line, warning of potential violence and saying that he had threatened to kill the family member, according to an affidavit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Manuchekhri discussed the payments at length with someone affiliated with ISIS in Turkey, who told him that the money would go to current ISIS soldiers and family members of dead ISIS fighters. They also alleged that Manuchekhri publicly expressed his support of past ISIS attacks on the U.S. and had multiple ISIS propaganda videos on his iCloud account.",
      "Manuchekhri would often train using firearms, prosecutors said, and in two instances sent videos of himself shooting guns to an ISIS contact in Turkey. He allegedly said that he trains with guns \"at least once or twice a week,\" and wrote in another message, \"Thank God, I am ready, brother.\"",
      "He was also charged with illegal possession of firearms, including an AK-47 and a tactical rifle, and immigration fraud. An attorney for Manuchekhri did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "The affidavit included photos allegedly taken from Manuchekhri's iCloud account showing him posed with various firearms at shooting ranges:",
      "Prosecutors said that Manuchekhri entered the U.S. on a tourist visa in 2016 and stayed in the country illegally after it expired. In March 2017, he paid an American citizen to enter into a sham marriage with him so he could obtain legal status in the United States, according to the affidavit.",
      "When immigration authorities asked for more documentation about the marriage, Manuchekhri filed for divorce and claimed he was a victim of domestic violence, hoping that would help him become a lawful permanent resident through other legal means, the government said.",
      "Both of Manuchekhri's immigration petitions were fraudulent, prosecutors alleged, adding that they have evidence he never lived with his wife and that utility bills submitted as evidence that the pair lived together were fake.",
      "Manuchekhri appeared before a federal judge on Wednesday and was ordered to be detained as proceedings play out, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York told CBS News.",
      "The arrest follows a spate of terrorism warnings from the U.S. government, with national security officials pointing to a system that's blinking red in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel and the emergence of terrorism hot spots in Central Asia.",
      "An ongoing FBI investigation into the New Year's Day truck attack on New Orleans' Bourbon Street found the attacker posted videos declaring his support for ISIS shortly before the deadly rampage. The attacker killed 14 people and injured dozens more when he rammed a pickup truck down the popular tourist spot.",
      "Following the attack, the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and National Counterterrorism Center circulated a law enforcement bulletin warning of the threat of violence from lone offenders: \"Official ISIS messaging in the group's flagship products from 2014 and 2016 called for attackers so use vehicles as weapons in addition to edged weapons and firearms, and pro-ISIS media outlets and the group's online supporters regularly recirculate or re-purpose those produces in a variety of forums.\"",
      "Last October, the FBI arrested Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi for allegedly planning an Election Day terrorist attack in Oklahoma City. Federal prosecutors said the Afghan national took steps to carry out an attack in the U.S., including by trying to sell his family home, relocate family abroad and stockpile firearms and ammunition.",
      "Last June, federal agents apprehended eight men from Tajikistan on immigration charges amid concern the men \u2014 who entered via the Southwest border and lived in Los Angeles, New York, and Philadelphia \u2014 were in the early stages of plotting a possible terrorist attack on U.S. soil, according to multiple U.S. officials.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-epa-cuts-spending-staffing/",
    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 19:48:39 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said the head of the EPA is prepared to implement deep staffing and spending cuts as part of the administration's efforts to downsize the executive branch.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said the head of the Environmental Protection Agency is prepared to implement deep staffing and spending cuts as part of the administration's efforts to downsize the executive branch, raising fears among employees and environmental groups about the impacts of the reductions.",
      "\"He thinks he's going to be cutting 65 or so percent of people from Environmental,\" Mr. Trump said at his first Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, referring to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. \"You had a lot of people who weren't doing their job. They were just obstructionists.\"",
      "A White House official later clarified that the president was referring to cutting 65% of spending at EPA, not necessarily a 65% cut in staff. Nonetheless, the remarks stoked concern among the EPA's workforce.",
      "The EPA currently employs more than 15,000 people across the country who are dedicated to its core mission of protecting clean air, land and water. A main part of that mission is to enforce federal laws, like the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, that protect the environment and human health. The agency is also instrumental in cleaning up contaminated lands and toxic sites. It recently wrapped up phase one of the hazardous debris clean-up in California following January's devastating wildfires.",
      "\"Trump said out loud what we have suspected all along: His agenda is to demolish the EPA,\" said Jeremy Symons, a senior adviser with the Environmental Protection Network, a group of more than 650 former EPA employees that was formed in 2017 to protect the integrity of the agency. \"This is a wrecking ball approach that will throw the doors open to corporate polluters.\"",
      "The Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management and Budget issued guidance to the heads of all agencies across the federal government on Wednesday instructing them to submit plans to reduce the size of their workforces and streamline their operations. The memo directed agencies to submit their plans to the offices for approval by March 13. Mr. Trump's comments about the EPA sparked confusion, given the agency has yet to submit a proposal for downsizing.",
      "\"Since this plan hasn't even been submitted to the OPM or OMB for review [and] approval, it is unclear how President Trump could state that there would be a 65% reduction at the EPA,\" said Marie Owens Powell, an EPA union president of Council 238, which represents thousands of employees across the country.",
      "\"President Trump, DOGE, and Administrator Zeldin are committed to cutting waste, fraud, and abuse across all agencies,\" said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers, referring to the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. \"After recently identifying $20 billion in fraudulent spending, Administrator Zeldin is committed to eliminating 65% of the EPA's wasteful spending.\"",
      "Rogers did not detail the $20 billion in allegedly fraudulent spending.",
      "Whether it's a 65% cut in staffing or a 65% budget cut, the impacts to the agency would be immense and hurt its ability to do its job, according to environmental organizations.",
      "\"Slashing the staff of the EPA will open the floodgates to more air pollution, contaminated water and toxic chemicals,\" said Alexandra Adams, chief policy advocacy officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. \"Pulling the nation's environmental stewards off the beat is great for polluters, but it's dangerous for the health of our families. Hobbling the EPA is not about saving money, it's about protecting President Trump's friends in the oil industry. Congress needs to step in to help put a stop to this.\""

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 17:50:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The SAVE Act could change voter registration requirements for millions of people. Here's how.",
    "story": [
      "A claim circulating on social media suggests that married people who changed their last name will face difficulties when trying to vote under the proposed Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act.",
      "Experts say the bill, which was recently\u00a0reintroduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, would not explicitly prevent these voters from casting a ballot, but it could create barriers to registration by requiring them to show additional documentation.",
      "If passed, the act would amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which requires states\u00a0to offer voter registration when obtaining a driver's license, to mandate documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration.",
      "This means that common forms of ID used for voter registration, including driver's licenses, would no longer be accepted as they are not generally considered proof of citizenship. Instead, voters would have to present documents such as a U.S. passport, a birth certificate, or naturalization paperwork to register.",
      "The Center for American Progress analysis estimated as many as 69 million have taken their spouse's name but do not have a matching birth certificate. \"The fate of those 69 million women are basically up in the air, the way the bill is written,\" said Greta Bedekovics, associate director of democracy policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy and advocacy group.",
      "Opponents argue that the law could also make voting more difficult for military and rural voters by upending both mail-in and online voter registration. Bedekovic said it would make an in-person trip to the election office the only \"viable way for Americans across the country to register to vote,\" adding that rural voters are less likely to have a passport and may have to travel hours to obtain and submit documents.",
      "According to Congress.gov, the bill also \"establishes criminal penalties\" for registering someone who does not have the right documents to vote.",
      "Eliza Sweren-Becker, senior counsel in the Brennan Center's Voting Rights and Elections Program, noted that the bill \"does not specify what extra documents\" married individuals would need to produce, adding that \"election officials, who would face legal risks under the bill, would be hesitant to register women whose documentation name does not match their current name.\"",
      "\"This in-person 'show your papers' requirement would keep many eligible voters out of the voting booth \u2014 beyond the millions who already lack ready access to their citizenship documents \u2014 and cause chaos for election administration,\" said Sweren-Becker.",
      "As of January 2025, eight states require proof of citizenship to register to vote, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Americans widely support both voter ID requirements and proof of citizenship. A\u00a02024 Gallup survey found more than 4 in 5 respondents supported proof of citizenship requirements for first-time voters.",
      "Supporters of the bill, including U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, a Republican from Pennsylvania, argue that it is necessary to prevent noncitizens from voting.",
      "However,\u00a0noncitizen voting is already illegal and rare. In a study following the 2016 election, the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice found just 30 suspected cases of noncitizen voting out of 23.5 million votes cast in the 42 jurisdictions reviewed.",
      "The SAVE Act has not yet passed and remains under debate in Congress.",
      "A 2023 Pew Research survey found\u00a0that about 80% of women married to men in the U.S. take their husband's last name. Under the SAVE Act, if their voter registration name differs from the name on their birth certificate or passport, they may need to show additional documents.",
      "If the SAVE Act were to become law, Bedekovics said married women who have changed their names should obtain certified copies of all marriage certificates, locate their birth certificates, and keep any change-of-name documentation on hand for any updates to their voter registration.",

      "In the memo, the heads of the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management asked agencies to submit these plans by March 13 and to prepare for \"reductions in force.\"",

Although several high-profile members of the administration posted on social media that they had answered \u2014 including White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt \u2014 other agency heads said they had directed their employees not to respond.",
      "The White House later said each agency could decide if employees had to reply. But Mr. Trump suggested at the start of a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday that they would be taking another look at the 1 million who did not respond, although he conceded that some could not respond due to the classified nature of their work.",
      "Those who didn't respond \"are on the bubble,\" he said, adding, \"maybe they're gonna be gone.\"",
      "Musk's role at the helm of the agency has been in question, with the administration denying he was is the DOGE administrator \u2014 a role specified in Mr. Trump's executive order creating the agency.

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 15:54:14 -0500",
    "summary": "USDA officials said there are \"no anticipated changes\" to the policy for killing flocks with sick birds.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Department of Agriculture officials said Wednesday that there are \"no anticipated changes\" to the current federal policy requiring poultry to be culled in response to bird flu outbreaks, which have driven up egg prices to record highs in recent months.",
      "The decision marks a rebuke of an idea floated by Trump administration officials in recent weeks to change the policy. More than 35 million birds have been killed in response to bird flu outbreaks in commercial flocks so far this year, according to the USDA's figures.",
      "\"The Biden plan was to just kill chickens, and they spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken,\" Kevin Hasset, director of the White House's economic council, told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\"\u00a0on Feb. 16.",
      "The U.S. and most other countries have a \"stamping-out policy\" for bird flu, in order to comply with standards that underpin international poultry exports from the World Organization for Animal Health, or WOAH.",
      "\"No anticipated changes to our current stamping-out policy at this time. And we will continue to follow WOAH guidelines,\" Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said Wednesday on a call with stakeholders.",
      "Biden administration officials had defended the culling approach as the best way to contain outbreaks and cut down on unnecessary suffering of poultry birds who are likely to otherwise die prolonged deaths from the disease anyway.",
      "\"The avian flu is an extremely fast spreading virus. And within a couple of days, it spreads so quickly that most of the chickens have died anyway,\" Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Wednesday in a Fox News interview.",
      "But Rollins also reiterated openness to changing the policy, saying that they hoped to fund research into \"some pilot programs around the country\" that might help avoid culling infected birds.",
      "\"There are some farmers that are out there that are willing to really try this on a pilot as we build the safe perimeter around them to see if there is a way forward with immunity,\" she added.",
      "Changes to how authorities respond to bird flu outbreaks could also have major implications for America's poultry industry, which exported more than $5 billion of poultry products last year.",
      "Rising egg prices",
      "Sifford's remarks come as the Trump administration is rolling out a new plan to combat the surge in egg prices driven by this past winter's uptick in bird flu outbreaks.",
      "Some of the new plan amounts to continuations of programs already being developed at the department, former USDA officials under the Biden administration said, or federal funding that officials had already secured towards combating the virus.",
      "One near-term change officials highlighted is that the USDA says it will soon pay \"up to 75% of the cost of addressing some of the highest risk biosecurity challenges that the producer faces,\" when issues are identified through the free audits that are offered to farmers.",
      "Rollins also said the administration is looking to import eggs in the short term, telling reporters at the White House that the talks could amount to up to 100 million more eggs imported over the next two months.",
      "In a call with reporters, officials mentioned Turkey as an example of a country that could export millions more eggs to the U.S. this year.",
      "The officials also said that they wanted \"to be realistic\" about the temporary imports, citing the need for food safety precautions on imported eggs. Private purchases of the imported eggs will also not be subsidized by the administration.",
      "Considering a plan to vaccinate poultry for bird flu",
      "One longer-term change could be the possibility of deploying a vaccine for poultry, which the Trump administration says it is now seriously considering.",
      "While previous administrations have poured money into research and development of new poultry vaccinations for bird flu, the idea has been plagued by concerns that vaccinating chickens would lead to undetected bird flu infections spreading in flocks that aren't displaying symptoms.",
      "Current outbreaks in the U.S. have already led to some spread of the virus from poultry to raw pet food, leading to the deaths of cats in several states.",
      "Any move to start vaccinating poultry could trigger import bans under agreements governing poultry exports, over concerns that food could be contaminated with the virus. Drawing up a plan to surveil and test poultry for missed infections would be needed to assuage those fears.",
      "One former USDA official under the Biden administration said it took more than a year of daily meetings to negotiate safely resuming imports of some poultry from France after that country's authorities decided to begin vaccinating ducks for bird flu.",
      "\"We expect to start the working group within the next two weeks and we will move very swiftly to put together a full plan, so that we can put that in front of trading partners as quickly as possible,\" said Sifford on the stakeholder call.",
      "USDA officials cautioned that they had not yet actually decided to begin vaccinations of poultry, citing the potential impact on exports.",
      "Instead, the department plans to continue supporting research and development into vaccines. Studies are aimed at overcoming the two longstanding hurdles towards using the shots: attempting to achieve \"sterilizing immunity\" to stop spread of the virus and making it easier to administer to the hundreds of birds in commercial flocks.",
      "\"We're going to make sure that we work to limit any impact on export trade markets, if there ever was vaccination rolled out,\" the department's chief of staff Kailee Buller told reporters.",

    "summary": "Intuitive Machines launches its second moon lander, which will use NASA and commercially developed tools to search for ice in the moon's crust.",
    "story": [
      "With two commercial moon landers already on their way, Houston-based Intuitive Machines launched its second robotic lander atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket Wednesday, the centerpiece of a multi-element NASA-sponsored mission to help pave the way for human expeditions.",
      "The workhorse rocket's nine first-stage engines roared to life at  7:16 p.m. EST, pushing the booster away from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center atop 1.9 million pounds of thrust and a brilliant jet of flaming exhaust.",
      "Arcing to the east through a crystal-clear early evening sky, the rocket quickly disappeared from view as it consumed propellant and lost weight. Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, the first stage fell away and the Falcon 9 continued toward space on the power of its single second stage engine.",
      "A little less than six minutes after that, the upper stage engine shut down, putting the rocket on the planned trajectory. A second one-minute firing was carried out 36 minutes after launch to put the upper stage and its payloads on course for the moon.",
      "Given the on-time launch and assuming no major problems, the Athena lander is expected to descend to touchdown on a flat mesa-like structure known as Mons Mouton on March 6, setting down just 100 miles from the moon's south pole \u2014 closer than any other spacecraft has attempted.",
      "Another privately-built moon lander, Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost, was launched by a Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket on Jan. 15 and is on course to land on the moon early Sunday. Touching down near the center of Mare Crisium, it is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments to collect data needed for planned astronaut landings in the agency's Artemis program.",
      "Blue Ghost shared its Falcon 9 with yet another moon lander, this one built by the Japanese company ispace. It is on a longer, low-energy trajectory to the moon and is expected to land in May.",
      "What's different about the Athena lander",
      "The Athena lander represents a more complex mission with broader science goals. Intuitive Machines managers say they incorporated dozens of upgrades and improvements to insure a safe, upright landing after the company's first lander, Odysseus, tipped over during touchdown last February.",
      "\"Every time you go, it's ... a roll-the-dice thing,\" said CEO Steve Altemus. \"I think we have higher confidence, but we're also have a much more complicated mission this time.",
      "\"This time we're flying with a deployable drill. We're flying with a deployable rover, we're flying with a drone, (a) rocket-powered drone that hops, flies off the lander and hops along the surface and down into a permanently shadowed (crater).",
      "\"All those deployments and surface operations are new, and we're going to learn when we do those,\" he said.",
      "The Athena lander's Trident drill and a mass spectrometer will analyze the ultra-cold soil beneath the spacecraft. The lander also will deploy a small commercially-built rover and a rocket-powered hopper that will jump up to 300 feet high before bounding into a nearby, permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",
      "Ice would be a critical resource for future astronauts, if it can be extracted, because it can be turned into drinking water, air and even rocket fuel, providing in situ resources that otherwise would have to be carried up from Earth.",
      "Data collected by orbiting satellites indicate reservoirs of ice may be present in the cold, dark interiors of polar craters that never see the light of the sun. Athena's mission is the first to actually search for the suspected ice from the surface.",
      "The hopper, named Grace after software pioneer Grace Hopper, and the Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform rover built by a company called Lunar Outpost, will communicate with the Athena lander via cellular networking equipment provided by Nokia in a first-of-its-kind demonstration.",
      "Other spacecrafts tagging along",
      "A tiny microrover known as Yaoki, provided by Tokyo-based Dymon Co., will be dropped to the surface from the Athena lander. It will provide close-up images of the lunar soil, or regolith, and beam them back to Earth through Athena.",
      "In case all that is not enough, hitching a ride aboard the Falcon 9 are three more independent spacecraft, one provided by NASA and two from private companies.",
      "AstroForge's commercially developed Odin asteroid prospector was released four minutes after Athena, NASA's Lunar Trailblazer satellite was deployed about 20 seconds after that followed a few seconds later by Epic Aerospace's Chimera GEO-1 space tug.",
      "Odin is headed for deep space on an asteroid prospecting mission. It will be the first commercially-built probe to fly beyond the moon, heading for an asteroid flyby to look for potentially valuable mineral deposits.",
      "During the Lunar Trailblazer's two-year mission, two instruments will study the nature of any ice that might be present in the lunar soil below while measuring surface temperatures on a global scale.",
      "The third satellite, known as Chimera GEO, was provided by Epic Aerospace. It's a compact space tug built to move small satellites to different locations in Earth orbit.",
      "The Grace hopper may end up the star of the show. Five hops are planned with the first carrying it to an altitude of about 65 feet to a landing another 65 feet from Athena.",
      "\"On the second hop, we expect to go around 50 meters (164 feet) altitude. And on the third hop we'll go about 100 meters (328 feet) altitude,\" said Trent Martin, a senior vice president at Intuitive Machines.",
      "The fourth hop will carry Grace into a permanently shadowed crater some 1,500 from the lander. It's fifth and final hop, either commanded through the Nokia network or triggered by a backup timer, will carry Gracie back up and out of the crater.",
      "\"The purpose of the demo is to show that we can reach extreme environments with technologies other than rovers,\" Martin said. \"The idea is that if you have a really deep crater and you want to get down into that crater, why not do it with something like a drone?\"",
      "The costs of the mission",
      "NASA paid Intuitive Machines $62 million to deliver the Trident drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million to help fund Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million helps finance Intuitive's Grace hopper.",
      "Finally, NASA spent another $89 million on the Lunar Trailblazer satellite and mission operations. Total cost to NASA: $207 million.",
      "The mission was funded in large part by the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the moon to enable industry growth and to support long-term lunar exploration, helping the United States stay ahead in space innovation,\" said Nicola Fox, head of NASA's space science mission directorate.",
      "Athena is Intuitive Machines' second CLPS-sponsored lunar lander. The company's first lander, Odysseus, touched down on the moon on Feb. 22, 2024. But the spacecraft came down harder than expected and it was moving slightly to one side at the moment of touchdown. It apparently caught a footpad on the surface and tipped over on its side.",
      "The spacecraft still had power, however, and it sent back data for several days. This time around, multiple upgrades were put in place to insure a safe landing for Athena.",
      "\"If you can routinely land on the moon, all the smart people, the scientists, and the engineers that want to fly things to the moon will now be willing to invest money, to build and engineer the systems that will help us live and work on the moon,\" Altemus said.",
      "\"These are the initial highways or trails that open up a whole new region of exploration of the moon. Like the United States when it was very young, go west, right? This is like that. Just like that.\"",

      "For the best chances, spectators should look at the sky as soon as the sun sets. That's when the planets will make a brief appearance.",
      "Which day is best will depend on the location. Tokyo started seeing the parade first, on Feb. 22, according to Star Walk, a sky-gazing app. New York will have the best view of the event on Feb. 25, Star Walk said. In other parts of the world, the phenomenon will be best visible in early March. Worldwide, the best day to see the alignment will be Feb. 28.",
      "How to watch the planetary parade",
      "Five planets are visible to the naked eye, according to NASA: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.",
      "Mars will appear reddish and high in the sky, near the Gemini constellation, Star Walk said. Jupiter will be a bit lower in the sky, near Taurus. Venus will appear as the brightest planet in the sky, near the Pisces constellation.",
      "Mercury will be in the constellation Aquarius, near the sun and just above the western horizon. Saturn will also be near the sun and low in the horizon, making it harder to spot, Star Walk said.",
      "To see Uranus and Neptune, you'll need a telescope, NASA said. Uranus will appear in the Aries constellation, and Neptune will be in Pisces, Star Walk said.",
      "The display will only be visible for a few minutes after sunset, because the planets near the horizon \u2014 Saturn and Mercury \u2014 will be setting. Once they drop below the horizon, they will no longer be visible, but the other planets will linger in the night sky.",
      "For the best view, head to a location with minimal light pollution and a clear view of the horizon. Clear skies will also be necessary to see all the planets.",
      "How do planetary alignments work?",
      "The planets in the solar system orbit the sun, just as Earth does. Every planet orbits at a different speed and distance.",
      "During these alignments, the planets appear to be lined up from Earth's perspective, creating the visual display, NASA said. In reality, the planets are extremely far from each other.",
      "The planets also move very slowly, causing the multi-day timeline of the planetary parades.",
      "When will the next planetary alignment be?",
      "Lineups of four or five planets occur every few years, according to NASA. In late August 2025, four planets will be visible before sunrise, and in late October 2028, five planets will be visible at once before sunrise. Another five-planet alignment will occur in late February 2034, with the planets visible after sunset.",
      "\"In summary, while they aren't once-in-a-lifetime events, planetary parades afford an uncommon opportunity to look up and appreciate our place in our solar system, with diverse worlds arrayed across the sky before our very eyes,\" NASA says on its website.",
      "Outside of the planetary alignments, it's possible to spot other planets individually. Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are frequently seen in the night sky, according to NASA.",

      "In responding to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple defended its diversity program as an integral part of its corporate culture, crediting the policies in part for making the technology giant the most valuable company in the world.",
      "\"We've never had quotas or targets for Apple. Our strength has always come from hiring the very best people and then providing a culture of collaboration,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a question-and-answer period at the meeting, while conceding the company may need to revise aspects of its diversity policies \"as the legal landscape\" around DEI evolves.",
      "\"But our North Star of dignity and respect for everyone, and our work to that end, will never waver,\" he said.",
      "Apple disclosed in 2022 that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees; early two-thirds of its employees were men.",
      "Mr. Trump slammed the decision by Apple shareholders to reject the proposal to end the company's DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Apple should get rid of DEI rules, not just make adjustments to them. DEI was a hoax that has been very bad for our country. DEI is gone!!!\" he wrote in a social media post on Wednesday.",
      "DEI, aimed at promoting fairness in the workplace and opening career paths for people of color, women and other protected classes,\u00a0gained momentum\u00a0after the 2020 murder of George Floyd.",
      "But that trend has reversed of late, with Ford,\u00a0Google, McDonald's, Meta,\u00a0Target, Walmart and other large corporations scaling back their diversity initiatives under pressure from conservative activists emboldened by court rulings and by President Trump, who has banned DEI programs across the federal government.",
      "Shifting DEI landscape",
      "Certain forms of DEI have become more legally risky than just a few years ago, yet practices such as employers posing standardized questions in recruitment to mitigate implicit bias are legally sound, according to David Glasgow, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law and executive director of its Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.",
      "\"DEI is a really broad umbrella term covering things like disabilities, parental leave and flexible work. The anti-DEI folks have done a good job of driving the narrative that it's all about racial quotas and preferences,\" which in reality is just a narrow slice of such initiatives, Glasgow told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some companies' response to the current legal and political climate is a matter of rebranding, Glasgow said. Businesses may ditch the terms diversity, equity and inclusion, while substituting references to \"welcoming\" and \"belonging.\"",
      "\"[I]t's more about getting anti-DEI activists off their back,\" Glasgow said.",
      "Critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. By contrast, advocates of these policies say that supporting inclusivity doesn't inhibit companies from rewarding top-performing employees, while also helping organizations create a respectful workplace culture.",
      "Despite the pushback on diversity, roughly half of corporate leaders who were surveyed after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration said they weren't considering rolling back their DEI programs, according to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0of 350 C-suite executives from Littler, a law firm focused on labor and employment issues. Roughly 22% of executives are considering reducing or phasing out jobs focused on DEI, the survey found.",

    "summary": "Cuts to the U.S. cybersecurity agency and FBI affected the federal workers tasked with stopping foreign interference in elections.",
    "story": [
      "Over the last month, the U.S. government has worked quickly to pause, disband and dismantle the U.S. effort to fight foreign meddling in elections, raising concern among federal lawmakers and election officials across the country who rely on the federal cybersecurity agency and its counterparts to warn them about attacks on election systems.",
      "First came a flurry of notices forcing out Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency personnel who are tasked with stopping foreign interference in U.S. elections \u2014 at least a dozen have been put on leave or fired over the past month. Then, on Attorney General Pam Bondi's first day in office on Feb. 5, she disbanded the FBI task force targeting foreign influence operations originating from places like Russia, China and Iran.",
      "The focus on election security has been turned toward the past, rather than the future. In an internal memo earlier this month, CISA's acting director announced an internal investigation to assess every position and program that touches election security \u2014 including election misinformation and disinformation \u2014 dating back to President Trump's first term in office, with findings to be delivered in a final report on March 6.",
      "The message, penned by Acting Director Bridget Bean and first reported by Wired, also revealed the defunding of a nationwide program to train state and local government officials and offer threat monitoring services through a center known as the \"Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center.\"",
      "\"It is necessary to rescope the agency's election security activities to ensure CISA is focused exclusively on executing its cyber and physical security mission,\" Bean wrote in the message, echoing Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's assertion during her confirmation hearing that the agency had strayed \"far off mission.\"",
      "The memo landed in the mailboxes of CISA's roughly 3,400 personnel on Valentine's Day, hours before more than 130 probationary workers \u2013 roughly 4% of the nation's cyberdefense agency \u2014 were summarily fired with form-letter terminations.",
      "Top Democrats on the Senate and House committees overseeing election legislation expressed \"grave concern\" over the changes in a letter to CISA's top leaders, noting the agency's \"establishing legislation clearly directs it to work on elections.\"",
      "\"We're here because in 2016 a foreign government \u2014 Russia \u2014 tried to tamper with our stuff,\" Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon told CBS News. \"They tried to physically hack into election systems,\" he added, noting Minnesota was just one of 21 states targeted, setting into motion a January 2017 designation of elections as critical infrastructure.",
      "In a letter to President Trump, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes likened the cuts to shutting down the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ahead of hurricane season. \"This decision undermines Arizona's election security at a time when our enemies around the world are using online tools to push their agendas and ideologies into our very homes,\" he wrote.",
      "The moves come months after CISA and the FBI aided states responding to a slew of Election Day bomb threats and white powder mailings. Officials debunked phony Russian-linked videos\u00a0purporting to depict election workers destroying ballots during nationwide voting, and an FBI investigation outed a hack-and-leak operation that stole documents from Mr. Trump's campaign, leading to the indictment of three Iranian cyber operatives.",
      "CISA and the FBI possess a broader view of the threat landscape that election officials find to be helpful in sizing up the threats facing them. \"You know it would be difficult to comprehend 50 states doing this on their own,\" Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt told CBS News. \"Each state runs elections in accordance with federal and state law\u2026 but no state has a national or global perspective on the nature of threats and the capabilities of bad faith actors seeking to disrupt our electoral process.\"",
      "While state and local governments run elections nationwide, federal agencies like CISA and the FBI coordinate with election offices to help safeguard against rising cyber and physical threats, while uncovering foreign influence campaigns designed to sow division among Americans and uproot voter confidence.",
      "\"States can often see only the effects of the attacks \u2014 disinformation directed at them and their voters and threats, but they have no insight into where those attacks are coming from, and therefore, have a limited ability to respond,\" said David Becker, CBS News election law expert and political contributor. \"CISA, the FBI Foreign Influence Task Force, and others, have that 'birds-eye view' insight, both detecting the source of the attacks \u2014 domestic or foreign, nations or criminal actors \u2014 as well as how they all fit into the big picture.\"",
      "In a letter to the DHS secretary on Friday, nearly 40 chief election officials wrote to try to persuade Noem to maintain cybersecurity and physical security services provided to states. \"Information technology systems related to election administration have long been targeted by sophisticated cyber threat actors including nation-state and cybercriminal groups,\" leaders of the National Association of Secretaries of State wrote. \"CISA's prioritized services help election entities defend against these national security threats.\"",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that \"CISA needs to refocus on its mission\" and is \"undertaking an evaluation of how it has executed its election security mission with a particular focus on any work related to mis-, dis-, and malinformation.\"",
      "But the cuts across CISA and the FBI targeted teams may not only affect their ability to identify false content online but could also affect safeguards protecting election infrastructure from being undermined, according to multiple current and former U.S. officials. The teams have rooted out covert operations from Russia, China and Iran in the last year alone. Among the cyber agency employees targeted are members of CISA's Election Security Resilience Team, the Cybersecurity Advisory Committee and Regional Election Security Advisors, multiple current and former federal and state officials told CBS News.",
      "The new administration has not yet nominated a new CISA director, with the agency's highest-ranking political appointee, Karen Evans, now serving as a senior adviser.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump\u00a0attempted to fire the chair of the Federal Election Commission, a move that coincides with the adjudication of campaign finance complaints from the 2024 election, including those against tech billionaire and presidential ally Elon Musk.",
      "Mr. Trump and some conservatives on Capitol Hill have accused CISA of policing speech by coordinating with social media companies to identify online misinformation and disinformation ahead of the 2020 election. They accused the agency of \"censorship,\" which CISA officials have repeatedly denied. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a lawsuit over the government's work, but the blowback prompted CISA to curb those conversations with tech platforms in 2021, according to three former U.S. officials.",
      "\"That is not our role, that's not what we do,\" former CISA Director Jen Easterly told reporters last year, ahead of the 2024 election. \"We're looking to work with our partners on overall threats to election infrastructure.\"",
      "CISA's ongoing internal probe appears to follow a Jan. 20-related directive instructing the attorney general and agency leaders to investigate Biden administration activities that are \"inconsistent\" with Trump's vow to end \"online censorship.\"",
      "DHS and CISA did not immediately respond to CBS News' questions about who directed the audit and would not say whether the report would be publicly released. The Justice Department did not respond to questions about whether the attorney general would be consulted on the investigation.",
      "\"I'm concerned and alarmed at what looks like a retreat from the anti-disinformation mission,\" Simon said. \"If a foreign adversary is spinning up a false narrative about our election system that could impact physical security, all it takes is one person who believes this disinformation to act out in a violent or threatening, harassing or intimidating way. All it takes is one.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 16:19:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A 9-year-old's mission to get a bionic arm led to a story about the power of kindness \u2014 and an inspiring new friendship.",
    "story": [
      "Remi Bateman was born without her left forearm and hand but she doesn't let it slow her down.",
      "Now 9 years old, Bateman is busy riding her bike and scooter around her neighborhood in Utah \u2014 and she's got her sights set on doing even more daily tasks, like cutting her own food and doing her own hair.",
      "Remi has been using a silicone prosthesis, covered by her health insurance, since she was 6 months old. While the prosthetic is helpful, it's heavy and doesn't give her the ability to move fingers.",
      "\"Her current prosthetic is pretty stationary and doesn't do a lot,\" her mother, Jami, told \"CBS Mornings.\" The hand on Remi's prosthesis was molded into a plastic fist.",
      "A \"life changing\" mission",
      "Last year, Jami came across a social media post for\u00a0Open Bionics\u00a0and its 3D-printed multi-grip \"Hero Arm.\" Each finger has its own motor, making it possible to grip everyday items with precision. Within 48 hours, Jami and her husband, Josh, scheduled a video consultation with Open Bionics and drove to their clinic in Denver, Colorado for an initial fitting.",
      "\"It was life changing,\" Jami said. \"This bionic arm is like 95% of having a real hand.\"",
      "The Batemans hoped insurance would help pay for the Hero Arm but their provider denied coverage, saying it wasn't \"medically necessary,\" according to Jami. Without insurance, the bionic arm cost $24,000.",
      "\"I do understand that you can live just fine without [a hand], but imagine what you could do with two hands. I feel like the whole world is built around having two hands,\" Jami said.",
      "Like many Americans with medical needs not covered by insurance, the Batemans turned to crowdsourcing.",
      "On Dec. 10, 2024, Remi's fight for her Hero Arm made the local news. Within four days, the Batemans raised over $24,000. Andy Schoonover, CEO of\u00a0CrowdHealth, a subscriber-based crowdfunding platform for medical bills, also contacted the Batemans after seeing their plea for help online.",
      "\"He told me he would pay for Remi's hand in cash,\" said Jami.",
      "And that's where the story takes a turn.",
      "Paying it forward",
      "With Schoonover's gift, Jami realized they still had $24,000 in donations. She asked her daughter what she wanted to do with it.",
      "\"Help more kids,\" Remi enthusiastically replied. \"So people can actually have a life-changing arm like me.\"",
      "Across the country in Maryland, 9-year-old Tyraun \"Taj\" Johnson was also trying to raise money for a Hero Arm. He was born with a partial left hand. His family worked hand specialists at Johns Hopkins Medicine to look at surgery and different prosthesis options to give him some usage of his left hand. They were hopeful the Hero Arm could be the solution they were searching for.",
      "But like Remi, Taj's health insurance company denied the coverage of the Hero Arm. His family was devastated.",
      "\"You're telling me that a kid able to function with daily tasks \u2013 something as small as feeding themselves, getting dressed...You're telling me that that's not medically necessary?\" his mother, Kaitlin Skinner, asked.",
      "\"I would give Taj my left hand if I could,\" Kaitlin added.",
      "The family started lemonade stands to raise the money for the bionic arm. In four months, they had only made $1,500.",
      "Then they got a life-changing call from Remi's mom. The Bateman's offered to use the donations they received for Remi's arm for Taj's Hero Arm.",
      "Open Bionics helped connect the families. Samantha Payne, co-founder of Open Bionics, told CBS News clinicians spend a lot of time assisting families in appealing insurance denials.\u00a0 \"The technology is 20 years old and has been tested,\" added Payne.",
      "A dream come true",
      "Kaitlin was brought to tears by the Batemans' generous offer and thanked them for making Taj's dream come true.",
      "\"Taj got teary eyed when he saw a video of Remi holding a fork with the Hero Arm,\" Kaitlin said. One of the things Taj is most looking forward to is playing sports.",
      "Kaitlin recently drove to New York City with Taj to meet Daniel Green, upper limb prosthetist at Open Bionics, who will make the mold that will become Taj's Hero Arm. While in New York, Taj had a surprise visitor: Remi and her mom. They arrived at our invitation.",
      "A new friendship forged through the kindness of strangers. Remi and Taj plan to meet again during the summer.",
      "\"If we have a playdate with our [Hero] robot arms, we could be like Ironman,\" Remi said.",
      "Donations for Remi continued to pour in. So she's continued to pay it forward, using the fund to help two more 11 year olds fund their Hero Arms after insurance denied their claims.",

    "summary": "The Social Security Administration is offering payouts to employees who voluntarily resign from the federal agency, ahead of what they warn will be \"significant workforce reductions.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration is offering financial incentives ranging from $15,000 to $25,000 to employees who choose to voluntarily resign from the federal agency, ahead of what they warn will be \"significant workforce reductions.\"",
      "A message sent out to employees Thursday stated that the agency will soon implement restructuring that includes workforce cuts and \"massive reorganizations.\"",
      "The SSA said that wholesale \"abolishment of organizations and positions\" could happen, as well as reassignments and staff cuts.",
      "Earlier this week, the Office of Personnel Management advised agencies to submit \"reorganization plans\" by March 13 and prepare for \"reductions in force.\"",
      "Thursday's message offers all Social Security employees three options ahead of the agency's expected cuts: voluntary reassignment \"to a mission critical position,\" voluntary early retirement, if eligible, or \"voluntary separation incentive payments,\" if eligible.",
      "Those who would take the voluntary separation incentive payment must opt in by March 14 and leave the agency no later than April 19. The option echoes the \"fork in the road\" or deferred resignation program from OPM, in which eligible federal employees could resign from their positions and retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The incentive payments offered the SSA is dependent on an employee's classification, or where they stand on the federal payscale. Those with a GS-8 or under would get $15,000, while those classified with GS-9 to GS-12 would receive $20,000. Those with a GS-13 or higher would receive $25,000.",
      "SSA notes that employees who opt in may be put on administrative leave through April 19 and must not have already opted into the buyout program offered by OPM earlier this year.",
      "Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS News they fear employees may opt in to get the separation payment, and that it could already strain the benefits agency she said is in need of more investment to shorten wait times and open more field offices, not cuts.",
      "\"If people don't take it, then they're going to be constantly looking over their shoulder, looking through their email waiting to see if they get fired,\" Altman said. \"It's going to add stress, chaos and uncertainty.\"",
      "Altman added that employees should first see if their severance pay from a potential termination could be more than what the SSA is offering for voluntarily resigning.",
      "Jill Hornick, a 33-year Social Security employee, noted that public-facing employees who work in field offices and handle claims at Social Security's 1-800 number were told by former acting SSA Commissioner Michelle King that they were exempt from OPM's buyout offer.",
      "\"[King] knew it would hurt public service\" if these hires were allowed to take the offer, said Hornick, who is also an administrative director at an Illinois local chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees, which nationally represents hundreds of thousands of federal workers. \"Because we're at a 25-year staffing low.\"",
      "Now that this separation incentive is available to them, Hornick said she has \"no doubt\" these frontline employees will take it, and warned that processing times for claims could \"go through the roof.\"",
      "\"I have been trying to reassure [these] employees to take a deep breath. They're terrified, scared to death they will not have a job tomorrow, and put a roof over their head. It's just been one thing after another this week,\" Hornick added.",
      "The incentive payments offer does not apply to probationary employees, who generally have less than a year on the job, and must have worked in the executive branch for at least three years.",
      "Those looking to retire early must opt in between March 1 and Dec. 31. To be eligible for early retirement, an employee must be at least 50 years old and have 20 years of \"creditable service,\" or have 25 years of creditable service at any age.",
      "The SSA has seen several changes in recent weeks. Acting SSA Commissioner Leland Dudek was appointed to the role after the previous commissioner, King, was resistant to allowing staff with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, get access to sensitive agency data.",
      "Earlier this week, two SSA offices were closed \u2014 the Office of Transformation and the Office of Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity \u2014 which resulted in 190 staffers being put on administrative leave.",

      "King's husband, Gavyn Johnson-Dean, said the couple initially \"chalked up all the symptoms to after-pregnancy and after a C-section, but it just kept building and building.\"",
      "Johnson-Dean finally insisted she go to the emergency room. Doctors discovered she was suffering from peripartum cardiomyopathy, a rare condition in which the heart weakens that can happen in the last month of pregnancy or within a few months of delivery.",
      "Symptoms of peripartum cardiomyopathy include fatigue, heart palpitations and shortness of breath.",
      "\"Be your own advocate for your own health,\" said Dr. Phillip Lam, a heart failure and transplant cardiologist at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C., where King underwent the transplant procedure. \"If you really feel like something is not right and something is off, seek care, don't ignore it.\"",
      "Lam, who was King's post-care doctor, described her case as rare and very aggressive. While she waited for a donor, she remained hospitalized while her newborn, Gage, was at home.",
      "\"It was a flood of different emotions, of happiness, but fear, anxiety as well,\" Johnson-Dean said of that time.",
      "Eleven hours of surgery later, King had a new lease on life. She now wears a bracelet to honor her donor and all they have given her.",
      "\"What do I not want them to know?\" King said of her donor. \"The biggest thing for me is that this decision that may have been really easy or hard for them, has allowed me to be a mom. Every day I just imagined my family, and not being there for them, and what their lives would be like.\"",
      "She is now about 18 months into what her family describes as a lifelong recovery.",

    "story": [
      "The State Department confirmed Thursday it plans to end more than 90% of USAID contracts around the world, while keeping in place contracts for the most crucial food and health programs.",
      "The department claims its cuts would allow the agency to tighten its belt by $58.2 billion in unspent funds on multi-year awards, but it provided no documentation to support its claim. It's also not clear that the department is funding the initiatives it claims it's supporting.",
      "USAID disbursed nearly $9 billion around the world in 2024 on public health initiatives. A State Department spokesperson said Thursday the agency spared critical USAID awards, including for food assistance, and life-saving medical treatments for diseases such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis.",
      "But Lucica Ditiu, the executive director of the Stop TB Partnership, said her global nonprofit, which focuses on tuberculosis, lost funding.",
      "\"That is not correct, absolutely not true,\" she said of the claim that life-saving treatments were spared.",
      "She said her organization would survive without U.S. assistance, but it will have to downsize weeks after securing what she was led to believe would be a five-year commitment.",
      "The U.S. government has been the largest government-to-government donor in the effort to end tuberculosis, a preventable and curable disease that is the leading cause of death globally from a single infectious agent.",
      "The Stop TB Partnership provides grants using USAID funds to 140 grassroots tuberculosis treatment and prevention organizations around the world, some of which perform the risky task of going door-to-door in search of people suffering from the infectious disease.",
      "The State Department has not specified exactly which programs have been cut, and which have been spared. USAID, which represents a fraction of 1% of the federal budget, has been targeted for elimination by the White House's cost cutters, most notably the world's richest man Elon Musk. The agency he championed, DOGE, has posted a \"wall of receipts\" that purports to show where cuts are being made. It's been marked by inaccuracies, miscalculations and unsubstantiated claims of budget cutting.",
      "Musk himself acknowledged that mistakes have been made during a White House Cabinet meeting Wednesday.",
      "\"One of the things we accidentally canceled very briefly was Ebola prevention.\" Musk said, before adding \"there was no interruption\" in services.",
      "Even that was apparently a misstatement. The Associated Press reported that day that a USAID official said no funds for fighting the deadly virus had been released since President Trump's Jan. 20 funding freeze on foreign aid.",
      "A State Department spokesperson said a review of its contracts and grants was geared toward eliminating all but the ones that make America stronger, safer and more prosperous. The agency's cuts are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to drastically shrink the federal workforce and budget.",
      "Ditiu questioned whether cutting funds designed for tuberculosis prevention would do that. She said \"thousands and thousands\" of people working to treat and prevent the disease globally stand to be laid off. She worries about work being interrupted in Mozambique, where there's an \"extremely drug resistant strain.\"",
      "\"TB is airborne. You can wear a condom, you can sleep under a bed net, you can run and exercise and eat just kale all your life. As long as you breathe, you can get TB,\" Ditius said. \"You can get it on a plane, in a taxi ride \u2026 it's not enough to close the borders.\"",
      "She predicted that as organizations recalibrate and rebuild without American funds, they'll take their purchasing power elsewhere, buying diagnostic tools and medicine from international competitors such as China.",
      "\"I honestly don't think that anyone took the time, or wanted to listen, to explain what it means for the U.S.,\" Ditiu said.",
      "Randy Chester, a USAID staffer and vice president of the American Foreign Service Association, warned that the cuts not only hurt those abroad, but they're going to affect Americans \u2014 and not just the government workers who are being fired.",
      "\"Every year we spend $2 billion on agriculture products in the U.S. from Midwestern farmers,\" Chester said. \"That's a patriotic thing to do, helping Americans connect to new markets and helping them sell their products to new markets.\"",
      "\"That should be looked at in a good light,\" said Chester, who is currently on administrative leave.",
      "Chester said the cuts will have a profound impact on the agency's employees. He pointed to his own family.",

He spent the day supporting colleagues who were allotted small time windows, some as brief as 15 minutes, to clear out the desks where many had spent their careers. He said they were devoted to serving their countries.",

      "\"The defendants taken into U.S. custody today include leaders and managers of drug cartels recently designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists,\" the Justice Department said in a statement. It said they are facing charges including racketeering, drug-trafficking, murder, illegal use of firearms, money laundering and other crimes.",
      "The Mexican government said in a\u00a0statement, \"They were wanted for their links to criminal organizations for drug trafficking, among other crimes.\" Mexico said the transfers were carried out \"under institutional protocols with due respect for their fundamental rights.\"",

      "The removal of the drug lords from Mexico coincided with a visit to Washington by Mexico's Foreign Minister Juan Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente and other top economic and military officials. The meeting was the latest in ongoing negotiations with the U.S. over trade and security relations, which have radically shifted since President Trump took office.",
      "\"As President Trump has made clear, cartels are terrorist groups, and this Department of Justice is devoted to destroying cartels and transnational gangs,\"Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement.",
      "DEA Acting Administrator Derek S. Maltz described Caro Quintero as \"a cartel kingpin who unleashed violence, destruction, and death across the United States and Mexico\" and called his transfer \"extremely personal for the men and women of DEA\" due to Caro Quintero's role in the brutal 1985 kidnapping and killing of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique \"Kiki\" Camarena.",
      "The attack marked a low point in U.S.-Mexico relations. Caro Quintero walked free in 2013 after 28 years in prison when a court overturned his 40-year sentence for Camarena's murder. He spent years on the FBI and DEA's most wanted lists.",
      "Caro Quintero, the former leader of the Guadalajara cartel, had since returned to drug trafficking and unleashed bloody turf battles in the northern Mexico border state of Sonora until he was arrested by Mexican forces in 2022.",

      "\"His return to the U.S. would give the family much needed closure and serve the best interests of justice,\" the letter states.",
      "The U.S. had sought the extradition of Caro Quintero shortly after his arrest in 2022. But the request remained stuck at Mexico's foreign ministry for unknown reasons as Sheinbaum's predecessor and political mentor,\u00a0Andr\u00e9s Manuel Lopez Obrador, severely curtailed Mexican cooperation with DEA to protest undercover U.S. law enforcement operations in Mexico targeting senior political and military officials.",
      "\"If he's being sent to the U.S. outside of a formal extradition, and if Mexico didn't place any restrictions, then he can be prosecuted for whatever the U.S. wants,\" according to Bonnie Klapper, a former federal narcotics prosecutor in Brooklyn who is familiar with the case.",
      "The removal of the Trevi\u00f1o Morales brothers also marks the end of a long process that began after the capture in 2013 of Miguel Trevi\u00f1o Morales and, two years later, of his brother, Omar. The process wound on for so many years that then-Mexico's Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero, described the lags as \"truly shameful\".",

      "The Mexican government released mug shots of the 29 men, with parts of their faces hidden behind black bars.",

      "CBS News has not received responses for requests for information about Musk's claims from the Office of Personnel Management or the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.",
      "How the federal government keeps track of its workers",
      "Federal employees must verify their identity and employment authorization by filling out an I-9 before being hired and often have their fingerprints taken. Federal law requires that agencies keep \"complete and accurate records\" of the hours their employees work and establish work schedules.",
      "While there are occasional instances of fraud, the Government Accountability Office found in 2020 that cases are rare. Between fiscal years 2015 to 2019, agency inspectors general substantiated only 100 allegations of employee time and attendance misconduct or fraud out of a federal workforce of around 2.1 million employees (the GAO report did not include postal workers). The report did not mention any instances of dead or fictitious employees getting paid.",
      "The report noted several checks and balances in place to prevent and detect fraud, including the use of timesheets, badge in-out data, video surveillance, network login information and government-issued routers, GAOs report said.",
      "Pattern of false claims about dead people",
      "Previously, Musk and Mr. Trump had falsely claimed that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old were collecting Social Security payments.",
      "But acting Social Security Administration commissioner Lee Dudek said people who are listed as over 100 years old in the Social Security system are \"not necessarily receiving benefits.\" Instead, those individuals \"are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record,\" Dudek said.",
      "Unless you qualify for survivor benefits, collecting Social Security payments for a deceased person is illegal. While there have been documented instances of payments to deceased beneficiaries, they do not occur near the scale the Trump administration suggested.",
      "In total, improper payments at the agency \u2014 including all accidental overpayments and underpayments \u2014 accounted for just under 1% of the $8.6 trillion in total payments from 2015 to 2022, according to a 2024 audit.",
      "Mr. Trump also has a long history of making false claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election by people who cast ballots in the name of dead people \u2014 claims which have been repeatedly debunked.",

    "summary": "Some 880 employees of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were laid off on Thursday, a congressional source told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of staffers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, were laid off Thursday as the Trump administration and its newly-created Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, continue slashing the federal workforce.",
      "A congressional source told CBS News the layoffs affected 880 NOAA employees. An administration official told CBS News about 5% of the agency's staff was let go, and nobody who was deemed critical to NOAA's responsibilities, such as National Weather Service meteorologists, was affected. A source at the National Weather Service disputed this, however, telling CBS News some meteorologists were included in the cuts.",
      "Laid off staffers who were considered probationary employees received an email Thursday, which read in part, \"OPM has advised that '[p]robationary periods are an essential tool for agencies to assess employee performance and manage staffing levels.' (4) In light of that guidance, the Agency finds that you are not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and/or skills do not fit the Agency's current needs.\"",
      "Some 400 employees at the National Weather Service were in a probationary period, a NWS source told CBS News, but it's not clear how many of them were included in the layoffs.",
      "Tom DiLiberto, who until Thursday had worked as a Climate and weather scientist and public affairs specialist, told CBS News he started as a contractor for NOAA back in 2010, but became a federal employee less than two years ago. His probationary period was set to end on March 13, 2025, two weeks from the day he was terminated.",
      "\"You're seeing the whittling away of scientists, and the people who got fired today are some of the best people you can imagine,\" DiLiberto said. \"These people have dedicated their lives to help others. There's no politics in this. When we forecast, or think of the oceans and keep them clean, we're not thinking about the politics. This is an insult on science and all that's good.\"",
      "DiLiberto had been a forecaster for El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a and, as a public affairs specialist in the office of communications, said he wrote for the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation blog for a decade. He published his final blog for the service the same day he was let go. He said he has been given no information on any next steps or if he would be receiving severance.",
      "Congressional Democrats had been worried DOGE and billionaire Elon Musk, who is classified as a \"special government employee,\" had their eyes set on NOAA for deep cuts. Former NOAA officials told CBS News earlier this month that current employees had been told to expect budget cuts of 30% and a 50% reduction in staff.",
      "Prior to Thursday's cuts, NOAA had about 12,000 staffers across the world, including 6,773 who are scientists and engineers, according to the agency's website.",
      "Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington State Democrat who chairs the Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard, which oversees NOAA, said the job cuts \"jeopardize our ability to forecast and respond to extreme weather events like hurricanes, wildfires, and floods\u2014putting communities in harm's way. They also threaten our maritime commerce and endanger 1.7 million jobs that depend on commercial, recreational and tribal fisheries, including thousands in the State of Washington. This action is a direct hit to our economy, because NOAA's specialized workforce provides products and services that support more than a third of the nation's GDP.\"",
      "House Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Jared Huffman, a Democrat who represents California's 2nd Congressional District, called Thursday's cuts a \"betrayal of the American people.\"",
      "\"Musk and his fake officials, the DOGE tech bros, have been rummaging through our most sensitive data without authority in violation of the law for weeks now,\" Huffman said in a statement. \"And this has come with sweeping, indiscriminate layoffs of nonpartisan public servants. Park rangers, firefighters, scientists \u2013 all of these people, whose purpose is to serve everyday Americans, have had the rug pulled out from under them. And we will all be worse off for it.\"",
      "\"Musk's sham mission is bringing vital programs to a screeching halt,\" Huffman continued. \"People nationwide depend on NOAA for free, accurate forecasts, severe weather alerts, and emergency information. Purging the government of scientists, experts, and career civil servants and slashing fundamental programs will cost lives.\"",
      "Congressional aides previously told CBS News that lawmakers had received multiple complaints about DOGE staff coming into NOAA offices earlier this month.",
      "Former NOAA officials, who spoke directly with current staffers, also previously confirmed to CBS News they saw members of the DOGE team at NOAA headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, and the Hoover Building, in Washington, D.C., where NOAA's parent agency, the U.S. Commerce Department is located.",
      "The NOAA runs the National Weather Service, which issues vital weather warnings \u2014 such as hurricane and tornado warnings \u2014 and the National Marine Fisheries Service. It is also responsible for monitoring the health of the oceans and the warming of the climate.",
      "House Science Committee ranking member Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat who represents California's 18th congressional district, said in a statement, \"This will cost American lives.\"",
      "\"Protect lives and property; that is NOAA's mission,\" Lofgren said. \"Firing the employees that allow the agency to carry out that mission will bring about dire consequences. People will die and face great hardship thanks to the recklessness of Co-Presidents Trump and Musk.\"",
      "Dr. Juan Declet-Barreto, senior social scientist for climate vulnerability in the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, also criticized the cuts, saying Thursday in a statement, \"NOAA's data and science are used routinely by weather forecasters, mariners, farmers, emergency responders, businesses and everyday people across the country. Everyone in the United States relies on NOAA in their daily lives whether they realize it or not, something that will come into focus for many in the weeks and months ahead.\"",
      "President Trump has nominated Neil Jacobs to lead the agency. Jacobs, who was acting director of the NOAA for a time during Mr. Trump's first term, was reprimanded for ethics violations after Mr. Trump held up a hurricane forecast map with black marker appearing to extend the storm's potential path into Alabama \u2014 an incident that became known as \"Sharpie-gate.\"",

    "story": [
      "A group of 15 right-wing influencers visited the White House on Thursday and emerged with binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1\" that they obtained from Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has vowed to release information held by the Justice Department about the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "But some of those who received the binder said there was little new information in the files. Bondi later released a statement with links to the documents, and said, \"The first phase of declassified files largely contains documents that have been previously leaked but never released in a formal capacity by the U.S. Government.\"",
      "Liz Wheeler, who was seen leaving the White House, went live on X\u00a0later in the day to describe the binder and flip through its contents. She said that while people are looking for new information related to the Epstein case, \"that's not what's in\" the folder. Most of the pages that Wheeler showed were from Epstein's address book, which has long been public, with addresses redacted.",
      "Jessica Reed Kraus, another influencer, wrote in an Instagram post that Bondi personally delivered the documents to the group in a meeting that President Trump joined. Wheeler wrote that FBI Director Kash Patel and Vice President JD Vance were also in attendance.",
      "A total of 15 influencers were on hand for the meeting, according to Kraus. Others included conspiracy promoter Jack Posobiec, election denier Scott Presler and Rogan O'Handley and Chaya Raichik, the people behind the accounts DC_Draino and LibsofTikTok, respectively.",
      "Posobiec described the contents of the binders as \"contacts\" and \"flight logs.\" He said \"more and more pieces of this\" would be coming.",
      "Bondi said in a Fox News interview on Wednesday that she anticipated releasing information about Epstein's case on Thursday. But the limited nature of the release disappointed many of those who were eagerly awaiting more information about Epstein, including some lawmakers. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican who leads the House Oversight Committee's Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, criticized the release online and said neither she nor the task force had reviewed the documents.",
      "\"GET US THE INFORMATION WE ASKED FOR instead of leaking old info to press,\" Luna wrote, referring to a story about the binder published by the New York Post.",
      "Wheeler said Bondi told the group that the FBI and prosecutors in the Southern District of New York had failed to turn over other documents that Bondi had ordered them to produce.",
      "Epstein, a wealthy financier, was found dead in his New York City jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in 2019. His death was ruled a suicide. Since then, hundreds of pages of documents related to his case have been released through lawsuits and public information requests.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tax-refund-status-2025-irs/",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 17:40:40 -0500",
    "summary": "IRS data shows that the average refund check so far is about $2,200, or $1,000 less than a year earlier. Here's what experts say.",
    "story": [
      "With tax season well underway, early data on the average tax refund shows that Americans are receiving about one-third less than they did a year earlier.",
      "The average refund check in 2025 stood at $2,169 as of Feb. 14, about 32% below the average $3,207 refund issued at the same time last year, the IRS said in its most recent tax update. The agency began accepting tax returns on Jan. 27 and will continue to do so until April 15 except for taxpayers who request an extension.",
      "Those numbers don't necessarily mean that individual taxpayers will get a smaller refund, experts note. Refunds are typically smaller at the start of the tax season because low- and middle-income workers with simpler tax returns are often the first to file, while higher-income Americans or people with more complicated taxes tend to wait until closer to the April 15 deadline to file their returns.",
      "\"Many employees, all they have is a W2 \u2014 they have smaller refunds or smaller amounts to pay because they have withholding through their jobs,\" Keith Hall, CEO of the National Association for the Self-Employed (NASE) and a certified CPA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "At the same time, Hall said some small business owners are reporting receiving financial tax forms, such as dividend or brokerage account statements, later than in past years. That often leads businesses to hold off on filing with the IRS until they've gathered all their tax documents.",
      "So far, fewer Americans have filed their taxes in the season's opening weeks when compared with 2024, the IRS data shows. About 33 million returns had been submitted through through Feb. 14, a 5% decline from the same period a year ago.",
      "The IRS also noted that tax data tends to \"even out as more tax returns come in.\" In its most recent data release, the agency said it expects tax return filings to \"level out in future weeks as the April filing deadline approaches.\"",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "Taxpayers should file as soon as possible because that will enable them to get their refund faster, Hall said. Other tax experts are also urging consumers to file quickly because of concerns that IRS job cuts ordered by the Trump administration could add to challenges in getting tax returns processed this year.",
      "Most refunds are issued in fewer than 21 calendar days if you file your taxes electronically, according to the IRS. Taxes filed on paper require more time because human IRS agents must process those returns, which can add weeks to getting a refund.",
      "Taxpayers can monitor the status of their 2025 refund using the IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund?\u00a0tool, with e-filers able to check on their return 24 hours after filing. People who file on paper won't be able to see their refund status for four weeks after they mail their return to the IRS, the agency says.",
      "About half of Americans intend to file their taxes by the end of February, with the other half planning to finish their returns in March and April, according to the National Retail Federation's annual tax return survey. About half of taxpayers say they expect a refund this year, it found.",

      "It's not only the surging cost of eggs that is making breakfast pricier these days \u2014 the price of coffee is also spiking because of a confluence of factors.",
      "The cost of wholesale arabica beans \u2014 the most popular on the planet \u2014 surpassed $4 a pound for the first time this month and have doubled over the past year, running up from less than two bucks a pound in January 2024 to a record $4.30 a pound on February 13, 2025, according\u00a0to\u00a0futures contracts traded in New York.",
      "For consumers still grappling with high food costs, that means soaring prices in the grocery aisle. The retail price of ground coffee hit an all-time high of $7 a pound in January, up 75% from $4 in January 2020, government data\u00a0shows.",
      "Coffee drinkers are likely to see even steeper prices over the next three or four months, with Andrea Illy, chairman of Italian roaster and global retailer Illycaff\u00e8, recently\u00a0predicting\u00a0that bean prices could climb 25% this year.",
      "Unlike some products, coffee is viewed as essential by many consumers, making them more willing to pay up for their java fixes. Without a direct substitute for coffee, retailers and suppliers generally have greater room to raise their prices.",
      "\"Coffee, as we all know, it's a pass-through category,\" J.M. Smucker CEO Mark Smucker said in an earnings\u00a0call in November. \"We've been very pleased with our performance in the quarter, despite the fact that we continue to see significant inflation,\" said the executive, whose company's brands include Folgers and Cafe Bustelo.",
      "Cost of climate change",
      "As with the cost of other global commodities, supply and demand are a large part of the equation. Getting caffeinated is likely to become an ever-costlier proposition because of rising temperatures, droughts and excessive rains striking Brazil and Vietnam, the world's two biggest producers.",
      "The 2024 coffee growing season saw a drought followed by August frost in Brazil, and flooding in October came in the wake of a drought in Vietnam. Brazil's coffee exports during the month were down 7.4% year-over-year and Vietnam's December export fell nearly 40%, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from the International Coffee Organization.",
      "\"When the crop in Brazil does not produce as much coffee as expected in the year, that causes the prices to shoot up,\" Gregory Zomfotis, founder and CEO of Gregory's Coffee, told CBS News.",
      "\"Some of the major producers have really not seen the production levels that were expected and quite far from it, so that's caused a severe spike in the price of coffee,\" added Zomfotis, whose company operates more than 50 stores nationwide and expect to purchase up to 700,000 pounds of coffee this year.",
      "Amid those supply constraints, global demand for coffee in growing. For example, consumption is up 150% over 10 years in China \u2014 the world's most populous country, according\u00a0to\u00a0the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Other factors also are contributing to the pricing pressures, including politics. President Trump on Tuesday vowed to proceed next week with his previous threats of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. A levy on Mexico, whose largest coffee export market is the U.S., would likely push prices up further.",
      "Separately, a new European Union law that is now set to take effect in December prohibits the sale of products, including coffee, if companies can't show they are not linked to deforestation\u00a0 \u2014 a bid to lessen greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss. That effort to address the climate crisis could further tighten supplies of coffee beans.",
      "Geopolitical conflicts are also a factor in rising coffee costs. Fighting between Israel and Hamas has caused havoc in the Red Sea, which carries 30% of the world's container traffic, including coffee from Vietnam. Slowdowns in the Red Sea and the Suez Canal meant as many as 5 billion bags of coffee had not yet arrived in Europe, the International Coffee Organization reported in December.",

    "story": [
      "This season's influenza vaccines may have been less effective against emergency room visits for some kids compared to last year, a new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests, though effectiveness was still high against hospitalization.",
      "So far this season, the vaccine's protection against flu hospitalization was at least 63% for children and at least 41% for adults. These estimates of effectiveness against hospitalization, released Thursday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, are considered high for flu vaccines.",
      "But another metric of the shot's effectiveness, looking at protection against infections that result in outpatient visits to places like urgent care clinics or emergency rooms, was worse. Effectiveness was 32% for children and adolescents, from the CDC's U.S. Flu VE network of health care systems. That's down from 67% in last year's estimates.",
      "Those figures are lower than from another network of outpatient providers in the report. The study's authors suspect the decline is because of a difference in how many kids were infected in each by a strain of the flu virus called H3N2.",
      "\"The U.S. Flu VE network did not find statistically significant VE against influenza A(H3N2) in the outpatient setting among child and adolescent patients or among adult patients,\" the study's authors wrote.",
      "Earlier data reported by the CDC suggested that this season's flu vaccines might be poorly matched against many H3N2 strains this season. Around half of infections this past fall and winter were H3N2.",
      "Scientists say that the protection offered by flu shots varies widely based on several drivers, not just how well-matched the shots are to what strains are circulating. A major factor is what kind of immunity people have from previous infections and vaccinations.",
      "Estimates for effectiveness in adults from the same network was 36%. That is similar to the 33% at this time last year.",
      "The new data comes as the U.S. is now seeing signs of a slowdown in influenza, after a record wave that reached some of the worst levels since the 2009 swine flu pandemic.",

      "Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that takes hundreds of lives each year, and makes even more people sick \u2014 but there are steps you can take to help keep yourself and your family safe.",
      "More than 400 Americans die annually from unintentional carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, more than 100,000 visit the emergency room and more than 14,000 are hospitalized, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Poisoning occurs when breathing in CO fumes prevents the body from getting enough oxygen, which can harm the brain, heart and other organs, according to Johns Hopkins.",
      "Here's what to know to protect yourself.",
      "What causes carbon monoxide?",
      "Carbon monoxide is produced any time a fossil fuel is burned, meaning accidental poisoning can occur when home appliances and systems like furnaces, kerosene heaters, stoves, lanterns and generators produce fumes that people breathe in.",
      "Most CO exposures happen in the winter in cold climates because of unvented space heaters in the home, a common source of CO poisoning. Cases sometimes occur after hurricanes or other storms when people are relying on generators for emergency power that may not be vented properly.",
      "Where to put carbon monoxide detector?",
      "While CO poisoning can be fatal, it is also preventable with the use of CO detector devices. Detector can range between $20 for basic models to $100 for digital, low-level detectors.",
      "The\u00a0U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommends each floor of the home have a separate CO detector.",
      "\"If you are getting a single detector, place it near the sleeping areas and make certain the alarm is loud enough to wake you up,\" the EPA notes.",
      "In addition to detectors, the CDC, Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins and other public safety advocates have a number of other recommendations, including:",
      "Car safety:\u00a0Don't run a car in an enclosed area like a garage. Even if the garage door is open, don't start a vehicle if the garage is attached to a home.",
      "Furnace and fireplaces:\u00a0Keep fireplaces clean and in good condition, make sure no debris is blocking the vents or chimney.",
      "Fuel-burning space heaters: Make sure heating systems, water heaters, and any other gas, oil, or coal burning appliances are cleaned and serviced every year, and make sure they're in well-ventilated areas. Johns Hopkins suggests opting for electrical space heaters, which pose no danger of carbon monoxide poisoning.",
      "Gas stoves and ovens: Never use these for heating a room.",
      "Portable generators: Never use generators inside a home or garage, even if doors and windows are open. Instead, place them outside more than 20 feet away from any windows, doors or vents.",

      "Anyone can be at risk for CO poisoning, but infants, the elderly and people with chronic heart disease, anemia or breathing problems are more likely to get sick, according to multiple health organizations.",
      "If you are experiencing these symptoms, get to fresh air and seek emergency care immediately, the organizations advise.",
      "Travel carbon monoxide detector",
      "It's also important to be aware of carbon monoxide while traveling, since some accommodations, from hotel rooms to home rentals, especially abroad, may not have appropriate safety measures in place.",
      "In 2022, multiple Americans in two separate incidents died from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning while traveling, bringing a spotlight to the issue. Three tourists were\u00a0staying at an apartment\u00a0in Mexico City,\u00a0reportedly\u00a0booked through Airbnb, while another group was at a Sandals Resort in the Bahamas.",
      "A spokesperson for Sandals Resorts confirmed to CBS MoneyWatch at the time that Sandals has carbon monoxide detectors in all rooms across its facilities. Airbnb started offering hosts free carbon monoxide detectors for units that don't already have the devices installed. Airbnb said it encourages its hosts to install detectors but does not require them. Guests can check if a rental has detectors by checking the \"safety devices\" section of the listing.",
      "Hyperbaric medicine specialist Dr. Andrew Moffat previously told CBS MoneyWatch he always travels with a portable detector.",
      "\"I bring my own carbon monoxide monitor with me everywhere I stay,\" he said. Moffatt cautioned that survivors of CO poisoning can suffer debilitating long-term effects like chronic anxiety and cognitive issues, and that many detectors don't go off until CO levels are so elevated that they damage the brain.",

      "He had been with the DEA for 11 years after serving in the U.S. Marine Corps, and as a fireman police, officer, and an Imperial County deputy sheriff in Calexico, California, where he grew up, according to the DEA.

      "He married his high-school sweetheart, and together with their young family, they moved to Mexico in 1981.",
      "At the time, Guadalajara  cartel leader Quintero was one of the primary suppliers of heroin, cocaine, and marijuana to the U.S. in the late 1970s. He blamed Camarena for a 1984 raid by Mexican authorities on a marijuana plantation, Rancho Bufalo, that upset his business.",
      "The DEA said at the time it was the largest drug seizure ever.",
      "In retaliation, it is believed Camarena was kidnapped in Guadalajara, allegedly on orders from Caro Quintero.",

      "\"Within about five or six hours, there's a dozen to two dozen agents that arrived,\" Enrique told CBS News in that 2017 interview. But he believed his father would return home.",
      "\"Well your dad's Superman,\" Enrique said. \"So, you think, we'll see him. He'll be fine.\"",
      "Enrique and his brothers were then rushed out of Mexico to the U.S. He remembers an agent picking him up and carrying him from his living room to a waiting car. He would never see his father again.",

In 1988, Congress formally established Red Ribbon Week, which encourages parents, educators and businesses to promote a drug-free lifestyle. The Enrique S.

    "story": [
      "During a news conference with President Trump, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday that his country is ready to put \"boots on the ground\" to support a peace deal in Ukraine as Starmer said they had a \"very good and productive visit.\"",
      "Achieving lasting peace in Ukraine and ending Russia's full-scale invasion was top of the agenda for Starmer and Mr. Trump in Starmer's first visit to the White House since Mr. Trump took office, as Mr. Trump said Thursday that he trusts Russian President Vladimir Putin to keep his word on any peace agreement they reach.",
      "\"We discussed a plan today to reach a peace that is tough and fair, that Ukraine will help shape, that's backed by strength, to stop Putin coming back for more,\" Starmer said. \"I'm working closely with other European leaders on this, and I'm clear that the U.K. is ready to put boots on the ground and planes in the air to support a deal, working together with our allies, because that is the only way that peace will last.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called Starmer a \"very tough negotiator.\" Starmer, for his part, called his visit a \"very good and very productive\" one, noting Mr. Trump's family roots in Scotland.",
      "The conciliatory words were in contrast to larger disagreements they have had, especially on the war in Ukraine. Mr. Trump has broken with many European allies and has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator\" but has declined to give the same label to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Starmer said the two are working to end the \"barbaric\" war in Ukraine, acknowledging what Mr. Trump and his top administration officials have largely ignored \u2014 that Russia is the aggressor.",
      "\"It can't be peace that awards the aggressor,\" Starmer said, adding, \"we agree history must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader.\"",
      "But in what is likely a concession to Mr. Trump, Starmer said the U.K. will be giving more aid to Ukraine this year than it has in any other year in the past, and will be increasing its defense spending as a part of its gross domestic product, also known as GDP.",
      "Mr. Trump said he thinks progress is being made on ending the Russia-Ukraine war, and that an agreement will \"either be fairly soon or it won't be at all.\"",
      "Starmer said the U.S. and U.K. will be working together on a lasting peace agreement in Ukraine.",
      "The U.K. prime minister also said the two administrations will work on reaching an economic deal between the two countries. Mr. Trump said Starmer tried very hard to persuade him not to impose tariffs on imports from the U.K.",
      "\"He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" Mr. Trump said of Starmer.",
      "Mr. Trump said there is a \"great chance\" they could reach a trade deal \"where tariffs wouldn't be necessary.\"",
      "Trump accepts invitation to visit U.K. in the \"near future\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Thursday he'll visit the United Kingdom in the \"near future\" and accepted an invitation for a state visit from King Charles.",
      "\"It's a great honor to have Prime Minister Starmer in the Oval Office,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's a very special place and he's a special man. And the United Kingdom is a \u2014 is a wonderful, this is a wonderful country that I know very well. I'm there a lot. And I'll be going, I'll be going there and we expect to see each other in the near future. We'll be announcing it.\" Both leaders emphasized the \"special relationship\" between the two countries, forged during World War II.",
      "Mr. Trump said he and Starmer would discuss Russia and Ukraine, as the president seeks an end to the war started when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. In a break with many European allies \u2014 including Britain \u2014 Mr. Trump has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator\" but has declined to give the same label to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\"Did I say that?\" Mr. Trump said, asked to repeat his characterization of Zelenskyy. \"I can't believe I said that. Next question.\"",
      "Starmer thanked Mr. Trump for changing the conversation on Ukraine, according to reporters in the room, and said he believes an \"historic deal\" can be achieved.",
      "Mr. Trump, however, disagreed with a previous assessment by Starmer that there is a risk Putin could invade Ukraine again after a deal is reached, saying he trusts Putin to keep his word.",
      "\"No. I don't think so,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think when we have a deal, it's going to be the deal.\"",
      "\"I think he'll keep his word,\" Mr. Trump said, calling it a \"trust and verify\" situation.",
      "\"We had to go through the Russian hoax together, that was not a good thing,\" Mr. Trump said, adding he's known Putin for a long time.",
      "Mr. Trump said they'll see if there are parts of Ukraine taken by Russia that could be given back to Ukraine, although he didn't specify where.",
      "\"There are a lot of areas that were taken,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Yeah, we've talked about it. A lot of the sea line has been taken. And we'll be talking about that. And we're going to see if we can get it back, or get a lot of it back for Ukraine, if that's possible.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the two will also be discussing trade, as he imposes new tariffs on allies and adversaries alike.",
      "Starmer said ahead of the meeting that the U.S. and Britain \"want to strike a new partnership. We share the view that our best days lie ahead.\"",
      "\"Taking out a chainsaw isn't quite my style, but we are stripping away red tape and bureaucracy,\" he said, at once taking a gentle jab at Musk while also attempting to appeal to Mr. Trump's passion for a slimmed down government. \"We are reforming, permitting, getting things built, reducing barriers to investment and growth, and we're open for business, open for investment, and we're determined to help U.S. innovators thrive in the United Kingdom.\"",
      "Starmer presented the president with a letter from King Charles, and Mr. Trump read it in real time. Mr. Trump called the British king a \"beautiful man and a wonderful man.\"",
      "Britain, the U.S., and collective security via NATO",
      "Starmer didn't arrive in Washington empty-handed. He flew in on the wings of an announcement just days earlier that his government was planning to bump U.K. defense spending from the current 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027, which his office has billed as Britain's biggest sustained defense spending increase since the Cold War. Starmer has left open the possibility of that defense spending rising further, to 3%, after the next U.K. general election.",
      "The timing of the prime minister's announcement was notable, coming just two days before his meeting with Mr. Trump. A White House official said ahead of the meeting that the Trump administration was \"very pleased\" with Starmer's announcement, but that it still wants to see America's NATO allies increase defense spending further, towards 5% of their respective national GDPs. That would be more, proportionally, than even the U.S. spends on defense, which in 2023 amounted to roughly 3.4% of the United States' GDP.",
      "Mr. Trump has implied that the U.S. could break from the historic collective defense agreement of NATO, known as Article 5, which essentially says that if any member is attacked it will be treated as an attack on all, if other member countries do not boost their defense spending.",
      "\"I think that that means there's got to be security guarantees,\" said Starmer, acknowledging the pressure for higher spending, but also indicating that he will ask the White House to provide clear commitments to help defend Ukraine against any future Russian attack if a ceasefire is reached to halt the ongoing war. \"I've indicated that we will play our full part. There has to be U.S. backing, because otherwise I don't think it will deter Putin. We are working on that. I'm having extensive discussions about it.\"",
      "A White House official said the U.S. appreciated Starmer's willingness to consider sending British troops to help with peacekeeping efforts to enforce a potential peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, but Mr. Trump has made it clear that any and all security guarantees for Ukraine may have to come from Europe.",
      "\"I'm not going to make security guarantees beyond, very much,\" Mr. Trump said this week. \"We're going to have Europe do that, because we're talking about, Europe is their nextdoor neighbor, but we're going to make sure everything goes well.\"",
      "U.S.-British trade",
      "Mr. Trump's tariff threats were also the agenda during Thursday's White House meeting. A 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imported into the U.S. is set to kick in on March 12, ordered by Mr. Trump, he said, to protect American companies. Starmer may seek an exemption.",
      "Mr. Trump implied weeks ago that a unilateral trade agreement could be worked with the U.K. If that does not happen, there's concern that some of the estimated 40,000 British jobs directly linked to steel and aluminum production could be lost and entire plants could close.",
      "After Starmer's meeting with Mr. Trump, he's scheduled to meet back in London with several European leaders on Sunday, including the heads of state from Germany, Italy and Poland. Starmer will no doubt brief them on his talks with the U.S. president.",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy may join them, after he meets with Mr. Trump in Washington on Friday, where he's expected to sign a financial deal to share his country's mineral wealth with Washington, which Mr. Trump has called \"payback\" for U.S. aid to Ukraine over the past three years.",

It said they are facing charges including racketeering, drug-trafficking, murder, illegal use of firearms, money laundering and other crimes.",
      "The Mexican government said in a\u00a0statement, \"They were wanted for their links to criminal organizations for drug trafficking, among other crimes.\" Mexico said the transfers were carried out \"under institutional protocols with due respect for their fundamental rights.\"",
      "Also on the list were two leaders of the Los Zetas cartel, Mexicans Miguel Trevi\u00f1o Morales and his brother Omar Trevi\u00f1o Morales, known as Z-40 and Z-42.",
      "The removal of the drug lords from Mexico coincided with a visit to Washington by Mexico's Foreign Minister Juan Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente and other top economic and military officials. The meeting was the latest in ongoing negotiations with the U.S. over trade and security relations, which have radically shifted since President Trump took office.",
      "\"As President Trump has made clear, cartels are terrorist groups, and this Department of Justice is devoted to destroying cartels and transnational gangs,\"Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement.",
      "DEA Acting Administrator Derek S. Maltz described Caro Quintero as \"a cartel kingpin who unleashed violence, destruction, and death across the United States and Mexico\" and called his transfer \"extremely personal for the men and women of DEA\" due to Caro Quintero's role in the brutal 1985 kidnapping and killing of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique \"Kiki\" Camarena.",
      "The attack marked a low point in U.S.-Mexico relations. Caro Quintero walked free in 2013 after 28 years in prison when a court overturned his 40-year sentence for Camarena's murder. He spent years on the FBI and DEA's most wanted lists.",
      "Caro Quintero, the former leader of the Guadalajara cartel, had since returned to drug trafficking and unleashed bloody turf battles in the northern Mexico border state of Sonora until he was arrested by Mexican forces in 2022.",
      "In January, a nonprofit group representing the Camarena family sent a letter to the White House urging the Trump administration to renew longstanding U.S. requests for Mexico to extradite Caro Quintero, according to a copy of the letter provided to The Associated Press by a person familiar with the family's outreach.",
      "\"His return to the U.S. would give the family much needed closure and serve the best interests of justice,\" the letter states.",
      "The U.S. had sought the extradition of Caro Quintero shortly after his arrest in 2022. But the request remained stuck at Mexico's foreign ministry for unknown reasons as Sheinbaum's predecessor and political mentor,\u00a0Andr\u00e9s Manuel Lopez Obrador, severely curtailed Mexican cooperation with DEA to protest undercover U.S. law enforcement operations in Mexico targeting senior political and military officials.",
      "\"If he's being sent to the U.S. outside of a formal extradition, and if Mexico didn't place any restrictions, then he can be prosecuted for whatever the U.S. wants,\" according to Bonnie Klapper, a former federal narcotics prosecutor in Brooklyn who is familiar with the case.",
      "The removal of the Trevi\u00f1o Morales brothers also marks the end of a long process that began after the capture in 2013 of Miguel Trevi\u00f1o Morales and, two years later, of his brother, Omar. The process wound on for so many years that then-Mexico's Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero, described the lags as \"truly shameful\".",
      "The Trevi\u00f1o Morales family, who American authorities have accused of running the violent northeastern Cartel from prison, have charges pending in the US for participation in a criminal organization, drug trafficking, firearms offenses and money laundering.",
      "The 29 prisoners, who had been held in various prisons across Mexico, were being transferred to several cities across the U.S. on Thursday, including Chicago; Houston; McKinney, Texas; New York City; Phoenix; San Antonio; Washington, D.C. and White Plains, New York, officials said.",
      "The Mexican government released mug shots of the 29 men, with parts of their faces hidden behind black bars.",
      "The transfer comes as top Mexican officials are in Washington, D.C., trying to head off the Trump administration's threat of\u00a0imposing 25% tariffs on all Mexican imports\u00a0next week.",
      "Mr. Trump said Thursday that he intends to move forward with the sanctions, writing on\u00a0Truth Social\u00a0that \"drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels.\"",
      "In exchange for delaying tariffs, Trump had insisted that Mexico crack down on the U.S.-Mexico\u00a0border, cartels and fentanyl production, despite significant dips in migration and overdoses over the past year. The removals may indicate that negotiations are moving along as the tariff deadline approaches.",

    "summary": "The increase in the range of people who can be targeted by the U.S. military dismantles Biden-era mandates that included more safeguards.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has rolled back constraints on American commanders to authorize airstrikes and special operation raids outside conventional battlefields, broadening the range of people who can be targeted, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the policy shift.",
      "The quiet but seismic recalibration dismantles Biden-era mandates and signals a return to more aggressive counterterrorism policies Trump first instituted in his first term.",
      "During his first overseas trip earlier this month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in a meeting with senior U.S. military leaders from U.S. Africa Command in Germany, signed a directive easing policy constraints and executive oversight on airstrikes and the deployment of American commandos.",
      "The move prioritizes flexibility by giving commanders greater latitude to decide whom to target while relaxing the multi-layered centralized control former President Joe Biden implemented over airstrikes and raids by American special operation forces, U.S. officials told CBS News on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about national security matters.",
      "One senior Defense Department official told CBS News that Biden's warfare policies were carbon copies of those established during former President Barack Obama's second term. During Biden's tenure, airstrikes typically focused on the senior leadership of terrorist organizations.",
      "The official added that Mr. Trump's approach carries both risks and rewards because the streamlined process can potentially degrade foreign terrorist organizations capabilities faster, given the lower threshold required to strike and widened target selection, but it inherently raises the risk of flawed decisions and unintended civilian casualties.",
      "The Islamist armed group Al-Shabaab in Somalia and the Houthis in Yemen were discussed as potential targets, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the meeting. It's not clear if the other U.S. combatant commands around the world were also given the same directive.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Pentagon and U.S. Africa Command on Tuesday, but has not received a reply.",
      "American military airstrikes fall into two broad categories \u2014 deliberate and defensive, according to U.S. Africa Command's website. Deliberate strikes adhere to a multi-layered process of regulations and high-level vetting, which under the Biden administration ran through the Joint Staff and the executive branch.",
      "Throughout the deliberate strike process, military lawyers review the compiled intelligence to determine if individuals are legal combatants under the law of armed conflict, to reduce the risk of civilian casualties and avoid targeted killings of innocent people mistaken for terrorist suspects.",
      "Defensive airstrikes are used \"in limited circumstances where U.S. or specifically designated partner forces are in imminent danger from hostile forces,\" according to U.S. Africa Commands website. These types of airstrikes are typically authorized by the combatant command, and the executive branch does not need to approve these strikes.",
      "A leaked classified study from 2013, obtained by The Intercept, details how the U.S. government authorized drone strikes in Yemen and Somalia between 2011 and 2012 following presidential approval during the Obama administration \u2014 policies similarly implemented under Biden.",
      "Before launching a strike, military commanders had to ensure it met a number of strict criteria and obtain approvals from seven decision makers \u2014 including the president.\u00a0 The individual targeted had to be confirmed as a member of an approved terrorist organization using two independent forms of intelligence. Civilian casualties had to be projected as minimal. And there could be no \"contradictory intelligence\" muddying the waters.",
      "The process became a high-stakes roundtable. The task force that assembled the target package, the combatant commander, the CIA chief of mission, and the host nation all had to sign off on the airstrike. A single dissent along the way meant the operation would be halted.",
      "It's not clear if these same provisions are included in the new directive. However, they did exist during Mr. Trump's first term, with some exceptions on approval by the host nation in countries such as Afghanistan.",
      "The directive to U.S. Africa Command comes at a tumultuous time inside the Pentagon, following the firings by the Trump administration of the top judge advocate generals for the Air Force, Army and Navy. Traditionally seen as apolitical positions, these top uniformed Pentagon officials encompass a broad range of responsibilities, from overseeing criminal cases involving the rank-and-file to ensuring the top brass adhere to international laws of armed conflict.",
      "Speaking to reporters on Monday, Hegseth defended the removals, stating that they were necessary to ensure there were no \"roadblocks to orders given by a commander-in-chief.\"",
      "He added, \"Ultimately, I want the best possible lawyers in each service to provide the best possible recommendations, no matter what, to lawful orders and are given, and we didn't think those particular positions were well suited, and so we're looking for the best.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 16:36:47 -0500",
    "summary": "The findings could pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to launch a widely demanded broader inquiry to examine the political decision-making that preceded the Oct. 7 terrorist attack.",
    "story": [
      "An investigation by the Israeli military has determined that Hamas was able to carry out the deadliest terrorist attack in Israeli history on Oct. 7, 2023, because the much more powerful Israeli army misjudged the militant group's intentions and underestimated its capabilities.",
      "\"A large-scale, surprise attack was not considered to be a likely scenario, due to a fundamental misunderstanding of the enemy,\" the military said in a summary of the findings, which were released Thursday. \"The IDF and intelligence agencies perceived Hamas as a limited and reactive threat and assumed that an early warning would precede any large-scale offensive.\"",
      "The findings could pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to launch a widely demanded broader inquiry to examine the political decision-making that preceded the terrorist attack, which triggered the war in Gaza.",
      "The prime minister has not taken responsibility for Israel's strategy in the years leading up to the attack, saying he will answer tough questions only after the war, which has been paused for nearly six weeks by a tenuous ceasefire. Despite public pressure, including from the families of the roughly 1,200 people killed in the Oct. 7 attack and the 251 taken as hostages into Gaza, Netanyahu has resisted calls for a commission of inquiry.",
      "The military's main findings were that the region's most powerful and sophisticated military misread Hamas' intentions, underestimated its capabilities and was wholly unprepared for the surprise attack by thousands of heavily armed militants in the early morning hours of a major Jewish holiday.",
      "In comments made to military commanders Monday, and shared with the media on Thursday, the army's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said he took responsibility for the army's failures.",
      "\"I was the commander of the military on October 7th, and I have my own responsibility. I also carry the weight of all your responsibility \u2014 that, too, I see as mine,\" said Halevi, who announced his resignation in January and is set to step down next week.",
      "The military's findings are in line with past conclusions reached by officials and analysts. The military released only a summary of the report and military officials outlined its findings.",
      "\"Oct. 7 was a complete failure,\" one military official told The Associated Press who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.",
      "A central misconception was that Hamas, which seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority in 2007, was more interested in governing the territory than fighting Israel, the inquiry found.",
      "The military also misjudged the capabilities of Hamas, long designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and Israeli governments. Military planners had envisioned that, at worst, Hamas could stage a ground invasion from up to eight border points, the military official told the AP. In fact, Hamas had more than 60 attack routes.",
      "Intelligence assessed in the aftermath of the attack has shown Hamas came close to staging the offensive on three earlier occasions but delayed it for unknown reasons, the official told the AP.",
      "The official also said that in the hours before the attack, there were signs that something was amiss, including when Hamas fighters switched their phones over to the Israeli network.",
      "The perception that Hamas did not want war guided decision-makers away from taking action that might have thwarted the attack.",
      "\"The belief was that Hamas could be influenced through pressures that would reduce its motivation for war, primarily by improving living conditions in the Gaza Strip,\" the summary of the report said. \"Israel's policy towards Gaza was based on defense, stabilization and efforts to prevent Hamas' military buildup, readiness for short periods (i.e. days) of direct conflict, and preparation for a scenario of escalation.\"",
      "The Israeli military official told the AP that intelligence shows that Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack who was killed last October, had started planning it as early as 2017.",
      "With the military off guard on a holiday weekend, Hamas launched a heavy wave of rockets that allowed thousands of fighters to burst through the security fence or fly over it on hang gliders. They knocked out surveillance cameras and quickly overwhelmed hundreds of soldiers stationed along the border.",
      "From there they advanced to key highway intersections and attacked troops dispatched to the area, including some senior officers, disrupting the military's command and control, according to a second military official, who also spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.",
      "For the first three hours after the attack, Hamas fighters marauded through border communities and a music festival with little resistance. That was when most of the 251 hostages were taken and most people were killed, the official told the AP. The official said the chaos led to friendly fire incidents, although he said there were not many, without disclosing a figure.",
      "It took hours for the military to regain control and days until the area was fully cleared of militants.",
      "According to the first official, the report blamed the military for being overconfident in its knowledge and not showing enough doubt in its core concepts and beliefs. The summary said a key lesson was that Israel could not let a threat develop on its border.",
      "It spelled out several recommendations, including creating special units meant to prepare for such surprise and large-scale events, as well as reform in the military intelligence department that would foster \"openness, skepticism, listening, learning.\"",
      "It did not place blame on any individual soldiers or officers, but is likely to pave the way for a reckoning in the military and eventual dismissals.",
      "Some high-ranking officers other than Halevi have also resigned, including the former head of military intelligence.",

      "The World Health Organization said Thursday that its \"investigation deepens\" into a mystery illness suspected of killing more than 60 people in the northern Democratic Republic of Congo over the past five weeks, warning it was continuing to spread.",
      "The WHO said in a statement Thursday that, along with Congo health officials, it was \"carrying out further investigations to determine the cause of another cluster of illness and community deaths\" in the Equateur province, marking the third time this year disease surveillance teams have identified an increase in illness and deaths in the region.",
      "\"The most recent cluster occurred in the Basankusu health zone, where last week 141 additional people fell ill, with no deaths reported,\" the United Nations' global health agency said. \"In the same health zone, 158 cases and 58 deaths were reported in the same health zone earlier in February.

      "The WHO's Africa office said earlier this week that the first outbreak was among several children who ate a bat and then died within 48 hours after experiencing hemorrhagic fever symptoms, similar to those caused by the Ebola or Marburg viruses.",
      "The deaths occurred in one village, Boloko, and affected people of all ages, however, teenagers and young adults seemed the most susceptible.",
      "Concern over front-line impact of Trump's aid cuts",
      "When a number of unexplained cases of illness crop up, a team of health officials and international \"virus hunters\" immediately go in to investigate the outbreak, determine who was the first case \u2014 \"patient zero\" \u2014 and work to identify, contain and treat the illness.",
      "But those teams have been gutted by the Trump administration's recent U.S. foreign aid cuts, a health official who works in the region told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "During the first Cabinet meeting of Mr. Trump's second administration on Wednesday, non-Cabinet member Elon Musk said officials with his efficiency-oriented DOGE department had mistakenly cancelled Ebola programs as they targeted USAID.",
      "\"We all make mistakes, but when we make mistakes, we fix it quickly, and in the case of the USAID, we accidentally canceled, very briefly, Ebola, Ebola prevention. I think we all want Ebola prevention, so we restored it and there was no interruption,\" Musk said.",
      "One U.S. health official who spoke with CBS News disputed that aid had been restored, however. They said locally trained health workers in some of the infectious disease hot zones in Africa have not been paid, and some have been dismissed entirely due to the USAID cuts.",
      "The U.S. has long been the largest international donor to Congo's health sector, and the funding has helped train epidemiologists to do the fieldwork that identifies and controls disease outbreaks. It's unclear how President Trump's funding cuts will affect the teams on the ground, but there's widespread concern among health officials, with one virus hunter telling CBS News the region is facing \"a perfect storm\" for the potential spread of infectious diseases, including possible new ones.",
      "Race to identify the mystery disease",
      "In northern Congo, health officials have been searching for anyone with general sickness or an illness that fits a \"broad case definition\" that includes fever, chills, headache, nose bleeding, coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, stiff neck and muscle or joint pain",
      "By February 19, the WHO said 943 people with such symptoms had been identified, including 52 who had died.",
      "Test results released on February 13 showed the first cases were not Ebola or Marburg, but half of the samples did test positive for malaria. Earlier samples of suspected cases, health officials say, were \"not viable,\" so retesting delayed the diagnostic process. WHO officials are conducting further tests, also looking at the possibility of meningitis and testing food, water and other environmental samples from the affected region.",
      "Officials say they're searching for unusual patterns in cases of the mystery illness by increasing both disease surveillance and treatment for other diseases such as malaria, meningitis and typhoid fever.",
      "A regional health team arrived in the Basankkusu health zone, which is about 110 miles from the Bolamba zone, on February 16, and it was joined six days later by a national rapid response team from the Ministry of Health and two WHO epidemiologists. They have been collecting samples of blood and urine and taking oral and nasal swabs for testing in an effort to identify the illness.",
      "\"These illnesses know no boundaries.\"",
      "The remoteness of the affected areas and Congo's limited national health system and poor roads and phone infrastructure have all contributed to the challenges of diagnosing and containing the illness.",
      "About 1,000 miles away, in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the M23 rebel group \u2014   which is backed by Rwanda, according to the United Nations \u2014   has captured large swaths of territory in the mineral rich region, pushing refugees into camps and adding to the burden of an already struggling health sector.",
      "Sarah Olsen, the director of Health Research at the Wildlife Conservation Society, told CBS News on Thursday that outbreaks of Ebola, Marburg and other diseases, like the still-unidentified one killing people in northern Congo, had become the new normal, adding a call for the global community to be ready to respond.",

    "story": [
      "Weeks after a mass rape trial involving a man who drugged his wife and brought strangers home to assault her, France is again reeling as a new alleged predator appears in court.",
      "A trial is underway in Vannes, France, of 74-year-old Joel Le Scouarnec, a former surgeon accused of raping or sexually assaulting 299 people, almost all of them children who were his patients. It is the biggest trial related to alleged child sex abuse in France \u2013 and one of the biggest in the world.",
      "His ex-wife, Marie-France Le Scouarnec, took the stand on Wednesday \u2013 and denied she had any knowledge of her husband's activities. \"There was nothing that could have made me think that. Nothing,\" she told the court.",
      "\"I never had an inkling. It's so huge, so unthinkable, inconceivable that my husband could have done all that,\" she said.",
      "The alleged assaults took place over 25 years, between 1989 and 2014, according to the prosecution. The average age of the children \u2014 both girls and boys \u2014 was 11.",
      "The prosecution claims many of the victims were still under anesthesia or just coming out of it when they were assaulted. Others were barely awake in their hospital beds as the surgeon allegedly assaulted them as he made his early morning rounds.",
      "On the first day of the trial, which started on Monday, Le Scouarnec told the court he had \"committed heinous acts.\" His lawyer said he admitted to carrying out \"the vast majority\" of the assaults of which he is accused.",
      "\"I owe it to all these people and their loved ones to take responsibility for my actions and the consequences they may have had,\" Le Scouarnec told the court.",
      "The alleged abuse of Le Scouarnec's former patients only came to light in 2017, after his neighbors' 6-year-old daughter told her parents he had exposed himself and touched her through the fence that divided their gardens.",
      "During a search of his home, police said they discovered hard drives containing more than 300,000 photos and videos depicting child sex abuse. They also found notebooks with meticulous records of the alleged abuse of child patients.",
      "That investigation led to his conviction in December 2020 for the sexual abuse of four little girls: the young neighbor, a 4-year-old patient and two of his nieces. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison.",
      "On Thursday, the former surgeon's sister, the mother of the two nieces, took the stand \u2014 and accused his ex-wife of \"cruelty\" and \"lies.\" The woman, Annie, whose last name was not made public at the trial, said Marie-France Le Scouarnec knew that her husband abused his nieces, which Marie-France Le Scouarnec had denied in court.",
      "Annie said the youngest of her two daughters confided in her in October 2000 that Le Scouarnec had sexually abused her. She told the court that her brother admitted the assault to her, and said that his wife was aware of what had happened.",
      "In 2005, Le Scouarnec was convicted of possession of child sexual abuse images, after an FBI investigation into an international network. He was given a four-year suspended sentence. The court did not order any psychological followup or restriction on his work.",
      "Le Scouarnec told investigators that even though he told his employers at a hospital in Quimperl\u00e9 about the conviction, no particular measures were taken.",
      "During his career, Le Scouarnec worked in a number of hospitals across Brittany, a region in western France where his trial is being held. That has led many to question how he could have carried out so many alleged rapes and assaults without an alarm being raised.",
      "Investigators said that few of the victims had any memory of the alleged assaults. For many of them, it came as a complete shock when police contacted them with evidence of what had happened, as recounted in the surgeon's journals.",
      "Outside the courthouse Monday, a small group of protesters brandished placards denouncing \"more than 20 years of silence\" about the surgeon's past.",
      "The trial is set to last four months. During that time, the 299 alleged victims \u2014 who are now men and women \u2014 will be called on to recount what they can remember of their interactions with Le Scouarnec, who faces 20 years in prison if convicted.",

      "Prosecutors in Romania have alleged for years that Andrew, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, set up a criminal enterprise in the country and in Britain in 2021, along with two women, and used it to sexually exploit multiple people. Andrew Tate was charged with rape and trafficking offenses in Romania, while his brother and two female associates faced trafficking and other related charges.",
      "The brothers have always maintained their innocence, denying all charges against them in Romania, as well as separate rape and assault allegations made by women in Britain, which are still being investigated by police in England.",
      "The Tates are due to return for a hearing in March, according to local media reports.",
      "Romania's organized crime prosecution unit DIICOT said the pair remained \"under judicial supervision\" and would have to \"appear before the judicial authorities at every summons,\" according to the French news agency AFP.",
      "\"Violation in bad faith of the obligations incumbent on them may lead to the replacement of judicial control with a higher custodial measure,\" DIICOT said.",
      "Romanian aviation news website BoardingPass said Thursday that \"a Gulfstream G550 private jet took off from Bucharest, Romania, bound for Fort Lauderdale\" just after 6 a.m. local time (11 p.m. eastern on Wednesday). It said the flight \"will be operated non-stop and will last 12 hours.\"",
      "Pressure from the Trump administration?",
      "DIICOT said in its statement that prosecutors had approved a \"request to modify the obligation preventing the defendants from leaving Romania,\" according to The Associated Press, but it made no mention of who had made the request.",
      "Four British women who have accused Andrew Tate of rape and physical assault between 2013 and 2016 voiced concern last week that the U.S. government could be pressuring Romania to ease travel restrictions on the Tates, who have publicly supported President Trump.",
      "The Financial Times reported earlier this month that the Trump administration was pushing Romanian authorities to return the Tate brothers' U.S. passports and allow them to leave the country.",
      "Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu told the Euronews outlet recently that Mr. Trump's envoy Richard Grenell had raised the case with him at the Munich Security Conference in mid-February, but denied that he was pressured.",
      "It is unclear whether the U.S. asked Romania to lift the travel ban on the Tates, and there was no immediate comment from the White House or State Department.",
      "Cristi Danilet, a former judge in Romania's northern city of Cluj-Napoca, told the AP that such a request would be unprecedented.",
      "\"I have never heard of a foreign government asking Romania to lift preventive measures to allow some suspects to leave the country,\" he said. \"If I had been a judge, this would not have happened.\"",
      "\"If it is true, it means that there is no more rule of law and sovereign countries,\" Danilet told the news agency.",
      "Self-proclaimed misogynist",
      "The four British women who have accused Andrew Tate responded to the news of the brothers' travel to the U.S. with a joint statement on Thursday, saying they were \"in disbelief and feel retraumatized by the news that the Romanian authorities have given into pressure from the Trump administration to allow Andrew Tate to travel around Europe and to the U.S.\"",
      "\"We can only hope that the British authorities finally take action, do something about this terrifying unfolding situation and ensure he faces justice in the U.K.,\" they said.",
      "The women's British lawyer Matthew Jury previously told the BBC that the women \"are the victims of the most horrible and horrific alleged crimes.\"",
      "\"To see the most powerful man in the world support their alleged abuser is incredibly traumatizing. It's retraumatizing for them. It's gaslighting of a sort,\" he said.",
      "The U.K.'s Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute Andrew Tate after the accusations made by the four British women, but the women have filed a civil suit.",
      "In a separate probe, Bedfordshire Police obtained a European arrest warrant in 2024 for Tate and his brother Tristan \"as part of an ongoing investigation into allegations of rape and human trafficking\" in 2024. It would be on these grounds that the pair would be extradited to Britain if and when that happens.",
      "A Romanian judge decided last year that this would only happen after the Romanian case concludes. In December, a British court ruled that police could seize millions of assets belonging to the pair in the U.K. because of unpaid taxes. Tate described the decision as a \"coordinated attack.\"",
      "Andrew Tate, a former international kickboxing champion, first gained wider fame by appearing on the British reality TV show \"Big Brother\" in 2016, before being kicked off after a video emerged showing him beating a woman with a belt.",
      "He subsequently gained millions of followers online before being banned by TikTok, Facebook and YouTube, which accused him of posting misogynistic hate speech. He has more than 10 million followers on Elon Musk's platform X, where he regularly posts homophobic and racist views.",
      "Tate moved to Romania years ago after starting a webcam business in the U.K. He has since reportedly boasted that the business was a \"total scam.\"",
      "Domestic abuse charities and school advocacy groups have warned that Tate's brand of extreme misogyny risks radicalizing men, and teenage boys in particular, to commit real-world harm.",
      "Even after he was barred from most social media platforms, for instance, the \"Safer Schools Northern Ireland\" organization, which includes the British territory's education department, warned that \"Incidents involving him [Tate] in schools have significantly increased,\" including \"verbal harassment of female teachers and pupils, with actions mirroring Tate's views.\"",

      "The world-famous site said it had excavated in recent weeks a nearly life-size frieze depicting the procession of Dionysus, the god of wine, painted on three sides of a large banquet room.",
      "Known as a \"megalography\" from the Greek for \"large painting,\" the frieze depicts a procession, with Dionysus joined by the bacchantes, his female followers. They are portrayed both as dancers or as hunters, with slaughtered animals on their shoulders.",
      "\"Young satyrs with pointed ears play the double flute, while another performs a sacrifice of wine in acrobatic style, squirting wine behind him from a drinking horn into a patera (shallow bowl),\"\u00a0Pompeii said in a statement, while releasing several images of the discoveries.",

      "The frieze is painted in the Second Style of Pompeian painting, which is known for its addition of architectural details like pillars. It dates from about 40 to 30 B.C., making it over 100 years old by the time of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 that destroyed the city.",
      "A woman at the center of the frieze \"is about to be initiated into the mysteries of Dionysus, the god who dies and is reborn and who promises the same destiny to his followers,\" it said.",
      "These initiation rituals, required in antiquity to join such cults, often promised \"a new blissful life, both in this world and in the afterlife.\"",
      "Hunting figures prominently in the rite depicted in the frieze, with another smaller frieze above the principal one depicting animals, alive and dead, a gutted wild boar, various birds, and fish.",
      "\"It is an exceptional historical document,\" said Italian Culture Minister Alessandro Giuli.",
      "Its discovery makes Pompeii \"an extraordinary testimony to an aspect of life in classical Mediterranean life that is largely unknown,\" he said.",

      "Last month, archeologists at the site unearthed a private bathhouse built over 2,000 years ago. Scientists working in the same area recently found a bakery, a laundry shop, two villas and the bones of three people\u00a0who died during the volcanic eruption, which destroyed both the ancient Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum.",

    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Thursday that he had instructed his country's negotiators to travel to Cairo \"for the continuation of the talks\" aimed at keeping the\u00a0tenuous ceasefire agreement with Hamas alive. The announcement came hours after four Israeli hostages'\u00a0remains were returned by Hamas\u00a0as part of the final hostage-prisoner exchange of phase one of the deal.",
      "The fact that the Israeli leader was sending his team to Cairo would bring hope, but there was still deep uncertainty over the future of the ceasefire deal two days before its first six-week phase ends.",
      "The bodies handed over by Hamas on Thursday were the last of the 33 hostages to be returned to Israel during phase one of the ceasefire. Israel released about 600 more Palestinian prisoners Thursday in exchange. The freed detainees, some of whom had been serving long sentences and others who were detained during the Gaza war and never formally charged, poured out of buses in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Gaza to emotional reunions with loved ones.",
      "There were still 59 Israeli hostages being held in Gaza as of Thursday, only 24 of whom are believed to be alive, according to the Israeli government. Their fate hinges on the future of the ceasefire agreement that was negotiated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar.",
      "The plan was for the second phase of the deal to see all remaining hostages returned in exchange for a permanent ceasefire and Israel pulling its forces out of Gaza. But Netanyahu has been under intense pressure from hardline members of his cabinet to walk away from the truce and resume Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas, which has long been designated a terrorist group by the U.S., Israel and the European Union.",

      "Israeli West Bank assault displaces more than 40,000 Palestinians as Gaza truce hangs in balance",
      "Netanyahu has said for more than a year that the objective of the war in Gaza \u2014 which the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run Health Ministry says has killed well over 48,000 people, most of them civilians \u2014 is to destroy or at least disarm Hamas. That's a goal Israel's devastating military assault has not yet achieved.",
      "The Israeli prime minister is also under intense pressure, however, from the families of the hostages to keep the ceasefire alive so their loved ones can be brought back home. President Trump has made it clear that he will back Israel, whatever Netanyahu decides to do, but his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff is expected back in the region soon to push for a second phase.",
      "\"We will get to stage two, or phase two, and I'm very focused on that, and I think it's going to happen,\" Witkoff said Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Witkoff said securing the release of the last U.S. national believed to be among the surviving hostages, Edan Alexander, who was serving with the Israel Defense Forces when he was abducted during the October 7 terrorist attack, was \"front and center for us.\"",
      "\"I know his parents. We talk all the time. He's critical. It's one of President Trump's most important objectives is to get all Americans home, and we're going to be successful in getting Edan home, I believe,\" Witkoff told Brennan.",
      "Getting to the second phase of the ceasefire agreement, and the terms negotiated for it, is also critical for Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinian residents, the vast majority of whom were forced to flee from their homes by the 15-month war, many of them multiple times. Many have returned to find their cities and towns in ruins, and Mr. Trump's suggestion that they all be forced out of the enclave \u2014 possibly without any right to return \u2014 so it can be turned into a new luxury real estate development, has fueled anxiety across the region.",
      "Critics have condemned the idea as would-be ethnic cleansing, and America's regional allies Egypt and Jordan, which Mr. Trump has suggested should take in the displaced Palestinians, have adamantly rejected the idea and, along with other Arab nations, are expected to present an alternative proposal to redevelop Gaza.",
      "Witkoff told Brennan that while the level of devastation in Gaza and the risks posed by unexploded ordinance \"suggest that nobody can really live there in a safe environment for probably at least 15 years\u2026 I'm not sure that anyone has a problem with people, with people returning. We've had these discussions around that. I just think the fundamental issue today is how we get phase two done, and then develop a reconstruction plan for Gaza.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's envoy was clear, however, that Hamas \"cannot be allowed to come back into the government\" in Gaza, saying the group that has run Gaza for almost 20 years, \"has to go. They've got to leave.\"",
      "He could not say where the group's remaining members should be sent, however, or who or what should be brought in to replace them as a governing body in the territory.",
      "\"I think the devil is in the details, and we've had a lot of discussions around it. I'm not at liberty to have that, that specific discussion today, but we've got some ideas, and that will be part of the negotiation,\" he said.",
      "Hamas said after the final exchange of phase one on Thursday that it was \"ready\" to engage in negotiations on the terms of a second phase.",
      "The news that Israeli negotiators were headed for Cairo, with the end of phase one looming on Saturday, will offer some hope to the families of the 59 remaining Israeli hostages \u2014 along with some 2 million Palestinians in Gaza and millions of people across the Middle East \u2014 for a continuation of diplomacy rather than a resumption of war.",

      "Another privately-built moon lander, Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost, was launched by a Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket on Jan. 15 and is on course to land on the moon early Sunday. Touching down near the center of Mare Crisium, it is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments to collect data needed for planned astronaut landings in the agency's Artemis program.",
      "Blue Ghost shared its Falcon 9 with yet another moon lander, this one built by the Japanese company ispace. It is on a longer, low-energy trajectory to the moon and is expected to land in May.",
      "What's different about the Athena lander",
      "The Athena lander represents a more complex mission with broader science goals. Intuitive Machines managers say they incorporated dozens of upgrades and improvements to insure a safe, upright landing after the company's first lander, Odysseus, tipped over during touchdown last February.",
      "\"Every time you go, it's ... a roll-the-dice thing,\" said CEO Steve Altemus. \"I think we have higher confidence, but we're also have a much more complicated mission this time.",
      "\"This time we're flying with a deployable drill. We're flying with a deployable rover, we're flying with a drone, (a) rocket-powered drone that hops, flies off the lander and hops along the surface and down into a permanently shadowed (crater).",
      "\"All those deployments and surface operations are new, and we're going to learn when we do those,\" he said.",
      "The Athena lander's Trident drill and a mass spectrometer will analyze the ultra-cold soil beneath the spacecraft. The lander also will deploy a small commercially-built rover and a rocket-powered hopper that will jump up to 300 feet high before bounding into a nearby, permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",
      "Ice would be a critical resource for future astronauts, if it can be extracted, because it can be turned into drinking water, air and even rocket fuel, providing in situ resources that otherwise would have to be carried up from Earth.",
      "Data collected by orbiting satellites indicate reservoirs of ice may be present in the cold, dark interiors of polar craters that never see the light of the sun. Athena's mission is the first to actually search for the suspected ice from the surface.",
      "The hopper, named Grace after software pioneer Grace Hopper, and the Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform rover built by a company called Lunar Outpost, will communicate with the Athena lander via cellular networking equipment provided by Nokia in a first-of-its-kind demonstration.",
      "Other spacecrafts tagging along",
      "A tiny microrover known as Yaoki, provided by Tokyo-based Dymon Co., will be dropped to the surface from the Athena lander. It will provide close-up images of the lunar soil, or regolith, and beam them back to Earth through Athena.",
      "In case all that is not enough, hitching a ride aboard the Falcon 9 are three more independent spacecraft, one provided by NASA and two from private companies.",
      "AstroForge's commercially developed Odin asteroid prospector was released four minutes after Athena, NASA's Lunar Trailblazer satellite was deployed about 20 seconds after that followed a few seconds later by Epic Aerospace's Chimera GEO-1 space tug.",
      "Odin is headed for deep space on an asteroid prospecting mission. It will be the first commercially-built probe to fly beyond the moon, heading for an asteroid flyby to look for potentially valuable mineral deposits.",
      "During the Lunar Trailblazer's two-year mission, two instruments will study the nature of any ice that might be present in the lunar soil below while measuring surface temperatures on a global scale.",
      "The third satellite, known as Chimera GEO, was provided by Epic Aerospace. It's a compact space tug built to move small satellites to different locations in Earth orbit.",
      "The Grace hopper may end up the star of the show. Five hops are planned with the first carrying it to an altitude of about 65 feet to a landing another 65 feet from Athena.",
      "\"On the second hop, we expect to go around 50 meters (164 feet) altitude. And on the third hop we'll go about 100 meters (328 feet) altitude,\" said Trent Martin, a senior vice president at Intuitive Machines.",
      "The fourth hop will carry Grace into a permanently shadowed crater some 1,500 from the lander. It's fifth and final hop, either commanded through the Nokia network or triggered by a backup timer, will carry Gracie back up and out of the crater.",
      "\"The purpose of the demo is to show that we can reach extreme environments with technologies other than rovers,\" Martin said. \"The idea is that if you have a really deep crater and you want to get down into that crater, why not do it with something like a drone?\"",
      "The costs of the mission",
      "NASA paid Intuitive Machines $62 million to deliver the Trident drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million to help fund Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million helps finance Intuitive's Grace hopper.",
      "Finally, NASA spent another $89 million on the Lunar Trailblazer satellite and mission operations. Total cost to NASA: $207 million.",
      "The mission was funded in large part by the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the moon to enable industry growth and to support long-term lunar exploration, helping the United States stay ahead in space innovation,\" said Nicola Fox, head of NASA's space science mission directorate.",
      "Athena is Intuitive Machines' second CLPS-sponsored lunar lander. The company's first lander, Odysseus, touched down on the moon on Feb. 22, 2024. But the spacecraft came down harder than expected and it was moving slightly to one side at the moment of touchdown. It apparently caught a footpad on the surface and tipped over on its side.",
      "The spacecraft still had power, however, and it sent back data for several days. This time around, multiple upgrades were put in place to insure a safe landing for Athena.",
      "\"If you can routinely land on the moon, all the smart people, the scientists, and the engineers that want to fly things to the moon will now be willing to invest money, to build and engineer the systems that will help us live and work on the moon,\" Altemus said.",
      "\"These are the initial highways or trails that open up a whole new region of exploration of the moon. Like the United States when it was very young, go west, right? This is like that. Just like that.\"",

      "London \u2014\u00a0Sales data show many Europeans, seemingly angry with Elon Musk as he navigates his close relationship with President Trump to influence U.S. policy, may be choosing to steer clear of Tesla vehicles. A sharp decline in sales comes as anti-Musk ads appear in the U.K. and other countries alluding a comparison to Adolf Hitler.",
      "Tesla new vehicle sales fell across the continent by nearly half in January, plunging by 45% year-on-year, according to data compiled by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA). In hard numbers, Tesla sold just under 9,950 vehicles in Europe in January. For the same month in 2024, the company sold just over 18,100 new vehicles.",
      "The drop in sales has hurt Tesla's share price, which had nearly doubled in the first month after Mr. Trump's election victory to a record high. Most of those gains have since been lost, and Tesla's market cap has plunged below the $1 trillion mark. The stock, which as of early Wednesday traded for roughly $305 in the U.S., remains up 54% over the last 12 months, buoyed by the company's ambitious plans for self-driving cars and humanoid robots.",
      "In Germany, Tesla sales fell nearly 60% in January year-on-year as would-be buyers voted with their wallets \u2014 possibly angered by Musk's purported meddling in the country's federal elections last weekend, which saw the far-right AfD party he backed become the country's second most popular.",
      "In France, Tesla's sales in January fell 63%. The plunge came after Musk backed far-right parties in that country and attacked left-leaning ones, although the impact of his political activities on Tesla's financial performance is hard to gauge and could reflect other factors, such as mounting competition from other EV makers.",
      "Tesla sales in the U.S. have also been declining, falling 1% in 2024 compared to the prior year \u2014 the automaker's first annual sales decline in 12 years despite global EV sales rising 7.3%. As CBS News' MoneyWatch reported this week, Wall Street analysts have said Musk's political activities could alienate consumers previously loyal to the brand, and protests have erupted at a number of Tesla dealerships in the U.S.",
      "\"Musk's DOGE related actions and more powerful alliance with Trump clearly could alienate some consumers to move away from the Tesla brand,\" analysts for the U.S. financial services firm Wedbush wrote in a Tuesday company report on the automaker. \"There is some momentum around this effort in Europe and pockets of the U.S. as well since November. That said, we view this as containable brand issues for Tesla for now that are not a major cause for concern.\"",
      "A similar trend has been seen in Europe. While Tesla's European sales numbers plunged in January, ACEA data show sales of electric vehicles overall surged by 34%, with buyers increasingly eyeing options from China and the continent's own automakers.",
      "In the U.K., after Musk attacked Prime Minister Keir Starmer and called for the release of a jailed far-right activist, January sales fell a comparatively gentler 12% year-on-year, but anger at Musk has been visible on British roadsides after an activist group called \"Everybody Hates Elon\" pasted over bus stop ads with posters showing Musk making a hand gesture that strongly resembled a Nazi salute at one of Mr. Trump's inauguration events.",
      "Musk has neither admitted nor denied his intent with the gesture, but he mocked the criticism of it, saying in a message on his social media platform X that, \"the 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.\"",
      "On the protest group's posters, the words \"0 to 1939 in three seconds\" appear above the image of Musk, alluding to the start of World War II.",

Rescue crews had not managed to established contact with the trapped men for more than 100 hours, and the efforts to reach the men have come up against a series of challenges.",
      "A portion of the Srisailam Left Bank Canal tunnel collapsed Saturday morning, causing water and mud to rush into the huge tunnel, which has a diameter of about 33 feet. Officials have said that about 50 workers were inside the tunnel when part of its ceiling caved in. Forty-three of them managed to escape, but eight were left trapped.",
      "There has been no confirmation on the condition of the trapped men as no contact has been made with them by rescuers. Personnel with several agencies, including the Indian Army and the National Disaster Response Force, have been involved in the rescue efforts.",
      "They have faced repeated setbacks due to loose soil and mud inside the tunnel.",
      "Work on the 27-mile-long tunnel, which would be one of the world's longest irrigation tunnels if it is completed, has been delayed several times since construction began in 2005.",
      "On Tuesday, the rescuers worked to clear a train track inside the tunnel so it can be used to transport equipment to pump water out from around the site of the collapse. A path was also being cleared to take earthmoving machines into the tunnel.",
      "\"As of now we are dewatering and going forward. But for the last 40 or 50 meters (yards) we are not able to go,\" B Santhosh, administrative head of the Nagarkurnool district, where the tunnel is being constructed, told India's PTI news agency.",

      "While Pope Francis is certainly far from out of the woods, per Vatican reports, it is important to clarify that mild renal insufficiency simply means blood flow to the kidney is mildly reduced, perhaps from low volume or dehydration, and it might well be improving from the blood transfusions he is receiving.",
      "As long as his urine output keeps up and his kidney function doesn\u2019t worsen, this should not be a major obstacle.",

      "That means the requests for injunctive relief are considered in a sort of two-part wave of proceedings, since most \u2013 if not all \u2013 Trump-era complaints include both the request for the TRO and for the preliminary injunction.",

      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the malware",
      "Microsoft Threat Intelligence has discovered a new version of XCSSET, a dangerous macOS malware that spreads by infecting Xcode projects, which are files used by developers to create Mac apps. While this malware is currently being seen in only a few attacks, it has been upgraded with new tricks to make it harder to detect and remove.",
      "One of the biggest changes is how the malware hides itself. It now scrambles its code in a more unpredictable way, making it difficult for security software to recognize. It also renames parts of its code to disguise its true purpose, allowing it to stay hidden for longer.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once it infects a Mac, the malware ensures it keeps running even after the computer is restarted. It does this in two ways. First, it inserts itself into system files that launch when the computer starts. Second, it replaces the shortcut to Launchpad, which is the tool used to open apps, with a fake version that runs both the real Launchpad and the malware at the same time.",
      "This malware also finds new ways to sneak into Xcode projects, making it more difficult to spot. If an infected project is shared or downloaded, the malware can spread to other devices without the user realizing it.",

      "The XCSSET malware is designed to steal a variety of sensitive information from infected Macs, putting both personal and financial data at risk. One of its primary targets is digital wallets, which are used to store cryptocurrency. If a user has a crypto wallet on their Mac, the malware can attempt to access and steal funds.",
      "It can also collect data from the Notes app, where many users store personal information, passwords and other sensitive details. If important data is saved in Notes, it could be accessed and sent to hackers.",
      "Beyond this, the malware can exfiltrate system information and files, meaning it can gather details about the Mac itself, installed applications and even specific files stored on the device. This could include work documents, saved login credentials or any other valuable information. Because XCSSET is a modular malware, meaning it can be updated with new capabilities, it may gain even more data-stealing abilities over time.",

      "2. Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links.\u00a0Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3. Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4. Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, Google account, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",

      "Mac users can\u2019t afford to be complacent anymore. Gone are the days when Macs were considered \"safe by default.\" Cybercriminals have leveled up, moving beyond basic adware to full-blown information stealers. They\u2019re swiping passwords, hijacking authentication cookies, intercepting OTPs and even emptying crypto wallets.

      "We saw a rise in infostealer malware in 2024, with hackers using it to steal credentials, cryptocurrency and other personal data from millions of users. If you recall, I reported countless\u00a0incidents of an infostealer called Lumma preying on Android, Windows and even iOS and Mac users.",

      "Security researchers have also observed 3.9 billion credentials shared in credential lists that appear to be sourced from infostealer logs.",

      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Infostealer-related attacks on the rise in 2024",
      "A\u00a0cybersecurity report by threat intelligence platform KELA has uncovered a sharp rise in infostealer malware in 2024. Researchers also observed an alarming trend in how stolen data was circulated. Large compilations of credentials, often referred to as \"credential lists,\" were being shared across cybercrime forums. These lists, primarily sourced from infostealer logs, contained billions of login details harvested from infected devices.",
      "One of the most notable incidents linked to infostealer malware was the breach of Snowflake, a cloud data storage provider. In April 2024, threat actors gained access to customer accounts using stolen login credentials, many of which were obtained through infostealers. Exploiting weak security practices, such as the absence of multifactor authentication, attackers extracted valuable data and later attempted to sell it on underground markets. The breach affected at least 165 companies.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The KELA report highlights that hackers deploying Lumma, StealC, Redline and other infostealers infected 4.3 million machines, leading to the compromise of 330 million credentials. Nearly 40% of these infected machines contained credentials for corporate systems, including content management platforms, email accounts, Active Directory Federation Services and remote desktop environments. In total, this accounted for 1.7 million compromised bots and 7.5 million stolen credentials.",
      "The report also found that 3.9 billion credentials were shared in credential lists that appear to be sourced from infostealer logs. KELA\u2019s analysis suggests that almost 65% of infected devices were personal computers storing corporate credentials, making them a prime target for infostealer malware.",

      "2025 is not going to be any different",
      "Infostealer malware is not going anywhere in 2025. With malware-as-a-service platforms on the rise and infostealers becoming more advanced, cybercriminals will likely keep using them as a go-to method for stealing credentials and gaining access to systems.",
      "Law enforcement has been cracking down, though. In 2024, authorities managed to take down key parts of the infostealer ecosystem, including disrupting Redline, one of the most widely used infostealers. This showed that international agencies can go after not just the malware developers but also the networks and underground markets that keep these operations running.",
      "But takedowns like these rarely put an end to the problem. When one major infostealer operation is shut down, others quickly step in to take its place. The constant demand for stolen credentials and the ability of cybercriminals to adapt means infostealer attacks will likely remain a major threat in 2025.",

      "Ways to stay safe from infostealer malware",
      "With infostealer malware becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are some effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "2. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "HOW TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST DEBIT CARD HACKERS WHO ARE AFTER YOUR MONEY",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Given the surge in infostealer malware warnings, it is clear that cybercriminals are actively targeting passwords. Both organizations and individuals are urged to strengthen their security measures by enabling 2FA, monitoring credential exposure and using endpoint protection tools. While no security measure is completely foolproof, combining these practices can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to infostealer malware.",

      "I was one of the first to spit into a test tube, giving up my DNA forever to learn more about my health and heredity.\u00a0You know, the ones that promise to connect you with distant relatives you didn\u2019t even know existed or reveal genetic risks for conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s or heart disease. These DNA tests aren\u2019t just about satisfying curiosity; people buy them to uncover important health information, connect with loved ones or give thoughtful gifts.",
      "But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 and I\u2019m speaking from a data privacy perspective here \u2013 genetic information is highly valuable and a risk to unlocking deeply intimate information unique to only you. And while these commercial DNA tests seem harmless, they come with risks that most people don\u2019t immediately think about. Once you hand over your DNA, you\u2019re giving these companies access to your most personal data. And believe me, what happens to that data after the test can be anything but straightforward.",

      "Illustration of human DNA (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What\u2019s the big deal?",
      "Your DNA is more than just a string of letters; it's a unique and permanent blueprint of your identity. Using a commercial DNA testing service can mean handing over not only physical samples but also information about potential medical conditions and predispositions, ethnicity and familial connections and even behavioral or lifestyle markers. This can put you at risk of things like genetic testing without your consent, increased insurance premiums, health-related scams and family secrets coming to light, sometimes with painful consequences.\u00a0One woman even felt that she \"lost her entire family\" after taking one of these tests.",
      "And here\u2019s the kicker: Even if you choose to stay out of the genetic testing game, if anyone who shares some of your DNA, like your brother or your niece, chooses to take one, it can still expose you to many of these risks without you even knowing.",
      "What does happen to your genetic data?",
      "Aside from doing what the services advertise, it turns out that many DNA testing services may be sharing your genetic data with researchers, marketers, insurance companies and even law enforcement agencies.",
      "In fact, according to recent research, half of commercial DNA testing services use your genetic data for research (both internal and external). Nearly half (4 in 10) use it for marketing. And nearly half (also 4 in 10) also share your data with law enforcement agencies, potentially without any kind of subpoena or court order.",
      "While DNA testing companies often claim to use anonymized data for many of these purposes, the reality is that \"anonymized\" genetic information can\u00a0often be re-identified when combined with other data sources, sources like data brokers and people search sites that hold and sell troves of information (like lists of vulnerable individuals, such as those experiencing dementia) that could be used toward this purpose.",

      "If you do buy one of these DNA testing kits, you might expect that the results are pretty reliable. However, I was surprised to learn that this may not always be the case. According to Dr. Divya Vats, a clinical biochemical geneticist at Kaiser Permanente,\u00a0at-home genetic tests aren\u2019t as accurate as medical DNA tests ordered by your doctor. This can lead to unnecessary anxiety or false reassurance regarding your health. Even when it comes to ethnicity and ancestry, results usually rely on statistical comparisons to reference populations, which\u00a0don\u2019t necessarily yield accurate results, especially if you\u2019re from a less-studied ethnic group.",

      "According to Incogni, a data broker removal service, almost none of the DNA testing services it investigated provided any information more substantial than that of a \"secure facility.\" This lack of transparency about where their data is stored and how it can be destroyed creates a major roadblock for anyone trying to regain control over their genetic information.",

      "1) Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Proactively remove your personal information from online data brokers and people search sites to minimize the risk of linking anonymized genetic data back to you. Not only will this clean up and prevent your health and genetic data from circulating the web, but it\u2019ll also make it much harder for your anonymized data (genetic or otherwise) to be linked to you. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2) Choose reputable companies: Select well-known and trusted DNA testing providers, as they are more likely to adhere to privacy and security standards due to public scrutiny.",
      "3) Review privacy options during sign-up: Pay close attention to privacy settings when registering your test kit. Many companies allow you to opt in or out of data sharing for research or marketing purposes.",
      "4) Limit data sharing: Carefully consider whether to permit your data to be shared with third parties. While you can revoke consent later, data already shared may not be fully retrievable or deletable.",
      "5) Delete data post-test: If you\u2019ve already taken a test, review the company\u2019s privacy policy and delete your data if possible. Note that data shared with third parties may remain accessible.",
      "6) Avoid uploading data to third-party databases: Refrain from uploading your genetic information to external services, which may share data with law enforcement or other entities without clear consent.",
      "7) Consider anonymous testing: Use anonymous methods when submitting DNA samples, such as pseudonyms or alternative payment methods, to reduce traceability.",

      "The line between spam and scam calls is often thin and blurred. The person on the other end of the call might sound like they're trying to sell you something or conduct a survey, but this could just be a cover for them to try to extract personal information from you.",

      "Take security questions, for example. They're pretty repetitive: your mother's maiden name, your first pet's name, your favorite elementary school teacher. A hacker does not need to know how to script a single line of code to break into your accounts; it's often enough that they know these things about you and can convince your mobile carrier to activate a SIM card in your name.",
      "This is all, let's not mince words, scary, especially if you've just sold a vehicle or property and have the proceeds lying around or a nest egg account set aside for your retirement, because scammers and hackers can easily find out about title or deed transfers through data brokers like people finder sites.",
      "Refuse to engage",
      "Scary as it is, it's also simple to protect against. Simple, but not always easy. If you just refuse to engage with these people, never giving up even a scrap of information, your risks of getting scammed or hacked plummet. Keep your personal information out of circulation in the first place (using a data removal service, for example), and they drop to almost zero.",

      "When to hang up",
      "So, once faced with a suspicious call, the solution is simply to hang up as soon as something seems off. And when is that, exactly? The moment someone calls you out of the blue and requires you to give or confirm any personal information. This could be the last four digits of your Social Security number, your address, which credit card company you're with \u2014 anything that concerns you, specifically. If the caller turns up the pressure and starts trying to get you to stay on the line, either by enticing you with \"rewards\" or even threatening you with dire consequences, then you can be absolutely sure the call is not legitimate.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The red herring of legitimacy",
      "But what if the call is legitimate? What if you hang up on someone who was only doing their job? What if they were truly trying to help you? These are the doubts that scammers and hackers play upon to ply their trades. We're all vulnerable to tactics like these, especially if caught off guard. Older adults are particularly vulnerable.\u00a0Studies suggest that older people \u2014 who collectively lose over $28 billion to scams each year \u2014 are more likely to cling to initial impressions of trustworthiness, even when later behavior puts that trustworthiness into question. Scammers typically start their interactions with well-rehearsed, smoothly executed preambles, creating good first impressions. Older people are also more likely to put stock in good manners, finding it more difficult than younger adults to directly or indirectly question a caller's intentions, let alone cut them off mid-sentence and hang up on them.",

      "Why call center staff won't ask for personal information",
      "So, how can you know if the caller is really who they say they are? That's the question many people get stuck on. The twist? It's a red herring. The fact is, it doesn't matter if the call is legit or not. If it's a scammer, they won't be hurt or offended: rejection and hang-ups come with the territory. If it's a real call, the caller also won't be hurt or offended \u2014 here's why. Call center staff and other people who make cold calls as part of their job are aware of the privacy and security concerns that such calls bring up. They know how dangerous it can be to divulge personal information over the phone, which is why they won't ask for it. They should also be familiar with one of the best practices there is for dealing with suspicious cold calls.",
      "10 ways to safeguard against phone scams and unwanted calls",
      "1. Use the \"Hang up, look up, and call back\" method for verification: When in doubt, hang up the phone, look up the organization the caller claimed to be calling from (using its official website, for example), and call it back using the number you find there. If the call you received was above board, they'll be able to redirect you back to the initial caller.",
      "2. Don't answer calls from unknown numbers: Let unknown calls go to voicemail, as legitimate callers will usually leave a message if it's important.",
      "3. Register your phone number on the\u00a0National Do Not Call Registry: This can help reduce telemarketing calls from legitimate businesses, but it won't stop scammers, illegal robocalls or exempt organizations (like charities and political groups) from calling you. Scammers often ignore the registry and use tactics like\u00a0number spoofing to bypass it. Want to know more about why your phone still won\u2019t stop ringing and what you can do about it? Check out our article on the\u00a0\u2018Do Not Call\u2019 list loophole.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Use a spam blocking app for texts and calls:\u00a0These apps can identify and block known spam numbers, significantly reducing the number of unwanted calls you receive.",
      "5. Never give out personal information in response to unexpected calls: Legitimate organizations won't ask for sensitive information over the phone if they've initiated the call.",
      "6. Be cautious of pressure tactics or requests for immediate action: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to prevent you from thinking clearly or verifying their claims.",
      "7. Set a password for your voicemail account: This prevents scammers from accessing your voicemail and potentially gathering personal information.",
      "8. Be wary of caller ID\u00a0spoofing \u2014 local numbers may not be local callers: Scammers can manipulate caller ID to display any number they choose, so don't trust it blindly.",
      "9. Don't respond to questions, especially those that can be answered with \"Yes\": Scammers may record your \"Yes\" response and use it to authorize fraudulent charges or changes to your accounts.",
      "10. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0To get fewer of these calls in the first place, you can enlist the help of a professional data removal service. These services can take your personal information out of circulation, including the contact details spammers and scammers use to call you. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt's Key Takeaways",
      "If you receive a call that gives you any doubts at all, even if you can't quite put your finger on why, then you should end the call and either go on with your day or look up the company and call it back on its official number. You can reduce the number of calls like this by signing up for a data removal service. This will leave fewer spam and scam callers with your contact details and other personal information \u2014 something they use to craft convincing backstories and put potential victims at ease.",

      "JOHANNESBURG: The key to Africa\u2019s future is in increasing trade with the U.S., not in receiving aid from it, a message key analysts told Fox News Digital in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign aid freeze.",
      "\"U.S. trade dollars exchanged with Africa massively exceed aid dollars granted,\" South African-based Frans Cronje, an advisor for the Yorktown Foundation for Freedom, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Some $11 billion of USAid funds were reportedly spent in Africa in 2024, but trade between the U.S. and Africa during the same period was seven times higher -\u00a0$71.6 billion, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.",

      "Cronje said \"the idea of helping people with aid may be admirable, but in practice achieves little in Africa by way of addressing the structural factors that underpin poverty. Trade, on the other hand, is a more viable route by which the U.S. can build strong relationships with Africa, and is also in line with President Donald Trump\u2019s style of diplomacy through transactions.\"",
      "Cronje elaborated, saying, \"Aid acts as a subsidy to bad governments, and thereby keeps them in power despite an absence of reform - whereas trade requires reforms and improving governance to be sustainable.\"",
      "Following the Trump administration's policy change, Ledama Olekina, senator for Kenya\u2019s Narok County, added, \"We don\u2019t need aid in Kenya; we can do it on our own!\" Posting on X on Jan. 28, Olekina wrote, \"Relying on aid from the West limits our opportunities to be industrious and creative. From now on, we must learn to live within our means, eliminate corruption, and instill a spirit of patriotism in our citizens. Together, let\u2019s build a brighter future for our country. Thank you @realDonaldTrump and @USAID it\u2019s time!\"",
      "Anna Mahjar-Barducci, a senior research fellow at the Middle East Media Research Institute, told Fox News Digital that aid \"does not help the needy, as foreign aid keeps the needy always being needy \u2026 international aid doesn't go directly to the starving population, but to governments. The direct consequence is the growth of the role of the State in the economy of the recipient country, which does not offer incentives to (the) private sector's development.\"",
      "She added, \"Foreign aid has been financing central governments, which (has) ended up promoting statism, and discouraging the creation of an entrepreneurial culture. As a result, government bureaucrats became richer, and regular citizens got poorer. As British economist Peter Bauer put it: \"Aid is a process by which the poor in the rich countries subsidize the rich in poor countries.\"",

      "Aid has other negative effects, according to Mahjar-Barducci, who added, \"aid is providing governments, many of which are dictatorships, in Africa with freely usable cash, which not only discourages the creation of an entrepreneurial culture, but it also discourages steps toward peace in war-torn areas.",
      "\"While many Westerners (mainly belonging to the radical left) criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pause U.S. foreign aid, many African intellectuals welcomed the new administration\u2019s policy.\"",
      "She pointed to a recent column by Nigerian expert Mfonobong Inyang, titled, \"Wake Up Africa, Foreign Aid Is Not A Development Strategy.\" She said \"in his article, he stated that foreign aid is meant to be a temporary relief and intervention, not an official policy of any country that seeks to assert its sovereignty.\"",
      "Mahjar-Barducci said, \"Many African economists are saying that the suspension of USAID funding, offers an opportunity to redefine the African countries\u2019 development strategy, and establish an \u2018Africa-first approach,\u2019 based on direct investments, innovation, partnerships, (and) empowering local governance.\"",

      "Cronje said that when it comes to Africa, China already believes in pushing trade, rather than aid, \"in terms of both foreign investment flows and trade flows, China is a significantly more important economic partner for Africa than is the U.S. Since around 2010, Chinese trade with Africa escalated sharply in dollar terms whilst trade levels between the U.S. and Africa remained relatively flat.\"",

      "Additionally, on China, Cronje concluded, \"In many respects, the U.S. is having to play catch-up in Africa. For American policy makers, the trade and investment deficit relative to China should be a more important concern than the question of future aid flows.\"",

    "summary": "The order by Judge William Alsup, who called the OPM directive \"illegal,\" does not reinstate any recently dismissed government employees, but it could affect future attempts at firings.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Office of Personnel Management to rescind earlier instructions telling federal agencies to \u201cpromptly determine whether these employees should be retained at the agency.\u201d",
      "The directions, communicated in a Jan. 20\u00a0memo\u00a0and Feb. 14 internal email, are \u201cillegal\u201d and \u201cshould be stopped, rescinded,\u201d Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California said from the bench.",
      "The ruling does not reinstate dismissed employees.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "The judge instructed the Office of Personnel Management to communicate to the Department of Defense on Friday \u2014 ahead of expected probationary terminations \u2014 that he has ruled they are invalid.",
      "Alsup has also ordered a hearing scheduled in which acting Office of Personnel Management Director Charles Ezell will testify. The timing of that hearing is unclear.",
      "\u201cThe Office of Personnel Management does not have any authority whatsoever under any statute in the history of the universe, to hire and fire employees within another agency,\u201d Alsup said Thursday night. \u201cIt can hire its own employees, yes. Can fire them. But it cannot order or direct some other agency to do so.\u201d",
      "\u201cOPM has no authority to tell any agency in the United States government, other than itself, who they can hire and who they can fire, period. So on the merits, I think, we start with that important proposition,\u201d he said.",
      "Alsup called probationary employees \u201cthe lifeblood of our government.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey come in at the low level and they work their way up, and that\u2019s how we renew ourselves and reinvent ourselves,\u201d he said.",
      "Probationary workers are\u00a0employees who are recent hires or sometimes longtime employees who were recently moved into new positions.",
      "\u201cThe government\u2019s position, for the first time in history of the United States, is that these employees can be fired at will,\u201d an attorney for the plaintiffs, Danielle Leonard, said. \u201cThat is not the law, Your Honor. Probationary employees and agencies do have obligations before firing probationary employees.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe government should not operate in secrecy when it comes to wholesale orders to fire so many people,\u201d Leonard pleaded with the court.",
      "There was significant disagreement as to whether the OPM\u2019s phone call to agencies instructing the firing of probationary employees in mid-February was an \u201corder\u201d or a \u201crequest.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomething aberrational happens, not just in one agency, but all across the government, in many agencies on the same day, the same thing. Doesn\u2019t that sound like to you that somebody ordered it to happen, as opposed to, \u2018Oh, we just got guidance,\u2019\u201d Alsup posited to local Assistant U.S. Attorney Kelsey Helland, who was the only representative of the government at the hearing.",
      "\u201cAn order is not usually phrased as a request,\u201d Helland said. \u201cAsking is not ordering to do something.\u201d",
      "Helland suggested impacted employees should go through the Office of Special Counsel or the Merit Systems Protection Board to fight their employment status \u2014 and that a temporary restraining order like this would be unnecessary.",
      "\u201cAre they really contending to this court that all of these federal employees are lying, Your Honor?\u201d Leonard asked. \u201cThat\u2019s what counsel is saying. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s credible.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for OPM did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people could have been affected by the directives from the Trump administration, according to data from\u00a0OPM, although the exact number of people who were terminated was not immediately clear.",
      "Everett Kelley, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, one of the unions that brought the case, called the ruling \"an important initial victory for patriotic Americans across this country who were illegally fired from their jobs by an agency that had no authority to do so.\u201d",
      "\"OPM\u2019s direction to agencies to engage in the indiscriminate firing of federal probationary employees is illegal, plain and simple, and our union will keep fighting until we put a stop to these demoralizing and damaging attacks on our civil service once and for all,\" Kelley said in a statement.",
      "Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees, said: \u201cWe know this decision is just a first step, but it gives federal employees a respite.... We will continue to move this case forward with our partners until federal workers are protected against these baseless terminations.\u201d"

    "summary": "Trump's choice of RFK Jr. to be HHS secretary poses a risk to GOP lawmakers in the midterm elections if measles, bird flu, ebola or another disease rips through the country.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of well-established vaccines, said Wednesday that his department is tracking an outbreak of measles that has infected more than 100 people and killed a child in Texas. But he played down the consequence of the resurgence \u2014 25 years after the disease was declared to be eliminated in the U.S.",
      "\"We're following the measles epidemic every day,\" Kennedy said during President Donald Trump's first Cabinet meeting since being sworn in Jan. 20. \u201cIncidentally, there have been four measles outbreaks this year in this country. ... So it\u2019s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year.\u201d",
      "But the death of an unvaccinated school-age child in West Texas, confirmed by a state health official this week, is the first fatality in the U.S. since 2015.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Kennedy has been scarce at HHS headquarters, has not visited a number of HHS agencies and has not sent all-staff emails to the department's workforce, according to one department official. Notably, this person said, Kennedy has not done anything to address the measles outbreak.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like he\u2019s still in campaign-mode rather than realizing he\u2019s head of a large agency and workforce,\" the HHS official said.",
      "An HHS spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Trump's decision to tap Kennedy to lead HHS reflected the president's own tortured relationship with pandemic disease, mass immunization and a political base that has become increasingly critical of vaccines following the health and economic damage wrought by Covid-19.",
      "It also poses a risk to Republican lawmakers in the midterm elections if measles, bird flu, Ebola or another disease rips through the country following Kennedy's appointment and the Department of Government Efficiency's cutbacks in foreign and domestic efforts to combat those viruses, according to some GOP strategists.",
      "\"If you\u2019re cutting a program, that increases the potential for something to go wrong \u2014 you\u2019re going to own it,\" said one strategist who has worked on Republican presidential, Senate and House campaigns. \"Maybe the measles thing is the canary in the coal mine. ... This is a small example of a potential problem. This has real-life consequences, and that's the part that is politically perilous.\"",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who voted to confirm Kennedy, said the government needs to pay close attention to the public health implications of communicable diseases.",
      "\u201cWe should be worried about any outbreak, particularly measles,\u201d Murkowski said.",
      "Billionaire Elon Musk, a temporary Trump White House adviser who is the public face of DOGE, erroneously said Wednesday that public funding for anti-ebola efforts had been turned back on after DOGE cut it off, according to The Washington Post, which reported that the money is still frozen. The DOGE cuts, and Trump executive orders pausing some government operations, complicated the administration's response to an avian flu outbreak that has spiked egg prices and could endanger people. But Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said this week that her department would commit as much as $1 billion to combating the economic and health effects of the disease.",
      "Many political experts believe Trump's reactions to Covid-19 hurt him in losing re-election to Joe Biden in 2020. In order to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the Trump administration issued stay-at-home guidelines that contributed to economic losses. Congress and Trump then spent trillions of dollars \u2014 later augmented by a massive Biden stimulus law \u2014 to prevent an economic collapse. At the same time, Trump launched Operation Warp Speed, a successful effort to push drug companies to develop a vaccine in record time.",
      "But many Trump voters were upset by the federal guidelines and more-stringent state-level commercial shutdowns, and some questioned the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. Trump's pride in pushing for the vaccine dissolved during his 2024 campaign. His shift was apparently enough for Kennedy, who dropped out of the race and endorsed him. Since taking office, Trump has issued a federal ban on Covid vaccine mandates in schools and ordered the reinstatement of military personnel who were fired for refusing to take the vaccine during the Biden administration.",
      "In other words, Trump has found a position that allows him to oppose vaccine mandates without banning immunizations, a stance that gives him some room to maneuver to each side when necessary. Kennedy, who was confirmed 52-48, with former Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., casting the only Republican \"no\" vote, has long been more critical of vaccines \u2014 including the MMR shot.",
      "Kennedy has promoted an unfounded theory that vaccines cause autism, and he blamed measles deaths in Samoa in 2018 on immunizations rather than the disease.",
      "\u201cI think that we need a vaccine that is not a leaky vaccine,\u201d Kennedy told NBC News of the MMR vaccine in February 2024. \"The immunity that you get is ephemeral, and it wears off over time.\u201d",
      "He added that the \"most frightening part\" of the measles shot is that \"it does not provide maternal immunity.\" Asked whether he would recommend that children get the measles vaccine, he walked away from the interview.",
      "The refusal to endorse the shot puts Kennedy in a small minority of Americans, according to polling in recent years. The vast majority of children in the U.S. receive a measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot, and roughly 9 in 10 Americans said in 2023 that they believed the benefits of that vaccine outweigh the risks, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "\"It was irresponsible for the president to put a vaccine skeptic in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services,\" Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said. \"The death in Lubbock is tragic, and I hope it will be a wake-up call for Republican leaders who have pushed dangerous conspiracy theories about vaccines and advocated for cuts to medical research and public health.\"",
      "Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., an obstetrician by trade, told NBC News that he spoke to Kennedy on Thursday morning \u2014 but that measles did not come up.",
      "\"He's already said that he's pro-vax,\" Marshall said, shifting the blame for skepticism to the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci.",
      "\"Fauci did more to create vaccine hesitancy in this country in two years than Bobby Kennedy potentially could have done in a lifetime,\" Marshall said, referring to Fauci's role on Trump's coronavirus task force and testimony to Congress about the origins of Covid-19 that some Republicans say was knowingly false.",
      "Marshall also pointed a finger at Biden, pinning the outbreak on undocumented immigrants.",
      "\"I encourage everyone to get their measles vaccine, their MMR vaccine. I think it\u2019s a great idea,\" Marshall said. \"But this wouldn\u2019t be happening in Texas right now if it wasn\u2019t for Joe Biden\u2019s open border.\"",
      "Trump frequently portrayed Fauci as a villain during the 2024 campaign and, upon taking the presidency, revoked the security detail protecting him.",
      "During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy said that he is broadly in favor of inoculations, but refused to endorse the measles vaccine.",
      "Deputy White House press secretary Kush Desai said the West Wing is happy with Kennedy.",
      "\"The White House has full confidence in Secretary Kennedy and his ability to deliver on President Trump's mandate to Make America Healthy Again,\" Desai said in an exchange of text messages."

      "He was 95.",
      "Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, 65, a classical pianist, were found dead in separate rooms in their Sante Fe, New Mexico, home, according to a search warrant that described their deaths as \"suspicious.\"",
      "Authorities are probing the circumstances surrounding their deaths, which the search warrant said were \"suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation.\" Officials said that there was no obvious sign of foul play but that they could not rule it out.",
      "In a statement, Hackman's family said he was \"loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just Dad and Grandpa. We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss.\"",
      "In a remarkable acting career that spanned six decades, Hackman established himself as one of the most distinctive and dependable film stars of his generation. He was part of a group of unconventional leading men who helped define the \u201cNew Hollywood\u201d cinema of the 1970s, but he was just as prominent across the '80s and '90s.",
      "He won his first Oscar for his portrayal of the ferocious detective Jimmy \u201cPopeye\u201d Doyle in William Friedkin\u2019s \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d taking the wheel for arguably the most electrifying car chase in movie history. He riveted audiences in Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s paranoid thriller \u201cThe Conversation\u201d and delighted younger viewers as villainous Lex Luthor in \u201cSuperman.\u201d",
      "Hackman, who seemed drawn to projects that explored moral gray areas, earned his second Oscar for his supporting work as the brutal Sheriff Little Bill Daggett in \u201cUnforgiven,\u201d Clint Eastwood\u2019s revisionist Western drama.",
      "In all, Hackman earned two Academy Awards, four Golden Globes (including an honorary prize), one Screen Actors Guild Award and two British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs). He also landed Oscar nominations for his roles in the seminal outlaws-on-the-run drama \u201cBonnie & Clyde,\u201d the character study \u201cI Never Sang for My Father\u201d and the divisive thriller \u201cMississippi Burning.\u201d",
      "Hackman was born Jan. 30, 1930, in San Bernardino, California. He roamed across the country with his father, Eugene, and his mother, Lyda, before they put down roots in Illinois. Hackman dropped out of school at 16 and fibbed about his age to join the U.S. Marines. He was trained as a radio operator and served in China, where he picked up work as a disc jockey.",
      "He took his talents to the radio industry, moving to New York City following his military discharge to learn the trade at the School of Radio Technique. He eventually switched gears and decided to pursue acting, enrolling at the Pasadena Playhouse in Southern California, where he was deemed least likely to succeed.",
      "In time, Hackman left Pasadena and moved back to New York, where he roomed with fellow striving thespians Dustin Hoffman and Robert Duvall. George Morrison, a former instructor at the famed Lee Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute, took Hackman under his wing and schooled him in the Method technique, teaching him to draw from personal experiences in his acting.",
      "Hackman started to get gigs in theater and on various television shows, such as the first episode of the CBS courtroom drama \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d and in 1964 he landed his first meaty movie part alongside Warren Beatty and Jean Seberg in the psychological drama \u201cLilith.\u201d",
      "Beatty and Hackman teamed up again for Hackman\u2019s breakout role in \u201cBonnie & Clyde,\u201d a shockingly violent crime drama that mixed classic outlaw archetypes with the energy of the French New Wave and the puckish spirit of the American counterculture. Hackman brought unexpected pathos to the part of Buck, the older brother of Beatty\u2019s bank robber Clyde Barrow.",
      "Hackman picked up more film work in the late 1960s, including as a quietly intense Olympic coach in \u201cDownhill Racer.\u201d But with \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d Hackman catapulted to new heights of fame and acclaim. In the role of vulgar, bigoted New York City narcotics cop Jimmy \u201cPopeye\u201d Doyle, Hackman delivered a masterclass in sheer live-wire energy.",
      "\u201cThe French Connection\u201d sped to five Oscars, including best picture and best actor for Hackman. The thriller propelled Hackman to memorable turns in \u201cThe Poseidon Adventure,\u201d \u201cScarecrow,\u201d a 1975 \u201cFrench Connection\u201d sequel, \u201cNight Moves,\u201d \u201cA Bridge Too Far\u201d and the blockbuster \u201cSuperman.\u201d",
      "Hackman\u2019s portrayal of obsessive surveillance expert Harry Caul in \u201cThe Conversation\u201d was a highlight of his 1970s filmography. Hackman, tamping down the volcanic anger that fueled \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d created an introverted character ravaged by paranoia and suspicion. The film and Hackman\u2019s tragic performance brilliantly captured the unease of the Watergate era.",
      "He entered one of the busiest stretches of his career in the 1980s, taking on a combination of leading roles and supporting parts in various dramas, action flicks and romances. He played a magazine editor in Beatty\u2019s epic \u201cReds,\u201d a small-town basketball coach in \u201cHoosiers\u201d and the secretary of defense in the noirish political thriller \u201cNo Way Out.\u201d",
      "Hackman capped his busy 1980s run with \u201cMississippi Burning,\u201d playing an FBI agent, a role based on real-life investigator John Proctor, who was looking into the mysterious disappearances of three civil rights volunteers in a fictional Mississippi county. Hackman was praised for his acting but the movie was fiercely criticized for appearing to whitewash history and marginalize Black characters.",
      "\u201cUnforgiven,\u201d released in 1992, brought Hackman some of the best notices of his career. The movie picked up four Oscars, including the best picture prize and best supporting actor for Hackman, and six years later the film earned a spot on the American Film Institute\u2019s list of the 100 best American movies ever made.",
      "In the 1990s, Hackman continued to work at a steady clip and frequently played a grizzled foil to younger stars, including Tom Cruise in \u201cThe Firm,\u201d Denzel Washington in \u201cCrimson Tide,\u201d Robin Williams in \u201cThe Birdcage\u201d and Will Smith in \u201cEnemy of the State,\u201d a frenetic surveillance thriller that paid homage to \u201cThe Conversation.\u201d",
      "Hackman endeared himself to a new generation of moviegoers as the deeply flawed but rakishly charming family patriarch in Wes Anderson\u2019s 2001 ensemble film \u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums,\u201d showing off his comedic chops and a more mischievous side of his public persona.",
      "Three years later, Hackman left Hollywood behind, making his final film appearance in the largely forgotten Ray Romano vehicle \u201cWelcome to Mooseport.\u201d In a rare 2004 interview, Hackman told Larry King that he did not have any film projects in the pipeline and expected that his screen acting days were mostly behind him.",
      "He remained creative even in retirement, however, writing four historical fiction novels \u2014 \u201cWake of the Perdido Star,\u201d \u201cJustice for None,\u201d \u201cEscape From Andersonville: A Novel of the Civil War\u201d and \u201cPayback at Morning Peak: A Novel of the American West\u201d \u2014 as well as the 2013 police thriller \u201cPursuit.\u201d",

      "An effort to encourage U.S. consumers to participate in a day of protest by not spending money Friday has picked up momentum online, with thousands of people across social media saying they plan to take part in the \u201ceconomic blackout.\u201d",
      "Started roughly a month ago by John Schwarz, a Chicago-area meditation and mindfulness educator, the idea has taken off on social media, where searches for the term surface hundreds of posts of people sharing screenshots of infographics and encouraging others to participate in the protest. Google\u2019s search data shows queries for \u201ceconomic blackout\u201d have surged in recent days.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t buy stuff on February 28,\u201d author Stephen King posted on Bluesky. \u201cMoney\u2019s the only thing these d---- understand.\u201d",
      "Actors John Leguizamo and Bette Midler have shared similar sentiments in recent days to their social media accounts.",
      "The call to action, or inaction in this case, comes as the prices of essentials such as groceries continue to rise, the housing market remains frozen and U.S. credit card debt has reached a record high. Adding to those woes, a closely followed consumer confidence report recently logged its sharpest decline since August 2021.",
      "Schwarz, who didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, also recently created a website for the protest effort \u2014 The People\u2019s Union USA \u2014 to essentially unionize working-class people across the country.",
      "In several videos posted online, Schwarz has said his campaign is a nonpartisan attempt at economic resistance against corporate greed, political corruption and economic exploitation.",
      "As part of the protest effort, Schwarz is asking shoppers to halt all nonessential purchases online and in stores. If people must spend, he said, they should funnel their dollars to only small and local businesses. He is also urging people to take the day off from work if possible.",
      "Since he began promoting the idea of a 24-hour economic blackout, Schwarz has gained hundreds of thousands of new followers across TikTok and Instagram, according to the social media analytics website Social Blade.",
      "\u201cThis is not just a protest. This is our warning shot. For too long, corporations have treated the American people like an endless source of profit,\u201d Schwarz said in a video Monday. \u201cThey raise prices because they can. They pay workers the bare minimum while raking in record profits. They also lobby politicians to keep the system rigged in their favor. But what is it they fear the most? It\u2019s us.\u201d",
      "Economic analyst Mark Hamrick said he has observed a growing public awareness of wealth and income inequality, driven by what he called \u201cthe financialization of the economy, where essentially the interests of shareholders are prioritized over the interests of stakeholders.\u201d",
      "Still, retail analyst Neil Saunders said translating online traction into action could prove difficult.",
      "\u201cIt may gain enough support to have a small impact on the day itself, but in the scheme of all the spending that goes on in the US economy it\u2019s unlikely that it will create a huge hole,\u201d Saunders wrote in an email, adding that many consumers will most likely only defer their spending to the following day.",
      "After the initial 24-hour blackout, The People\u2019s Union has scheduled additional weeklong boycotts of specific companies throughout the year, targeting Amazon, Nestl\u00e9, Walmart, General Mills, Target and McDonald\u2019s. Another general 24-hour economic blackout is also scheduled for April 18.",
      "Representatives for Amazon, Nestl\u00e9, Walmart, General Mills, Target and McDonald\u2019s didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.",
      "The online movement has echoes of the Occupy Wall Street movement that broke out in 2011, a culmination of public discontent and distrust in corporations after the 2008 economic recession. The scheduled inaction, however, is a contrast to the Occupy movement, which had protesters flooding the streets for months to mobilize against economic inequality and corporate corruption.",
      "Schwarz\u2019s campaign insists it isn\u2019t political, and it doesn\u2019t explicitly mention widespread cuts to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives \u2014 which have ramped up in the wake of rhetoric from conservative pundits and recent directives from the Trump administration. Still,\u00a0many online have called for the more targeted boycott of brands that have slashed their DEI efforts.",
      "Several political organizations have added their support to Friday\u2019s planned blackout, specifically citing the rollback of DEI initiatives. (Such initiatives, which typically include policies geared toward ensuring fair treatment of people from different backgrounds, have become a cultural flashpoint as the Trump administration describes them as \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d and anti-merit.)",
      "\u201cWe encourage members to avoid buying anything that day unless it\u2019s from a small, local business,\u201d the Colorado League of Women Voters said on Instagram. \u201cEspecially avoid large companies that are rolling back or eliminating their DEI programs, including Target, Walmart, McDonald\u2019s and Amazon.\u201d",
      "Major companies such as Walmart, Lowe\u2019s, Ford and Toyota were among the first to dial back their DEI programs late last year, particularly after social media-driven campaigns by influencers like Robby Starbuck, who reported last week that PepsiCo was one of the latest to follow suit.",
      "Companies across the country had pledged sweeping support for diversity efforts after the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in 2020 initiated a national social justice movement. But President Donald Trump has issued a slew of executive orders against DEI in his first weeks in office, some of which have faced legal hurdles as civil rights organizations sued and a federal judge blocked his administration from terminating DEI-related grants.",
      "Last month, Target also said it will end its three-year DEI goals, stop reports to external diversity-focused groups like the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Corporate Equality Index and end a program focused on carrying more products from Black- or other minority-owned businesses.",
      "The move drew immediate calls for a boycott as shoppers urged one another to switch to Costco, which is among the companies that have expressed intentions to continue their diversity efforts. The comments on Target\u2019s latest social media videos have been filled with mentions of Costco as users reply that they\u2019re \u201c[w]atching this while eating a Costco hot dog\u201d or that they\u2019d \u201crather shop at Costco!\u201d",
      "The boycott Friday coincides with the ongoing \u201cLatino Freeze\u201d movement, which similarly describes itself as a nonpartisan grassroots effort \u201cadvocating that everyday purchases be made with American businesses that support the Latino community.\u201d Its website describes it as a response to the erosion of DEI efforts in a variety of industries, as well as the \u201cgrowing fear and marginalization of our immigrant communities\u201d as the Trump administration cracks down on immigration.",
      "The Latino Freeze campaign urges people to shop only for essentials and avoid major purchases while supporting local businesses or businesses that support DEI and immigrant communities. It provides lists of major retailers that have demonstrated commitments to DEI, as well as lists of those that have scaled back on such initiatives.",
      "\u201cWe encourage all consumers to explore the information provided and make their own informed decisions about which companies align with their values and priorities,\u201d the movement says on its website. \u201cThe choice to support or engage with any company is entirely up to the individual consumer.\u201d",
      "Hamrick, the economic analyst, said any visible impact from large-scale boycott campaigns would most likely require more consistency \u2014 which is difficult to achieve when many people in the United States depend on chain corporations for their daily purchases.",
      "\u201cIf there were more substantial and sustained movement toward buying local, targeting privately owned businesses, that could gain some momentum,\u201d Hamrick said. \u201cOne of the challenges is there aren\u2019t many choices out there. In other words, how many entities can you do business with that fit this description over a long period of time? And the answer is there aren\u2019t many.\u201d"

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/seven-planets-share-sky-parade-ends-soon-rcna193630",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 23:26:09 GMT",
    "summary": "The seven other planets in our solar system can be seen in the sky at once through Friday, forming a planet parade. But two require a telescope to view.",
    "story": [
      "As February draws to a close, skywatchers have their final chance to see the \u201cplanet parade\u201d that has been lighting up the night sky.",
      "While the celestial spectacle, in which all seven planets in our solar system apart from Earth can be seen at once, has been on display for most of the week, Friday is expected to offer the best chance for skywatchers worldwide. That\u2019s because Mercury, which did not appear above the horizon until late this month, will be at its highest point above the horizon.",
      "After Friday, Mercury and Saturn will likely appear too faint and too low on the horizon for most people to see.",
      "Including those two planets, it should be possible to spot five of the seven planets with the naked eye if conditions are right. Viewing Uranus and Neptune, however, will require a telescope.",
      "Planetary parades occur when multiple planets appear at the same time, spread across the sky in a kind of arc. They\u2019re not uncommon, though it\u2019s rare for all seven planets to be visible at the same time. In August, four planets will be visible before sunrise, but it won\u2019t be until October 2028 that five will again be visible at once, according to NASA.",
      "To see the planets in the sky this week, it\u2019s best to find a spot with minimal light pollution on a clear night.",
      "Saturn will appear close to the horizon (it has become more difficult to see over the course of the month as it sinks lower in the sky). Mercury has gotten farther from the sun in recent weeks, making it easier to spot. It can be found low in the western sky after sunset, near Saturn.",
      "Venus, too, is in the western part of the sky and usually the easiest of the planets to find, as it tends to be the brightest.",
      "Jupiter can be seen at dusk, high overhead in the south, according to NASA. Mars, meanwhile, will be in the eastern sky and the last planet to set before sunrise.",
      "Michael Shanahan, planetarium director at the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey, recommended looking for Mercury and Saturn soon after sunset, near where the sun went down \u2014\u00a0ideally with binoculars.",
      "Then, once it gets a little darker, he said, \u201cyou can still get a great view of Venus as this incredibly bright dot over in the western sky. High overhead, you can see Jupiter, which is like Venus, brighter than any star in the sky. And then, sort of more towards the east, the planet Mars is still pretty bright right now.\u201d",
      "Shanahan added that even beyond Friday, people will still be able to witness what he referred to as a \u201cballet of the planets against the starry background.\u201d",
      "\u201cAround the 10th of March, Venus is going to be too low to see. Right now, Venus is this blazing bright dot like an airplane,\u201d he said.",
      "Planetary parades occur because the planets orbit the sun on a relatively flat, disk-shaped plane. Each moves at its own pace along this metaphorical racetrack: Mercury completes an orbit in 88 days, Venus takes 225 days, and Saturn needs more than 29 years to circle the sun.",
      "When multiple planets end up on the same side of the track, they appear to us to like cars at different points along a straightaway, Jackie Faherty, an astronomer and senior research scientist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, told NBC News earlier this month."

    "story": [
      "A much-ballyhooed release of documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case devolved into anger and disappointment Thursday, with conservative figures and even Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging FBI agents were hiding the full case files.",
      "Epstein, a New York City financier whose social circle included presidents and other rich and powerful figures, died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019 after he was charged with running a sex trafficking ring involving minors.",
      "His case has long been an obsession of those who are convinced that the names of prominent figures involved in his sex trafficking network have been kept secret. Conspiracy theorists have also speculated without real evidence that Epstein didn\u2019t die by suicide but was in fact killed in his jail cell to prevent names from leaking out.",
      "Thousands of law enforcement files have been released over the years\u00a0with no such smoking gun revelations. (Some have been redacted or sealed to protect victims and because of ongoing civil and criminal litigation.) The content that was ultimately released Thursday appears to have already been public. Most of the material was exhibits used in the trial of an Epstein associate.",
      "But people on the right pushed the new Trump administration for the latest release. And leading up to it, there was discussion in right-wing social media circles suggesting that this time, with President Donald Trump back in office, would be different.",
      "Then, Thursday, a handful of right-wing media figures were photographed leaving the White House holding binders labeled \u201cThe Epstein Files: Phase 1.\" The figures included Jack Posobiec, who helped spread the false \u201cPizzagate\u201d conspiracy theory about Democrats\u2019 operating a satanic child abuse ring out of a Washington pizzeria that led to a shooting at the restaurant.",
      "Some went on to cheer the release of the files on their social media accounts. But almost immediately some of them started downplaying what was in the documents.",
      "Later Thursday, a letter from Bondi to FBI Director Kash Patel was made public. In it, she said she had learned \u201cfrom a source\u201d that the FBI field office in New York had \u201cthousands of\u201d Epstein-related documents that were never disclosed to her.",
      "Instead, Bondi wrote, she had received only 200 pages of documents. She went on to demand that the \u201cfull and complete Epstein files\u201d be delivered to her office by 8 a.m. Friday.",
      "\u201cThere will be no withholdings or limitations to my or your access,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Bondi acknowledged, though, that some information couldn\u2019t be released to protect the identities of the victims. \u201cThe Department of Justice will ensure that any public disclosure of these files will be done in a manner to protect the privacy of victims and in accordance with the law,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Two senior Justice Department officials who asked to remain anonymous because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak on the record told NBC News that there would be very little new information in any release, given how much has already been made public.",
      "One of the senior Justice Department officials said they perceived the purpose and the timing of the release of the Epstein documents by Bondi as \u201ca distraction\u201d from other matters.",
      "Conservative figures and conspiracy theorists, including some of those who\u2019d received the binder, quickly took to social media alleging a cover-up that had kept the revelations they believe must exist out of the binder.",
      "Liz Wheeler, one of the right-wing media figures who was at the White House and got the binder, said on X: \"Be outraged that the binder is boring. You should be. Because the evil deep state LIED TO YOUR FACE.\"",
      "Radio host Glenn Beck wrote: \"Who is subverting POTUS? The #Epsteinfiles are a total joke. I know Kash, Pam B and The President. This is not the file.\"",
      "The MAGA influencer who goes by Catturd chimed in, \"Send these scumbag traitor agents to prison and throw away the key.\"",
      "Epstein was found hanged in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City in August 2019, and the New York medical examiner has ruled his death a suicide, a conclusion supported by the Justice Department's inspector general. He had been arrested the previous month on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges brought by federal prosecutors in New York. He was facing up to 45 years in prison if he were convicted.",
      "The prosecutors in the case said Epstein, who was 66 when he died, sexually abused dozens of underage girls and young women at his properties in New York and Florida in the early 2000s. He was also accused of paying many of his victims to recruit others, allowing him to build a vast network of women to exploit.",
      "The charges came more than a decade after Epstein signed a\u00a0controversial non-prosecution deal in Florida in 2008. The once-secret agreement ended a federal sex crimes investigation against him and spared him the prospect of a long prison sentence. Alex Acosta, the U.S. attorney who approved the plea deal, was appointed labor secretary during Trump's first term. He resigned in July 2019 after the deal came under renewed scrutiny.",
      "Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution and served 13 months in the Palm Beach County jail in that case.",
      "His social circle once included a who's who of famous people, including Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton and Trump. All three have denied being involved in any criminal behavior.",
      "A\u00a0fund set up to compensate women\u00a0Epstein sexually abused closed down in 2021 after having paid out roughly $121 million to about 150 victims.",
      "The announcement provided the most comprehensive accounting to date of the number of women and young girls Epstein is alleged to have sexually assaulted."

But for routine primary care, she simply uses her iPhone.",
      "Soon that may no longer be possible. On March 31, Medicare telehealth \u201cflexibilities\u201d established during the Covid-19 pandemic are set to expire. Recent social media posts, including the one that alerted Peterson to the change, have prompted an outcry from beneficiaries and their families who rely on the service.",

      "Health advocates say the telemedicine options now at risk are particularly important for older adults who are homebound or, like Peterson, live in rural communities far from their doctors\u2019 offices.",
      "The current flexibilities were enacted when Congress waived restrictions in March 2020 under President Donald Trump and were extended several times under President Joe Biden.",
      "If Congress doesn\u2019t act, on April 1, the previous rules will largely be restored, which means most telehealth appointments will be covered only if they\u2019re provided in person at rural medical facilities."

    "summary": "The FDA\u2019s abrupt decision to cancel next month\u2019s vaccine advisory committee meeting is raising concerns about whether the U.S. will have enough of the vaccine for the next flu season.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s abrupt decision on Wednesday to cancel next month\u2019s vaccine advisory committee meeting \u2014 where experts recommend the strains for next season\u2019s flu shot \u2014 is raising concerns about whether the U.S. will have enough of the vaccine for the next flu season.",
      "Drugmakers already face a tight deadline each year to produce enough doses for distribution in the fall.",
      "The federal government typically places preorders for the vaccines in January and February, which appears to have been placed as usual. But drugmakers can\u2019t actually start making the doses until the FDA selects the strains. Shots are usually available by the end of July or early August, said Litjen Tan, co-chair of the flu shot advocacy group the National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit.",
      "The advisory committee meeting plays a key role, Tan said, because the flu virus is constantly evolving, requiring updates to the vaccine to provide the best protection. This year\u2019s FDA flu meeting was scheduled for March 13, with a final decision from the agency on the strain expected shortly after.",
      "Tan said that depending on the vaccine technology used, manufacturers can wait until late March for input from the FDA on strain selection to produce enough doses for the fall \u2014 but no longer.",
      "\u201cIf the strain selection happens much later than now, it\u2019s going to be really, really tight, but the manufacturers will scramble and can make it happen,\u201d Tan said. \u201cIf the delay is any longer than late March, it\u2019s going to put manufacturers into a huge bind.\u201d",
      "The cancelation of the meeting comes amid a particularly bad flu season this year, with as many as 910,000 hospitalizations so far, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At least 86 children and 19,000 adults have died.",
      "In a statement, Andrew Nixon, a senior spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, said the agency will \u201cmake public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season.\u201d",
      "Nixon didn\u2019t answer questions about why the meeting was cancelled or whether the agency would seek input from its outside advisory committee.",
      "Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, who has advised the FDA on vaccines, said that if the agency decides not to seek input from its committee, it won\u2019t be entirely in the dark.",
      "On Friday, a World Health Organization advisory committee is convening to decide which strains should be included in next season\u2019s flu vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere.",
      "That meeting usually guides the FDA\u2019s strain selection, Levy said.",
      "\u201cFDA has the authority to advance flu vaccines without convening the VRBPAC committee,\u201d he said.",
      "It\u2019s unclear, however, whether drugmakers can begin producing doses for the U.S. based on the WHO\u2019s recommendation or if they must wait for the FDA\u2019s guidance.",
      "It also remains to be seen whether the FDA will reschedule its advisory committee meeting or forgo input on the flu strains from its expert panel altogether \u2014 which would be a first for the agency, according to Tan. Typically, the agency must provide two weeks\u2019 notice of a meeting to allow for a public comment period, meaning any advisory committee meeting likely wouldn\u2019t happen until mid-March at the latest.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, a committee member and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said agency officials offered no explanation for the canceled meeting, nor did they indicate whether it would be rescheduled.",
      "\u201cWhat worries me about this, I think it\u2019s part of the bigger picture, which is this sort of dissolution of public health infrastructure, that we don\u2019t need experts anymore,\u201d said Offit, who helped develop a vaccine for rotavirus that was later sold to drugmaker Merck. \u201cWe don\u2019t need experts advising us at the CDC, we don\u2019t need experts advising us from the FDA. We\u2019ll just figure it out ourselves.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, federal health officials also abruptly postponed a CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting.",
      "Asked whether he\u2019s concerned about next season\u2019s flu shot supply, Offit said, \u201cI think we\u2019ll have a flu vaccine this year, although I guess I shouldn\u2019t say anything because everything seems unimaginable, and yet it still happens.\u201d",
      "The flu vaccine is recommended for everyone over 6 months old. Data so far show that this year\u2019s flu vaccine is 63% to 78% effective for preventing hospitalization in children and teens, and 41% to 55% effective for adults, the CDC reported Thursday.",
      "If drugmakers don\u2019t have enough time to produce the vaccines because of the canceled meeting, \u201cmany lives that could be saved by vaccination will be lost,\u201d said Dr. Tin Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.",
      "\u201cThis decision \u2014 and other federal efforts to undermine well-established science about vaccine safety \u2014 puts everyone at risk, especially when we are currently experiencing the worst U.S. flu season in more than a decade,\u201d Tin Tan said.",
      "Flu vaccine manufacturers are still preparing for next year\u2019s flu season.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for Sanofi said it has \u201calready begun production for the 2025-2026 flu season in the Northern Hemisphere and will be ready to support final strain selections in time for the season.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for GSK, another flu vaccine manufacturer, said it\u2019s aware of the canceled meeting and is continuing to work with the FDA on its flu strain recommendation."

      "In other cases, medications prescribed after surgery may generate high levels of potassium in the blood, causing irregular heartbeats, said Dr. Elliot Tapper, an associate professor of hepatology at the University of Michigan.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the most involved surgeries that can be done,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are sick afterwards. They\u2019re usually weak or they\u2019ve had an infection or some minor complication, and they\u2019ll need somebody to help them with their activities of daily living.\u201d",
      "Transplants are typically reserved for people whose livers have sustained irreversible damage, leaving them no other options. Around 10,000 people receive liver transplants annually in the U.S., and 24,000 are on a waiting list at any given time.",
      "The reasons Trachtenberg received the transplant are not known. Nationwide, alcohol-related liver disease is the most common reason for a liver transplant \u2014 around 41% of recipients in 2023 had alcohol-related liver disease as their primary diagnosis. Fatty liver disease, a condition linked to obesity and diabetes that is characterized by fat buildup in the liver, made up the second largest share: 20%.",
      "Other, less common reasons for a transplant include liver cancer, viral hepatitis and autoimmune conditions.",
      "In recent years, some fans of Trachtenberg \u2014\u00a0who is best known for her roles on \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d and \u201cGossip Girl\u201d \u2014\u00a0had remarked on social media that she looked ill and had lost weight. But more than a year ago, Trachtenberg responded to comments on her Instagram page about her appearance, telling people she was \u201chappy and healthy.\u201d",
      "The doctors interviewed said that rates of both fatty liver disease and alcohol-related liver disease are rising among young adults, though the conditions can affect people of all ages.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely seen increases in alcohol-related liver disease and need for liver transplant in patients in the 20s to 30s range, particularly that 30s range,\u201d Brandman said.",
      "Tapper said the issue can largely be attributed to lifestyle factors.",
      "\u201cThe nation\u2019s livers are not as healthy as they used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s more fat in the liver because of diet, obesity and the epidemic of diabetes. People binge-drinking is more common in younger generations than it ever had been before.\u201d",
      "People who require liver transplants typically have cirrhosis, a condition in which healthy tissue in the liver is replaced with scar tissue caused by swelling and inflammation. This scarring prevents the liver from carrying out vital tasks like filtering toxins from the blood and helping the body digest food and convert it into energy.",
      "Those who have reached this point, known as end-stage liver disease, may experience confusion, weight loss and yellow discoloration in the skin and eyes, among other symptoms.",
      "Most transplanted livers come from deceased donors, but a minority of patients have part of their liver replaced with a section from a living, healthy person.",
      "Transplant recipients usually need to take lifelong medication to prevent their bodies from attacking the donor organ \u2014 what\u2019s known as \u201crejection.\u201d The risk of rejection is highest within the first six months.",
      "\u201cWe pick up rejection by looking at liver enzymes in the blood, and then we have a protocol to treat that before it becomes a serious problem,\u201d Tapper said. \u201cSo rejection that you can\u2019t get ahead of is actually super rare.\u201d",
      "Dr. Brian Lee, a hepatologist and liver transplant specialist with Keck Medicine of USC, a medical system affiliated with the University of Southern California, said transplant outcomes could be improved if more doctors referred patients earlier in the course of their disease.",
      "\u201cThere are so many patients who die from liver disease because they weren\u2019t referred at all, or they weren\u2019t referred early enough for a liver transplant,\u201d he said.",
      "Tapper said it\u2019s also important to reduce risk factors that lead to liver disease in the first place, such as excessive alcohol use, high sugar intake and limited physical activity.",
      "\u201cI would rather people not need a liver transplant,\u201d he said."

      "Billy Horschel went face-to-face with an alligator in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. After the reptile interrupted his game, Horschel grabbed a 60-degree wedge to poke it in its shoulder and then guided it back into the water, according to video shared on social media by Paul Hodowanic, a staff writer for PGATOUR.com.",
      "\"That's a gator getting a gator,\" someone can be heard saying in the background of the video. Horschel played college golf for the University of Florida Gators.",
      "Horschel had just finished the sixth hole at the PGA National, he said in video posted by Hodowanic.",
      "Horschel was on his way to the seventh hole when he saw the alligator making its way across the green. A nearby officer tried to shoo the alligator away but wasn't having any luck.",
      "Horschel knew the options: He could have either waited for someone to grab a rake at hole eight and come back to take on the gator, or he, only about 30 yards away, could have grabbed a club himself to try to push the animal away.",
      "So Horschel grabbed the club, knowing that the officer needed help and that the gator \"was going nowhere good,\" Horschel said.",
      "\"I mean, I'm not afraid of gators,\" Horschel said. \"Listen, as I tell most people, I said they're more afraid of you. The majority of the time, they're only going to come after you during mating season where they're a little aggressive and then if you're around their nest when they've got some eggs.\"",
      "Maybe Horschel wasn't afraid of the gator, but he was fearful for his club. He said he picked up the 60-degree wedge because he knew he had two extras in his locker.",

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Hamas is willing to cede political power and administrative governance of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian unity government, but would not disarm unless an independent Palestinian state is achieved, Basem Naim, a senior political official for Hamas, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWe are ready today, if not yesterday, to step back from governance to hand it over to a body, a government, a committee, that is ready to run the Gaza Strip,\u201d Naim said.",
      "Naim made his comments during a critical impasse: The first phase of a tenuous deal between Hamas and Israel is set to end on Saturday, and no arrangements have been made for continuing the ceasefire.",
      "While there have been few publicly acknowledged negotiations to extend the truce into a second phase, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said it will soon send a diplomatic delegation to Cairo to continue talks.",
      "Naim said that beyond that public announcement, Hamas had not been officially notified of Israel's intention to resume negotiations.",
      "It was unclear whether Israeli officials would seek to extend the first phase of the agreement or negotiate terms for a second phase, which could ultimately lead to a more permanent ceasefire and the eventual withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip.",
      "Naim said Israel was deliberately delaying further negotiations to create a pretext for returning to war against Hamas.",
      "\u201cWe believe that this is intentionally done to escalate the situation or to push the second-phase negotiations under the threat to return back to war and not to withdraw from the Gaza Strip,\u201d he said.",
      "Israeli troops are supposed to start withdrawing from the Gaza-Egypt border area on Saturday, marking the end of the ceasefire's first phase. However, Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen told public broadcaster Kan on Thursday that Israel has demanded that their military stay in the Philadelphi Corridor, which runs along Gaza\u2019s southern border with Egypt.",
      "The last step of the agreement\u2019s six-week first phase came overnight, when Israel released more than 600 Palestinian prisoners after Hamas handed over the corpses of four Israeli hostages killed during captivity in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Under the ceasefire\u2019s terms \u2014 which were reached with help from intermediaries Qatar and Egypt in late January, after more than a year of fraught negotiations \u2014 talks on the second stage should have begun weeks ago.",
      "But rather than returning to the negotiating table, each side has repeatedly accused the other of violating the agreement\u2019s terms. Several of the weekly exchanges of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners have been dogged by last-minute accusations and near-cancellations.",
      "Hamas has stated before that it is willing to cede governance of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body, and Israel has made clear that any plan for Gaza\u2019s \u201cday after\u201d should not include Hamas, which led the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on southern Israel. On that day, about 1,200 people were killed and 250 were kidnapped, according to local officials, sparking Israel's 15-month war on Gaza that has killed at least 48,300 people, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, and destroyed much of the enclave.",
      "The thorniest question standing in the way of negotiating the second phase of an agreement remains whether Hamas will disarm. Netanyahu has declared Hamas\u2019 destruction as the primary goal of Israel\u2019s war in the Gaza Strip \u2014 sometimes, his critics have said, superseding the freedom and welfare of the Israeli hostages still being held there.",
      "Though he reiterated Hamas\u2019 offer to integrate into a Palestinian unity government, Basem Naim said the group would only disarm and transform into a purely political party if Palestinians are granted an independent political state \u2014 a condition that Netanyahu and his right-wing allies in government have repeatedly rejected.",
      "\u201cThese are two different tracks. The arms are related to the existence or the presence of the occupation,\u201d he said, referring to Israel's ongoing presence in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem.",
      "If an independent Palestinian state is created, Naim said, \u201cwe are ready again to become a political party and to integrate our fighters into a Palestinian national army.\u201d",
      "Israeli military leaders have repeatedly made clear that they are prepared to return to war if the agreement collapses, going so far as to call up reservists for renewed fighting.",
      "Though Hamas remains committed to the ceasefire agreement, Naim said, the group is also preparing for renewed fighting.",
      "\u201cIf they decide to escalate and to return back to war, we are preparing ourselves for all options,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no choice other than to defend ourselves, as we have done already along the 15 months.\u201d"

    "summary": "Mexico has sent 29 drug cartel figures, including drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who was behind the killing of a U.S. DEA agent in 1985, to the United States as the Trump administration turns up the pressure on drug trafficking organizations.",
    "story": [
      "More than two dozen drug cartel suspects from Mexico \u2014\u00a0including the man charged in the 1985 slaying of a U.S. drug agent \u2014\u00a0are in U.S. custody after Mexican officials agreed to send them to the United States, four sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.",
      "The 29 people accused of violence and drug trafficking were deported as the Trump administration has turned up pressure on Mexico to curb illegal immigration, cartel activity and fentanyl production with a promised 25% tariff on all Mexican imports set to start next week.",
      "\u201cFor those of us who have investigated Mexican cartels for many generations, this is truly an historical moment,\" said Ray Donovan, the former chief of operations at the Drug Enforcement Administration. \"We have never seen this many sent from Mexico to the U.S. in one day.\u201d",
      "Among those deported by Mexico is Rafael Caro Quintero, who U.S. officials believe is responsible for the 1985 murder of DEA agent Enrique \u201cKiki\u201d Camarena and others.",
      "Caro Quintero has been on the DEA's most-wanted fugitives list for four decades. \"Today we can proudly say he has arrived in the United States where justice will be served,\u201d acting DEA Administrator Derek S. Maltz said.",
      "The suspects sent to the United States included members of five of the six Mexican\u00a0organized crime groups the Trump administration designated this month as \u201cforeign terrorist organizations.\u201d",
      "Those sent to the United States on Thursday were taken from prisons across Mexico to board planes at an airport north of Mexico City that took them to eight U.S. cities, according to the Mexican government.",
      "Among them were two leaders of the now-defunct\u00a0Los Zetas cartel, Mexicans Miguel Trevi\u00f1o Morales and his brother Omar Trevi\u00f1o Morales, known as Z-40 and Z-42. U.S. authorities have accused the brothers of running the successor Northeast Cartel from prison.",
      "The removal of the Trevi\u00f1o Morales brothers marks the end of a long process that began after the capture in 2013 of Miguel and two years later of his brother Omar. Mexican Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero had described the delay as \u201ctruly shameful.\u201d",
      "A who\u2019s who of Mexican cartels",
      "Besides Caro Quintero, there were cartel leaders, security chiefs from both factions of the Sinaloa cartel, cartel finance operatives and a man wanted in connection with the\u00a0killing of a North Carolina sheriff\u2019s deputy\u00a0in 2022.",
      "Vicente Carrillo Fuentes was among those turned over to the United States. He is a former leader of the Ju\u00e1rez drug cartel, based in the border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, across from El Paso, Texas, and brother of drug lord Amado Carrillo Fuentes, known as \u201cthe Lord of the Skies,\u201d who died in a botched plastic surgery procedure in 1997.",
      "According to prosecutors in both countries, the prisoners sent to the United States on Thursday faced charges related to drug trafficking and in some cases homicide, among other crimes.",
      "\u201cWe will prosecute these criminals to the fullest extent of the law in honor of the brave law enforcement agents who have dedicated their careers \u2014 and in some cases, given their lives \u2014 to protect innocent people from the scourge of violent cartels,\u201d U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.",
      "The deportation of the drug cartel figures coincided with a visit to Washington by Mexican Foreign Affairs Secretary Juan Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente and other top economic and military officials, who met with their U.S. counterparts, including\u00a0Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "In exchange for delaying tariffs, President Donald Trump had insisted that Mexico crack down on cartels, illegal immigration and fentanyl production, despite significant dips in migration and overdoses over the past year.",
      "A longtime DEA target",
      "Mexico\u2019s surprise handover of one of the FBI\u2019s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives was weeks in the making.",
      "Caro Quintero had walked free in 2013 after 28 years in prison when a court overturned his 40-year sentence for the kidnapping and killing of Camarena, the DEA agent, in 1985. The brutal murder marked a low point in U.S.-Mexico relations.",
      "Caro Quintero, the former leader of the Guadalajara cartel, had since returned to drug trafficking and unleashed bloody turf battles in the northern Mexico border state of Sonora until\u00a0Mexican forces arrested him in 2022.",
      "The United States had sought Caro Quintero\u2019s extradition shortly after he was arrested in 2022. But the request remained stuck at Mexico\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry for unknown reasons as President Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s predecessor and political mentor,\u00a0Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, severely curtailed Mexican cooperation with the DEA to protest undercover U.S. law enforcement operations in Mexico targeting senior political and military officials.",
      "\u201cThis moment is extremely personal for the men and women of DEA,\u201d said Maltz, the acting head of the DEA.",
      "Cartels could respond",
      "Mexican security analyst David Saucedo said that since negotiations with the Trump administration began, he had expected the U.S. government to demand three things: an increase in drug seizures, arrests of high-profile drug trafficking suspects and the handing over of drug traffickers the United States has long targeted for extradition.",
      "He called Thursday\u2019s removals \u201can important concession\u201d by Mexico\u2019s government.",
      "The decision also threatens to upend an unwritten understanding \u2014\u00a0with notable exceptions\u00a0\u2014 that Mexican drug lords would serve sentences in Mexican prisons, where they were often able continue to run their illicit businesses, Saucedo said.",
      "\u201cThere will surely be a furious reaction by drug trafficking groups against the Mexican state,\u201d he said."

      "The deputies suspected \"the heater could have fallen in the event the female abruptly fell to the ground.\"",

      "When the current season premiered on Peacock Jan. 9, it introduced fans to the initial 21 cast members tasked with adding as much money to the prize pot while avoiding being banished or murdered by their fellow contestants. Among the cast, which TODAY exclusively announced in June, were \u201cBig Brother\u201d legends Danielle Reyes and Britney Haynes, deceptive \u201cSurvivor\u201d winners Tony Vlachos and Jeremy Collins and reality television favorites Chrishell Stause and Gabby Windey.",

      "\u2018The Traitors\u2019 Season 3 eliminated contestants",
      "Dorinda Medley",
      "Dorinda Medley made a costly mistake in Episode 1 when she decided to sacrifice her safety in the mission to help the team complete the task. After her selfless act was unappreciated by the rest of the cast, The \u201cReal Housewives of New York City\u201d star bickered with British royal Lord Ivar Mountbatten and a few others, placing a target on her back. The Traitors pounced on the opportunity and decided to make her their first victim, killing her off in Episode 2.",
      "Wells Adams",
      "During Episode 2, at the first roundtable of Season 3, Wells Adams had the tables turned on him. He initially planned to call out \u201cThe Real Housewives of Potomac\u201d star Robyn Dixon as a potential Traitor following an awkward interaction between them earlier. But, she proved to be more convincing and reflected the spotlight onto him instead. \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d alum was banished after receiving a majority of the votes. Before he left, he revealed that he was a Faithful.",
      "Chanel Ayan",
      "Chanel Ayan seemed, admittedly, unprepared for the duplicity she would face on \u201cThe Traitors.\u201d Like Dorinda, she erroneously chose to get off the boat in Episode 1. Then, she struggled after Wells\u2019 elimination as he was one of her closest friends and allies in the house. In Episode 3, the Traitors decided to murder another housewife to create more confusion in the castle. As \u201cThe Real Housewives of Dubai\u201d star learned her fate, she became emotional and questioned how the Traitors could be so cruel.",
      "Tony Vlachos",
      "Tony Vlachos, a two-time \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner, had his stint on Season 3 cut short after placing his trust in the wrong people. During the third mission, Bob Harper called out Tony for not volunteering to go first and risk his safety. Tony didn\u2019t appreciate being put on blast and voiced his irritations during the car ride home. At the roundtable, Bob Harper learned Tony was upset with him and started to wonder if Tony was a Traitor. Although the \u201cSurvivor\u201d star tried to prove his innocence, a majority of the cast voted him out in Episode 3. Before departing, a hurt Tony confirmed he was a Faithful and labeled fellow \u201cSurvivor\u201d alum Rob Mariano a \u201csellout\u201d for turning on him.",
      "Jeremy Collins",
      "Episode 4 began with the conclusion of a special task for the Traitors. They were required to meet in a secret room in the castle and scribe three names, either Faithfuls or Traitors, onto a hidden parchment, shortlisting them for murder. The Traitors selected \"Survivor\" winner Jeremy Collins, \"Summer House\" star Ciara Miller and retired professional wrestler Nikki Garcia. Each person then had to lie down in a coffin and await their fate. Although Jeremy offered to work with the Traitors if he was spared, they chose to murder him since he correctly suspected \"Big Brother\" star Danielle Reyes was a Traitor. In his final confessional, Jeremy became emotional as he spoke about not bringing home the prize pot to his family.",
      "Bob the Drag Queen",
      "Bob the Drag Queen's devilishly cunning run on Season 3 was cut short in Episode 4 when his fellow Traitors, particularly Rob, turned on him. Bob had been vocal throughout the season, trying to cast suspicion onto others and throw his adversaries off his scent. But when he suggested the group question if the three newcomers \u2014 Rob, Wes and Derrick \u2014 were possible Traitors, Rob took it as an opportunity stab the \"RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\" winner in the back. Rob convinced the group to banish Bob, stunning him. After being voted out, Rob stood before the cast and proudly confirmed he had lied and was a Traitor.",
      "Robyn Dixon",
      "After a roaring roundtable that resulted in one of their own being exposed, the remaining Traitors plotted in Episode 5 to murder someone who would draw suspicion away from them. They debated back and forth, with one Traitor failing to be heard. Ultimately, they decided that murdering Robyn Dixon would add to the confusion permeating throughout the castle. When \"The Real Housewives of Potomac\" star learned she had been eliminated, she said, \"I knew it was coming because I am a threat to the Traitors.\" In her parting words, she advised the Traitors to \"work harder\" after losing Bob the Drag Queen.",
      "Nikki Garcia",
      "Nikki Garcia was living on borrowed time in the castle after the Traitors set up her inevitable downfall. After being selected as one of the three contestants to lie in the coffin in Episode 4, the rest of the contestants assumed that at least one cast member chosen was a Traitor. The former WWE star deflected suspicion at first, but in Episode 5, one of her closest allies, Chrishell Stause, started to doubt her. Chrishell voiced her concerns about Nikki during the roundtable, leading most of the group to vote her out. \"The win for me is that I do get to go home to my son. The loss for all of you is that I'm a Faithful,\" Nikki said as she left.",
      "Bob Harper",
      "As Episode 6 began, the trust between the Traitors was at an all time low.  They met in the turret and discussed their \"dysfunctional family\" before listing their targets. They settled on Bob Harper, who was vocal at the most recent roundtable about who the Faithfuls couldn't trust. The three remaining Traitors labeled him as \"the more imminent threat\" and agreed to murder him. When \"The Biggest Loser\" trainer didn't show up for breakfast the next morning, the cast, excluding the Traitors, were stunned. After Bob H. read his letter from the Traitors, he said, \"No f---ing way. I think the Traitors are playing a really ballsy game. They're very invincible right now because they are so hidden. I'm angry. I'm just angry over the train of thought of why I was murdered. I hate the Traitors.\"",
      "Wes Bergmann",
      "At the end of the Episode 6, Wes Bergmann planned to turn on Rob, but the \"Survivor\" winner beat him to it. Throughout the episode, Wes had been suggesting Rob's name to multiple people. When everyone arrived at the roundtable, Rob used Wes' scheming ways against him and pointed out that Wes pushed for Nikki to be banished. To defend himself, Wes warned that he would target anyone who voted against him. His tactic didn't work and pushed the Faithfuls in the opposite direction, making them vote to banish him. \"The Challenge\" star delivered one of his signature boastful speeches before he left, calling himself \"one of the greatest reality competition players of all time.\" He added, \"I don't care about any of you. You are all chess pieces on a board. And so to all those people that have died until I got to this circle right here, I have no idea who killed them because I'm a Faithful.\"",
      "Derrick Levasseur",
      "Derrick Levasseur took a chance during the roundtable in Episode 6 and voiced his theory about Rob being a traitor. The next episode, his boldness came back to bite him. When the Traitors met in secret at the beginning of Episode 7, they begrudgingly decided the \"Big Brother\" winner needed to go to help rebuild trust between them. As Derrick learned his fate, he was unsurprised. \"I knew that after I called out Rob directly last night, and he chose to instead go at Wes, that he was not going to give me another roundtable, which I guess I have to take as a compliment,\" Derrick said. He proudly added, \"I'm the most dangerous person in here for the Traitors, and they know it.\" He said he would have made the same move and that he was \"honored\" to have been a part of the season.",
      "Rob 'Boston Rob' Mariano",
      "Rob's smooth-talking and cunning ways could no longer save him by Episode 7. Before he departed, Derrick planted seeds to his fellow Faithfuls, cautioning them that Rob was a Traitor. At breakfast, Rob posed the theory that the Traitors had murdered Derrick to make the \"Survivor\" star look guilty. But \"Vanderpump Rules\" star Tom Sandoval was unconvinced and realized that it was the third time a Faithful was murdered after publicly going against Rob. So, Tom presented that evidence during the roundtable, hoping that others would jump on board. After everyone voted, Rob received a majority of votes \u2014 including two from his fellow Traitors \u2014 and was banished, ending his masterful run this season. \"First of all, I just want to tell all of you that I have really enjoyed meeting you and playing this game with you. I've had a ton of fun,\" he said during his final speech. \"I am, and always have been, from the very beginning, a Traitor.\"",
      "Chrishell Stause",
      "At the start of Episode 8, Chrishell Stause was one of the few remaining players that did not secure a shield in the previous mission. So, she had to dress to the nines and go to the chapel to learn if the Traitors decided to murder her. While the other vulnerable players turned around and saw Cumming waiting for them near the pews, Chrishell came face to face with the two remaining Traitors. The \"Selling Sunset\" star seemed slightly shocked as she discovered the Traitors' identities. They explained that she would've never been banished, so they needed to eliminate her. \"That's unfortunate,\" Chrishell simply said. In her final confessional interview, she said that all of the Faithfuls had been \"idiots\" and that one particular Traitor was \"playing the best game.\" She added, \"I wasn't ready to leave. But, if I must go, I appreciate the fabulous send off.\"",
      "Ciara Miller",
      "The remaining Faithfuls desperately searched for any evidence that could point them in the direction of a Traitor. Sam Asghari suggested that the group revisit the theory that one of the Traitors was in the coffins in Episode 3. With Jeremy murdered and Nikki banished, that left Ciara as the only possible option. At the round table in Episode 8, Ciara explained that her passionate speech after she was placed in the coffin was an example of her pleading for her life in the game. She also tried to cast doubt on two contestants. But, the other players did not trust her and all voted to banish the \"Summer House\" star. \"I don't really do speeches, but I'll always go down fighting. I'm never succumbing to anyone,\" she said during her final remarks. \"Even the Traitors, because I am a Faithful.\"",
      "Sam Asghari",
      "Episode 9 began with the remaining Traitors, once again, butting heads about the next murder. They ultimately agreed that murdering Sam would be the best move. They pointed out that he was improving at picking up on suspicious behavior and that other Faithfuls were starting to listen to him. When the actor learned his stint on the show was over, he was unsurprised. \"Alright, my time has come to an end,\" he said. \"I was sort of expecting this. I had some good ideas around the roundtable. I was getting good at it and the only way to get me out of the castle was to murder me.\" He said he was leaving with no regrets. \"I've played with honor, respect, I got to know people, and I got to have fun. So I wouldn't change one thing.\"",
      "Carolyn Wiger",
      "Carolyn's run as the most undetected Traitor in the game came to a dramatic end in Episode 9. Throughout the episode, Carolyn started to hint to other players that they shouldn't trust her fellow Traitor Danielle. Meanwhile, Danielle was secretly plotting to expose Carolyn as a Traitor. In the chess game mission, Danielle took a back seat while Carolyn was vocal, making the other players think for the first time that something was off. Then at the roundtable, Danielle showed off her convincing debate skills. She called Carolyn out for attacking her in a previous episode, noting that eliminated Traitors were very aggressive at the roundtable. Carolyn attempted to create a counter argument but was unsuccessful. After getting voted out, she tearfully approached the circle of truth and said, \"I'm somebody who, every day of my life, am judged because of who I am, my differences, my quirks.\" She revealed that she avoided building connections because of how emotional she is. \"Playing this game, it's not easy for me,\" she continued. \"I just wanted to have fun! But I have to get real with myself. Being a Traitor isn't fun.\"",
      "Tom Sandoval",
      "Episode 10 began with the sole remaining Traitor successfully recruiting a new ally before the two secretly escaped to the turret to weigh their options for the next murder. They agreed that Tom Sandoval was close to figuring out their identities and needed to go. When the \"Vanderpump Rules\" star spotted a letter from the Traitors, he immediately let out a maniacal chuckle. \"I knew it!\" he said before reading that he had been eliminated from the game. \"I was expecting this. Who's the most threatening of the guys? Obviously me,\" he theorized. He added, \"I've enjoyed this so much and I didn't realize I was going to be so good at it. It's kind of f---ing cool.\" Tom then applauded himself for how he played the game and how the other players perceived him. \"Overall, I was a pleasure to work with, for the most part, and valued, respected and that's all I could ask for,\" he concluded."

    "story": [
      "When HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Pitt\u201d premiered in January, it drew immediate comparisons to another medical drama, \u201cER.\u201d",
      "Both shows are set in busy urban hospitals and follow frontline healthcare workers as they grapple with a series of intense traumas in the emergency room.",
      "\u201cThe Pitt\u201d even stars a familiar face: Noah Wyle, who played Dr.  John Carter in \u201cER,\u201d portrays protagonist Dr. Michael \u201cRobby\u201d Robinavitch in the new show.",
      "The new series also marks an \u201cER\u201d reunion behind the camera, bringing back \u201cER\u201d producers John Wells and R. Scott Gemmill.",
      "The apparent similarities between the two series are at the heart of an ongoing legal dispute between the creators of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d and the estate of the late author Michael Crichton.",
      "Crichton, who is also known for writing the novels that inspired \u201cJurassic Park\u201d and \u201cThe Andromeda Strain,\u201d wrote the original screenplay for \u201cER\u201d in 1974 and served as an executive producer on the show until his death in 2008.\u00a0The medical drama ended in 2009.",
      "Now, Crichton's estate is alleging in a lawsuit that \u201cThe Pitt\u201d was created as a sequel to \u201cER\u201d without the permission of the late author\u2019s heirs.",
      "The creators of \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d meanwhile, insist their show is not an \u201cER\u201d reboot, arguing that it is \u201cno more similar to \u2018ER\u2019 than is \u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy,\u2019 \u2018Chicago Med,\u2019 or any of the countless other hospital medical dramas that have aired since or before \u2018ER.\u2019\u201d",
      "Keep reading to learn more about why Michael Crichton\u2019s estate is suing the creators of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d and where the case stands now.",
      "Why is Michael Crichton's estate suing 'The Pitt' creators?",
      "In August 2024, the estate of the late author Michael Crichton sued the creators of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d on three counts, including breach of contract.",
      "The plaintiffs allege that the HBO medical drama, which premiered in January, is an unauthorized reboot of \u201cER,\u201d which was created and executive produced by Crichton and ran from 1994 until 2009.",
      "Warner Bros. Television, showrunner R. Scott Gemmill, executive producer John Wells and the star of \"The Pitt\" Noah Wyle, who also serves as a writer and executive producer for the series, were among those named as defendants.",
      "According to the complaint, the defendants began working on an \u201cER\u201d reboot in 2020, planning for it to air on HBO Max. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants worked on the reboot \u201cwithout any notice\u201d to Crichton\u2019s widow, Sherri Crichton, and in \u201cbrazen disregard\u201d of the contractual rights of the late author\u2019s estate.",
      "When he created \u201cER,\u201d Crichton was granted a \u201cfrozen rights\u201d provision in his contract that would prohibit Warner Bros. Television from \u201cproceeding with any sequels, remakes, spinoffs, or other productions derived from \u2018ER\u2019 without Crichton\u2019s express consent,\u201d according to the lawsuit.",
      "The complaint alleges that the creators of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d revealed to Crichton\u2019s widow in 2022 that they had been developing an \u201cER\u201d reboot, two years after they began working on the project.",
      "After negotiations stalled with the studio, Crichton\u2019s estate refused to give consent for the planned reboot, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cWithout (the Plaintiff\u2019s) consent, Defendants\u2019 work on an ER reboot should have ended,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. \u201cBut Defendants\u2019 efforts did not end.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit argues that \"The Pitt\" is essentially a re-creation of \"ER,\" but with an altered setting and character names.",
      "The complaint alleges that Noah Wyle, who also starred as Dr. John Carter in \u201cER,\u201d plays essentially the same character, this time named Dr. Michael Robinavitch, in \"The Pitt.\"",
      "\u201cNoah Wyle\u2019s character is Dr. John Carter from 'ER' in all but name, only 30 years later, and imbued with the experience and lessons learned during the 15-year run of the original series,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.",
      "The complaint also alleges that the two shows share striking similarities when it comes to their hospital settings, structure and supporting characters, noting that \u201cthe main character\u2019s co-worker/ friend in both series is a roguish bad boy.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit also notes that \u201cThe Pitt\u201d is executive produced by John Wells, who served as an executive producer on \u201cER.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Pitt is \u2018ER.\u2019 It\u2019s not like \u2018ER,\u2019 it\u2019s not kind of \u2018ER,\u2019 it\u2019s not sort of \u2018ER.\u2019 It is \u2018ER\u2019 complete with the same executive producer, writer, star, production companies, studio, and network as the planned \u2018ER\u2019 reboot,\" the lawsuit states. \"No one has been fooled.\"",
      "The lawsuit called the defendants\u2019 actions \u201clegally and morally repugnant\u201d and, in the case of Wells, \u201ca personal betrayal of a 30-year friendship.\"",
      "\u201cDefendants seek not to bury Crichton\u2019s credit but to erase him altogether and to rob his heirs of the fruits of one of his greatest creations,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cPlaintiff will not allow that to happen. Defendants must be held accountable to Crichton and other creators whose rights are too often trampled upon in pursuit of unrelenting greed.\u201d",
      "What have the creators of 'The Pitt' said?",
      "The creators of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d have fought back against the lawsuit.",
      "On Jan. 31, Warner Bros. Television and the other defendants filed a motion to have the lawsuit dismissed under California\u2019s anti-SLAPP law.",
      "The purpose of an anti-SLAPP motion is to quash frivolous legal claims that are brought to \u201cchill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech,\u201d according to the statute.",
      "The creators of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d argued that making of the show was a \u201cconstitutionally protected act of free speech,\u201d according to a ruling by the Superior Court of California in February.",
      "Producers Gemmill and Wells have not commented publicly on the lawsuit, but they have opened up interviews about how they believe \u201cThe Pitt\u201d differs from \u201cER.\u201d",
      "Gemmill said he and his fellow creators wanted to \u201cfind a way to do it that was fresh for both us and the audience so that we weren\u2019t just retreading what we\u2019d done in the past,\u201d as he told Variety on Jan. 23.",
      "He added that he had no desire to re-create \u201cER.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf I was going to do another medical show, it would have to be completely different and new, because I don\u2019t want to do the same thing over again,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the audience \u2014 I mean, there are some who would (want to revive \u2018ER\u2019) for nostalgia\u2019s sake, but that\u2019s no fun for me and I don\u2019t know how much fun it is for Noah (Wyle).\u201d",
      "Wyle said in the same joint interview with Variety that in his view, \u201cThe Pitt\u201d and \u201cER\u201d are stories told from different angles.",
      "\u201cIn a lot of ways, \u2018ER\u2019 was a patient-centric show, and this is more of a provider-centric show, which puts the focus of the medicine and the current way that it\u2019s practiced in first position,\u201d he said.",
      "In a November statement, Warner Bros. Television called the lawsuit\u2019s claims \u201cbaseless.\u201d",
      "\u201cMs. (Sherri) Crichton\u2019s lawsuit against WBD lacks both factual and legal foundation. Ms. Crichton\u2019s description of the timeline and content of our negotiations about a potential \u2018ER\u2019 reboot are incorrect, and we strongly deny her allegations,\u201d the studio said, as reported by Deadline in November.",
      "\u201cImportantly, 'The Pitt' does not include any 'ER' intellectual property and is no more similar to \u2018ER\u2019 than is 'Grey\u2019s Anatomy,' 'Chicago Med', or any of the countless other hospital medical dramas that have aired since or before \u2018ER\u2019,\u201d the statement continued.",
      "Casey Bloys, the head of HBO\u2019s Max streaming service, also rejected the allegation that \u201cThe Pitt\u201d is based on \u201cER\u201d in comments at a press conference in November, according to Variety.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not supposed to talk about active litigation, but I will say the idea that a show can\u2019t be set in an ER seems kind of unrealistic on its face, that no other show can be set in a hospital emergency room,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s kind of a staple on television.\u201d",
      "Sherri Crichton responded to Bloys\u2019 remarks in a Deadline interview the same month, calling them \u201cnot credible.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe case is not about whether someone can do a show set in a hospital,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is about whether Warner Bros., John Wells, Noah Wyle, and Scott Gemmill can spend two years developing an 'ER' reboot, negotiate with the estate for nearly a year to obtain consent per Michael Crichton\u2019s contract, and, when they can\u2019t get the terms they want, proceed with the exact same show with a different title and location.\u201d",
      "Where does the case stand now?On Feb. 24, a judge denied the defendants\u2019 motion to throw out the complaint, meaning that the lawsuit can move forward.",
      "In her ruling, Judge Wendy Chang of the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles said the Court agreed that the making of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d is a \u201cconstitutionally protected act of free speech.\u201d",
      "However, the Court also found that the plaintiff\u2019s claims were not \u201ctotally meritless\u201d and could not be dismissed, meaning that legal proceedings can continue.",
      "The ruling states that the plaintiffs did \u201cestablish a timeline of various communications and events to show the negotiations with the Estate over an \u2018ER\u2019 reboot, failure of those negotiations, and the creation of \u201cThe Pitt.\u2019\u201d",
      "A case management conference is now scheduled for March 26 in Los Angeles."

    "summary": "Do the White Lotus opening credits art predict the characters' fates? An art historian thinks so and reads into what it all means.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for \"The White Lotus\" Season Three.",
      "The opening credits of \"The White Lotus\" Season 3 might give away more information than just the cast and crew's names. Fans think the art has clues into the characters\u2019 fates \u2014 and some of the actors this season do, too.",
      "Jason Isaacs, who plays father of three and businessman Timothy Ratliff in the third season of the hit HBO show, brought up the meaning behind the opening credits this season in an interview with some of his castmates aired on TODAY on Feb. 12.",
      "\"Someone said to Patrick (Schwarzenegger) and I the other day that during the credits when each individual name comes up, did you notice that the drawing behind it means something about their character?\" Isaacs asked.",
      "Sarah Catherine Hook, who plays Tim's middle child Piper in the show, said the illustration accompanying her name directly corresponded with her character.",
      "\"Mine was meditating,\" Hook said. \"I was like, 'That's Piper.'\"",
      "Isaacs started laughing and replied, \"We didn't notice any of this at all.\"",
      "While the cast of the \"White Lotus\" are aware of what the illustrations could mean (or could not mean), fans have began posting their own theories on social media.",
      "One TikTok, which has more than 350,000 views, offered five minutes of analysis of the opening credits, from character illustrations to how Season Three's credits could connect to the credits (and plot lines) from Season One.",
      "Kelly Cahn, an art advisor, curator and appraiser, shared more insights about the opening credits in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "\"I feel like they're literally showing us the entire thing in advance,\" Cahn said of the opening images, which were hand drawn by Plains of Yonder.",
      "The 'White Lotus' Season 3 credits, analyzed by an art expert",
      "The paintings shown in the opening credits are inspired by Thai mural paintings, which can be found in temples and royal palaces in Thailand, Cahn said.",
      "She noted that several paintings throughout the credits, including the one featured in the first few seconds, appear to be on top of panel that is behind the ones that are visible, meaning we might not be seeing the full, bigger picture.",
      "\"Like, there's some story that's a cover up or something,\" Cahn said.",
      "The first actor's name to appear is Leslie Bibb. The letters are surrounded by an illustration of several elephants \u2014 creatures known for having a remarkable memory.",
      "Cahn said at first she saw three elephants \u2014 which could correspond to the trio Bibb's character is with on the trip \u2014 but then could potentially see four, possibly hinting at more to come for their group.",
      "The illustration for Carrie Coon, who plays another one of the three women on vacation together, also features an elephant, though it's surrounded by a pack of animals as two winged creatures look on from above.",
      "\"There's almost a sense of you're being watched,\" Cahn says of the painting. \"Are these things that can fly away and report back? Again, it feels like an attack. Lying in wait, watching.\"",
      "Walton Goggins is the next name to appear after imagery of a palace or temple. His illustration shows a man sitting in a tower looking down below, which Cahn said could hint at his surveillance of the owners of the hotel.",
      "As Hook said on TODAY, her name is shown with a woman who appears to be meditating on a hill, and her character Piper is a Buddhist.",
      "Before Isaacs' name is alongside a man hiding in a tree (\"perhaps from the incriminating press,\" Cahn said). Above him in the tree are hanging knives or swords \u2014 which could be a sign of incoming danger for the father of three, Cahn said.",
      "And in Episode 2, Tim's business partner Kenny (voiced by Ke Huy Quan) tells him that the feds have raided his office. Kenny then warns Tim that they have everything on their business dealings in Brunei, which Tim implies could be tied to money laundering.",
      "The image for Blackpink singer Lalisa Manobal, who plays Mook, seems to show a woman holding an umbrella and flirting with a man, Cahn said.",
      "\"In the first episode, she is trying to convince her partner to go after more lucrative bodyguard positions that would enable them to travel,\" Cahn noted of Mook.",
      "Michelle Monaghan, who plays the third woman vacationing in Thailand with her two best friends, has a topless woman on a balcony in the image alongside her name.",
      "Sam Nivola, who plays one of Tim\u2019s sons Lochlan, shared on TODAY that the illustration beside his name is just a boy lying down \u2014 but he did give the show\u2019s creator Mike White some room for interpretation with the opening credits.",
      "\u201cWhat if he\u2019s just like, screwing with us all?\u201d Nivola asked.",
      "Cahn analyzed the painting as a boy in his underwear floating in the water, perhaps showing a direct line to who could end up dead in the water at the end of the series.",
      "But as Nivola himself said on TODAY, it all could be a red herring as well.",
      "Lek Patravadi, who plays the owner of the hotel, is shown with a woman seated in a lotus position holding a bird with a human head in her hand, Cahn said.",
      "Parker Posey's image shows two monkeys sitting together, one of which is blowing smoke, which Cahn said could allude to the Southern mom's dependence on prescription drugs.",
      "After Posey's name, the credits cut to an alligator looking in the distance, and then pans over to a heron or crane looking at its reflection in the water.",
      "Natasha Rothwell's name pops up, which Cahn said could relate to the myth of Narcissus, or even her ability to see Gary as Greg.",
      "\"Or perhaps it deals with the self-reflection she will be undertaking during her 3 months in Thailand,\" Cahn said.",
      "Two men appear to be peeping watching a topless woman (a possible reference to the image from Monaghan's name, Cahn noted) from afar in some trees in the next section \u2014 as Patrick Schwarzenegger's name comes up.",
      "\"Patrick Schwarzenegger is clearly, like, the guy that would be leering through the bushes,\" Cahn said, referring to his character Saxon. \"I feel like he instantly tries to hit on (women), and they're like, 'What?' ... it feels like this kind of peeping Tom energy.\"",
      "Tayme Thapthimthong, who plays the hotel's bodyguard Gaitok, has a man fighting a tiger alongside his name, while a cow or ram watches from above, Cahn said.",
      "A large cat has attacked another animal alongside Aimee Lou Wood's name, while two other animals look on and watch. Cahn questioned if Wood's character Chelsea is the attacked animal \u2014 or if she could be the feline itself.",
      "Wood\u2019s name is the last cast member\u2019s name to be shown before members of the crew. A large group of monkeys are seen traveling together, with one monkey pointing the way, as the casting director Meredith Tucker\u2019s name is shown.",
      "Two monkeys appear to be crawling up a tower as the Thailand casting director Non Jungmeier's name is shown, and four people are at the top of the tower as costume designer Alex Boivard's name comes into the frame. One person is holding a snake towards the monkeys, Cahn noted.",
      "The next few scenes show what could be an attack on a place, before a boat appears to capsize, and some of the crew are eaten by large fish, Cahn said.",
      "The last image is of a man paddling on a log while another fish looks on, as White's name is credited as creating the series.",
      "The credits end with an ornate red temple with a Buddha in the middle, which Cahn said could be an allusion to the hotel owner's husband.",
      "Whether Lochlan ends up floating the water, or if the tree of knives falls on Timothy, still remains to be seen. But the theories as to who dies at the end of Season 3 of \"The White Lotus\" are just getting started.",
      "And if \"The White Lotus\" has taught us anything, it\u2019s that we should analyze everything \u2014 from the\u00a0Testa di Moro statues to the art on the walls."

      "After receiving the notification, she recalls telling her husband: \u201cPretty soon, the only privacy any of us will have will be in our dreams.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis book follows a person who, like all of us, thinks that this technological surveillance is part of our lives and is generally harmless, and comes to discover that, in fact, it can be harmful,\u201d Lalami adds. \u201cAnd in the book, she is accused of committing a crime because of her dreams. So the question becomes, how does she fight back? How does she regain her freedom?\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a deliberate choice to have her be an archivist, because one of the things that really struck me about all of the data that that our phones collect about us is that we\u2019re essentially creating an archive of us,\u201d Lalami says.",
      "\u201cI wanted to draw the connection between this world that we think of as futuristic and different, and say, actually, maybe it\u2019s not all that different,\u201d she adds. \u201cMaybe it actually does connect to our present and also to our past.\u201d",

It\u2019s something that even infants do, apparently, and you continue dreaming your whole life,\u201d she says.",

    "summary": "Harriet Tubman's great-great-great-grandniece Rita Daniels spoke to TODAY.com about the late abolitionist's legacy and the surviving family members keeping her memory alive.",
    "story": [
      "Rita Daniels didn't always know she was the great-great-great-grandniece of Harriet Tubman. In fact, a 9-year-old Daniels had no idea they were related when her teacher assigned her a book report on Tubman.",
      "At the time, Daniels, who lived in Auburn, New York, where Tubman lived for the majority of her life, could only unearth research that said Tubman was a \"fugitive\" and there \"was a bounty of her head,\" she tells TODAY.com.",
      "Unsatisfied, she went to her mom with the assignment, curious about why she'd been asked to research a figure who seemingly did what she was \"raised to not do.\"",
      "This moment would change Daniels life forever.",
      "Her mom revealed that they were descendants of Tubman, whom Daniels now affectionately calls \"Aunt Harriet,\" a fact her mom had discovered while comparing family trees in her 20s.",
      "\"She says, 'But your Aunt Harriet was not the kind of villain that they make her out,'\" Daniels recalls of her mother explaining the inaccuracies in the research at that time.",
      "Daniels dived into the book report, using some of her elder aunts and uncles to gather knowledge on Tubman that the school library didn't have.",
      "\"I got an AAA (grade) on (the book report) because I had more information than the school books had,\" she says.",
      "But that assignment was just the beginning of Daniels journey of family discovery and preserving Harriet Tubman's legacy.",
      "This month, Daniels released her book called \"Harriet Tubman: Military Scout and Tenacious Visionary,\" which she co-wrote with author Jean Marie Wiesen. It aims to correct the misconceptions that previous books and research have reported about Tubman.",
      "She says there's a long list of errors, like that she would \"jump off a cliff,\" as seen in the 2019 film \"Harriet,\" or that she would be \"caught in bushes\" and \"having sex with other people just to get through.\"",
      "Daniels wants her book to spread awareness of Tubman's true legacy and actions, properly documenting Tubman's life that \"went from one extreme to another.\"",
      "She also hopes the book encourages others to dive into their own ancestral past.",
      "\"Other people need to find out what is their journey, who they are they related to, who survived some type of \u2014 I can't (necessarily) say slavery \u2014 but some type of goodness, or whatever it is,\" she adds.",
      "\"Go and follow that journey, get the book so you could see why Harriet Tubman's story was so important to be told. If she could do it, so can others.\"",
      "Daniels isn't the only one in her family who works to honor Tubman's life. Read on to learn about some of the late abolitionist\u2019s other surviving family members.",
      "Who is Harriet Tubman\u2019s surviving family \u2014 and how are they keeping her legacy alive?",
      "Daniels, who comes from a family of nine children, has taken it upon herself to ensure others know what Tubman stood for so people don't forget the past.",
      "\u201cIf a slave would make that long journey over to the United States from Africa and not have anything \u2014 everything stripped from her, and I look at it as, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s strength,\u2019 and you can\u2019t hold us back,\u201d Daniels says.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going back. Those are my words. We\u2019re not going back,\" she adds.",
      "In 2015, Daniels started the Harriet Tubman Learning Center in Powder Springs, Georgia, alongside her mother, Geraldine Copes-Daniels, with a mission to carry out Tubman's legacy through improving the literacy of underserved children.",
      "Daniels says that \"slaves were not allowed to learn how to read or write,\" so Tubman \"never had that opportunity to learn.\"",
      "\"(Slaves) were not supposed to have any type of skill sets when it came to school or anything like that, and if they if someone even tried to teach them, they would either be hung or lynched,\" she explains.",
      "She and her mother started the learning center because they wanted to support underserved children who otherwise didn't have learning resources available.",
      "\"We know they come in there and they can\u2019t read properly, or they can\u2019t do certain things, but we don\u2019t focus right in on the school the problem,\" Daniels says. \"We bring them in, we feed them, and then right after that, we get them, we teach them how to build a robot.\u201d",
      "While the learning center shut its doors during COVID-19, her family is working on raising the funds to reopen it.",
      "Outside of Daniels, there are other family members who have publicly spoken about Tubman's lasting impact.",
      "Copes Johnson, 97, is the great-great-grandniece of Tubman. She was born and raised in Auburn, New York, where Tubman lived for about 50 years until her death.",
      "Daniels explains that Copes Johnson has done various advocacy work to honor Tubman's legacy throughout much of her life: She taught at the Harriet Tubman Home, and also assisted the U.S. Department of the Interior\u2019s initiative to create the Harriet Tubman National Historic Park. Additionally, Copes Johnson has given presentations on Tubman\u2019s life across the U.S. and even in Ghana.",
      "Copes Johnson also took part in the campaign to get Tubman's face on the $20 bill in place of former President Andrew Jackson, which has yet to take place.",
      "Daniels says that stories of Tubman have been passed down throughout the generations and shared at family reunions at Tubman\u2019s former residency in Auburn, New York.",
      "A resident of Washington, D.C., Ernestine \u201cTina\u201d Martin Wyatt is one of Tubman's great-great-great-grandnieces.",
      "\"My great-great-grandmother, Ann Marie Stewart, was the daughter of Soph, one of Tubman\u2019s sisters who was sold away. We think it was to Georgia,\" she told Essence in a May 2021 interview.",
      "Wyatt pioneers an annual celebration called Harriet Tubman Day, which aims to educate others on her ancestor's legacy. She has also spoken on Tubman's legacy at various events, such as a virtual conversation about Tubman hosted by the Northwest African American Museum in 2021.",
      "\"She is a true American Patriot and chose to help preserve the Union by risking her life and liberty to do it. She continued to serve and help people who were marginalized, disenfranchised, and in need,\" Wyatt shared with Essence.",
      "\"I would say look at her life and what she accomplished with the span of time from her self-liberation in 1849 until 1913, how she rose up out of it and uplifted others.\"",
      "Like Copes Johnson, she has also spoken about the importance of getting her ancestor on the $20 bill.",
      "\u201cThat $20 bill, for me, represents something greater about who she was and what she gave to the United States,\u201d Wyatt told CNN in January 2024. \u201cShe is a symbol of true democracy in this country, and we have to pay attention to the symbols that we want to represent it.\u201d",
      "Judith G. Bryant is the great-great-grandniece of Tubman and currently resides in Auburn, New York.",
      "Bryant, a descendant of Tubman's brother, William Henry Stewart, Sr., told Ms. Magazine in a January 2022 interview that she views the social activist like any other family member.",
      "\u201cHarriet Tubman is like a stage name for me,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not who she was to herself or to her family here. In Auburn, she was Mrs. Davis. The public has no clue about who she really was as a person, as a member of our family.\u201d",
      "Bryant has spoken at services, events and ceremonies that involve Tubman's legacy, including the opening ceremony for the Thompson Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, which is part of the Harriet Tubman National Historical Park in Auburn, New York.",
      "Joan Rebecca Stewart Springfield-Butler \u2014 a descendant of Tubman\u2019s brother, James Stewart \u2014 lives in Schenectady, New York.",
      "She discovered her connection to Tubman when she was in her 30s.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know about being related to her until I was about 36 or 37,\" she told Ms. Magazine in its January 2022 story. \"I was a little upset because she was in the schoolbooks when I was in school, and there weren\u2019t many Black people in there at that time, and I could have said, \u2018Well, I\u2019m related to her.\u2019\u2019\u2019",
      "Springfield-Butler told Ms. Magazine that her father was 13 when Tubman died.",
      "\u201cHe remembered her sitting at the table and talking and falling asleep. And then she picked up right where she left off when she woke up,\" she said.",
      "\"We had a room in my grandfather\u2019s house that my uncle was living in, and the room was empty except for a Bible and gun. I once asked whose they were, and they said, \u2018Oh, a relative.\u2019 I had no idea that they were Harriet Tubman\u2019s! And then my uncle lost them when he moved from that house to another house.\"",
      "Michele Jones Galvin is a great-great-great grandniece of Tubman.",
      "She co-authored a book on Tubman's life called \u201cBeyond the Underground. Aunt Harriet, Moses of Her People\u201d with her mother, Joyce Stokes Jones, who has since died.",
      "When Galvin was in fourth grade, she was assigned a school report to pick \"an important individual who was greatly admired\" in the course of history, per Syracuse Woman Magazine. She considered writing about Tubman, but ultimately chose another subject as there was not enough information available regarding her ancestor.",
      "\u201cThen it hit me,\u201d Galvin told the outlet. \u201cAnd, then, I learned that I should never have squandered that opportunity to share with my classmates and my teacher about the relationship with Aunt Harriet.\u201d",
      "Her mother went on to research Tubman's life heavily, producing a documentary called \u201cA Conversation with a Living Relative of Harriet Tubman.\" The mother-daughter duo also published a book on Tubman, which mixes \"family lore, memoir and historical reconstruction,\" according to the official description.",
      "Valerie Ardelia Ross Manokey is Tubman\u2019s great-great-niece. She is a mother of five who lives in Maryland, per the National Parks Conservation Association.",
      "In an interview with NPCA published in 2017, Manokey recalled that when she was growing up, her parents would always tell her, \"Remember Aunt Harriet. If she could endure, so can you.\"",
      "Manokey said in the 1950s, her family advocated for a Harriet Tubman memorial but it never came to fruition.",
      "\u201cPeople told us, \u2018You\u2019ll never get anything,\u2019\u201d Manokey told the association. \u201cBut \u2018never\u2019 means you have just got to fight harder. You might get knocked back to your knees, but you are going to get back up.\u201d",
      "Starting as a teacher's aide, Manokey taught children about Tubman, far beyond what was being shared at the time.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t feel like I was a good teacher. I knew I was,\u201d she said. \u201cI had confidence. I had pride.\u201d",
      "Manokey spoke on Tubman's legacy today, saying, \u201cI honor Harriet. I honor the name. I honor the stories that I have heard. And I thank God that I have lived long enough to see this.\u201d",
      "Charles E.T. Ross is Tubman's great-great-great-nephew and Manokey's nephew. Ross carries out Tubman's mission of helping others through his role as an education specialist, according to the National Parks Conservation Association.",
      "\u201cI need to basically continue what she did,\" he shared with the outlet.",
      "He continues Tubman\u2019s legacy through art, as seen through the mural he painted of her in Dorchester County, which his aunt said shows a young Tubman and marshy terrain, per the association. Ross also volunteers at the Harriet Tubman Museum and Educational Center in Cambridge, Maryland.",
      "\u201cShe was a leader,\u201d he said of Tubman in a November 2022 interview from The Washington Post. \u201cAnd she should empower all of us to be leaders.\u201d"

      "Naim said that beyond that public announcement, Hamas had not been officially notified of Israel's intention to resume negotiations.",
      "It was unclear whether Israeli officials would seek to extend the first phase of the agreement or negotiate terms for a second phase, which could ultimately lead to a more permanent ceasefire and the eventual withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip.",
      "Naim said Israel was deliberately delaying further negotiations to create a pretext for returning to war against Hamas.",
      "\u201cWe believe that this is intentionally done to escalate the situation or to push the second-phase negotiations under the threat to return back to war and not to withdraw from the Gaza Strip,\u201d he said.",
      "Israeli troops are supposed to start withdrawing from the Gaza-Egypt border area on Saturday, marking the end of the ceasefire's first phase. However, Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen told public broadcaster Kan on Thursday that Israel has demanded that their military stay in the Philadelphi Corridor, which runs along Gaza\u2019s southern border with Egypt.",
      "The last step of the agreement\u2019s six-week first phase came overnight, when Israel released more than 600 Palestinian prisoners after Hamas handed over the corpses of four Israeli hostages killed during captivity in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Under the ceasefire\u2019s terms \u2014 which were reached with help from intermediaries Qatar and Egypt in late January, after more than a year of fraught negotiations \u2014 talks on the second stage should have begun weeks ago.",
      "But rather than returning to the negotiating table, each side has repeatedly accused the other of violating the agreement\u2019s terms. Several of the weekly exchanges of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners have been dogged by last-minute accusations and near-cancellations.",
      "Hamas has stated before that it is willing to cede governance of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body, and Israel has made clear that any plan for Gaza\u2019s \u201cday after\u201d should not include Hamas, which led the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on southern Israel. On that day, about 1,200 people were killed and 250 were kidnapped, according to local officials, sparking Israel's 15-month war on Gaza that has killed at least 48,300 people, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, and destroyed much of the enclave.",
      "The thorniest question standing in the way of negotiating the second phase of an agreement remains whether Hamas will disarm. Netanyahu has declared Hamas\u2019 destruction as the primary goal of Israel\u2019s war in the Gaza Strip \u2014 sometimes, his critics have said, superseding the freedom and welfare of the Israeli hostages still being held there.",
      "Though he reiterated Hamas\u2019 offer to integrate into a Palestinian unity government, Basem Naim said the group would only disarm and transform into a purely political party if Palestinians are granted an independent political state \u2014 a condition that Netanyahu and his right-wing allies in government have repeatedly rejected.",
      "\u201cThese are two different tracks. The arms are related to the existence or the presence of the occupation,\u201d he said, referring to Israel's ongoing presence in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem.",
      "If an independent Palestinian state is created, Naim said, \u201cwe are ready again to become a political party and to integrate our fighters into a Palestinian national army.\u201d",
      "Israeli military leaders have repeatedly made clear that they are prepared to return to war if the agreement collapses, going so far as to call up reservists for renewed fighting.",
      "Though Hamas remains committed to the ceasefire agreement, Naim said, the group is also preparing for renewed fighting.",
      "\u201cIf they decide to escalate and to return back to war, we are preparing ourselves for all options,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no choice other than to defend ourselves, as we have done already along the 15 months.\u201d"

      "Controversial influencer brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate, who both face charges in Romania, including human trafficking and sexual intercourse with a minor, arrived in the United States on Thursday after a travel ban on them was lifted, according to their spokesperson and Romanian prosecutors.",
      "A spokesperson for the brothers, Mateea Petrescu, said the two landed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, around midday, The Associated Press reported.",
      "After landing, Andrew Tate said that \"my brother and I are largely misunderstood.\"",
      "\"There\u2019s a lot of opinions about us that go around on the internet. We\u2019ve yet to be convicted of any crime in our lives ever. We have no criminal record anywhere on the planet,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Ahead of their arrival, Joseph McBride, the Tate brothers' U.S.-based attorney, told NBC News on Thursday morning, he would not comment on whether the State Department or the White House was involved in lifting the travel ban. A Trump official also declined to comment on the Tate brothers' arrival in the United States. The State Department also declined to comment.",
      "When asked about the Tate brothers' arrival in the U.S., President Donald Trump said he was unaware of the matter but would look into it.",
      "\"Our position is that Andrew and Tristan have long been targets of lawfare,\" McBride said. \"They have maintained their innocence, arguing the accusations against them are defamatory and false.\"",
      "In a statement, McBride said the Tate brothers \" feel secure in America for several reasons\" but the main reason is that Trump is president.",
      "As a result, they are excited to call America their home again,\" McBride said. \"However, our mission does not stop here. We will not only seek justice for Andrew and Tristan but also work with investigators worldwide to expose and bring to justice those who have weaponized legal systems against their political opponents.\"",
      "McBride said the Tate brothers plan to return to Romania at the end of March to meet with prosecutors. They will then come back to the United States, he said.",
      "When asked about the Tate brothers entering the state, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said it was under the federal government\u2019s jurisdiction \"whether they want to rebuff his entry into the United States.\"",
      "Matthew Jury, a lawyer for those in the U.K. who have accused the Tate brothers of misconduct, told Reuters the alleged victims were \"disgusted, dismayed, distraught\" upon learning the brothers had entered the U.S.",
      "\"They don\u2019t understand how this could happen,\" Jury told the publication. \"Why would the so-called most powerful man in the world intervene on the behalf of one of the world\u2019s worst and most prolific alleged sex traffickers and rapists?\u201d",
      "The Tate brothers, who are dual U.S.-British citizens, were reported by Romanian media to have taken a private plane from the country to the U.S. early Thursday.",
      "The brothers left Romania while under criminal investigation over accusations of having formed an organized criminal group, in addition to human trafficking, the trafficking of minors, sex with a minor and money laundering. They have denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Romania\u2019s Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism, or DIICOT, said in a statement Thursday that prosecutors had approved a \u201crequest to modify the obligation preventing the defendants from leaving Romania,\u201d but it said judicial control measures remained in place, The Associated Press reported. The agency did not expand on who had made the request.",
      "The Tate brothers would still be expected to appear before judicial authorities if summoned and were warned that violating their obligations could \"result in judicial control being replaced with a stricter deprivation of liberty measure,\" DIICOT said.",
      "Andrew Tate, 38, and Tristan Tate, 36, were arrested near Bucharest, Romania's capital, in 2022 along with two Romanian women, with all four indicted by Romanian prosecutors last year.",
      "The Bucharest Tribunal ruled in April that a trial could move forward but did not set a date, with all four denying the allegations against them.",
      "The Tate brothers' departure to the U.S. comes after an American woman who says the siblings attempted to recruit her into a webcam sex trafficking ring filed a countersuit against them this month, claiming they had defamed her after she gave a testimony to Romanian authorities.",
      "Jane Doe\u2019s countersuit came after the Tate brothers sued her for defamation in 2023, accusing her and another woman of giving Romanian authorities fabricated evidence and conspiring to defraud and falsely imprison them.",
      "Her suit was the first U.S.-based lawsuit against the Tate brothers, who are both former kickboxers.",
      "McBride, the brothers' lawyer, said a Zoom hearing was expected to be held on Thursday in a defamation suit the brothers filed in Palm Beach County Circuit Court, but added that that was a coincidence and unrelated to their travel.",
      "When asked about why Romanian authorities gave the brothers permission to leave, McBride added that their defamation case against the government \"put a crack in\" the charges against them, pointing to \"corruption\" in Romania.",
      "Matthew Jury, a lawyer who has represented British women who have filed criminal complaints against Andrew Tate in the U.K., said reports that the Trump administration had played a role in the Tate brothers being allowed to leave Romania for the U.S. were  \u201cequal parts disgusting and dismaying.\"",
      "NBC News was not able to independently verify whether Washington played any role in the development. The Trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "McBride declined to comment on whether the White House was involved in the Tate Brothers' departure from Romania.",
      "\u201cThere is clear evidence to support the allegations against Tate that he is one of the world\u2019s worst human traffickers and serial rapists,\u201d Jury said Thursday of Andrew Tate in a post on X. But, he added: \u201cAny suggestion that the Tates will now face justice in Romania is fanciful.\u201d",
      "The lawyer called on the British government to step in and act to see the Tate brothers extradited to the U.K. to face charges of \"human trafficking and rape they are alleged to have committed in this jurisdiction.\u201d",
      "The British government did not immediately comment on the developments."

      "A woman may have signed her name on the world's oldest dated runestone, researchers in Norway have found, as they piece together the 2,000-year-old puzzle.",
      "The inscription begins with the word \u201cI\u201d in runic script, followed by the name of the writer and a verb that indicates writing, before ending with the word \u201crune,\u201d researchers wrote earlier this month in the journal Antiquity after studying a fragment of the stone found at a grave site in Hole, a small municipality in southern Norway to the east of the capital, Oslo.",
      "\u201cBasically the text would be saying, I, the rune inscriber\u2019s name, wrote the runic inscription,\u201d one of the study\u2019s co-authors, Kristel Zilmer, told NBC News in telephone interview Monday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a type of inscription also that has parallels in some other romantic inscriptions, basically somebody telling us that they made this inscription,\u201d added Zilmer, a professor of runology at the University of Oslo\u2019s Museum of Cultural History.",
      "The researchers said they believed the Germanic alphabetic script was inspired by the Roman alphabet, of which runes formed the foundational blocks in the first A.D. centuries. It was widely used in Scandinavia up until the late Middle Ages.",
      "Runic inscriptions have been found on objects such as a bone knife and iron knife from Denmark and a comb, which archeologists have dated to around 150 A.D. Those found on other runestones date to around 700 A.D.",
      "Often they bore messages, including spells to bring back the dead and charm words.",
      "But very little is known about their development as it varied over time and deciphering them can be challenging without archaeological context.",
      "The latest research suggests the fragments, the first of which was discovered in 2021, were part of a single slab. The discovery also brings scientists one step closer to understanding the language\u2019s evolution and the use of such stones, the researchers said.",
      "Two years later, researchers found more fragments and the script on them appeared to continue across the fragments, indicating they were all part of a single stone.",
      "\u201cThey managed to find two extra pieces, and they fit perfectly within the middle part of one of the inscriptions, and gave us almost a complete inscription,\u201d Zilmer said.",
      "Due to the damage and the weathering of the stone, she added that determining the exact text, including the name of the inscriber, is a \u201cbit tricky,\u201d but what especially caught the attention of the researchers is a feature in the name that indicates it ended with a \u201c-u.\u201d",
      "In ancient runic script, she said that would indicate a possible woman\u2019s name which, if confirmed, \u201cwould be the earliest known record of a female rune-inscriber.\u201d",
      "Because the fragments found in Hole were buried along with cremated human remains, scientists had the crucial archeological context that allowed them to use radiocarbon dating to confirm the fragments dated between 50 B.C. and 275 A.D.",
      "\u201cWe may have here a series of events unfolding involving different people,\u201d Zilmer said. \u201cIt may be a stone that combines different purposes.\u201d",
      "While much of the research is still ongoing, \u201cwe are still missing significant portions, so there are evident gaps,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle with holes, but nonetheless it will be very interesting to see how far we can get, how many of these small fragments, some of these also inscribed, that might be able to connect to each other,\u201d she added."

      "Many victims have said they don\u2019t remember being assaulted and experienced similar symptoms to L\u00e9v\u00eaque\u2019s, their lawyers said. Others suffered sexual dysfunction and fell into substance abuse. When police, taking names from Le Scouarnec\u2019s writings, sought them out and showed them the passages written about them, those revelations triggered physical and psychological reactions of varying degrees, the lawyers added. Two men, both 25, died by suicide in 2020 and 2021.",
      "The case, which includes a dark history of incest, has raised questions about how a well-respected surgeon who worked in nine hospitals and clinics across five regions in northwest France was allowed to practice when there were so many red flags that legal observers say should have signaled that Le Scouarnec was dangerous, including a 2005 conviction for possessing material depicting child sexual abuse.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s lawyers declined to comment, but prosecutors said he has admitted to many, but not all, of the charges. Unlike in the United States, defendants in France are brought to trial even if they admit guilt.",
      "Victims\u2019 advocates hope the trial, set to last four months, will prompt a hard look at what they call a lax pursuit of child abuse allegations, particularly when doctors \u2014 who are in short supply in many areas \u2014 are accused of misconduct.",
      "\u201cThere were warnings over 30 years,\u201d said Francesca Satta, who is representing 10 victims and families. \u201cThis man benefited from a system that opened the door for him to have his own hunting ground.\u201d",
      "\u2018Pedophile fantasies\u2019",
      "Beyond the medical world, the lines have often blurred in France over what constitutes child abuse versus seduction.\u00a0The once-celebrated writer Gabriel Matzneff, now 88, made having sex with adolescents a staple of his books, even boasting about the practice in an infamous TV interview, until a leading literary publisher, Vanessa Springora, called him out in her own 2020 book for grooming her for sex in the 1980s when she was 14 and he was 50.",
      "It is illegal for an adult to have sex with a minor under the age of 15, though child advocates say many adults are never charged. Earlier this month, in a closely watched case seen as a test of evolving attitudes toward sex with minors, the director Christophe Ruggia was convicted of sexually assaulting actress Ad\u00e8le Haenel, now 35, from the time he cast her in a film when she was 12 and he was 36. He was sentenced to two years of house arrest, with two years suspended.",
      "\u201cL\u2019Affaire Scouarnec\u201d has drawn parallels with another high-profile trial that transfixed the country late last year and led to the conviction of Dominique Pelicot, 72, for organizing and documenting the mass rape of his sleeping wife, whom he drugged, by dozens of men over a decade. He is now under investigation for two other alleged crimes involving drugging: the rape and murder of a young woman in 1991 and the attempted rape of another in 1999.",
      "As in the Pelicot case, investigators discovered a trove of allegedly incriminating evidence on hard drives seized in the suspect\u2019s house, including thousands of photos depicting child sexual abuse and videos, many of them violent, French media reported.",
      "Le Scouarnec allegedly told investigators he was \u201cobsessed and tyrannized\u201d by his \u201cpedophile fantasies\u201d and began keeping a diary, according to court documents. Those digital files date to the early 1980s and include the names of patients and others, including young family members, along with their ages, addresses and a detailed account of what was done to them, the\u00a0documents show.",
      "The assaults tracked in the digital diaries stop in March 2017, when Le Scouarnec was arrested on charges of raping his 6-year-old neighbor after luring her across a gap in the mesh fence between their gardens, according to testimony. In December 2020, he was convicted in that case, along with the rape and sexual assault of two of his nieces when they were children in the 1980s and \u201990s, and a 4-year-old patient.",
      "Le Scouarnec faces a maximum of 20 years in prison, which would run concurrently with the 15 years he is now serving in connection with the 2020 conviction. With his pretrial detention and parole eligibility taken into account, he could be out by 2030, said lawyer Marie Grimaud.",
      "Grimaud, who is representing 37 victims, and other lawyers say the penalties for sex crimes and child abuse should be much more severe.",
      "\u201cIn France, if you rape one person, you rape 300, it\u2019s exactly the same number of years you\u2019re looking at,\u201d she said.",
      "Warning signs",
      "The first people who knew about Le Scouarnec\u2019s behavior were his family. As early as 1984, references to the rapes of a niece and a family friend appear in the surgeon\u2019s diaries, according to court documents. But none of the adults took action, even after the children told them, and the abuse continued, three family members told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis is a man who sees children as sexual objects,\u201d Le Scouarnec\u2019s niece Alexandra, 47, told NBC News. She said her uncle isolated her and then raped her from ages 5 to 13. (NBC News does not name victims\u00a0of sexual assault, but Alexandra has asked that her first name be used.)",
      "She said she will testify at the upcoming trial, along with a family friend who was also one of the first victims mentioned in the diaries, though Le Scouarnec cannot be charged in their cases because the acts happened too long ago under French law.",
      "Some children knew Le Scouarnec\u2019s \u201cexam\u201d was not appropriate, but their parents brushed aside their complaints, said Hugo Lemonier, a journalist who spent three years researching a new book about the case, \u201cTrapped: In the Intimate Diaries of Dr. Le Scouarnec.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we see in this case is the omnipotence of the medical profession,\u201d he said.",
      "French authorities were first alerted in January 2004, when the FBI told them Le Scouarnec\u2019s credit card was linked to a pedophile website the agency was monitoring, court records show. There is no indication that medical authorities were notified as the police carried out their investigation.",
      "At his trial for possession of child sexual abuse material in the fall of 2005, the surgeon was \u201calmost considered a victim,\u201d Lemonier said. Le Scouarnec presented himself as a man \u201cin a moment of great distress,\u201d recounting how his wife had left him, taking their three kids, and in his solitude he \u201cfound a refuge, an escape\u201d in viewing the material, he added.",
      "The surgeon, who specialized in appendectomies and abdominal and gynecological surgery, got a break when the judge imposed a four-month suspended sentence with no restrictions.",
      "\u201cThe judge could have ordered him to stop practicing or seek treatment, but he didn\u2019t,\u201d said Homayra Sellier, founder of the child protection agency Innocence in Danger. \u201cHe should have lost his medical license.\u201d",
      "Another opportunity was missed in June 2006, when a psychiatrist at the hospital where Le Scouarnec worked in Quimperl\u00e9, on the southern coast of Brittany, learned about his conviction and wrote a letter alerting the hospital director, who passed it along to the local medical board and ordered the surgeon to be accompanied whenever he was with minors, according to France Info.",
      "\u2018A nutcase in Brittany\u2019",
      "The local medical board requested a copy of the conviction, but it took the prosecutor\u2019s office five months to send it, which was then forwarded to state authorities, Lemonier said. \u201cAfter that, they washed their hands of it.\u201d",
      "Back at the hospital, the order requiring the surgeon to be shadowed was never carried out, and Le Scouarnec, whose modus operandi was to isolate victims under the guise of examining them, would go on to abuse at least 54 more victims from 2004 to 2017, all of whom are part of the current case, Lemonier said.",
      "Not all of the victims in the diaries have been pursued by investigators, he said, adding that according to his count the total could top 400.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a chain of failures where nobody wanted to take responsibility,\u201d Lemonier said. \u201cThe police, the courts, the medical association, the hospitals, the health authorities and the state are all responsible.\u201d",
      "The hospital director, Andr\u00e9 Labat, died in 2013. The current administration declined to comment when contacted by NBC News, as did all of the boards that could have imposed sanctions or revoked Le Scouarnec\u2019s medical license, including the local and regional medical boards and the regional health agency. The national Health Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. The local branch of the national police referred questions to the national police press office, which also did not respond.",
      "\u201cThe French authorities were warned that we had a nutcase in Brittany,\u201d said lawyer Maud Touitou, who represents eight victims. She called local oversight boards \u201cbarons\u201d that \u201crevel in their provincial social status, who have no other goal but to continue to have and exercise their little power.\u201d",
      "In June 2008, Le Scouarnec moved to a hospital in Jonzac, about five hours\u2019 drive south, where he was considered the \u201cwise man\u201d on staff, Le Monde reported. The hospital\u2019s former director, Mich\u00e8le Cals, told police in 2017 that she didn\u2019t take \u201cany special measures\u201d when the surgeon told her about his conviction because there had been \u201cno physical aggression,\u201d according to Radio France, which counted more than 20 victims at the Jonzac hospital. Cals could not be reached for comment, and the Jonzac hospital declined to comment.",
      "\u200b\u200bChildren\u2019s advocates are hoping the trial will prompt sweeping changes beyond tougher laws. They are hoping that the accounts of victims will be given greater credence.",
      "For the victims, who have waited nearly eight years since the investigation began to tell their stories \u2014 some have waited decades \u2014 the trial represents a chance to heal.",
      "\u201cThe only fear they have is that the entire trial will focus on Le Scouarnec,\u201d Grimaud said.",
      "\u201cThey want to be recognized.\u201d",
      "Linda Hervieux reported from Paris, and Gabrielle Nolin from London.",
      "If you are a child being abused, or know a child who may be facing abuse, call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at\u00a0(800) 422-4453, or go to\u00a0www.childhelphotline.org. States often have child abuse hotlines, but if you suspect a child\u2019s life is in imminent danger, call 911.",

    "summary": "Mexico has sent 29 drug cartel figures, including drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who was behind the killing of a U.S. DEA agent in 1985, to the United States as the Trump administration turns up the pressure on drug trafficking organizations.",
    "story": [
      "More than two dozen drug cartel suspects from Mexico \u2014\u00a0including the man charged in the 1985 slaying of a U.S. drug agent \u2014\u00a0are in U.S. custody after Mexican officials agreed to send them to the United States, four sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.",
      "The 29 people accused of violence and drug trafficking were deported as the Trump administration has turned up pressure on Mexico to curb illegal immigration, cartel activity and fentanyl production with a promised 25% tariff on all Mexican imports set to start next week.",
      "\u201cFor those of us who have investigated Mexican cartels for many generations, this is truly an historical moment,\" said Ray Donovan, the former chief of operations at the Drug Enforcement Administration. \"We have never seen this many sent from Mexico to the U.S. in one day.\u201d",
      "Among those deported by Mexico is Rafael Caro Quintero, who U.S. officials believe is responsible for the 1985 murder of DEA agent Enrique \u201cKiki\u201d Camarena and others.",
      "Caro Quintero has been on the DEA's most-wanted fugitives list for four decades. \"Today we can proudly say he has arrived in the United States where justice will be served,\u201d acting DEA Administrator Derek S. Maltz said.",
      "The suspects sent to the United States included members of five of the six Mexican\u00a0organized crime groups the Trump administration designated this month as \u201cforeign terrorist organizations.\u201d",
      "Those sent to the United States on Thursday were taken from prisons across Mexico to board planes at an airport north of Mexico City that took them to eight U.S. cities, according to the Mexican government.",
      "Among them were two leaders of the now-defunct\u00a0Los Zetas cartel, Mexicans Miguel Trevi\u00f1o Morales and his brother Omar Trevi\u00f1o Morales, known as Z-40 and Z-42. U.S. authorities have accused the brothers of running the successor Northeast Cartel from prison.",
      "The removal of the Trevi\u00f1o Morales brothers marks the end of a long process that began after the capture in 2013 of Miguel and two years later of his brother Omar. Mexican Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero had described the delay as \u201ctruly shameful.\u201d",
      "A who\u2019s who of Mexican cartels",
      "Besides Caro Quintero, there were cartel leaders, security chiefs from both factions of the Sinaloa cartel, cartel finance operatives and a man wanted in connection with the\u00a0killing of a North Carolina sheriff\u2019s deputy\u00a0in 2022.",
      "Vicente Carrillo Fuentes was among those turned over to the United States. He is a former leader of the Ju\u00e1rez drug cartel, based in the border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, across from El Paso, Texas, and brother of drug lord Amado Carrillo Fuentes, known as \u201cthe Lord of the Skies,\u201d who died in a botched plastic surgery procedure in 1997.",
      "According to prosecutors in both countries, the prisoners sent to the United States on Thursday faced charges related to drug trafficking and in some cases homicide, among other crimes.",
      "\u201cWe will prosecute these criminals to the fullest extent of the law in honor of the brave law enforcement agents who have dedicated their careers \u2014 and in some cases, given their lives \u2014 to protect innocent people from the scourge of violent cartels,\u201d U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.",
      "The deportation of the drug cartel figures coincided with a visit to Washington by Mexican Foreign Affairs Secretary Juan Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente and other top economic and military officials, who met with their U.S. counterparts, including\u00a0Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "In exchange for delaying tariffs, President Donald Trump had insisted that Mexico crack down on cartels, illegal immigration and fentanyl production, despite significant dips in migration and overdoses over the past year.",
      "A longtime DEA target",
      "Mexico\u2019s surprise handover of one of the FBI\u2019s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives was weeks in the making.",
      "Caro Quintero had walked free in 2013 after 28 years in prison when a court overturned his 40-year sentence for the kidnapping and killing of Camarena, the DEA agent, in 1985. The brutal murder marked a low point in U.S.-Mexico relations.",
      "Caro Quintero, the former leader of the Guadalajara cartel, had since returned to drug trafficking and unleashed bloody turf battles in the northern Mexico border state of Sonora until\u00a0Mexican forces arrested him in 2022.",
      "The United States had sought Caro Quintero\u2019s extradition shortly after he was arrested in 2022. But the request remained stuck at Mexico\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry for unknown reasons as President Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s predecessor and political mentor,\u00a0Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, severely curtailed Mexican cooperation with the DEA to protest undercover U.S. law enforcement operations in Mexico targeting senior political and military officials.",
      "\u201cThis moment is extremely personal for the men and women of DEA,\u201d said Maltz, the acting head of the DEA.",
      "Cartels could respond",
      "Mexican security analyst David Saucedo said that since negotiations with the Trump administration began, he had expected the U.S. government to demand three things: an increase in drug seizures, arrests of high-profile drug trafficking suspects and the handing over of drug traffickers the United States has long targeted for extradition.",
      "He called Thursday\u2019s removals \u201can important concession\u201d by Mexico\u2019s government.",
      "The decision also threatens to upend an unwritten understanding \u2014\u00a0with notable exceptions\u00a0\u2014 that Mexican drug lords would serve sentences in Mexican prisons, where they were often able continue to run their illicit businesses, Saucedo said.",
      "\u201cThere will surely be a furious reaction by drug trafficking groups against the Mexican state,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said there is \u201cvalue\u201d in an agreement that President Donald Trump is pursuing on Ukrainian mineral rights to repay some of the $500 billion in military aid that the U.S. has sent in support of the country's war against Russia.",
      "Starmer, who met with Trump at the White House on Thursday to discuss efforts at ending the Russia-Ukraine war and a possible trade deal with the U.S., said in an interview with NBC News that economic ties between Washington and Kyiv could be considered a form of security.",
      "\u201cI can see the value in the approach in relation to minerals,\u201d Starmer said in the interview. \u201cThat\u2019s a matter between President Trump and President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy. But I can see very clearly the argument that President Trump makes in relation to minerals, and I can also see the validity of his points when he says that if there is a deal on minerals then the U.S. has economic interests in Ukraine, which, if you like, form at least one element of any security guarantee.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cThat, in its own right, is an important aspect.\u201d",
      "Trump has been vocal about his interest in settling the yearslong conflict in Ukraine and talked about compensation for the billions of dollars in aid that Washington has provided Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February 2022. But he has shied away from committing to any security guarantees, saying this week that he would ask Europe to take the lead on that.",
      "Earlier in the day, Trump warned that if a peace deal \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen quickly, it may not happen at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody wants peace, everybody wants bloodshed to end. Not least the Ukrainians,\u201d Starmer told NBC News, adding that discussions were already underway on what security would look like.",
      "Asked if Britain can achieve its objectives without U.S. participation, Starmer responded that \u201cthe first thing is to get the European element in place.\u201d",
      "He said Trump \u201cis right\u201d to press for talks to drive forward a deal, while adding words of caution about Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cMy concern is that we know, historically, that Putin might go again,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cHe has ambitions in relation to Ukraine. And therefore, if there\u2019s to be a deal, it has got to be a deal that lasts.\u201d",
      "The Starmer-Trump meeting comes at a sensitive time for the United Kingdom as the prime minister commits to sending British troops to Ukraine to help secure a \u201clasting peace\u201d if a peace deal with Russia is reached.\u201cThe stakes, they couldn\u2019t be higher,\u201d Starmer said during a joint news conference with Trump at the White House. He said it was essential that Ukraine be \u201cbacked by strength that will stop Putin coming back for more.\u201d",
      "Starmer, standing beside Trump, insisted that any deal should put to rest Russian ambitions and committed to putting \u201cboots on the ground and planes in the sky\u201d to limit future incursions into Ukrainian territory.",
      "Trump offered praise to Starmer, greeting him warmly at several junctures throughout the day. The two leaders held a bilateral meeting and continued their discussions on Ukraine and a possible trade deal over lunch, Trump said during the news conference.",
      "Starmer is a \u201cspecial man,\u201d Trump said, adding that they \u201cget along famously.\u201d",
      "The meeting came a day before the president is scheduled to meet with Zelenskyy in Washington, as Trump hopes the U.S and Ukraine can sign an agreement on rare mineral rights.",
      "The deal to jointly develop Ukrainian resources has been envisioned as a step toward an eventual peace deal between Ukraine and Russia."

      "Imprisoned Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan called on his militant group on Thursday to lay down its arms and dissolve as part of a new bid to end a four-decade long conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives.",

      "\u201cConvene your congress and make a decision. All groups must lay their arms and the PKK must dissolve itself,\u201d Ocalan said, according to a message that was relayed by pro-Kurdish party politicians who visited Ocalan earlier in the day.",
      "Ocalan\u2019s momentous announcement is part of a new effort for peace between the group and the Turkish state, that was initiated in October by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli. The far-right politician suggested Ocalan could be granted parole if his group renounces violence and disbands.",
      "Ocalan, 75, has been imprisoned on the island of Imrali, off Istanbul, since 1999 after being convicted of treason. Despite his incarceration, he continues to wield significant influence over the PKK. The group\u2019s leadership is widely expected to heed any call Ocalan makes, although some factions within the group could resist, analysts say.",
      "The peace effort comes at a time when Erdogan may need support from the DEM party in parliament to enact a new constitution that could allow him to stay in power.",
      "The Turkish Constitution doesn\u2019t allow Erdogan, who has been in power since 2003 as prime minister and later as president, to run for office again unless an early election is called \u2014 something that would also require the support of the pro-Kurdish party.",
      "The DEM party has long pressed for greater democracy in Turkey and rights for the country\u2019s Kurdish population, and also to improve conditions for the imprisoned Ocalan.",
      "Founded by Ocalan in 1978, the PKK has led an insurgency in Turkey\u2019s southeast since 1984. The group is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies. Previous peace efforts with the PKK have ended with failure \u2014 the most recent in 2015.",
      "Even amid the latest peace efforts, Erdogan\u2019s government has widened a crackdown on the opposition, arresting journalists and politicians. Several elected Kurdish mayors have been ousted from office and replaced with state-appointed officials.",
      "Thursday\u2019s meeting was the third time DEM party officials have met with Ocalan as part of the peace efforts. The officials have also met with Selahattin Demirtas, an imprisoned former pro-Kurdish party leader, and traveled to Iraq for talks with Kurdish leaders there."

    "story": [
      "The American coach of the Canadian men\u2019s national soccer team blasted President Donald Trump on Wednesday amid icy geopolitical tensions between the neighbors. The fiery rhetoric comes just as the U.S., Canada, and Mexico prepare to co-host the World Cup in 2026, with Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs on both nations looming.",
      "Since winning the presidential election in November, Trump has repeatedly stated that Canada should become America\u2019s 51st state, a thought that doesn\u2019t sit well with Canada\u2019s Wisconsin-born soccer coach Jesse Marsch.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to address the 51st state discourse, which I find unsettling and frankly insulting,\u201d said Marsch while speaking to the press in Los Angeles this week. \u201cIf I have one message to our president, it\u2019s lay off the ridiculous rhetoric about Canada being the 51st state.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs an American, I\u2019m ashamed of the arrogance and disregard that we\u2019ve shown one of our historically oldest, strongest and most loyal allies,\u201d said Marsch.",
      "The Racine native and former U.S. men\u2019s national team player compared the politics of his home nation to that of the country he\u2019s now coaching.",
      "\u201cCanada is a strong, independent nation that\u2019s deep-rooted in decency,\u201d said Marsch, who at one time was touted to take over the U.S. men\u2019s soccer team. \u201cIt\u2019s a place that values high ethics and respect, unlike the polarized, disrespectful and often now hate-fueled climate that\u2019s in the U.S.\u201d",
      "Trump reiterated his desire for the United States to absorb Canada at the first Cabinet meeting\u00a0of his second term on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI say Canada should be our 51st state. It\u2019s not fair for us to be supporting Canada, and if we don\u2019t support them, they don\u2019t subsist as a nation,\u201d Trump said, flanked by his Cabinet appointees and special government employee Elon Musk.",
      "On Thursday morning, Trump blasted Canada and Mexico, writing on his Truth Social social media platform: \u201cDrugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels.\"",
      "While U.S. Customs officials intercepted 20,000 pounds of fentanyl at the Mexican border in 2024, only 43 pounds of fentanyl were intercepted at the Canadian border last year, according to an NBC News analysis of U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.",
      "Trump also said in his post that tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go into effect on Tuesday \"as scheduled.\"",
      "During his Cabinet meeting, Trump outlined the crippling effects his tariffs will have on Canada. \u201cThe tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell cars into the United States. The tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell lumber or anything else into the United States,\u201d he said.",
      "Since Trump\u2019s pugilistic tone toward Canada has taken shape, the tension between the longtime allies has boiled over into the world of sports. Canadian fans have booed the American national anthem before NBA and NHL games, including on Feb. 15 when the U.S. and Canada\u2019s hockey teams faced off in Montreal, where three fights broke out in the first nine seconds.",
      "\u201cThese international tournaments for Canada means something different now,\u201d acknowledged Marsch.",
      "The most highly watched international tournament in all of sports is just over a year and a half away. The World Cup could see the host nations play each other in the knockout rounds amid the backdrop of unprecedented geopolitical dynamics."

      "A man in India has successfully won damages from the country's biggest movie theater in a consumer court after he complained that  having to watch too many advertisements before a movie caused him to miss important work meetings.",
      "In December 2023, Abhishekh M.R., who lives in the city of Bengaluru, paid $10 (826 rupees) for three tickets to see the war drama \u201cSam Bahadur\u201d at a PVR movie theater, records of the Bangalore Urban Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission showed.",
      "The movie, which was scheduled to begin at 4:05 p.m and end at 6:30 p.m., was delayed for nearly half an hour because the theater played what Abhishekh called \u201ctrailers, advertisements and other fillers,\u201d according to his court ruling.",
      "The delay caused him to miss \u201cother arrangements and appointments\u201d scheduled that day, resulting in losses \u201cwhich cannot be calculated in terms of money as a compensation,\u201d the moviegoer told the court.",
      "Abhiskekh demanded nearly $570 in compensatory damages and $60 for \"mental agony\" from the theater giant in January 2024, with a consumer court in the city earlier in the month ruling his favor.",
      "This month, the court said the theater management\u2019s \u201cviolation of the guidelines on the cost of viewers is unjust and unfair,\u201d ordering the chain to pay the plaintiff $320 in damages and $1,150 in regulatory fines.",
      "\u201cMany times viewers will rush to the theater in a hurry \u2026 only on the reason that they are supposed to sit for watching movie at the time they mentioned in the ticket,\u201d the court ruled.",
      "The movie theater giant also violated regulations by playing lengthy commercials instead of government PSAs, the court said, adding movies must start \"as scheduled and mentioned in the ticket.\"",
      "Indian films are known for being long, and usually also include an intermission that can be as long as 15 minutes and consist of advertisements.",
      "\u201cNo one has the right to gain benefit out of others' time and money,\" the court said in its ruling, adding that 30 minutes is too long \"to sit idle in the theatre and watch whatever the theatre telecasts.\u201d"

      "The Chinese government denies accusations that it has committed large-scale abuses against Uyghurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic group who live mainly in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang.",
      "The Thai national police chief, Kitrat Phanphet, told reporters that 40 people had been deported and that officials in China \u201cshowed the sincerity and the intention to take care of this group of\u00a0Chinese Uyghurs.\u201d",
      "The Chinese Ministry of Public Security said 40 Chinese nationals who had entered Thailand illegally had been deported, without saying whether they were Uyghurs.",
      "The deportation was carried out in accordance with the laws of both China and Thailand, the Chinese government said, adding that the legal rights of the individuals involved had been fully protected.",
      "Rights groups and Thai lawmakers condemned the move by the Thai government, which had said earlier that it had no plans to deport the Uyghurs.",
      "\u201cWhat is the Thai government doing?\u201d Thai opposition lawmaker Kannavee Suebsang said in a post on X. \u201cWe have violated their human rights more than enough. There must be a better resolution,\u201d he added.",
      "Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said the deportation by Thailand \u201cconstitutes a blatant violation of Thailand\u2019s obligations under domestic and international laws.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe men now face a high risk of torture, enforced disappearance, and long-term imprisonment in China,\u201d she said in a statement.",

      "Rights groups say Uyghurs in China face discrimination and the suppression of their cultural identity. The U.S. and other Western governments have said that Beijing\u2019s policies on Uyghurs, including the forced detention of possibly a million or more people, amount to genocide.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration said it is eliminating more than 90% of the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said it is eliminating more than 90% of the\u00a0U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s\u00a0foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world, putting numbers on its plans to eliminate the majority of U.S. development and humanitarian help abroad.",
      "The cuts detailed by the administration would leave few surviving USAID projects for advocates to try to save in what are ongoing\u00a0court battles with the administration.",
      "The Trump administration outlined its plans in both an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press and filings in one of those federal lawsuits Wednesday.",
      "The Supreme Court intervened in that case late Wednesday and temporarily blocked a court order requiring the administration to release billions of dollars in foreign aid by midnight.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s disclosures also give an idea of the scale of the administration\u2019s retreat from U.S. aid and development assistance overseas, and from decades of U.S. policy that foreign aid helps U.S. interests by stabilizing other countries and economies and building alliances.",
      "The memo said officials were \u201cclearing significant waste stemming from decades of institutional drift.\u201d More changes are planned in how USAID and the State Department deliver foreign assistance, it said, \u201cto use taxpayer dollars wisely to advance American interests.\u201d",
      "President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0and ally\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0have hit foreign aid harder and faster than almost any other target in their push to cut the size of the federal government. Both men say USAID projects advance a liberal agenda and are a waste of money.",
      "Trump on Jan. 20 ordered what he said would be a 90-day program-by-program review of which foreign assistance programs deserved to continue, and cut off all foreign assistance funds almost overnight.",
      "The funding freeze has stopped thousands of U.S.-funded programs abroad, and the administration and Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency teams have pulled the majority of USAID staff off the job through forced leave and firings.",
      "Widely successful USAID programs credited with containing outbreaks of Ebola and other threats and saving more than 20 million lives in Africa through HIV and AIDS treatment are among those still cut off from agency funds, USAID officials and officials with partner organizations say. Meanwhile, formal notifications of program cancellations are rolling out.",
      "In the federal court filings Wednesday, nonprofits owed money on contracts with USAID describe both Trump political appointees and members of Musk\u2019s teams terminating USAID\u2019s contracts around the world at breakneck speed, without time for any meaningful review, they say.",
      "\u201c\u2018There are MANY more terminations coming, so please gear up!\u2019\u2019\u2019 a USAID official wrote staff Monday, in an email quoted by lawyers for the nonprofits in the filings.",
      "The nonprofits, among thousands of contractors, owed billions of dollars in payment since the freeze began, called the en masse contract terminations a maneuver to get around complying with the order to lift the funding freeze temporarily.",
      "So did a Democratic lawmaker.",
      "The administration was attempting to \u201cblow through Congress and the courts by announcing the completion of their sham \u2018review\u2019 of foreign aid and the immediate termination of thousands of aid programs all over the world,\u201d said Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
      "A coalition representing major U.S. and global businesses and nongovernmental organizations and former officials expressed shock at the move. \u201cThe American people deserve a transparent accounting of what will be lost \u2014 on counterterror, global health, food security, and competition,\u201d the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition said.",
      "The State Department said Secretary of State Marco Rubio had reviewed the terminations.",
      "In all, the Trump administration said it will eliminate 5,800 of 6,200 multiyear USAID contract awards, for a cut of $54 billion. Another 4,100 of 9,100 State Department grants were being eliminated, for a cut of $4.4 billion.",
      "The State Department memo, which was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, described the administration as spurred by a federal court order that gave officials until the end of the day Wednesday to lift the Trump administration\u2019s monthlong block on foreign aid funding.",
      "\u201cIn response, State and USAID moved rapidly,\u201d targeting USAID and State Department foreign aid programs in vast numbers for contract terminations, the memo said.",
      "Trump administration officials \u2014 after repeated warnings from the federal judge in the case \u2014 also said Wednesday they were finally beginning to send out their first or any payments after more than a month with no known spending. Officials were processing a few million dollars of back payments, officials said, owed to U.S. and international organizations and companies.",
      "But U.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali\u2019s order to unfreeze billions of dollars by midnight Wednesday will remain on hold until the Supreme Court has a chance to weigh in more fully, according to the brief order signed by Chief Justice John Roberts.",
      "Ali had ordered the federal government to comply with his decision temporarily blocking a freeze on foreign aid, ruling in a lawsuit filed by nonprofit groups and businesses. An appellate panel refused the administration\u2019s request to intervene before the high court weighed in.",
      "The plaintiffs have until noon Friday to respond, Roberts said.",
      "The administration has filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court in one other case so far, arguing that a lower court was wrong to reinstate the head of a federal watchdog agency after Trump fired him."

      "The stock of\u00a0uranium\u00a0enriched to up to 60% fissile purity, close to the roughly 90% of bomb grade, has been a long-standing concern for Western powers, which say there is no civil justification for enriching\u00a0uranium\u00a0to such a high level.\u00a0Iran\u00a0says it seeks only peaceful nuclear energy.",
      "While President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has said it plans to pressure\u00a0Iran\u00a0over its nuclear program, the International Atomic Energy Agency has\u00a0said\u00a0time is running out for diplomacy to impose new restrictions on\u00a0Iran\u2019s activities.",
      "\u201cThe significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched\u00a0uranium\u00a0by\u00a0Iran, the only non-nuclear weapon state to produce such nuclear material, is of serious concern,\u201d the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a passage that, unusually, was included in both its quarterly reports\u00a0on\u00a0Iran.",
      "Those confidential reports, sent to member states on Wednesday and both seen by Reuters, showed that while the stock of 60% material grew by half, there was no real progress on resolving long-running outstanding issues including the unexplained presence of\u00a0uranium\u00a0traces at undeclared sites.",
      "The stock of\u00a0uranium\u00a0refined to up to 60% in the form of\u00a0uranium\u00a0hexafluoride grew by 92.5 kg in the past quarter to 274.8 kg, one of two confidential IAEA reports said.",

This is just short of the 42 kg that is enough in principle for one bomb, if refined further.",

      "During his first term as president, Trump withdrew the United States from a landmark deal between\u00a0Iran\u00a0and major powers that placed strict limits on Tehran\u2019s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. After Trump pulled out in 2018,\u00a0Iran\u00a0breached and far surpassed those limits.",
      "With the deal now largely in tatters, European powers are seeking to either have the U.S. help agree to new limits on\u00a0Iran\u2019s nuclear program or use a mechanism in the deal to reimpose all sanctions before the deal expires in October."
