      "Hanks was scheduled to receive the 2025 Sylvanus Thayer Award on Sept. 25, but the U.S. Military Academy's alumni association canceled the ceremony last week, according to news reports.",
      "\u201cImportant move!\u201d Trump said in a post on his social media network Monday. \u201cWe don\u2019t need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards!!! Hopefully the Academy Awards, and other Fake Award Shows, will review their Standards and Practices in the name of Fairness and Justice.\u201d",
      "West Point, its alumni association and a representative for Hanks did not immediately respond to messages and calls seeking comment Monday.",
      "It comes as Trump has moved to direct the ideology and leadership of higher education institutes and the military in his second term, seeking to assert control with a mix of executive orders and threats of legal action and withholding funds.",
      "This summer, the Army secretary directed West Point to review its hiring practices, bar outside groups from choosing employees and remove a newly announced hire who led the nation\u2019s cybersecurity agency under then-President Joe Biden.",
      "Earlier this year, West Point disbanded a dozen cadet clubs centered on ethnicity, gender, race and sexuality in response to the Trump administration\u2019s push to eliminate diversity programs throughout government. The school also rehung a painting of Gen. Robert E. Lee dressed in his Confederate uniform in the library as the Trump administration has pushed to restore Confederate names and monuments that have been removed in recent years.",
      "The Sylvanus Thayer Award award is named for an early superintendent of the military academy who is known as the \u201cFather of West Point.\" It has been given out every year since 1958 \u201cto an outstanding citizen of the United States whose service and accomplishments in the national interest exemplify personal devotion to the ideals expressed in West Point\u2019s motto: \u2018Duty, Honor, Country,\u2019\u201d according to the West Point Association of Graduates.",

      "Retired Army Col. Mark Bieger, president and chief executive officer of the association, wrote in an email Friday that the decision to call off the award ceremony \u201callows the Academy to continue its focus on its core mission of preparing cadets to lead, fight, and win as officers in the world\u2019s most lethal force, the United States Army,\u201d according to The Washington Post, which was first to report on the cancellation.",

He called the then-Republican candidate a \u201cself-involved gasbag\u201d during an on-stage interview in 2016.

      "She said there \u201chas been a lot of clear polarization\u201d that has \u201cspilled over into a bad place, spilled into a bad place when it comes to these acts of political violence.\u201d",

      "\u201cFor example, when a former president was indicted \u2014 a historical first \u2014 the court took the case to decide whether he could be prosecuted for his official acts,\u201d Barrett wrote. She joined most of Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 majority opinion.",

      "The court's consideration of the president and executive power \"necessarily has to be detached from the current occupant of the office because ... the court has to think about things in the context of the broad sweep of history, of the presidents who have come before and the presidents who will come later. And so the court in deciding cases about executive power, it really is focused on the presidency rather than the president,\u201d Barrett said.",
      "In the interview and in subsequent public appearances, Barrett downplayed the idea that the nation is facing a constitutional crisis or dealing with unprecedented events.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say when you look over all of history that there haven\u2019t been times in which that disagreement has been even more acute,\u201d she said, listing the Civil War, Vietnam war protests and the Great Depression.",
      "The book is being published Tuesday by Sentinel, a conservative imprint of Penguin Random House.",
      "Barrett wrote clearly on two topics that suggest some disagreement with the president. Trump signed an executive order last month requiring the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute people for burning the American flag, despite a 1989 high court decision protecting the act as political speech.",

      "In the book, Barrett offered a defense of the decision.",
      "\u201cIf the Constitution places a matter beyond the reach of democratic majorities, the Court must vigilantly and fearlessly enforce that choice. Otherwise, the Court must leave the matter to the democratic process, which requires citizens to persuade one another rather than a handful of Supreme Court justices,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThese points animate the Court's reasoning in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which holds that the Constitution leaves the regulation of abortion to the democratic process.\u201d",
      "As she approaches the five-year anniversary of her confirmation, Barrett said the biggest changes in her life deal with ever-present security and that \u201cyou can never feel completely free.\u201d",
      "Last week, Barrett said she passed on dancing at a wedding until the very end, when Aretha Franklin's \u201cRespect\u201d began to play. \u201cI just started kind of twirling around my niece a little bit, and all of a sudden I see my sister take off across the floor, and somebody had a phone out and they were recording me,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cShe went up, and she said, \u2018I want you to delete that.\u2019\u201d",

There are, after all, plenty of fascinating figures \u2014 beyond the celebrity kind \u2014 to be found on the Lido.",
      "Here's a look at this year's Venice Film Festival, by the numbers.",
      "That figure includes 1,936 feature films, which cost 200 euros ($234) apiece to submit. To be eligible for selection, a film must have been completed after Sept. 7, 2024, and must be making its world premiere at Venice. The festival decides what section a selected film goes in.",
      "It amounts to slightly over 1% of the feature films submitted. The 21 movies were the ones eligible for awards like the Golden Lion, which was won this year by Jim Jarmusch's \u201cFather Mother Sister Bother.\u201d There were also 30 films making their world premieres at Venice, but out of competition, like Luca Guadagnino's \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d Nineteen films played in the Horizons (Orizzonti) sidebar, which has its own awards. The Venice Classics sidebar featured 18 restorations.",
      "Led by American director Alexander Payne, the jury included French director St\u00e9phane Briz\u00e9, Italian director Maura Delpero, Romanian director Cristian Mungiu, Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof (he lives in exile in Germany), Brazilian actor Fernanda Torres and Chinese actor Zhao Tao. They decide the winners among the main competition.",
      "The applause meter at film festivals is notoriously faulty, calibrated differently outlet by outlet, but it was clear that the ovation for \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab\u201d was record-breaking and definitely over 20 minutes. Variety reported 22 and BBC had it at 23. Kaouther Ben Hania's movie easily surpassed last year's Golden Lion winner, Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d which had people on their feet for 18 minutes.",
      "Doing the math, that's definitely more than 82 years ago. The festival has been suspended or periodically taken different forms over the years, including during World War II \u2014 though it did go forward in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Selections hailed from far and wide, from the U.S., France and, of course, Italy, to Ecuador, Slovakia and Taipei.",
      "There's space for short films \u2014 20 minutes and under \u2014 and feature films \u2014 longer than 60 minutes \u2014 but woe betide the filmmaker who makes anything in between.",
      "That distinction belongs to Olivier Assayas\u2019 \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin,\u201d an adaptation of Giuliano da Empoli\u2019s bestselling book of the same name, in which Jude Law transforms into Vladimir Putin.",
      "The longest ovation went to the shortest film in competition, \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab.\u201d Ben Hania's film combines real audio from Hind Rajab, the Palestinian 6-year-old girl who was found dead days after her desperate call for rescue in Gaza, with actors portraying volunteers at the Red Crescent, where the movie is set.",
      "Israel's war in Gaza reverberated through the festival, with high-profile calls to disinvite Gerard Butler and Gal Gadot over the war and questions to filmmakers and actors about an indie film company\u2019s funding ties to the Israeli military. The Aug. 30 march in Venice aimed to turn the spotlight from the stars to the war, and organizers estimate that over 10,000 people turned out.",
      "Those Golden Lions went to Kim Novak, the 92-year-old legendary actor who starred in Alfred Hitchcock's \u201cVertigo,\u201d and Werner Herzog, the prolific 83-year-old German filmmaker whose works range from lauded documentaries like \u201cLittle Dieter Needs to Fly\u201d to the Nicolas Cage-starrer \u201cBad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans.\u201d (He also acts, as viewers of \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d can attest.)",

      "The Belmond hotel is where George Clooney, Adam Sandler, Julia Roberts and more stars stayed during the festival. On a separate island from the Lido, its location offers celebrities a tad more privacy.",
      "The cocktail was invented by bartender Walter Bolzonella with Clooney, at the Cipriani\u2019s Bar Gabbiano. Described on the menu as \u201cfresh, fruity, low alcohol,\u201d it's made with vodka, lime, ginger, cucumber and cranberry. (For the record, it's not more expensive than the hotel's other signature cocktails.)",
      "That\u2019s the recipe Italian spirits maker Campari advises when it comes to the simple, refreshing cocktail that\u2019s a staple of the Venice Film Festival. Usually selling for 4 euros, the spritzes are ubiquitous around the festival's HQ.",
      "The Venice Film Festival doesn't take place in the heart of the city, which would be the Piazza San Marco. Instead, it's on the Lido, a barrier island across the Venetian Lagoon. The Palazzo del Cinema, featuring three movie theaters, is the main headquarters of the festival. It takes 32 minutes to make the journey, by vaporetto, the public water bus. (For good measure, pun somewhat intended, 4.5 kilometers is just under 3 miles.)",
      "Over the decades, few tableaux are as glamorous as movies stars arriving, stylishly disheveled, by launch to the festival. Ferried to and from the Lido, celebrities, journalists and members of the public with passes cross the Venetian Lagoon. Should they fall overboard, they would contend with a depth of up to 71 feet (21 meters).",
      "The historic theater is home to the biggest screenings at the festival, as well as the awards ceremonies. It includes four additional spaces for people in wheelchairs.",
      "Every film shown at Venice has to have subtitles burned in: Non-Italian-language movies must have Italian subtitles, and Italian-language movies must have English subtitles. (All films are shown with English subtitles projected off-screen.) The festival's detailed subtitling guidelines suggest opting for white on-screen subtitles. And, yes, the festival has a preferred font. Much like the Microsoft Office of yore, it's Arial.",

      "The 82nd Venice Film Festival has wrapped up, but the buzz continues",
      "The 82nd Venice Film Festival may be over, but the conversations on the films that premiered, the things people said, the clothes they wore, and how it affects the Oscar race are still going.",
      "Here\u2019s a rundown of the big moments and takeaways from this year\u2019s edition.",
      "Jim Jarmusch\u2019s quiet film \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother\u201d took the top prize, the Golden Lion. It was a surprise to many who expected that honor to go to \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab,\u201d which ended up with the runner up award, or \u201cNo Other Choice.\u201d",
      "Aside from Benny Safdie\u2019s best director win for \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d Hollywood players were largely shut out of the awards in favor of a diverse, international selection. Chinese actor Xin Zhilei won best actress for Cai Shangjun\u2019s \u201cThe Sun Rises on Us All,\u201d Italian icon Toni Servillo won best actor for \u201cLa Grazia\u201d and Swiss actor Luna Wedler took the up-and-comer prize, the Marcello Mastroianni Award, for \u201cSilent Friend.\u201d",
      "The awards didn\u2019t give many hints, but Venice has been known to launch several best actor campaigns including Joaquin Phoenix in \u201cJoker,\u201dBrendan Fraser in \u201cThe Whale\u201d and Adrien Brody in \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d This year the most obvious heavyweight to follow is Dwayne Johnson for his turn as MMA fighter Mark Kerr in \u201cThe Smashing Machine.\u201d",
      "Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons were also strange and fierce as kidnapped and kidnapper in Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s provocative \u201cBugonia.\u201d Oscar Isaac portrayed Victor Frankenstein as a romantic madman and Jacob Elordi was na\u00efve and raw as the monster. Amanda Seyfried put a human, feminist, face to the religious sect the shakers in \u201cThe Testament of Ann Lee,\u201d and Julia Roberts flexed her acting muscles as a Yale philosophy professor in the midst of a misconduct accusation against a colleague in \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d",
      "Filmmakers like Kathryn Bigelow and previous Golden Lion winners Guillermo del Toro and Yorgos Lanthimos will also likely be in the conversation for months to come.",
      "There\u2019s always some unexpected Hollywood person at the Venice Film Festival who doesn\u2019t seem to be associated with any one film. Sometimes they\u2019ve come in for amfAR, sometimes they\u2019ve been invited by one of the festival\u2019s sponsors. But text chains started blowing up when Seth Rogen started popping up everywhere: Red carpets, press conferences, parties. Don\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s a Venice episode of \u201cThe Studio\u201d in the works: This trip was research, and maybe even a little more.",
      "In a cute, unexpected (possibly highly staged) moment during the festival, Amanda Seyfried commented on Julia Roberts\u2019 Instagram asking to \u201cplease let me wear the same outfit.\u201d Three days later, Seyfried was also rocking the Versace blazer, jeans, button up and belt, just with different shoes. It helps that they share a stylist, Elizabeth Stewart.",
      "First, let\u2019s just make clear that entertainment trade publications only started tracking Venice standing ovations recently. This year, audiences at the premiere of \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab\u201d applauded for 22-minutes, surpassing the 18-minute record set last year by \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d which went on to win the Golden Lion. Even with a limited data set, that\u2019s a long time to clap after a movie.",
      "Other standing ovation times from the 82nd festival: \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d ((tilde)5 minutes), \u201cBugonia\u201d ((tilde)6 minutes), \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d ((tilde)7 minutes), \u201cJay Kelly\u201d ((tilde)9 minutes), \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin\u201d ((tilde)10 minutes), \u201cA House of Dynamite\u201d ((tilde)11 minutes), \u201cFrankenstein\u201d ((tilde)14 minutes), \u201cThe Testament of Ann Lee\u201d ((tilde)15 minutes), \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d ((tilde)15 minutes).",
      "The festival might not take political stances, but politics, and filmmakers grappling with the state of the world, from the Israel-Hamas conflict to nuclear weapons, were clearly top of mind. Kathryn Bigelow set off a warning shot about nuclear weapons and the apparatus of decision making with her urgent, and distressingly realistic, thriller \u201cA House of Dynamite.\u201d Tunisian filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania made an essential document of the human toll in Gaza with \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab.\u201d And Olivier Assayas charted the rise of Vladimir Putin in \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin.\u201d",

      "The documentary \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d directed by Colin Hanks and produced by Ryan Reynolds, is a tribute not just to Candy the actor, but Candy, the man",
      "TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) \u2014 \u201cI wish I had more bad things to say about him,\u201d Bill Murray says in the opening moments of the documentary \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me.\u201d",
      "It has always been hard to find a negative word about Candy. The great Canadian comedian and actor not only radiated a warm, down-to-earth friendliness in movies like \u201cPlanes, Trains and Automobiles,\u201d \u201cUncle Buck\u201d and \u201cThe Great Outdoors,\u201d he was that way off screen, too. As Mel Brooks says in the film, \u201cHe was a total actor because he was a total person.\u201d",
      "\u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d directed by Colin Hanks and produced by Ryan Reynolds, is a tribute not just to Candy the actor, but Candy, the man. On Thursday night, it premieres as the opening night film of the Toronto International Film Festival. For a beloved Canadian icon like Candy, whose nickname was \u201cJohnny Toronto,\u201d the setting could hardly be more fitting. To reference Candy\u2019s cameo in \u201cThe Blues Brothers,\u201d it\u2019s an occasion that calls for orange whips, all around.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the amount of meetings we had about when the movie can be made, and maybe we can do this festival or that,\u201d Hanks says. \u201cAnd I just kept thinking in the back of my mind: Well, this is a gigantic waste of time. It should just be at Toronto. Period. The End.\u201d",
      "\u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d which will debut on Prime Video on Oct. 10, is a kind of cinematic eulogy for Candy, who died of heart failure at the age of 43 in 1994. Long ago as that was, \u201cI Like Me\u201d is the first feature documentary to tackle Candy, who might be even more popular three decades after his death.",
      "\u201cPart of me hates the fact that John maybe never really saw how beloved he was,\u201d Reynolds says. \u201cHe left something really lasting. He died of a heart failure and ironically the thing he left behind was his heart. That\u2019s the thing that stays.\u201d",
      "Hanks, Reynolds and Candy\u2019s children, Jennifer and Chris Candy, spoke in interviews before the TIFF opening about the making of \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d the title of which comes from one of Candy\u2019s most memorable lines from \u201cTrains, Planes and Automobiles.\u201d But it also serves as a guiding ethos to the documentary.",
      "Candy, who grew up in working-class Ontario and whose father also died young, had his own long-range struggles with that loss. He also, through a people-pleasing smile, dealt with the sometimes insensitive way his size was discussed in the media. Says Reynolds: \u201cHe was self-effacing his work, but not self-loathing. He didn\u2019t make a sport of punching down, not even on himself.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe left, but he did leave us some tools to get through this,\u201d says Chris Candy, 40, speaking alongside his 45-year-old sister. \u201cThat would be through the way he raised us and also saying it\u2019s OK to talk to someone if you have heavy feelings.\u201d",
      "For the Candys, \u201cI Like Me\u201d is an extremely emotional experience but one they\u2019re grateful for. They have each navigated their own way through an upbringing marked by their father\u2019s loss. It was years before Chris could visit his father\u2019s grave site or rewatch his movies. Once he did, he was astonished at his father\u2019s talent.",
      "For Jennifer, her father's movies helped carry her through grief.",
      "\u201cI jumped in and watched everything. All through college, I made sure I had the whole DVD collection,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me that was a constant reminder to hear his voice. We had cassette tapes of his \u2018Radio Kandy\u2019 show that I would just listen to all the time in the car during high school.\u201d",

      "Hanks, whose directorial work includes the 2015 documentary \u201cAll Things Must Pass: The Rise and Fall of Tower Records,\u201d wanted to find a thread for the film that went beyond tribute. To him, the movie is about drilling down on what gave Candy such an everyman quality. What made him, to millions, like their Uncle Buck. Hanks experienced Candy's effect firsthand as a child visiting his father, Tom Hanks, on the set of \u201cSplash.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have vivid memories of visiting on set. He was just one of my parents\u2019 friends, someone they worked with,\u201d says Hanks. \u201cHe had a way, even as a kid, of making you feel incredibly important.\u201d",
      "\u201cI had been on the periphery of the most intense fame you can have, as well as a much smaller version myself,\u201d adds Hanks. \u201cIt is an adjustment. It is hard to navigate. Not that it\u2019s not amazing and great, but that idea of how much you can actually give of yourself to people.\u201d",
      "Reynolds, born and raised in Vancouver, has been a fan of Candy\u2019s since growing up watching \u201cSCTV\u201d reruns. His fondness for Candy, in many ways, has been an influence throughout his career.",
      "\u201cI feel like in the bigger movies I\u2019m always either Del Griffith or Neil Page, from \u201cPlanes, Trains,\u201d says Reynolds. \u201cI tend to really fluctuate back and forth between those guys.\u201d",
      "As his own fame grew, alongside with his ability to take some authorship of his films, Reynolds has populated his movies with references to Candy. Easter eggs adorn the \u201cDeadpool\u201d films. In one moment, he utters the \u201cI like me,\u201d albeit in a much different context. Reynolds had the prop department make a mug with the same quote. A Chrysler LeBaron appears in the background of another scene. He even licensed the book \u201cThe Canadian Mounted: A Trivia Guide to Planes, Trains\u201d so it could make a cameo in all the \u201cDeadpool\u201d movies.",
      "\u201cI like having him around,\u201d says Reynolds. \u201cI feel safer. I feel better. I also feel maybe just a skosh more honest.\u201d",
      "\u201cJohn was a good person when nobody was watching, and I think that\u2019s an increasingly scarce resource these days, in an age where everything is not only seen, it\u2019s perfection,\u201d Reynolds adds. \u201cIt\u2019s like an epidemic. All we see is perfection and curation. Nobody wants to try anything new because nobody\u2019s willing to suck at anything.\u201d",
      "For Jennifer and Chris, \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d awash in memories of their father,\u201d is a kind of time capsule that, like their dad's other movies and radio show recordings, will be long treasured.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m fortunate that I will always have this,\u201d says Chris. \u201cAnd I love it for that.\u201d",

      "TOKYO -- A three-hour film about the esoteric world of Kabuki is defying the odds at the Japanese box office, with tickets selling out at some cinemas.",
      "\u201cKokuho,\u201d which means \u201cnational treasure,\u201d has already grossed more than 10 billion yen ($68 million), making it the second-highest grossing Japanese live-action film of all time, and the first to achieve that in more than two decades.",
      "It stars heartthrobs Ryo Yoshizawa and Ryusei Yokohama who portray longtime rivals and soulmates. They are both Kabuki \u201connagata\u201d actors, meaning they specialize in women roles, from gorgeous princesses to damsels in distress.",
      "They look stunning, and convincing, having gone through months of training with a real Kabuki actor.",
      "Japan has submitted the film for the international feature category at the Academy Awards. The short list of the 15 films from which the final nominations come will be announced Dec. 16.",
      "\u201cKohuko\u201d got a favorable reception at the Cannes Film Festival. And it's been seen 7.4 million times in the first 73 days in Japanese theaters, many of them repeat viewers.",
      "The plot of \u201cKokuho\u201d \u2014 pronounced Koh-koo-hoe \u2014 explores perennial themes of family and the grueling hardships of being an artist, set to the backdrop of the intense but dreamlike life of the Kabuki actor.",
      "It also pays homage to old-style yakuza movies, as well as obliquely to Western gangster films, like \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d because one of the heroes is the son of a gangster.",
      "In short, it\u2019s not the kind of material that usually makes a hit movie in Japan, where action-packed blockbusters or animation based on popular manga comics or spectacular special effects have drawn audiences in the past.",
      "But the movie\u2019s theme explores something intrinsically Japanese and hit a raw nerve in a country where soul-searching about national pride is on the rise amid a widespread perception that economic and political clout is on the decline.",
      "Being an outsider was the theme that jumped out for tourism science scholar Yosuke Kon.",
      "\u201cThe Kabuki world seems very special, but a Kabuki kind of mentality exists in many places in Japan,\u201d he told The Associated Press, noting a closed mentality is prevalent in the village, as well as local governments he has worked with.",
      "\u201cMany people can relate to the film,\u201d he added.",
      "The film is dominated by stage scenes from Kabuki, an art form dating to the 17th century, which combines stylized dance and acting to live music. It\u2019s been stereotyped as catering to old people, as younger generations turn to Western and modern forms of entertainment like boys\u2019 bands, baseball games and streaming services.",
      "In Kabuki, all the roles are played by men, wearing thick makeup and elaborate kimono, delivering sing-song lines in tales of intrigue and violence set in the samurai era.",
      "The film shows the dazzling esoteric elements of Kabuki, such as the backstage where actors apply makeup with their fingertips, or the flutter of paper snowflakes or flower petals on the stage.",

      "\u201cThe beauty of the cinematography was utterly amazing,\u201d said Miho Anzai, a nutritionist, who saw the film after hearing so much about it. She was especially impressed with the younger actors who portrayed the characters as children.",
      "\u201cThe work was superb in how realistically Kabuki actors and their fiercely strict yet delicate aesthetic were portrayed,\u201d she said.",
      "Hiroyuki Okada, a teacher in the traditional \u201cikebana\u201d flower arrangement, said the film gave him a sense of satisfaction as though he had seen high quality theater, and that the characters seemed to represent light and darkness, or the Asian duality of \u201cyin and yang.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt the work depicted a tasteful pursuit of madness,\u201d he said.",
      "The success of the film has sparked interest in the two-volume best-selling book by Shuichi Yoshida it is based on. Yoshida worked as a stagehand for several years to learn the workings of Kabuki.",
      "The film has been brought to the screen by acclaimed director Sang-il Lee, whose credits include the 2007 award-winning film \u201cHula Girls\u201d and the 2022 Apple TV series \u201cPachinko,\u201d as well as the Japanese-language version of Clint Eastwood\u2019s \u201cUnforgiven.\u201d",

His camera angles give a delightfully new and pensive perspective on Kabuki, whose official footage tends to make a point of showing full-body shots.",
      "Lee was deeply moved to see people watching his film, glued to the screen. The scene was straight out of the movies, he recalled",
      "\u201cThere the barriers of generations were gone, living proof that everyone is searching for the moment that truly touches our emotions, knowing how beautiful those tears that flow for no reason can be,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cFilms are so wonderful. They are worth the fight.\u201d",

      "Artificial intelligence company Anthropic has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit by book authors who say the company took pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot",
      "NEW YORK -- Artificial intelligence company Anthropic has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit by book authors who say the company took pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot.",
      "The landmark settlement, if approved by a judge as soon as Monday, could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement.",
      "The company has agreed to pay authors or publishers about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement.",
      "\u201cAs best as we can tell, it\u2019s the largest copyright recovery ever,\u201d said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \u201cIt is the first of its kind in the AI era.\u201d",
      "A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "A federal judge dealt the case a mixed ruling in June, finding that training AI chatbots on copyrighted books wasn\u2019t illegal but that Anthropic wrongfully acquired millions of books through pirate websites.",
      "If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.",
      "\u201cWe were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,\u201d said William Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Anthropic said in a statement Friday that the settlement, if approved, \u201cwill resolve the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining legacy claims.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems,\u201d said Aparna Sridhar, the company's deputy general counsel.",
      "As part of the settlement, the company has also agreed to destroy the original book files it downloaded.",
      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic\u2019s Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup\u2019s June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \u201cknew had been pirated.\u201d It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \u201cThe Lost Night\u201d by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",

The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \u201can excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors\u2019 works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\u201d",
      "The Danish Rights Alliance, which successfully fought to take down one of those shadow libraries, said Friday that the settlement would be of little help to European writers and publishers whose works aren\u2019t registered with the U.S. Copyright Office.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s comforting to see that compiling AI training datasets by downloading millions of books from known illegal file-sharing sites comes at a price,\u201d said Thomas Heldrup, the group\u2019s head of content protection and enforcement.",
      "On the other hand, Heldrup said it fits a tech industry playbook to grow a business first and later pay a relatively small fine, compared to the size of the business, for breaking the rules.",
      "\u201cIt is my understanding that these companies see a settlement like the Anthropic one as a price of conducting business in a fiercely competitive space,\u201d Heldrup said.",
      "The privately held Anthropic, founded by ex-OpenAI leaders in 2021, earlier this week put its value at $183 billion after raising another $13 billion in investments.",
      "Anthropic also said it expects to make $5 billion in sales this year, but, like OpenAI and many other AI startups, it has never reported making a profit, relying instead on investors to back the high costs of developing AI technology for the expectation of future payoffs.",
      "The settlement could influence other disputes, including an ongoing lawsuit by authors and newspapers against OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft, and cases against Metaand Midjourney. And just as the Anthropic settlement terms were filed, another group of authors sued Apple on Friday in the same San Francisco federal court.",
      "\u201cThis indicates that maybe for other cases, it\u2019s possible for creators and AI companies to reach settlements without having to essentially go for broke in court,\u201d said Long, the legal analyst.",
      "The industry, including Anthropic, had largely praised Alsup\u2019s June ruling because he found that training AI systems on copyrighted works so chatbots can produce their own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative.\u201d",
      "Comparing the AI model to \u201cany reader aspiring to be a writer,\u201d Alsup wrote that Anthropic \"trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them \u2014 but to turn a hard corner and create something different.\"",
      "But documents disclosed in court showed Anthropic employees\u2019 internal concerns about the legality of their use of pirate sites. The company later shifted its approach and hired Tom Turvey, the former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "With his help, Anthropic began buying books in bulk, tearing off the bindings and scanning each page before feeding the digitized versions into its AI model, according to court documents. That was legal but didn\u2019t undo the earlier piracy, according to the judge.",

      "The unlikely connection between the pop superstar \u2014 whose fianc\u00e9 is Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce \u2014 and one of the most popular clubs in soccer-mad Brazil lies in the release date of her albums dating to 2006.

      "It all started as a joke about five years ago, but it has developed into a superstition for local fans.",

Taylor\u2019s first contract was signed on Sept. 1, that\u2019s the same day Corinthians was founded in 1910,\u201d said Rebeca Gois, 32, a marketing writer who lives near the stadium and is a Swift fan. \u201cIt has become a thing.

      "For Giorgio Armani, it was always the clothes",
      "MILAN -- For Giorgio Armani, it was always the clothes. And his clothes all started with the fabrics.",
      "While other fashion empires make their money on handbags and footwear, Armani\u2019s appeal has always been in the apparel, the core of his $10 billion empire.",
      "After his death Thursday at the age of 91, Armani has been remembered for softening the 1980s power suit, decades of fruitful Hollywood collaborations and as a defining figure of Italian luxury ready-to-wear.",
      "But he was also a keen business owner who maintained his independence in an era of consolidation, an innovative communicator and a boss who was in charge of every aspect of his business.",
      "\u201cI have to say, King George is the first in everything. The first but not the only,\u2019\u2019 said Mario Boselli, who was president of the Italian fashion chamber from 1999-2015. \u201cHe was the master of luxury ready-to-wear.\u201d",
      "The deconstructed, soft-shouldered Armani jacket catapulted Armani to fashion stardom, first with Richard Gere in the 1980 film \u201cAmerican Gigolo,\u2019\u2019 and then as the centerpiece of a women\u2019s wardrobe.",
      "\u201cI would say that the famous Armani jacket was a discovery that allowed women to live every day with an Armani garment that could go from work to dates. Armani could dress a woman from morning to evening, I would say with great precision, for every occasion,\u2019\u2019 Boselli said.",
      "Armani himself said in his 2015 memoir he wanted to create \u201ca new kind of femininity that forced men to look at women with new eyes.\u2019\u2019",
      "\u201cI have great esteem for women. I think they know how to be seductive without resorting to an exhibitionism that easily slips into vulgarity and excess,\u2019\u2019 Armani wrote. He credited American women as \u201cthe first to appreciate my work \u2014 and my audacity.\u2019\u2019",
      "Jackets remained the core of his collections through the decades. But with time he introduced more couture elements into his ready-to-wear in part to counter his image as the power suit designer, said Scott Schuman, the Milan-based photographer behind The Sartorialist fashion blog and the creator of the Armani tribute Instagram account @armaniarchive.",
      "Every collection started with a cascade of textiles on a huge table, which Armani himself would examine after his team made a first selection.",
      "\u201cThe collection, and the mood and the vibe started from the fabrics,\u2019\u2019 said Milan-based Austrian designer Arthur Arbesser, who was on the Armani design team for seven years until leaving in 2013 to launch his own brand.",
      "\u201cThat was unique, I learned from him what it was to touch the fabrics, then to come in with another fabric and with another shade to form a gradient of colors,\u2019\u2019 Arbesser said.",
      "Boselli first met Armani 45 years ago, arriving at his Borgnonuovo offices with a satchel of jersey knit samples as a sales rep for his family\u2019s textile company.",
      "\u201cHe saw the entire collection of fabrics, and chose them personally,\u2019\u2019 Boselli recalled. \u201cThat is not something everyone does. It takes time, it takes care. He had great respect for the work of others.\u2019\u2019",

But Armani always had a following, from Hollywood stars who could count on him for stunning looks without too much risk, to everyday people who sought well-made, tailored looks to project them from morning to evening.",
      "\u201cArmani was a beautiful river of design. You could pop in and out, and there was some kind of continuity,\u2019\u2019 Schuman said.",
      "Kenneth Richard, founder of The Impression, an influential fashion newsletter, called Armani \"the original game-changer,'' for the scale of a fashion empire he built himself, and for extending his brand into areas like home decor and hotels while maintaining his famed attention to detail.",
      "\u201cYou can check into an Armani hotel, get fitted downstairs and go to a red carpet event. Where else can you do this? You are sleeping on Armani sheets, in an Armani bed, with an Armani couch,'' Richard said. And all of it is owned by Armani, not licensed as many brands do.",
      "On the runway, Armani \u201cstuck to a singular voice through 50 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis aesthetic was refined, and approachable. You cannot become a $10 billion brand when you are consistently doing the same thing over and over again, without being approachable. He sells. People want to wear his clothing.\u201d",
      "Giorgio Armani's final collection will be previewed during Milan Fashion Week later this month during an event marking 50 years of his signature fashion house.",
      "Armani set up a foundation as a succession tool to avoid his businesses being split up. A rarity in the Italian fashion world, he never sold even a part of his company to an outsider.",
      "He also indicated the creative succession would go to longtime collaborator Leo Dell\u2019Orco and his niece Silvana Armani, who have headed the menswear and womenswear collections, respectively, for all Armani collections: Giorgio Armani, Emporio Armani and Armani Exchange.",
      "The question of generational succession has always been a fraught one in Italy's largely family run fashion industry. Armani's attention to every detail in the empire he launched 50 years ago will make him a tough act to follow.",
      "\u201cHe was involved in very step of the process from the very beginning to the end. Every photograph, every font, everything,'' Arbesser said. \"That is what makes a difference. These days, there is no boss, no creative director, who has so much control over everything. That is where the magic is. And that is where it is hard to see what is going to happen now.\u201d",

      "\u201cMy grandfather was the real thing: a larger than life paradox from the old world; a consummate dreamer saddled with a scientific brain. He spoke half a dozen languages and solved complicated mathematical problems for fun, but his heart truly belonged to the written and visual arts,\u201d Adams said.",
      "While brother Gregory Hemingway had a deeply troubled relationship with his famous parent, Patrick Hemingway spoke proudly of his background and welcomed the chance to bring up the family name or get behind a project he thought could sell or attract critical attention. In the 2022 book \u201cDear Papa: The Letters of Patrick and Ernest Hemingway,\u201d father and son share stories of hunting and fishing and express mutual affection, with the author telling Patrick that \u201cI would rather fish with you and shoot with you than anybody that I have ever known since I was a boy and this is not because we are related.\u201d",

The estate also unsettled Hemingway admirers by expanding beyond books and offering a line of products that included clothing, eyewear, rugs and \"Papa's Pilar Rum.\"",
      "Patrick's most ambitious undertaking was the editing of \"True at First Light,\" a fictionalized account of Ernest Hemingway's time in Africa in the mid-1950s that the author left unfinished at the time of his death. Patrick assembled the 1999 release from some 800 pages of manuscripts, cutting the length by more than half. \"True at First Light\" was highly anticipated, but ended up disappointing readers and critics, some of whom faulted Patrick for exploiting the family name.",
      "Asked by NPR if he read his father's work, Patrick replied: \"Pretty often, because I have a commercial interest. ... I have to read it in order to be competent in the marketing of it and the management of it.\"",
      "Hemingway managed a long life in a family haunted by suicide and mental illness: Ernest Hemingway's father, Clarence, killed himself in 1928, and the author did the same in 1961. Gregory Hemingway suffered from alcoholism and depression and died in a jail cell in 2001 after being arrested for indecent exposure.

Because the author rarely stayed in one place for an extended time, the Hemingways lived everywhere from Cuba and Spain to Wyoming and Key West, Florida during Patrick\u2019s childhood (Ernest and Pauline divorced in 1940). Patrick Hemingway would recall his father\u2019s various \u201ctrophy mounts\u201d of animals hunted down on safari and how they were \u201ctastefully distributed throughout every room\u201d of their Key West house, including a wildebeest that hung in the bedroom of Patrick and Gregory.",

      "In New Hampshire, high blood pressure caused Stewart's kidneys to fail but he had no other health problems. It can take up to seven years for people with his blood type to find a matching kidney from a deceased donor, and some would-be living donors didn't qualify.

      "WASHINGTON -- Members of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s family are calling for him to step down as health secretary following a contentious congressional hearing this past week, during which the Trump Cabinet official faced bipartisan questioning about his tumultuous leadership of federal health agencies.",
      "Kennedy's sister, Kerry Kennedy, and his nephew, Joseph P. Kennedy III, issued scathing statements Friday, calling for him to resign as head of the Health and Human Services Department.",
      "The calls from the prominent Democratic family came a day after Kennedy had to defend his recent efforts to pull back COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and fire high-level officials at the Centers for Disease Control at a three-hour Senate hearing.",
      "\u201cRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is a threat to the health and wellbeing of every American,\u201d Joseph P. Kennedy III said in a post on X. The former congressman added: \u201cNone of us will be spared the pain he is inflicting.\u201d His aunt echoed those claims, saying \u201cmedical decisions belong in the hands of trained and licensed professionals, not incompetent and misguided leadership.\u201d",

      "Sophia Forchas was the most seriously wounded child among those who survived after a shooter opened fire at the Church of the Annunciation on Aug. 27.

      "The shooter died by suicide, police said.",
      "Sophia remains in intensive care at Hennepin Healthcare, a trauma hospital that has treated many of the victims. Her neurosurgeon, Dr. Walt Galicich, said at a news conference that a bullet, which remains lodged in her brain, caused severe damage, including to a major blood vessel. Surgeons had to remove the left half of her skull to relieve the pressure inside her head.",
      "\u201cIf you had told me at this juncture, 10 days later, that we\u2019d be standing here with any ray of hope, I would have said it would take a miracle,\u201d Galicich told reporters. He said they are banking on the ability of young brains to heal and make up for the damage.",
      "Sophia is still being kept in a medically induced coma most of the time to control the swelling, Galicich said. She is opening her eyes and showing some level of awareness of her surroundings, and has some slight movement in her right leg, but she\u2019s still not responding to commands, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s day by day, and I can\u2019t tell you how this is going to end,\" the doctor said. \"I know she\u2019s had a stroke from that injury to that blood vessel.

      "The International Atomic Energy Agency said Friday that officials are in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with Indonesian nuclear regulators who have detected Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope, at a processing plant that sent millions of pounds of shrimp to the U.S.",
      "\u201cPreliminary information suggests that it may have originated from activities at a metal melting facility at the same industrial site or from the disposal of scrap metal junk to other areas of the site,\u201d IAEA spokesperson Fredrik Dahl said in an email.",
      "No U.S. investigators have been sent to the site in Serang, west of Jakarta, federal officials said.",
      "Meanwhile, the company that exported the shrimp, PT Bahari Makmur Sejati, also known as BMS Foods, has recalled more than 300 shipping containers that were already on their way to the U.S., Dahl said.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned last month that Cesium-137 was detected in shipping containers sent to four U.S. ports, and in a sample of imported frozen shrimp. That spurred multiple recalls of shrimp sold at Walmart, Kroger and other stores.",
      "This week, additional recalls were issued by Tampa Maid Foods LLC, of Florida, for breaded butterfly shrimp sold under Admiral of the Fleet, Portico Seafood Classic and other labels.",
      "None of the shrimp that triggered alerts or tested positive for Cesium-137 was released for sale, the FDA said. But other shipments sent to stores may have been manufactured under conditions that allowed the products to become contaminated, the agency said.",

      "The level of Cesium-137 detected in the frozen shrimp was about 68 becquerels per kilogram, a measure of radioactivity. That is far below the FDA\u2019s level of 1,200 becquerels per kilogram that could trigger the need for health protections.",
      "Still, it is unusual to see that concentration of Cesium-137 in shrimp, said Steve Biegalski, a nuclear medicine expert at the Georgia Institute of Technology.",
      "It\u2019s possible that the contamination could have come from recycling old medical equipment that contained Cesium-137, Biegalski said. The material has been used in medical devices to reduce blood contamination and to treat cancer, for instance.",

      "Under the bill, providers could be ordered to pay $100,000. But only the pregnant woman, the man who impregnated her or other close relatives could collect the entire amount. Anyone else who sues could receive only $10,000, with the remaining $90,000 going to charity.",

      "They\u2019ve become even more widely used since then. Their availability is a key reason that the number of abortions has risen nationally, even though Texas and 11 other states are enforcing bans on abortion in all stages of pregnancy.",
      "The pills have continued to flow partly because at least eight Democratic-led states have enacted laws that seek to protect medical providers from legal consequences when they use telehealth to prescribe the pills to women who are in states where abortion is illegal.",
      "Earlier this year a Texas judge ordered a New York doctor to pay more than $100,000 in penalties for providing abortion pills to a Dallas-area woman.",
      "The same provider, Dr. Maggie Carpenter, faces criminal charges from a Louisiana prosecutor for similar allegations.",

      "Meanwhile the attorneys general of Texas and Florida are seeking to join Idaho, Kansas and Missouri in an effort to get courts to roll back U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals for mifepristone, one of the drugs usually used in combination for medication abortions, contending that there are safety concerns. They say it needs tighter controls because of those concerns.",
      "If the states are successful, it\u2019s possible the drug could be distributed only in-person and not by telehealth.",
      "Major medical organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists say the drug is safe.",

      "The nonprofit APOPO has worked in Morogoro, Tanzania, for more than two decades to train African giant pouched rats for lifesaving missions",
      "MOROGORO, Tanzania -- A man lies unmoving, slumped in the rubble of a simulated earthquake, as an unlikely rescuer approaches: a rat with a backpack. Whiskers waving, the rat breezes past garbage, toppled furniture and scattered clothes to find him and pull a trigger on its pack, alerting searchers above.",
      "Then a resounding click. A survivor has been found. The search in Morogoro in Tanzania\u2019s Uluguru Mountains is over and the rat scurries out of the abandoned building to be rewarded with a banana. A successful mission is complete for this African giant pouched rat being trained for search and rescue operations.",
      "\u201cTheir sense of smell is incredible,\u201d said Fabrizio Dell\u2019Anna, an animal behaviorist at APOPO, a Tanzania-based nongovernmental organization that trains the rats for lifesaving applications. \u201cThese rats are able to detect explosives, tuberculosis \u2014 even tiny amounts of the bacteria \u2014 and in this project, they are able to correctly identify and indicate humans.\u201d",
      "In a field nearby, more rats walk on leashes held between handlers, pacing a grid filled with land mines as part of an initiative by APOPO, which works alongside Sokoine University of Agriculture. When they pause, it indicates that explosives are beneath. These rats are readying for their next deployment, perhaps Angola or Cambodia, where APOPO has helped clear more than 50,000 land mines since 2014.",
      "From detecting land mines to sniffing out tuberculosis, these \u201chero rats\u201d have become unlikely, and sometimes unrecognized, front-line responders in Tanzania and beyond.",
      "For decades APOPO has trained these \u201chero rats,\u201d which have one of the most sensitive noses in the animal kingdom. Since 2003, the rats have been finding land mines and, more recently, have been turned on to trafficked wildlife and earthquake survivors.",
      "The rats begin training shortly after birth for specific missions and, with a longer-than-average rodent life span of almost a decade, can spend years carrying out their work. The cost of training each rat runs around 6,000 euros ($6,990).",
      "It is all done with classical conditioning and positive reinforcement, explained Dell\u2019Anna, who oversees the search and rescue program. The first cohort of this group of specialized rats are already in Turkey with a partner search and rescue organization.",
      "While the rats focused on explosives or survivors buried in rubble get all the glory, it is a group of rats inside a lab that are arguably the most impactful lifesavers. These are not typical lab rats, but rather, as their proponents would argue, one of the world\u2019s most effective detectors of tuberculosis.",
      "\u201cEvery day as many people die from TB as from land mines in a whole year,\u201d said Christophe Cox, the CEO of APOPO. \u201cIt\u2019s more spectacular to be on the minefield \u2026 but for TB \u2026 in terms of social impact, it\u2019s tremendous.\u201d",
      "Tuberculosis is an ancient respiratory disease that continues to run rampant despite centuries of research and treatment. The World Health Organization said last October in its most recent TB report that the disease had resurged as the top infectious disease killer, with 1.25 million deaths and a record 8.2 million infections in 2023.",
      "In sub-Saharan Africa, only about half of TB patients receive a diagnosis, according to a study by researchers in the UK and Gambia published in the National Library of Medicine, and this leaves them liable to spread the disease. Tanzania struggles with one of the highest global TB burdens, according to the WHO.",
      "APOPO expanded into TB detection in 2007 and its rats have been deployed in Tanzania, Ethiopia and Mozambique. The group works with 80 hospitals in Tanzania, collecting samples daily and bringing them to the lab rats.",
      "With their sensitive noses, the rats sniff out samples of sputum from patients, looking for positive TB cases that had been marked as negative. Research suggests the rats are picking up on six unique volatile organic compounds in positive TB samples, said Cox.",
      "False negatives remain a persistent issue in TB detection and suppression because each infected person can spread the disease to 10 to 15 more people each year.",
      "\u201cThe benefits of using rats are significant,\u201d said Felista Stanesloaus, a doctor at a TB clinic in Morogoro. \u201cThey help us detect cases that might otherwise be missed, which prevents people from unknowingly spreading infections.\u201d",

      "TB detection has made significant advances in recent years, including using artificial intelligence tools in conjunction with lung scans. However, many areas that are burdened most by TB, such as rural villages or low-income urban communities, do not have access to these tools.",
      "While the use of molecular detection devices, such as one called GeneXpert, have become more widespread, a clinic may only have one of these devices and it can take two hours to process a sample. Overburdened clinics turn to the centuries-old technique of microscopy, or investigation of sputum under a microscope, which is both fallible and time-consuming.",
      "\u201cHuman error may result in a person being told they are disease-free when they are not,\u201d said Stanesloaus. \u201cUsing rats is a very effective initiative.\u201d",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats can scan 100 samples in 20 minutes, and since the program's inception, the rats have been able to identify more than 30,000 patients who had been sent home with a clean bill of health but were actually carrying TB, said Cox. The NGO is able to do with one lab what 55 hospitals do in a day, he adds.",
      "Yet using live animals in the place of medical devices poses challenges, especially when it comes to scale. Samples have to be brought directly to a lab with enough trained rats to conduct the detection, with some samples brought to Morogoro by motorbike each day. Operations are most effective in dense urban centers, like Dar es Salaam, Cox said.",
      "The more existential challenge for these \u201chero rats\u201d comes from regulators and a wider health community who doubt this unconventional method of disease detection.",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats are not classified as primary diagnostic tools by the WHO. Instead, they are a second line of defense. Any positive samples detected by the rats must be confirmed with human microscopy in APOPO\u2019s labs before treatment can be administered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge,\u201d said Cox. \u201cNot being recognized by the WHO means that the mainstream funding for TB \u2026 never reaches us.\u201d",
      "Cox has given up on the prospect of getting approval from the WHO, though APOPO has faced pressure from donors to go through this process, which would be extensive and rigorous with no guarantee of success.",
      "Regulators may also challenge APOPO\u2019s method of focusing on finding every single positive case possible at the cost of more potential false positives.",
      "APOPO relies on the indication of just one rat to proceed with further investigation into a possible positive case, while higher specificity standards may need multiple rats to flag a sample.",
      "Cox defends this approach.",
      "\u201cOur choice was to go for that last patient out there \u2014 to go for the social impact,\u201d said Cox.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s economy expanded at a stronger rate in the fiscal first quarter than previously estimated, despite worries about U.S. tariffs and domestic political uncertainty, according to government data released Monday.",
      "The Cabinet Office said Japan\u2019s real gross domestic product, the sum value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, grew at a seasonally adjusted 2.2% annualized rate in the April-June quarter from the previous quarter.",
      "That was better than the preliminary estimate for 1.0% growth, which came out last month, as solid consumer spending and inventories lifted growth more than previously thought.",
      "Quarter-on-quarter, Japan\u2019s GDP grew 0.5%, up from the initial estimate for a 0.3% rise, which was also what analysts projected, according to RaboResearch.",
      "That marked the fifth straight quarter of growth. The annualized number shows what the growth, or contraction, would have been if the quarterly rate continued for a year.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s move to raise tariffs on Japanese imports is a major worry for the export-dependent economy, especially auto exports, which now face a 15% tariff, up from 2.5%.",
      "Another concern is the looming political uncertainty after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced Sunday he is stepping down as head of the ruling party. A party election will follow over the next weeks.",

      "Having both intact and patched up notes in circulation at the same time has resulted in confusion and tensions between businesses and customers.",

      "PARIS -- Legislators toppled France\u2019s government in a confidence vote on Monday, a new crisis for Europe\u2019s second-largest economy that obliges President Emmanuel Macron to search for a fourth prime minister in 12 months.",
      "Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou was ousted overwhelmingly in a 364-194 vote against him. Bayrou paid the price for what appeared to be a staggering political miscalculation, gambling that lawmakers would back his view that France must slash public spending to repair its debts. Instead, they seized on the vote that he called to gang up against Bayrou \u2014 a 74-year-old centrist who was appointed by Macron last December.",
      "The demise of Bayrou\u2019s short-lived minority government \u2014 now constitutionally obliged to submit its resignation to Macron after just under nine months in office \u2014 heralds renewed uncertainty and a risk of prolonged legislative deadlock for France as it wrestles with pressing challenges, including budget difficulties and, internationally, wars in Ukraine and Gaza and the shifting priorities of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.",
      "Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou warned that France is risking its future and its influence by racking up trillions in state debts that are \u201csubmerging us,\u201d pleading for belt-tightening in a last-ditch effort to save his job from a parliamentary vote expected to oust him later Monday.",
      "Bayrou, 74, painted a dramatic picture of the European Union\u2019s No. 2 economy becoming beholden to foreign creditors and addicted to living beyond its means. He castigated opponents in the National Assembly who were preparing to topple his minority government, ganging up against him despite their own sharp political differences.",
      "\u201cYou have the power to overthrow the government, but you do not have the power to erase reality,\u201d Bayrou said in a speech to the National Assembly before the confidence vote that he called. \u201cReality will remain inexorable. Spending will continue to increase and and the debt burden \u2014 already unbearable \u2014 will grow heavier and more costly.\u201d",
      "At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France\u2019s public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros, or 114% of gross domestic product. Debt servicing remains a major budget item, accounting for around 7% of state spending.",
      "The expected demise of Bayrou\u2019s short-lived premiership \u2014 he was appointed in December \u2014 would bring renewed uncertainty and a risk of prolonged legislative deadlock for France as it wrestles with pressing challenges, including budget difficulties and, internationally, wars in Ukraine and Gaza and the shifting priorities of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "The confidence vote expected in the early evening seems set to make Bayrou the third prime minister in 12 months to leave or be forced out by lawmakers, requiring Bayrou to submit his government's resignation to President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "Although Macron has had two weeks to prepare for the expected government collapse since Bayrou announced in August that he\u2019d seek a confidence vote on his unpopular budget plans, no clear front-runner has emerged as a likely successor.",
      "After Gabriel Attal\u2019s departure as prime minister in September 2024, followed by former Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier\u2019s ouster by parliament in December and Bayrou now threatened, too, Macron again faces an arduous hunt for a replacement to build consensus in the parliament's lower house that is stacked with opponents of the French leader.",
      "As president, Macron will continue to hold substantial powers over foreign policy and European affairs and remain the commander in chief of the nuclear-armed military. But domestically, the 47-year-old president\u2019s ambitions are increasingly facing ruin.",

But the gamble backfired, producing a splintered legislature with no dominant political bloc in power for the first time in France\u2019s modern republic.",
      "Shorn of a workable majority, his minority governments have since lurched from crisis to crisis, surviving on the whim of opposing political blocs on the left and far-right that don\u2019t have enough seats to govern themselves but can, when they team up, topple Macron's choices.",
      "Bayrou, too, rolled the dice by calling the confidence vote, a decision that quickly looked like a staggering miscalculation by the political veteran as left-wing and far-right legislators vowed to seize the opportunity to bring down his government, seeking to increase pressure on Macron.",
      "Bayrou conceded that putting his fate on the line was risky, but said that France's debt crisis compelled him to seek legislative support for remedies, in the face of what he called \u201ca silent, underground, invisible, and unbearable hemorrhage\u201d of excessive public borrowing.",

      "Fiam\u0113, who led Samoa since 2021, in January sacked La\u2019aulialemalietoa as a cabinet minister after he was charged with criminal offenses. La\u2019aulialemalietoa, also the FAST party chairman, in turn expelled Fiam\u0113 from FAST altogether.",
      "Her minority government staggered on before collapsing in May when she was unable to pass her budget. That prompted her to seek an election earlier than the vote scheduled for 2026, in which she was forced to run against her own former party.",
      "In August\u2019s vote, Fiam\u0113 campaigned as the leader of the new Samoa Uniting Party but won only three seats in Parliament, dashing her hopes of returning as prime minister. FAST won 30 seats, the opposition Human Rights Protection Party captured 14 and independents took four.",
      "Samoa\u2019s Head of State Tuimalealiifano Va\u2019aletoa Sualauvi II, who occupies a ceremonial post, said Monday that the country\u2019s new Parliament will sit on Sept. 16 to confirm a new prime minister.",

      "Raised in a Catholic family among the Acholi people of northern Uganda, Kony once served as an altar boy. His elders saw in him the occult gifts of the diviner and others began consulting him for advice on everything from curing infertility to lifting curses. \u201cSome said he would sit in his hut with a hand placed on a Bible, or peer into a cracked shard of mirror to foretell the future,\u201d the LRA biographer Matthew Green wrote in \u201cThe Wizard of the Nile.\u201d",
      "Kony seized his moment as a local leader with the rise to power in 1986 of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, whose guerrilla army had toppled government forces substantially drawn from Kony\u2019s tribe. In Green\u2019s account, Kony gathered people to tell them he had received a spirit that asked him to fight and overthrow Museveni: \u201cAcolytes wearing bamboo rosaries gathered at his homestead, awaiting orders.\u201d Kony left his village in April 1987 with 11 followers to begin his movement, whose stated goal was to rule the East African country according to the biblical 10 Commandments.",
      "Kony\u2019s guerrilla campaign, with its reliance on ambushing government soldiers and others, terrorized local people even more. Attacks on villages, or fear of impending attacks, often forced many civilians to flee their remote homes in search of relative safety in nearby towns. The rebels were known to be highly mobile, hard to track. In the mid-1990s, Ugandan authorities forced hundreds of thousands of civilians into camps for the internally displaced in efforts to isolate the rebels.",
      "That decision was criticized by local leaders, rights activists and others who said it exacerbated the people\u2019s suffering while doing little to eradicate the LRA, whose attacks continued. The rebels abducted boys and girls in sporadic attacks, and other alleged acts of cruelty included chopping off limbs. With every successful attack Kony\u2019s reputation as a fearsome warlord grew. Ugandan officials say Kony had his deputy, Vincent Otti, killed when Otti appeared interested in a peace deal with the government.",
      "In 2011, the U.S. sent about 100 U.S. troops to help African Union forces find Kony, a number that later grew to about 250. The effort degraded the LRA, but Kony himself remained elusive. A year later, Kony shot to international notoriety after the advocacy group Invisible Children made a popular online video highlighting his crimes, especially those against children.",
      "The U.S. has offered up to $5 million in rewards for information leading to Kony\u2019s capture. Ugandan officials have long said they believe Kony is alive and possibly hiding in the lawless border region between Central African Republic and Sudan\u2019s South Darfur region. Most of the LRA's top commanders have either been killed or captured while Kony somehow survives, adding to the myth surrounding the warlord. Many in his home area believe Kony will never be caught.",

      "ISTANBUL -- Authorities in Istanbul have imposed a temporary ban on public gatherings across several central districts and blockaded the main opposition party\u2019s provincial headquarters, as party supporters prepared to rally on Monday against the controversial appointment of a trustee chairman to oversee its local branch.",
      "Last week, an Istanbul court suspended the Republican People\u2019s Party's (CHP) provincial leadership, citing alleged irregularities in the party\u2019s 2023 congress. The court also appointed Gursel Tekin, a former CHP lawmaker aligned with the party\u2019s old guard, as interim chair. Critics have condemned the move as a politically motivated intervention aimed at weakening the party.",
      "In response, CHP leadership called on supporters to gather at the party\u2019s Istanbul headquarters ahead of Tekin\u2019s scheduled arrival on Monday. The call prompted the governor\u2019s office to announce a three-day ban on public gatherings late Sunday, as police surrounded the building, erected barricades and restricted access.",
      "Despite the restrictions, supporters began rallying outside the headquarters starting on Sunday night, defying the ban.",

      "Later this month, a separate court in Ankara is expected to rule on a similar case targeting the CHP\u2019s 2023 main congress, which elected Ozgur Ozel as party leader. A ruling against the party could potentially reinstate its former leader, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131cdaroglu, a figure whose tenure drew widespread criticism.",

      "Prince Harry has planned a flying visit to his U.K.-based charities this week, sparking speculation about a potential meeting with his father, King Charles III",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Prince Harry will make a flying visit to his U.K.-based charities this week, leading to a flurry of speculation about whether he will meet with his father, King Charles III, for the first time in 19 months.",
      "Amid signs of a thaw in the frigid relationship between Harry and the rest of the royal family, British media suggest that the prince\u2019s trip to London on Monday's third anniversary of the death of Queen Elizabeth II provides an opening for a long-overdue rapprochement between Charles, 76, and his estranged son.",
      "Harry has had little contact with his father and elder brother, Prince William, since he and his wife, the former Meghan Markle, gave up royal duties and moved to California in 2020. The relationship became even frostier after the couple bared their grievances with Buckingham Palace in a tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey, a Netflix series and Harry\u2019s memoir, \u201cSpare.\u201d",
      "The last time Harry and Charles met was in February 2024, when the prince flew to London after receiving news that his father had been diagnosed with cancer. Harry spent about 45 minutes with Charles before the king flew to his Sandringham country estate to recuperate from his treatment.",
      "Harry was last in London in April, when the Court of Appeal rejected his bid to restore a police protection detail that was canceled after he stopped being a working royal. Charles was on a state visit to Italy at the time, so a meeting was impossible.",
      "That case was itself an impediment to improved relations because it involved Harry criticizing the king\u2019s government in the courts. But once it was over, change became possible.",
      "Immediately after the case ended, Harry said he would \u201clove reconciliation with my family.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no point in continuing to fight anymore,\u201d he told the BBC on the day the court case was resolved. \u201cLife is precious. I don\u2019t know how much longer my father has.\u201d",
      "Despite that olive branch, Harry struck a combative tone that might torpedo hopes of repairing the family breach. The prince repeatedly said that the decision to withdraw his security was made at the direction of the royal household in an effort to control him and his wife while putting their safety at risk.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m struggling to forgive, and what I will probably always struggle to forgive, is the decision that was made in 2020 that affects my every single day and that is knowingly putting me and my family in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Harry said.",
      "But with the lawsuit out of the way, the mood music coming from Charles and Harry\u2019s supporters seemed to change.",
      "In July, the new team handling Harry and Meghan\u2019s communications, headed by Los Angeles-based Meredith Maines, was seen on the balcony of a private members' club in London speaking with Tobyn Andreae, the king\u2019s press representative. The Mail on Sunday was on hand to snap a photo of what the paper called: \u201cThe secret Harry peace summit.\u201d",
      "Regardless of who tipped off the paper, it showed a change of tone since the meeting wouldn\u2019t have happened if the so-called principals hadn\u2019t given their tacit consent.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea said Tuesday that leader Kim Jong Un supervised a test of a new rocket engine designed for intercontinental ballistic missiles, the latest step in his effort to build an arsenal that poses a viable threat to the continental United States.",
      "North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said Monday\u2019s event marked the ninth and final ground test of the solid-fuel rocket engine built with carbon fiber and capable of producing 1,971 kilonewtons of thrust, more powerful than past models. The report came a week after Kim visited the research institute that developed the engine, which North Korea then said will be used for future ICBMs, including a system called Hwasong-20.",
      "North Korea in recent years has flight-tested a variety of ICBMs that demonstrated potential range to reach the U.S. mainland, including those with built-in solid propellants that are easier to move and conceal and can be prepared for launch more quickly than the North\u2019s previous liquid-fuel missiles.",
      "Kim has called for further advancements in North Korea\u2019s long-range weapons, including the development of multi-warhead systems that would improve their chances of defeating missile defenses. All of North Korea\u2019s ICBM tests so far have been conducted at steeper-than-normal trajectories to avoid neighboring territories, and experts say the country may not yet have perfected the technology needed to ensure its warheads survive the harsh conditions of atmospheric re-entry.",
      "KCNA said Kim expressed satisfaction after Monday\u2019s test, calling the \u201ceye-opening\u201d development of the new rocket engine a \u201csignificant change\u201d in his effort to expand North Korea\u2019s nuclear forces.",
      "Kim has stepped up testing activities since the collapse of nuclear talks with the U.S. in 2019 under President Donald Trump \u2019s first term, demonstrating weapons of various ranges designed to strike U.S. allies in Asia and the U.S. mainland. Analysts say Kim\u2019s nuclear push is aimed at eventually pressuring Washington to accept the idea of the North as a nuclear power and to negotiate economic and security concessions from a position of strength.",

He visited Beijing last week, sharing the spotlight with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Putin at a massive military parade marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and China\u2019s fight against Japanese aggression.

      "The housing market is becoming more buyer-friendly after years of sharply rising prices",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Skyrocketing housing values and a shortage of homes on the market gave homeowners the upper hand for years when it came time to sell. That\u2019s no longer a given.",
      "Across the country, it\u2019s getting tougher for sellers to drive a hard bargain. A dearth of home shoppers who can afford to buy and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy, jobs and mortgage rates is putting pressure on sellers to give ground at the negotiating table.",
      "In some markets, mainly in the South and West, homeowners who are eager to sell are more likely to give buyers a better deal. This could include a lower price, up-front money to nudge down the buyer\u2019s mortgage rate, and funds for closing costs and any repairs or improvements that may pop up after the home inspection.",
      "The reasons: Would-be buyers balk at what they view as unreasonable asking prices, while at the same time new construction is giving buyers more options and putting pressure on sellers to make their homes more appealing.",
      "As a result, while the national median home listing price rose slightly in July, some metro areas saw a decline, signaling a reversal in the power dynamic between buyers and sellers. It\u2019s rare to see the type of eye-popping bidding wars that exploded home values by roughly 50% nationally earlier this decade. Low-ball offers are more common.",
      "Despite this hopeful trend, the housing market remains mired in a slump. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes are running about 1.3% below where they were through the first seven months of last year, when they sank to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",
      "The national median home listing price rose slightly in July from a year earlier to $439,450, according to Realtor.com. The real estate listing company found the most a homebuyer who earns the median U.S. household income can afford to spend on a home is $298,000. The analysis assumes a 20% down payment and a 30-year mortgage at a fixed rate of 6.74%. By those criteria, 7 out of 10 home shoppers are priced out of the market.",
      "The housing market has been in a rut since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows. The number of homes available for sale sank while prices kept rising.",
      "Nationally, more homes are going on sale and remaining unsold longer because buyers have been unwilling or unable to make a deal. Active listings \u2014 a tally that encompasses all homes on the market except those pending a finalized sale \u2014 increased in July for the 21st month in a row, climbing nearly 25% from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com.",
      "The inventory of homes for sale across the U.S. has increased gradually as the market has slowed and is now at a level where supply and demand are more balanced. But in states like Texas and Florida, the number of homes on the market has climbed sharply, partly because those states are hotbeds of new home construction.",
      "Home shoppers may now have more leverage relative to sellers in the South and West, where home inventory has risen in the single digits, compared to pre-pandemic levels. Conditions are tougher in markets in the Midwest and Northeast, where the supply of homes remains 40% and 50% below pre-pandemic levels, respectively, according to Realtor.com.",
      "After roughly two months on the market and three open houses, Doug McCormick\u2019s home has yet to receive a single offer.",
      "The retired business owner and his wife initially listed the 4-bedroom, 4.5-bath house located in Evergreen, a mountain community about 30 miles west of Denver, for $1.3 million. They lowered their asking price to about $1.28 million. That, too, failed to bring in a buyer.",

      "Lindsay Olesberg and her husband, John, know what it\u2019s like to navigate both sides of the housing slump.",
      "The couple listed their 4-bedroom, 3.5-bath home outside Albuquerque for $835,000 in June 2024 after John, a research scientist, got a new job in Texas. The plan: Sell their house, move to Austin and buy a home there. It took more than a year, during which the couple lowered their asking price several times, temporarily took the home off the market and had some offers fall through.",
      "In the end, they agreed to sell for $40,000 below their original listing price.",
      "Buying a home was much easier. The Olesbergs had little trouble finding homes they liked and could afford in Austin, where home inventory was up nearly 60% in July compared to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "They bought a five-bedroom, three-bath house in Austin for $735,000, or $30,000 below its initial listing price. The seller also agreed to cover $1,000 in fees.",
      "\u201cWe got less for our house in New Mexico than we would have wanted,\u201d said Lindsay Olesberg, 59, a Bible teacher. \u201cBut at the same time, you also knew it was a buyer\u2019s market in Austin, so the prices were coming down.\u201d",

      "Tammy Tullis put her home in the Miami suburb of South Miami on the market in June. But the four-bedroom, 3.5-bath house didn\u2019t receive many offers initially, so she dropped her $2.8 million asking price by $100,000. That helped drive turnout during an open house, but she only received low-ball offers.",
      "\u201cThey were like $400,000-$500,000 off the mark,\u201d said Tullis, 51.",
      "Last month, the finance consultant took the listing down. She may relist it sooner, rather than later.",
      "\u201cI want to sell, but I\u2019m not in a rush-rush,\u201d Tullis said.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, saying doing so will help the housing market. But homebuyers \u2013 and politicians \u2013 should keep in mind that the central bank only directly influences short-term rates, while most mortgages are based on the yield of the 10-year Treasury. So, lower mortgage rates wouldn\u2019t be a given, even if the Fed cuts rates in two weeks, as the market expects.",
      "And while lower mortgage rates would boost home shoppers\u2019 purchasing power, they also could bring in more buyers, giving sellers less incentive to keep lowering prices.",

The bank has also been opening new branches in multiple markets, but particularly in the Southwest.",
      "The FirstBank acquisition will make PNC the largest bank in the Denver market, and will give PNC more than 70 branches in Arizona. PNC will also grow to roughly $575 billion in assets.",
      "The FirstBank purchase will put PNC closer in size to Capital One and U.S. Bank, who are PNC\u2019s closest rivals. U.S. Bank, in particular, operates heavily in the Colorado and Arizona market.",

Kirakosian works for TTEC, a company that provides third party customer service lines in 22 countries to companies in industries such as autos and banking that need extra capacity or have outsourced their call center operations.",
      "Answering these calls can be thankless work. Roughly half of all customer service agents leave the job after a year, according to McKinsey, with stress and monotonous work being among the reasons employees quit.",
      "Much of what these agents deal with is referred to in the industry as \u201cbreak/fix,\u201d which means something is broken \u2014 or wrong or confusing \u2014 and the customer expects the person on the phone to fix the problem. Now, it\u2019s a question of who will be tasked with the fix: a human, a computer, or a human augmented by a computer.",
      "Already, AI agents have taken over more routine call center tasks. Some jobs have been lost and there have been dire forecasts about the future job market for these individuals, ranging from modest single-percentage point losses, to as many as half of all call center jobs going away in the next decade. The drop likely won't match the more dire predictions, however, because it's become evident that the industry will still need humans, perhaps with even higher levels of learning and training, as some customer service issues become increasingly harder to solve.",
      "Some finance companies have already experimented with going in heavily with AI for their customer service issues.",
      "Klarna, the Swedish buy now, pay later company, replaced 700 of their roughly 3,000 customer service agents with chatbots and AI in 2024. The results were mixed. While the company did save money, Klarna found there was still a need for higher skilled human agents in certain circumstances, such as complicated issues related to identity theft. Earlier this year, Klarna hired seven internal freelancers to handle these issues.",
      "Earlier this year, Klarna hired a handful of customer service employees back to the firm, acknowledging there were certain issues that AI couldn\u2019t handle as well as a real person, like identity theft.",
      "\u201cOur vision of an AI-first contact center, where AI agents handle the majority of conversations and fewer, better trained and better paid human agents support only the most complex tasks, is quickly becoming a reality,\u201d said Gadi Shamia of Replicant, an AI-software company that trains chatbots to sound more human, in an interview with consultants at McKinsey.",

      "The initial customer service call has long been handled through interactive voice response systems, known in the industry as IVR. Customers interact with IVR when they're told \u201cpress one for sales, press two for support, press five for billing.\u201d These crude systems got an update in the 2010s, when customers could prompt the system by saying \u201csales\u201d or \u201csupport\u201d or simple phrases like \u201cI\u2019d like to pay a bill\u201d instead of navigating through a labyrinthian set of menu options.",
      "But customers have little patience for these menus, leading them to \u201czero out,\u201d which is call center slang for when a customer hits the zero button on their their keypad in hopes of reaching a human. It\u2019s also not uncommon that after a customer \u201czeros out\u201d they will be put on hold and transferred because they did not end up in the right place for their request.",
      "Aware of Americans' collective impatience with IVR, Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Republican Jim Justice of West Virginia have introduced the \u201cKeep Call Centers in America Act,\u201d which would require clear ways to reach a human agent, and provide incentives to companies that keep call center jobs in the U.S.",
      "Companies are trying to roll out telephone systems that broadly understand customer service requests and predict where to send a customer without navigating a menu. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, is coming out with its \u201cChatGPT Agent\u201d service for users that\u2019s able to understand phrases like \u201cI need to find a hotel for a wedding next year, please give me options for clothing and gifts.\u201d",
      "Bank of America says it has had increasing success in integrating such features into \u201cErica,\u201d its chatbot that debuted in 2018. When Erica cannot handle a request, the agent transfers the customer directly to the right department. Erica is now also predictive and analytical, and knows for instance that a customer may repeatedly have a low balance and may need better help budgeting or may have multiple subscriptions to the same service.",
      "Bank of America said this month that Erica has been used 3 billion times since its creation and is increasingly taking on a higher case load of customer service requests. The chatbot's moniker comes from the last five letters of the company's name.",
      "James Bednar, vice president of product and innovation at TTEC, has spent much of his career trying to make customer service calls less painful for the caller as well as the company. He said these tools could eventually kill off IVR for good, ending the need for anyone to \u201czero out.\u201d",

Fast forward to 2025, and only eight players in all of baseball have played in each of his team's games: Brent Rooker, Pete Alonso, Ozzie Albies, Kyle Schwarber, Matt Olson, Elly De La Cruz, Manny Machado and Rafael Devers. And the season isn't over yet.",
      "Last season only four players appeared in all 162 games, including Alonso and Olson. The longest active streak belongs to Olson, who hasn't missed a game since 2021. He'd have to keep going until 2037 \u2014 when he'll be 43 \u2014 to catch Ripken's mark of 2,632.",
      "Then again, Ripken didn't play all those games directly in a row. He simply played every game in a season, then had the winter off before coming back to do it all over again. While it's rare for anyone to play 162 games in a season, it does still happen.",
      "From 1982 to 1998, a player reached 162 games in a season 66 times. That's an average of 4.4 players doing it per year, if you don't count the 1994 and 1995 seasons that were shortened because of a strike. From 2021-2024, it happened 12 times \u2014 3.0 per season. Maybe Ripken's mark won't be duplicated, but Olson is currently at 763. Making it to 1,000 would be a reasonable goal.",
      "When Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's record of 2,130 consecutive games in 1995, Baltimore was a talented team in the middle of a disappointing season. But beginning with the record-tying game, the Orioles finished on a 16-8 run that year and then made the postseason in 1996 and 1997.",
      "The 2025 Orioles, having a down year of their own, can only hope for a similar rebound.",
      "The Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America will begin awarding a Relief Pitcher of the Year honor in 2026. If it were happening this year, Aroldis Chapman of the Boston Red Sox would be making a strong bid.",
      "Chapman has gone 17 straight appearances \u2014 spanning 14 2/3 innings \u2014 without allowing a hit.",
      "When Johnny Vander Meer famously threw back-to-back no-hitters in 1938, that was part of a run of 21 2/3 innings without yielding a hit, according to play-by-play data at Baseball Reference.",

      "Then he exited the game, and he didn't even get a win because ...",
      "When Holliday came to the plate, Baltimore trailed 3-0 and had a win probability of 0.5% according to Baseball Savant. After Holliday's homer, Blake Treinen relieved Yamamoto and allowed a double, a hit batter and two walks.

      "The momentum, however, turned shortly after the Bills cut the lead to 40-32 with 3:56 left, when Josh Allen\u2019s tipped pass was caught by Keon Coleman in the end zone.",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re ridiculously fast,\u201d Logano said when asked about Toyota after his No. 22 Ford took fifth at Gateway. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of grip, and they\u2019ve got a lot of horsepower. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do to catch up. We\u2019ve got to be absolutely perfect in every category to contend, and we need them to make mistakes, which they do.

      "A new study finds that climate change is increasing sugar consumption in the United States",
      "WASHINGTON -- Global warming in the United States is amping up the country's sweet tooth, a new study found.",
      "When the temperature rises, Americans \u2014 especially those with less money and education \u2014 drink lots more sugary beverages and a bit more frozen desserts. That amounts to more than 100 million pounds of added sugar (358 million kilograms) consumed in the nation a year, compared to 15 years earlier, according to a team of researchers in the U.S. and United Kingdom.",
      "When temperatures go between 54 and 86 degrees (12 and 30 degrees Celsius), the amount of sugar the average American consumes goes up by about 0.4 grams per degree Fahrenheit (0.7 grams per degree Celsius) per day, based on researchers tracking of weather conditions and consumers' purchases. At 54 degrees, the amount of added sugar for the average American is a little more than 2 grams. At 86 degrees, it\u2019s more than 15 grams.",
      "Beyond that, appetites lessen and added sugar falls off, according to the study in Monday's Nature Climate Change.",
      "\u201cClimate change is shaping what you eat and how you eat and that might have a bad effect on your health,\u201d said study co-author Duo Chan, a climate scientist at the University of Southampton.",
      "\u201cPeople tend to take in more sweetened beverages as the temperature is getting higher and higher,\u201d Chan said. \u201cObviously under a warming climate that would cause you to drink more or take in more sugar. And that is going to be a severe problem when it comes to health.\u201d",
      "The daily difference from higher temperatures doesn't amount to even a single candy bar for the average person. But it adds up over time and has a big effect, said University of California San Francisco endocrinology professor Dr. Robert Lustig, a specialist in pediatrics and obesity who wasn't part of the study.",
      "Lustig wrote in an email that among poorer Americans, just one added can of sugary soft drink per day increases diabetes risk by 29% \u2014 and temperature-related thirst plays a big part in America\u2019s obesity epidemic.",
      "The United States\u2019 average annual temperature has gone up about 2.2 degrees (1.2 degrees Celsius) since 1895, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "To chart the impact on sugar consumption, researchers compared it to the American Heart Association recommendations: limiting daily intake to 36 grams for men and 25 grams for women.",
      "The team then compared wind, precipitation and humidity records to the detailed purchase records of 40,000 to 60,000 American households from 2004 to 2019, not using any data after the pandemic hit. Then they looked at the nutritional information of the items bought. That allowed them to eliminate other factors to make a causal link and come up with a calculation for how much extra sugar is consumed per person per degree, said lead author Pan He, an environmental scientist at Cardiff University.",

Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.",
      "This is the nation\u2019s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port \u2014 enough to power up to 60,000 homes.",

      "Wave energy is an emerging industry that\u2019s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.",
      "Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America\u2019s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.",
      "Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port\u2019s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,\u201d said R\u00e9mi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.\u201d",
      "A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.",
      "But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.",

She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn\u2019t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.",

      "New research suggests that a tiny phytoplankton that is an essential part of the marine food web may decline sharply as oceans warm",
      "SEATTLE -- For decades, scientists believed Prochlorococcus, the smallest and most abundant phytoplankton on Earth, would thrive in a warmer world. But new research suggests the microscopic bacterium, which forms the foundation of the marine food web and helps regulate the planet\u2019s climate, will decline sharply as seas heat up.",
      "A study published Monday in the journal Nature Microbiology found Prochlorococcus populations could shrink by as much as half in tropical oceans over the next 75 years if surface waters exceed about 82 degrees Fahrenheit (27.8 Celsius). Many tropical and subtropical sea surface temperatures are already trending above average and are projected to regularly surpass 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 Celsius) over that same period.",
      "\u201cThese are keystone species \u2014 very important ones,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Ribalet, a research associate professor at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Oceanography and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cAnd when a keystone species decreases in abundance, it always has consequences on ecology and biodiversity. The food web is going to change.\u201d",
      "Prochlorococcus inhabit up to 75% of Earth\u2019s sunlit surface waters and produce about one-fifth of the planet\u2019s oxygen through photosynthesis. More crucially, Ribalet said, they convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into food at the base of the marine ecosystem.",
      "\u201cIn the tropical ocean, nearly half of the food is produced by Prochlorococcus,\u201d he said. \u201cHundreds of species rely on these guys.\u201d",
      "Though other forms of phytoplankton may move in and help compensate for the loss of oxygen and food, Ribalet cautioned they are not perfect substitutes. \u201cEvolution has made this very specific interaction,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, this is going to have an impact on this very unique system that has been established.\u201d",
      "The findings challenge decades of assumptions that Prochlorococcus would thrive as waters warmed. Those predictions, however, were based on limited data from lab cultures. For this study, Ribalet and his team tested water samples while traversing the Pacific over the course of a decade.",
      "Over 100 research cruises \u2014 the equivalent of six trips around the globe \u2014 they counted some 800 billion individual cells taken from samples at every kilometer. In his lab at the University of Washington, Ribalet demonstrated the SeaFlow, a box filled with tubes, wires and a piercing blue laser. The custom-built device continuously pulls in seawater, which allowed the team to count the microbes in real time. \u201cWe have counted more Prochlorococcus than there are stars in the Milky Way,\u201d Ribalet said.",
      "Paul Berube, a research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies Prochlorococcus but was not involved in the work, said the breadth of data is \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d And he said the results fit with what is known about the microbe\u2019s streamlined genome, which makes it less adaptable to rapid environmental changes.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re at the very base of the food web, and they feed everything else \u2014 the fish eat the things that eat the phytoplankton and we eat the fish,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen changes are being made to the planet that influence these particular organisms that are essentially feeding us, that\u2019s going to have big consequences.\u201d",
      "To test whether Prochlorococcus might evolve to withstand hotter conditions, Ribalet\u2019s team modeled a hypothetical heat-tolerant strain but found that even those would \u201cnot be enough to fully resist the warmest temperature if greenhouse emissions keep rising,\u201d Ribalet said.",
      "He stressed that the study\u2019s projections are conservative and don\u2019t account for the impacts of plastic pollution or other ecological stressors. \u201cWe actually tried to put forth the best-case scenario,\u201d Ribalet said. \u201cIn reality, things may be worse.\u201d",

Kirakosian works for TTEC, a company that provides third party customer service lines in 22 countries to companies in industries such as autos and banking that need extra capacity or have outsourced their call center operations.",
      "Answering these calls can be thankless work. Roughly half of all customer service agents leave the job after a year, according to McKinsey, with stress and monotonous work being among the reasons employees quit.",
      "Much of what these agents deal with is referred to in the industry as \u201cbreak/fix,\u201d which means something is broken \u2014 or wrong or confusing \u2014 and the customer expects the person on the phone to fix the problem. Now, it\u2019s a question of who will be tasked with the fix: a human, a computer, or a human augmented by a computer.",
      "Already, AI agents have taken over more routine call center tasks. Some jobs have been lost and there have been dire forecasts about the future job market for these individuals, ranging from modest single-percentage point losses, to as many as half of all call center jobs going away in the next decade. The drop likely won't match the more dire predictions, however, because it's become evident that the industry will still need humans, perhaps with even higher levels of learning and training, as some customer service issues become increasingly harder to solve.",
      "Some finance companies have already experimented with going in heavily with AI for their customer service issues.",
      "Klarna, the Swedish buy now, pay later company, replaced 700 of their roughly 3,000 customer service agents with chatbots and AI in 2024. The results were mixed. While the company did save money, Klarna found there was still a need for higher skilled human agents in certain circumstances, such as complicated issues related to identity theft. Earlier this year, Klarna hired seven internal freelancers to handle these issues.",

      "The initial customer service call has long been handled through interactive voice response systems, known in the industry as IVR. Customers interact with IVR when they're told \u201cpress one for sales, press two for support, press five for billing.\u201d These crude systems got an update in the 2010s, when customers could prompt the system by saying \u201csales\u201d or \u201csupport\u201d or simple phrases like \u201cI\u2019d like to pay a bill\u201d instead of navigating through a labyrinthian set of menu options.",
      "But customers have little patience for these menus, leading them to \u201czero out,\u201d which is call center slang for when a customer hits the zero button on their their keypad in hopes of reaching a human. It\u2019s also not uncommon that after a customer \u201czeros out\u201d they will be put on hold and transferred because they did not end up in the right place for their request.",

Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Republican Jim Justice of West Virginia have introduced the \u201cKeep Call Centers in America Act,\u201d which would require clear ways to reach a human agent, and provide incentives to companies that keep call center jobs in the U.S.",

When Erica cannot handle a request, the agent transfers the customer directly to the right department. Erica is now also predictive and analytical, and knows for instance that a customer may repeatedly have a low balance and may need better help budgeting or may have multiple subscriptions to the same service.",

He said these tools could eventually kill off IVR for good, ending the need for anyone to \u201czero out.\u201d",

      "Researchers will date the water back in the lab, and that will be key in determining whether it is a renewable resource that could be used responsibly. Primordial water is trapped and finite; newer water suggests the aquifer is still connected to a terrestrial source and being refreshed, however slowly.",

Can it be taken without an unacceptable risk of contaminating the supply from the ocean above? Will it be cheaper or environmentally friendlier than today's energy-hungry desalination plants?",
      "Dugan said if governments decide to get the water, local communities could turn to the aquifers in time of need, such as drought, or when extreme storms flood coastal freshwater reserves and ruin them. The notion of actually using this old buried water is so new that it has not been on the radar of many policymakers or conservationists.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lesson in how long it can take sometimes to make these things happen and the perseverance that\u2019s needed to get there,\" said Woods Hole geophysicist Rob Evans, whose 2015 expedition helped point the way for 501. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of excitement that finally they\u2019ve got samples.\"",
      "Still, he sees some red flags. One is that tapping undersea aquifers could draw water away from onshore reserves. Another is that undersea groundwater that seeps out to the seafloor may supply nutrients vital to the ecosystem, and that could be upset.",
      "\"If we were to go out and start pumping these waters, there would almost certainly be unforeseen consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of balance we would need to consider before we started diving in and drilling and exploiting these kinds of things.\u201d",
      "For most in the project, getting to and from Liftboat Robert meant a voyage of seven hours or more from Fall River, Massachusetts, on a supply boat that made round trips every 10 days or so to replenish stocks and rotate people.",
      "On the platform, around the clock, the racket of metal bore pipes and machinery, the drilling grime and the speckled mud mingled with the quieter, cleaner work of scientists in trailers converted to pristine labs and processing posts.",
      "There, samples were treated according to the varying needs of the expedition\u2019s geologists, geochemists, hydrologists, microbiologists, sedimentologists and more.",
      "Passing through clear plastic tubes, muck was sliced into disks like hockey pucks. Machines squeezed water out. Some samples were kept sealed to enable study of ancient gases dissolved in the water. Other samples were frozen, filtered or left as is, depending on the purpose.",
      "After six months of lab analysis, all the science teams of Expedition 501 will meet again \u2014 this time in Germany for a month of collaborative research that is expected to produce initial findings that point to the age and origin of the water.",
      "On July 31, Liftboat Robert cranked up its legs from this place of hidden water to end a mission that lent credence to another passage from \u201cThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\" Samuel Taylor Coleridge's classic poem about life, death and mysteries at sea.",

      "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government\u2019s attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \u201canswer engines\u201d as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google\u2019s long-held position as the internet\u2019s main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by AI also reshaped the judge\u2019s approach to the remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration and carried onward by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "\u201cUnlike the typical case where the court\u2019s job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge\u2019s forte,\u201d Mehta wrote.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services. The ruling also will pry open some of the prized databases of closely guarded information about search that have provided Google with a seemingly insurmountable advantage.",
      "The handcuffs being slapped on Google will preclude contracts that give its search engine, Gemini AI app, Play Store for Android and virtual assistant an exclusive position on smartphone, personal computers and other devices.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google\u2019s search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \u201cwould be incredibly messy and highly risky.\u201d",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine\u2019s secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results. That is a measure that Google had also fiercely opposed, contending it was unfair and would raise privacy and security risk for the billions of people who have posed questions to its search engine \u2014 sometimes delving into sensitive issues.",
      "The Justice Department's antitrust chief, Gail Slater, hailed the decision as a \u201cmajor win for the American people,\u201d even though the agency didn't get everything it sought. \u201cWe are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough,\u201d Slater wrote in a post.",
      "In its own post, Google framed Mehta's ruling as a vindication of its long-held position that the case never should have been brought. The decision \u201crecognizes how much the industry has changed through the advent of AI, which is giving people so many more ways to find information,\u201d wrote Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \u201cThis underlines what we\u2019ve been saying since this case was filed in 2020: Competition is intense and people can easily choose the services they want.\u201d",
      "The Mountain View, California, company has already vowed to appeal the judge\u2019s monopoly findings issued 13 months ago that led to Tuesday's ruling.",

That would translate into a nearly $200 billion increase in Alphabet's market value, if the shares follow a similar trajectory in Wednesday's regular trading session.",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It\u2019s also a win for Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and other recipients of the payments.",

      "Chrome would have been a hot commodity had the judge forced Google to put it on the auction block. Perplexity submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer to buy Chrome last month. And during court testimony earlier this year, a ChatGPT executive left no doubt that service\u2019s owner, OpenAI, would be interested in be interested in buying Chrome, too.",
      "But the judge decided forcing Google to open up parts of its search data to rivals such as DuckDuckGo, Bing, and others will offer he best and fairest way to foster more compelling competition. In doing so, Mehta still narrowed the scope of the Justice Department's request and will limit the access to Google's search index and query histories.",

After different federal judge in Virginia declared that some of the technology underlying the ad network to be an illegal monopoly earlier this year, the Justice Department plans to make its case for another proposed breakup  in a trial scheduled to begin later this month.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Over a recent two-year period, the Pentagon funded hundreds of projects done in collaboration with universities in China and institutes linked to that nation's defense industry, including many blacklisted by the U.S. government for working with the Chinese military, a congressional investigation has found.",
      "The report, released Friday by House Republicans on the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, argues the projects have allowed China to exploit U.S. research partnerships for military gains while the two countries are locked in a tech and arms rivalry.",
      "\u201cAmerican taxpayer dollars should be used to defend the nation \u2014 not strengthen its foremost strategic competitor,\u201d Republicans wrote in the report.",
      "\u201cFailing to safeguard American research from hostile foreign exploitation will continue to erode U.S. technological dominance and place our national defense capabilities at risk,\" it said.",
      "The Pentagon didn't immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment. Beijing has in the past said science and technological cooperation between the two countries is mutually beneficial and helps the two sides cope with global challenges.",
      "The congressional report said some officials at the Defense Department argued research should remain open as long as it is \u201cneither controlled nor classified.\u201d",
      "The report makes several recommendations to scale back U.S. research collaboration with China. It also backs new legislation proposed by the committee's chairman, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Michigan. The bill would prohibit any Defense Department funding from going to projects done in collaboration with researchers affiliated with Chinese entities that the U.S. government identifies as safety risks.",
      "The 80-page report builds on the committee's findings last year that partnerships between U.S. and Chinese universities over the past decade allowed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to help Beijing develop critical technology. Amid pressure from Republicans, several U.S. universities have ended their joint programs with Chinese schools in recent years.",
      "The new report focuses more narrowly on the Defense Department and its billions of dollars in annual research funding.",
      "The committee's investigation identified 1,400 research papers published between June 2023 and June 2025 that acknowledged support from the Pentagon and were done in collaboration with Chinese partners. The publications were funded by some 700 defense grants worth more than $2.5 billion. Of the 1,400 publications, more than half involved organizations affiliated with China's defense research and industrial base.",
      "Dozens of those organizations were flagged for potential security concerns on U.S. government lists, though federal law does not prohibit research collaborations with them. The Defense Department money supported research in fields including hypersonic technology, semiconductors, artificial intelligence, advanced materials and next-generation propulsion.",

      "For their study, Sun and his team relied primarily on 23 marsquakes recorded by InSight, all of them relatively weak. The epicenters were 740 miles to 1,465 miles (1,200 kilometers to 2,360 kilometers) away from the lander.",

      "While praising the results, the University of Maryland\u2019s Nicholas Schmerr, who was not involved in the study, said questions regarding Mars\u2019 core are far from settled.

      "\u201cThere are a lot of details about the exact shape of the inner core and composition of the inner and outer core of Mars that will require a network of InSight like seismometer stations to resolve,\u201d Schmerr said in an email.",
      "More detailed modeling is necessary to develop a clearer picture of how the inner core formed and \"what it reveals about the history of Mars' magnetic field,\u201d said Sun.",
      "At present, Mars lacks a magnetic field, possibly because of the slow crystallization of the planet's solid core, Schmerr added.",

      "A new online platform called wplace invites users to \u201cpaint the world\u201d on a massive digital canvas",
      "NEW YORK -- In one new corner of the internet, users are invited to \u201cpaint the world.\u201d And paint they have. Welcome to wplace \u2014 an ever-evolving, gamified global map overflowing with drawings made on a more than 4-trillion-pixel canvas.",
      "Images of Icelandic singer Laufey float over Reykjav\u00edk, while tributes for the late Tejano singer Selena Quintanilla surround Corpus Christi, Texas. The crest of San Lorenzo and other soccer clubs fill Buenos Aires. \u201cSquid Game\u201d fanart can be found on the outskirts of Seoul. And Walter White's opening monologue from \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d sits near Albuquerque, New Mexico.",
      "Wplace launched July 21, but the artwork is already overwhelming \u2014 ranging from simple stick figures and thin-lettered words, to colorful fanart and highly detailed images users build under online pseudonyms.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wild, and chaotic and crude,\u201d said Yotam Ophir, a University at Buffalo professor of communication whose research includes analyzing digital spaces. That's part of wplace's appeal, he added, describing the site as a somewhat of a \u201crebellion\u201d against what the internet has become.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to break Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s kind of a reminder that things can be done differently.\u201d",
      "Wplace has garnered more than 10.6 million users worldwide as of Thursday, co-founder Enzo Watanabe told The Associated Press. With that explosion in just over a month, moderation challenges have arisen. Watanabe said via email that the project\u2019s growth \u201cexceeded all expectations\u201d \u2014 but acknowledged that \u201cadjusting to the high demand has been challenging.\u201d",
      "The game was developed in Brazil over three months by a single person, he said, and is now run by a team of 46, in addition to volunteers.",
      "New users begin with a small, fixed number of pixels, and more become available every 30 seconds. The more you contribute, the more pixels are available to you \u2014 sort of \u201clike a leveling system\u201d seen in video games, said Moira Hembns, a 19-year-old user from Edmonton, Alberta.",
      "Even with bigger pools of pixels, it can take a lot of time to bring map paintings to life. \u201cEvery art piece takes me hours to design in advance,\u201d said Hembns. One drawing she recently finished, of a Pok\u00e9mon named Leafeon in her hometown, took her two days to design outside of wplace \u2014 and then another day to build in it, she said.",
      "But Hembns notes that she loves art, and checks the map and places pixels almost every morning now. Muhammad Aliy Fattah bin Yusrizal, a 21-year-old from Malaysia, similarly says wplace has become an outlet for his creativity.",
      "The site \u201cis one of the places that I can express myself,\u201d Fattah said, noting he's mostly contributed art dedicated to his favorite video games and placed atop his home country.",
      "Users from around the world also team up to bring larger projects to life \u2014 like \u201cThe Neighborhood,\u201d which sits in a corner of Yuma County, Arizona. Real-life resident Krista Rider, 25, started by drawing two homes. It now has over 50, connected by paths, patches of grass and rivers.",
      "\u201cI wanted to do something nice that could lift people up, give them something that they feel like they\u2019re contributing to, whether it\u2019s big or small,\u201d Rider said.",
      "Much of wplace's spaces are filled with an endless array of pop culture references \u2014 often intertwined with symbols of local and national identity, protest and other reflections of daily life seen worldwide. In his own time scrolling through wplace's map, Ophir notes he's seen anything from small towns highlighting a restaurant they love, to tributes to local musicians, to broader imagery of political tensions and global conflicts.",
      "\u201cIn a way, every person is zooming in on what reflects them and who they are,\u201d Ophir said.",
      "Above Gaza, users have painted Palestinian flags and messages of solidarity amid Israel's ongoing war. Images of war are also seen on the border between Russia and Ukraine \u2014 some use their pixels to depict military tanks or planes, while others write messages calling for peace. Washington, D.C., is covered with political messages, many of which focus on President Donald Trump.",
      "Carly Kocurek, associate dean of Lewis College of Science and Letters at Illinois Tech and director of the school\u2019s game design program, says there's a long history of \u201cdigital spaces as a places for protest.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe challenge is big, but we are doing our best,\u201d Watanabe said.",

      "Watanabe on Thursday told the AP wplace intends \u201cto continue welcoming new contributions,\u201d as well as host in-platform events.",

That means the total damages awarded in the five-year-old case works out to about $4 per device.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Ned is a perfectly nice snail. If he had a dating profile, it might read: good listener, stable home, likes broccoli, seeks love.",
      "But he\u2019s already exhausted his local options and it\u2019s not because he\u2019s picky or unappealing. Instead, he\u2019s a common garden snail with an uncommon anatomical problem that\u2019s ruining his love life.",
      "Ned\u2019s shell coils to the left, not the right, making him the 1 in 40,000 snails whose sex organs don\u2019t line up with those of the rest of their species. Unless another lefty snail is found, the young gastropod faces a lifetime of unintentional celibacy.",
      "That dire prospect prompted a New Zealand nature lover who found the snail in her garden in August to launch a campaign to find his perfect match. But Ned\u2019s quest for true love, perhaps predictably, is slow.",
      "Giselle Clarkson was weeding her home vegetable patch in Wairarapa on the North Island when a snail tumbling out of the leafy greens caught her eye. Clarkson, the author and illustrator of a nature book, \u201cThe Observologist,\u201d has an affection for snails and had long been on the lookout for a sinistral, or left-coiled shell.",
      "\u201cI knew immediately that I couldn\u2019t just toss the snail back into the weeds with the others,\u201d she said. Instead, she sent a photo of the snail, pictured alongside a right-coiled gastropod as proof, to her colleagues at New Zealand Geographic.",
      "The magazine launched a nationwide campaign to find a mate for Ned, named for the left-handed character Ned Flanders in \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d who once opened a store called The Leftorium. That explains the male pronouns some use for Ned, although snails are hermaphrodites with sex organs on their necks and the capacity for both eggs and sperm.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a right-coiling snail and a left-coiling snail, they can\u2019t slide up and get their pieces meeting in the right position,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cSo a lefty can only mate with another lefty.\u201d",
      "The fact that romantic hopefuls need not be a sex match should have boosted Ned\u2019s prospects. But his inbox has remained empty except for photos of \u201coptimistically misidentified right-coiling snails,\" Clarkson said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of enthusiasm and encouragement for Ned, a lot of people who can relate and really want the best for them, as a symbol of hope for everyone who\u2019s looking for love,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as yet, no lefties have been forthcoming.\u201d",
      "Ned\u2019s relatable romantic woes have attracted global news coverage, but New Zealand\u2019s strict biosecurity controls mean long-distance love probably isn\u2019t on the cards.

      "It was a fascinating chance for scientists to investigate what produces left-coiled snails, with the cause most likely a rare genetic mutation. Studies of snail farms in Europe prompted researchers to estimate about 1 in every 40,000 snails is a lefty.",

Zoom school also emphasized rote learning, a technique based on repetition that some experts believe may favor boys, instead of teaching students to solve problems in different ways, which may benefit girls.",
      "Old practices and biases likely reemerged during the pandemic, said Michelle Stie, a vice president at the National Math and Science Initiative.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s just call it what it is,\u201d Stie said. \u201cWhen society is disrupted, you fall back into bad patterns.\u201d",
      "In most school districts in the 2008-2009 school year, boys had higher average math scores on standardized tests than girls, according to AP's analysis, which looked at scores across 15 years in over 5,000 school districts. It was based on average test scores for third through eighth graders in 33 states, compiled by the Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University.",
      "A decade later, girls had not only caught up, they were ahead: Slightly more than half of districts had higher math averages for girls.",
      "Within a few years of the pandemic, the parity disappeared. In 2023-2024, boys on average outscored girls in math in nearly nine out of 10 districts.",
      "A separate study by NWEA, an education research company, found gaps between boys and girls in science and math on national assessments went from being practically non-existent in 2019 to favoring boys around 2022.",
      "Studies have indicated girls reported higher levels of anxiety and depression during the pandemic, plus more caretaking burdens than boys, but the dip in academic performance did not appear outside STEM. Girls outperformed boys in reading in nearly every district nationwide before the pandemic and continued to do so afterward.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something like COVID happened and girls just fell apart,\u201d said Megan Kuhfeld, one of the authors of the NWEA study.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, teaching practices shifted to deemphasize speed, competition and rote memorization. Through new curriculum standards, schools moved toward research-backed methods that emphasized how to think flexibly to solve problems and how to tackle numeric problems conceptually.",
      "Educators also promoted participation in STEM subjects and programs that boosted girls\u2019 confidence, including extracurriculars that emphasized hands-on learning and connected abstract concepts to real-life applications.",
      "When STEM courses had large male enrollment, Superintendent Kenny Rodrequez noticed girls losing interest as boys dominated classroom discussions at his schools in Grandview C-4 District outside Kansas City. Girls were significantly more engaged after the district moved some of its introductory hands-on STEM curriculum to the lower grade levels and balanced classes by gender, he said.",

      "The New Orleans Archdiocese has agreed to a $230 million settlement for survivors of clergy sexual abuse",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The New Orleans Archdiocese on Monday agreed to a $230 million proposed settlement for survivors of clergy sexual abuse, attorneys for some of the survivors said Monday. The agreement paves the way for a final resolution to yearslong negotiations amid a series of similar settlements from the Catholic Church.",
      "The archdiocese had announced in May that it would pay at least $179.2 million in response to more than 500 abuse claims, which the bloc of attorneys said they opposed because they considered it to be lowballing the hundreds of survivors.",
      "\u201cWe knew this was a bad deal, and we knew we could do better; and we have,\" the group of 10 attorneys said in a statement. \"The \u2018power of no\u2019 forced the Archdiocese to come up with significantly more money.\u201d",
      "The archdiocese had filed for bankruptcy in May 2020 rather than handle each abuse claim separately, which survivors point out allows church leadership to avoid facing tough questions in court. The archdiocese called the updated settlement a \u201csignificant step forward for the benefit of all claimant survivors\" in an emailed statement.",
      "Survivors have until late October to vote on whether or not to approve the settlement. If approved by two-thirds of survivors, payments could begin disbursement by next year.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I\u2019m not aware of a single attorney for an abuse survivor that opposes the plan,\u201d said Brad Knapp, an attorney for a committee representing abuse survivors. \u201cWith all the abuse survivors\u2019 attorneys supporting it, I think there\u2019s much less chance that it gets voted down.\u201d",
      "The archdiocese's bankruptcy is one of the longest running and most contentious of more than a dozen ongoing Catholic Church bankruptcy cases in the U.S. related to sex abuse, according to Terence McKiernan, president of the nonprofit BishopAccountability.org.",
      "Judge Meredith Grabill, overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings in federal court, has warned that if the settlement is not approved, then she will dismiss the case.",
      "If a bankruptcy settlement fails, survivors would be required to seek compensation for their abuse claims through new lawsuits, which could take years to play out in courts. And it raises the prospect that the archdiocese would declare bankruptcy again to delay payments, according to a public letter from the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors. The committee represents the interests of abuse survivors in the bankruptcy case and urged survivors to accept the initial settlement offer.",
      "The committee warned that bringing individual abuse claims in court would likely lead to difficult confrontations with a \u201caggressive and hostile\u201d archdiocese, which could force survivors and their friends and family to engage in tough depositions and years of appeals, exacerbating survivors\u2019 \u201cemotional and psychological pain.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of survivors are ready for this to be resolved,\u201d said Kristi Schubert, an attorney representing dozens of survivors. \u201cA lot of them would prefer to receive certain money now.\u201d",

He pointed out that the bankruptcy process allows the church to \u201cwear people down\u201d and keep the public in the dark about the extent to which it enabled abuse.",
      "The settlement as outlined in May requires the archdiocese to bring in outside experts to evaluate its child-protection programs and recommend improvements.

      "President Donald Trump is swiftly implementing his vision of the military as an all-powerful tool for his policy goals. It's ground that presidents have hardly ever crossed outside of times of war, and experts say it's remaking the role of the most powerful military in the world and its relationship with the American public.",
      "Yet as Trump has dramatically stepped up his use of military force, fellow Republicans in Congress \u2014 where authorization for such actions is supposed to originate \u2014 have done little but cheer him on. That's giving the president significant leeway as he raises plans to send troops next to Chicago, Baltimore and New Orleans.",
      "\u201cIf I were one of those mayors, I\u2019d be glad to have the help,\u201d said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, speaking from a Capitol building where National Guard troops were patrolling the surrounding city. \u201cI think the big city Democrats are really making a mistake. I think they're being tone deaf.\u201d",

The vast majority of Americans, 81%, see crime as a \u201cmajor problem\u201d in large cities, according to recent polling from the The AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

      "\u201cAll of these things indicate an administration that is making a broad, concerted effort to insert the military into civilian law enforcement in a way and on a scale that has no precedent in American history,\u201d said Joseph Nunn, an attorney at the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program.",

      "Congress under its constitutional duties has laid out laws that govern when and how the National Guard can be deployed domestically. But as Trump has pushed the limits of those laws, the Republican-controlled Congress has stood by. Instead, it's been left to the courts to put any guardrails on Trump's maximalist approach to the presidency.",
      "A federal judge ruled last week that the Trump administration \u201cwillfully\u201d broke the Posse Comitatus Act, a nearly 150-year-old federal law that limits the U.S. military\u2019s role in domestic law enforcement, when he sent National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area in early June after days of protests over immigration raids. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco noted Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have stated they intend to deploy National Guard troops to other cities across the country, raising concerns they're \u201ccreating a national police force with the President as its chief.\u201d",

Since then, presidents have increasingly exercised more power over the troops that started as state-based militias.",
      "\u201cThis is another one of those pendulum moments where the Guard will become more federal or maybe it will swing back in the other direction,\" Wiest said. \u201cBut since the founding of the Republic, it\u2019s been swinging towards the federal side.\u201d",

      "Republicans are moving to change the rules of the Senate to approve more of President Donald Trump's nominees",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader John Thune says he\u2019s ready to change the chamber\u2019s rules to allow quick confirmations of dozens of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive branch nominees, moving this week to speed up votes after months of Democratic delays.",
      "Thune says he\u2019ll start the process of changing the rules when the Senate goes into session on Monday afternoon, with a final vote likely coming later this week. \u201cWe must return to the Senate\u2019s traditional confirmation process that existed before this unprecedented blockade,\u201d Thune said in an op-ed published on Breitbart.com Monday morning.",
      "Republicans have been talking about options for changing the rules since early August, when the Senate left for a monthlong recess after a breakdown in bipartisan negotiations over the confirmation process. Democrats have blocked nearly every single one of Trump\u2019s nominees, forcing majority Republicans to spend valuable floor time on procedural votes and leaving many positions in the executive branch unfilled.",
      "The changes come after both parties have escalated their obstruction of the other party\u2019s nominees for years, and as leaders in both parties have incrementally changed the rules to make the process less bipartisan. The proposal to group nominations is loosely based on legislation introduced by Democrats two years ago as Republicans blocked many of then-President Joe Biden\u2019s picks.",
      "But while Senate Republicans forced similar delays during Biden\u2019s administration, Democrats have blocked almost all of Trump\u2019s nominations. It\u2019s the first time in recent history that the minority party hasn\u2019t allowed at least some quick confirmations.",
      "\u201cDemocrats have made President Donald Trump the first president on record to not have a single nominee confirmed via voice vote or unanimous consent, and they are forcing time-consuming votes on noncontroversial nominees who go on to be confirmed by large bipartisan margins,\u201d Thune said in the op-ed.",

      "If Republicans act quickly, they could confirm more than 100 of Trump\u2019s pending nominations as soon as this week. The rules change is expected to only apply to executive branch nominations, not lifetime judicial appointments, and would exclude the most high-profile positions, such as Cabinet nominees, that require a longer debate time. Some others could also be excluded, such as nominees that are particularly controversial.",
      "The process to change the rules will likely require several floor votes and the support of a simple majority, so at least 51 out of the chamber\u2019s 53 Republicans. But most GOP senators appear to be on board.",
      "The change will be the latest salvo in years of intensifying standoffs over presidential nominations. In 2013, Democrats changed Senate rules for executive branch and lower court judicial nominees to remove the 60-vote threshold for confirmations as Republicans blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s picks. In 2017, Republicans did the same for Supreme Court nominees as Democrats tried to block Trump\u2019s nomination of Justice Neil Gorsuch.",
      "Democrats have said the rules change would be a mistake, especially as Senate Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass spending bills and other legislation moving forward.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said last week that Republicans\u2019 proposed plan \u201cguts the Senate\u2019s constitutional role of advice and consent, weakens our checks and balances, and guarantees that historically bad nominees will only get worse with even less oversight.\u201d",

      "As President Donald Trump signals plans to order federal intervention in Chicago, experts say the likely escalation of immigration enforcement operations is setting the stage for a contentious dynamic between local police and federal authorities",
      "CHICAGO -- As President Donald Trump threatens to expand immigration raids and deploy the National Guard, Chicago has become the latest flashpoint in a broader national struggle over how far the federal government can push local authorities to cooperate with its immigration agenda.",
      "For the Chicago Police Department, the challenge is acute. The force must preserve public safety in a city already under strain while avoiding the appearance of working hand-in-hand with federal immigration authorities, a stance that could erode community trust and ignite new protests.",
      "The same balancing act has confronted other big-city departments in recent months. Local police in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., were drawn into fraught arrangements with federal agencies that experts say left residents wary and, at times, undermined public confidence in their police.",
      "Now, Chicago finds itself on the same path, with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker objecting to any National Guard deployment and city officials bracing for how the added federal presence could reshape the dynamic on the ground. The outcome, policing experts warn, may determine whether Chicago police can maintain credibility in immigrant communities likely to be targeted by a president determined to show force.",
      "\u201cWhat the Trump administration is doing here is engaging in federal policing in a way that really rips at the seams of the relationships between state and local police and the federal government, between communities and law enforcement,\u201d said Nayna Gupta, policy director at American Immigration Council. \u201cThose kinds of standoffs and contentious practices is what erodes public safety.\u201d",
      "Over the course of the Trump administration\u2019s immigration surges, Chicago officials repeatedly reaffirmed the city's so-called sanctuary policies that have been place for four decades. But as fear grew about looming U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions, the city's mayor has avoided detail about how local police will navigate tensions on the ground.",
      "Chicago\u2019s policies bar local law enforcement from asking about or detaining someone for their immigration status or from supporting ICE, including by securing perimeters for raids, transporting detainees or sharing information about undocumented immigrants.",
      "Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order last week declaring city police would not collaborate with federal immigration agents. It also requires Chicago officers to wear uniforms and not wear masks to \u201cclearly distinguish them from federal agents.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not have our police officers who are working hard every single day to drive down crime deputized to do traffic stops and checkpoints for the president,\u201d Johnson said before signing the order.",
      "Craig Futterman, a law professor at the University of Chicago, said any cooperation between ICE and local officers hurts public trust and blurs the lines between agencies.",
      "\u201cIt can get really messy,\u201d Futterman said. \u201cThere\u2019s how sanctuary cities are supposed to work on paper vs. what happens in practice.\u201d",
      "Gupta said Chicago police will have to coordinate with federal agencies to some degree, even to respond to protests against immigration raids and detentions.",
      "In the meantime, city officials say they're following a similar strategy to policing as the one in place around the 2024 Democratic National Convention, which cost the city about $27 million in officer overtime.",
      "ICE detained at least 10 Chicagoans at an immigration office on June 4, drawing dozens of protesters and local elected officials to the street outside. Police didn't originally know it was an immigration action and left after realizing that, officials said.",
      "Some protesters and local elected officials claimed they saw Chicago officers clearing the way for ICE agents and protecting their vehicles. Chicago City Council members demanded an internal probe into officers\u2019 behavior.",
      "Similar tensions played out in California, where hundreds of protesters clashed with federal immigration authorities in June, prompting Trump to deploy thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, despite the objections of local authorities.",

      "But whether local officers step in if they disagree with federal agents' interactions with protesters is also uncertain.",
      "\u201cDo they have the power to intervene?\" Futterman asked. \"These are really difficult legal questions. It\u2019s a really fraught situation.\u201d",
      "Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Washington D.C.-based think tank the Police Executive Research Forum, said local police leaders are used to working with federal authorities including joint task forces aimed at terrorism, drugs or organized crime. But if the National Guard is deployed in Chicago, its role in performing local policing hasn\u2019t been clearly defined.",
      "On Thursday, the District of Columbia sued to stop President Donald Trump\u2019s deployment of National Guard during his law enforcement intervention there.",
      "\u201cAs far as the National Guard as police, they have traditionally assisted in natural disasters, large scale disturbances and aiding law enforcement in support functions like traffic and crowd control,\" Wexler said. \"I don\u2019t recall the National Guard being deployed to deal directly with day-to-day crime issues.\u201d",

      "\u201cBut the problem is it\u2019s short-lived. It can\u2019t be sustained. When they leave, crime returns. You haven\u2019t addressed the root causes of crime.\u201d",

      "An appeals court has upheld the conviction of a Minnesota man in a gun and drug case",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- An appeals court Monday upheld the conviction of a Minnesota man in a gun and drug case that put him back in legal trouble following the commutation of his life sentence in a high-profile murder case.",
      "The Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled that a search that followed a traffic stop and led to Myon Burrell's conviction on the gun and drug charges was legal.",
      "The court rejected defense arguments that police lacked probable cause to expand their investigation beyond the scope of an initial traffic stop into an impaired driving investigation, and that the ensuing search of his vehicle without a warrant was therefore illegal.",
      "Burrell was 16 when he was arrested for the 2002 death of 11-year-old Tyesha Edwards, a Minneapolis girl who was hit by a stray bullet. He maintained his innocence. The Associated Press and APM Reports in 2020 uncovered new evidence and serious flaws in that investigation, leading to the creation of an independent legal panel to review the case.",
      "Burrell was freed in 2020 after 18 years behind bars. The state pardons board commuted his sentence to time served, after he had spent more than half his life in prison, but denied his request for a full pardon.",
      "Then police in the Minneapolis suburb of Robbinsdale found drugs and a handgun in his SUV during a traffic stop in 2023. Since his conviction for first-degree murder remained on his record, it was still illegal for him to have a gun. He was convicted on the gun and drug charges last year and later sentenced to five years. Minnesota inmates typically serve two-thirds of their sentences in prison and one-third on supervised release.",

      "The defense argued that the officer's testimony was not credible because no smoke could be seen on his body camera or dashboard camera videos. But the appeals court said it found that argument to be unconvincing, and that it would defer to the trial court's finding that the officer's testimony was credible.",
      "The three-judge panel similarly rejected Burrell's challenges to the officer's statements that Burrell's eyes were bloodshot and his pupils were dilated, and that he saw marijuana residue on the SUV's console.",

      "\u201cYou need to start telling people about your whereabouts, so you don\u2019t disappear,\u201d Hatch said during Sunday services at New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to despair. We\u2019re not going to feel threatened. We\u2019re not going to give up and give in to fascism and authoritarianism.\u201d",
      "As Chicago braced for an immigration enforcement crackdown and a possible National Guard deployment, churches across the city turned up their response from the pulpit. Some worked to quell fears about detention and deportation while others addressed the looming possibility of more law enforcement on the streets of the nation\u2019s third-largest city.",
      "President Donald Trump has threatened federal intervention in Democratic strongholds, most recently warning apocalyptic force could be used in Chicago to fight crime and step up deportations. He\u2019s repeatedly cited the expected plans over fierce objections from local leaders and many residents who call it unnecessary and unwanted.",
      "While fears have been high in immigrant circles since Trump took office the second time, the threat of more federal agencies and troops has also inflamed tensions, particularly in Black and Latino communities where trust in police is fragile.",
      "Among the church attendees was Lester Burks, a 74-year-old U.S. Army veteran who said a military presence in Chicago would be threatening.",

      "Details on the expected intervention have been sparse, including its focus and when it\u2019s expected to begin. Trump\u2019s border czar Tom Homan said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that federal law enforcement action will come to Chicago this week. He also promised more worksite enforcement operations like the massive one at a Hyundai plant in Georgia.",

      "The Trump administration has repeatedly targeted, and unsuccessfully sued, over Chicago's sanctuary laws, which are among the strongest in the nation. His administration launched a nationwide immigration enforcement operation in the city in January.",
      "There is no official definition for sanctuary policies or sanctuary cities. The terms generally describe limits on local cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE enforces U.S. immigration laws nationwide but sometimes seeks state and local help.",
      "This time, the Department of Homeland Security plans to use a military base north of the city and has alerted leaders of another suburb that they\u2019ll use a federal immigration processing center there for an operation that\u2019ll potentially last 45 days.

      "Most of Chicago\u2019s nearly 3 million people are Black or Latino.

      "Trump targeted D.C. after deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles earlier this summer as the administration ramped up its immigration enforcement efforts and attempted to quell protests.

      "WASHINGTON -- Law enforcement officials on Sunday removed a peace vigil that had stood outside the White House for more than four decades after President Donald Trump ordered it to be taken down as part of the clearing of homeless encampments in the nation\u2019s capital.",
      "Philipos Melaku-Bello, a volunteer who has manned the vigil for years, told The Associated Press that the Park Police removed it early Sunday morning. He said officials justified the removal by mislabeling the memorial as a shelter.",
      "\u201cThe difference between an encampment and a vigil is that an encampment is where homeless people live,\u201d Melaku-Bello said. \u201cAs you can see, I don't have a bed. I have signs and it is covered by the First Amendment right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression.\u201d",
      "The White House confirmed the removal, telling AP in a statement that the vigil was a \"hazard to those visiting the White House and the surrounding areas.\u201d",
      "Taking down the vigil is the latest in a series of actions the Trump administration has ordered as part of its federal takeover of policing in the city, which began last month. The White House has defended the intervention as needed to fulfill Trump's executive order on the \u201cbeautification\u201d of D.C.",
      "Melaku-Bello said he's in touch with attorneys about what he sees as a civil rights violation. \u201cThey\u2019re choosing to call a place that is not an encampment an encampment just to fit what is in Trump\u2019s agenda of removing the encampments,\u201d he said.",
      "The vigil was started in 1981 by activist William Thomas to promote nuclear disarmament and an end to global conflicts.

      "Some history teachers are concerned about what may come of a White House review of the Smithsonian's public-facing content",
      "High school history teacher Katharina Matro often pulls materials from the Smithsonian Institution website as she assembles her lessons. She trusts its materials, which don't require the same level of vetting as other online resources. She uses documents and other primary sources it curates for discussions of topics like genocide and slavery.",
      "As the White House presses for changes at the Smithsonian, she's worried she may not be able to rely on it in the same way.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want a partisan history,\" said Matro, a teacher in Bethesda, Maryland. \"We want the history that\u2019s produced by real historians.\u201d",
      "Far beyond museums in Washington, President Donald Trump's review at the Smithsonian could influence how history is taught in classrooms around the country. The institution is a leading provider of curriculum and other educational materials, which are subject to the sweeping new assessment of all its public-facing content.",
      "Trump is moving to bring the Smithsonian into alignment with his vision of American history. In a letter last month to the Smithsonian Institution, the White House said its review is meant to \u201cassess tone, historical framing, and alignment with American ideals.\u201d It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s agenda to \u201ccelebrate American exceptionalism\u201d by removing \u201cdivisive or partisan narratives,\u201d it said.",
      "Those opposed to the changes fear they will promote a more sanitized version of American history.",
      "In celebration of the country\u2019s 250th anniversary next year, the Education Department recently launched the White House's Founders Museum in partnership with PragerU, a conservative nonprofit that produces videos on politics and history. Visitors to the museum in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, as well as the White House website, can read biographies on the signers of the Declaration of Independence and watch videos that depict them speaking.",
      "\u201cReal patriotic education means that just as our founders loved and honored America, so we should honor them,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a PragerU video introducing the project.",
      "The project mentions some signers favoring abolition and includes Phillis Wheatley, an enslaved woman who became the first published Black female poet in the U.S. But critics say it brushes over some of the nation\u2019s darker past.",
      "\u201cThose are the kinds of things that teachers are really leery of because they don't see partisanship in the sources that we're using as being good educational practice,\u201d said Tina Ellsworth, president of the National Council for the Social Studies.",
      "Like many other history teachers, Matro said she turns to materials from the Smithsonian because she doesn't have the time to create lessons from scratch or the budget to buy the latest books. She favors the museum's digitized collections to guide her classes.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have to figure out \u2018is this real? Is this not real?\u2019 I can trust the descriptions of the artifact,\u201d she said.",
      "More than 80% of history teachers report using free resources from federal museums, archives and institutions including the Smithsonian, according to an American Historical Association survey last year.",
      "The federal institutions' materials have been widely trusted partly because they are thoroughly examined by professionals, said Brendan Gillis, the historical association's director of teaching and learning. Some teachers have out-of-date history textbooks, and online resources from institutions like the Smithsonian can fill the gaps, he said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s been one of the most influential and profoundly important ways that the federal government has invested in social studies education over the last couple of decades,\u201d Gillis said.",
      "While education always has been part of the Smithsonian's mission, developing materials specifically for classrooms became more prevalent after World War II, said William Walker, a State University of New York, Oneonta, professor who has researched the Smithsonian\u2019s history. The museum organizes professional development workshops for teachers and offers materials ranging from worksheets to videos.",

    "story": [
      "Dr_ Joseph Ladapo, a Nigerian-born physician with impeccable U_S_ medical credentials, says that requiring vaccinations for diseases like measles, polio and chickenpox amounts to government-imposed \u201cslavery.\u201d",
      "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Dr. Joseph Ladapo, whose credentials include two Harvard University degrees, says that requiring vaccinations for diseases like measles, polio and chickenpox amounts to government-imposed \u201cslavery.\u201d It\u2019s far from the first time Florida\u2019s surgeon general has cut against the medical establishment grain.",
      "Ladapo, an appointee of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, made worldwide headlines this week by announcing Florida would seek to eliminate all mandated vaccinations for schoolchildren and others. He cast the immunization requirements, which date back decades and are considered a major global medical achievement that has saved millions of lives, as improper government intrusion in personal health decisions.",
      "\u201cEvery last one is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,\" Ladapo said at a news conference with DeSantis this week. \u201cWho am I, or anyone else, to tell you what you should put in your body? Who am I to tell you what your child should put in their body? I don\u2019t have that right.\u201d",
      "So far, a concrete action plan for eliminating immunization mandates in Florida has not emerged, despite multiple requests by The Associated Press. Ladapo acknowledged some proposed changes would require the state Legislature to act. Educators and many health professionals are aghast.",
      "\u201cRemoving policies that keep our children healthy creates unnecessary confusion and fear,\u201d said Dr. Rana Alissa, president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cSchools are tight-knit networks of children, educators, and families, making it easy for contagious diseases to spread.\"",
      "Ladapo, 46, emigrated from Nigeria to the U.S. at age five with his parents. He earned a degree in chemistry from Wake Forest University and then attended Harvard, where he got his medical degree and also a doctorate in health policy.",
      "This is a well-trodden path for medical expertise. Ladapo was affiliated after Harvard with New York University and later UCLA, where his op-eds against the pandemic response were noticed by DeSantis, who tapped him as Florida surgeon general in 2021. Ladapo also got a professor position at the University of Florida medical school in the deal.",
      "Like the governor, Ladapo raised questions about COVID-19 policies that forced people to wear masks and move education online, keep their distance from others and show proof of COVID vaccinations to attend public events, go to a restaurant or take a cruise. Ladapo also misrepresented studies to raise doubts about the mRNA vaccine, the studies' authors said.",
      "In a 2024 guidance statement, Ladapo's Department of Health warned against using the COVID vaccine at all, contending that \u201cthe federal government has failed to provide sufficient data to support the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 boosters, or acknowledge previously demonstrated safety concerns associated with COVID-19 vaccines and boosters.\u201d Those purported risks include respiratory tract infections, greater chance of autoimmune disease and cardiovascular problems.",
      "Almost every major medical or public health organization disputed those assertions, including the Food and Drug Administration: \u201cThe challenge we continue to face is the ongoing proliferation of misinformation and disinformation about these vaccines which results in vaccine hesitancy that lowers vaccine uptake,\u201d said the FDA statement, adding that the agency \u201crespectfully disagrees with the Florida Surgeon General\u2019s opinion.\u201d",
      "In his public comments, Ladapo makes clear he does not follow the guidance of government health experts who, in his view, don't look at the full picture of how to tackle disease and improve public health. His agency did not respond to an Associated Press request for an interview.",

      "\u201cAt what point are you free to make your own decisions?\" DeSantis said this week. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot over the years to really be on the right side of fighting against the hysteria.\u201d",

Childhood vaccines save lives,\u201d Wilson posted on social media this week. \u201cGovernor DeSantis must either remove Joseph Ladapo as Surgeon General or have him resign.\u201d",
      "There's no indication that will happen. Ladapo appears to have full support from DeSantis and many conservatives cheer his willingness to buck the medical establishment, including what some see as the untoward influence of pharmaceutical companies.",
      "\u201cThere are many brave people out there \u2014 moms & dads, doctors, scientists, and others \u2014 who have shown admirable courage in the fight for medical freedom,\u201d Ladapo posted recently on the X social media platform. \u201cLet's continue. Much more work to be done.\u201d",

      "The operation was the latest a long line of workplace raids conducted as part of the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation agenda.

      "The U.S. Capitol Police have led a massive training exercise in Maryland to improve coordination among law enforcement agencies",
      "LAUREL, Md. -- The car jolted as protesters pounded on its windows, boxing in the lawmaker trapped inside. Within seconds, officers in full riot gear surged forward in formation, yanking open the doors and pulling the passenger to safety. A few hundred yards away, another team of police moved just as quickly, surrounding, isolating and arresting a man spotted in the crowd with a gun.",
      "The clashes were staged, unfolding Friday at a Secret Service training complex in Maryland. The U.S. Capitol Police led the operation, joined by 600 officers representing nearly 20 agencies \u2014 including the Secret Service and local police and sheriff\u2019s departments \u2014 in one of the largest law enforcement training drills in the country. The goal was to sharpen coordination among the many agencies that must work side by side in Washington, a push shaped by the glaring security breakdowns of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.",
      "With 2025 on track to bring more threats against members of Congress than any year in history, law enforcement agencies are bracing for a volatile era defined by surging political violence, swelling protest movements and a more muscular federal role in local communities. The training highlighted how quickly multiple dangers can erupt at once, and how determined authorities are to prepare for the next flashpoint.",
      "The exercise comes at a moment when threats and attacks against public officials are mounting, and federal authorities have stepped more aggressively into cities to confront unrest. From the storming of the Capitol to more recent attacks targeting lawmakers and judges, the scenarios practiced in Friday\u2019s drill carried an unmistakable resonance: In today\u2019s America, the line between routine dissent and potential disaster feels increasingly thin.",
      "Commanders emphasized that the drills are not just about riot shields and tactical maneuvers. They also showcased new tools meant to prevent the kinds of communication breakdowns that hobbled the Jan. 6 response. Drones provided real-time aerial views of the mock protests, while mobile command posts allowed leaders from different agencies to track the action simultaneously and direct units on the ground.",
      "Officials said the biggest shift since Jan. 6 has been the rhythm of coordination itself. Agencies that once trained largely in isolation now drill together, building muscle memory for rapid deployments and cross-agency communication that can determine whether a protest remains peaceful or spirals into violence.",
      "\u201cTraining like this is incredibly important,\u201d said Michael Sullivan, chief of the U.S. Capitol Police. \u201cMaking sure that we understand how the different teams work is critically important if we ever have to make that call for them to come in and help.\u201d",
      "The push reflects how deeply Jan. 6 still looms over the force. Sean Gallagher, an assistant chief who has overseen the department\u2019s response to scathing inspector general and congressional reports, said the agency is not ignoring those failures. Instead, he cast the drill as a deliberate attempt to turn lessons into action.",

      "Reflecting on the mistakes of the past, Gallagher said the agency wouldn\u2019t shy away from them, but that \u201cthis is our attempt at fixing those issues.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re facing a lot of different threats. It\u2019s a heightened political environment that we continuously operate in on Capitol Hill. We\u2019ve taken the lessons of the past, we\u2019ve incorporated them into these scenarios and the goal with this is to be proactive and not reactive.\u201d",
      "That urgency is felt not just in the command ranks but also on the front lines. Aaron Davis, a Capitol Police officer who has worked on the civil disturbance unit for nearly eight years and responded to the Jan. 6 attack, said the drills are essential because no scenario feels implausible anymore.",
      "\u201cWe use our imagination like crazy in training, just because you don\u2019t want that to be the first time you encounter something of that nature,\u201d he said, recalling the storming of the Capitol that left hundreds of his fellow officers injured.",
      "In other scenarios, demonstrators shouted \u201cFree D.C.\u201d as they hurled wooden blocks meant to simulate bricks \u2014 a nod to the rising anger over the surge of federal agents and National Guard troops into the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cKeep moving, back up!\u201d officers yelled as they marched the crowd down the street behind riot shields, while an unmarked police van pulled in to carry away those taken off in handcuffs. The realism of the drills, officials said, was intentional: Each scenario was designed to mirror the volatile mix of protest and confrontation that has become increasingly common in American cities.",
      "For the Secret Service, the lessons stretch back to the mass demonstrations that filled Washington in 2020 during the first Trump administration. Andrew Ackley, assistant chief of the agency\u2019s Uniform Division, said those experiences underscored how much tactics must change as threats evolve.",
      "\u201cThe training has evolved significantly because we\u2019re constantly learning. None of these situations are identical, right? None of these situations can be copycat from another one. So we\u2019re constantly evolving. We\u2019re constantly training,\u201d Ackley said.",

      "The clothes designed by Giorgio Armani (July 11, 1934-Sept. 4, 2025) very much reflected relaxed elegance \u2013 a supercool attitude that blurred divisions between men's and women's clothing. Forming the Giorgio Armani Company in 1975, he first made menswear, then launched a women's line, one that recut a traditional men's suit jacket.",
      "Armani told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2006 that it was a response to the emerging feminist movement; he thought women needed their own sexy version of boardroom attire. \"When I started blending men and women's fashions many years ago, the public often became uneasy and perplexed,\" he said.",
      "Born in Piacenza, Italy, Armani's was a childhood ravaged by World War II, his family's home destroyed by bombs. Though he hadn't dreamed of a career in design, a temporary job in a department store made him realize he had a knack. Rising through the ranks, he worked for designer Nino Cerutti, but lacked formal training of his own.",
      "In 1966, Armani met Sergio Galeotti, an architectural draftsman who became his partner in work and in life. Galeotti encouraged Armani to begin designing on his own.",
      "Armani would put Italian ready-to-wear style on the international fashion map in the late 1970s. His liningless sports jacket, paired with a T-shirt, was an instant success, while his women's pantsuit was revolutionary. He landed on the cover of Time magazine, and his clothes found their way into countless films (including \"American Gigolo\"), and on the red carpet.",
      "After the death of Galeotti in 1985, Armani continued the company, building it into a $10 billion empire encompassing not just fashion but also home design, bars and restaurants, perfumes, cosmetics, and even a basketball team, Olympia Milano.",

    "story": [
      "2024 was a historic year for comedian Nate Bargatze. As the highest-grossing stand-up in the country, he set attendance records at several massive arenas. But a small gymnasium in Nashville \u2013 the home of the Donelson Christian Academy Wildcats \u2013 is where he's recently made his mark. He's donated more than a million dollars to his alma matter, which now features the Nate Bargatze Gymnasium.",
      "Bargatze never played on this court: \"Yeah, I was cut every year from my basketball team,\" he said. \"But now, you know, now they can't cut you!\"",
      "Donelson Christian Academy is a private high school his family could only afford because his father taught here. \"My freshman year, he's assistant coach,\" Bargatze said. \"So that really got it started. When your dad cuts you, it kind of sets the tone for the rest of your high school.\"",
      "Nate's father, Stephen Bargatze, also happens to be a professional magician. Before that, he was a clown. As you might imagine, that provided some inspiration for a career in comedy \u2013 and for some early stand-up material:",
      "\"It's funny, too, when I tell people my dad was a clown. People will just be like 'Ugh, I hate clowns.' Hey, remember that time I just said my dad was a clown?\"",
      "After dropping out of community college, Bargatze moved from Nashville to Chicago, where he honed his style performing for free at small clubs. \"I would never trade it, and I would never go back,\" he said. \"You just didn't know no better. There's nothing better than when you don't know that there's better.\"",
      "He then made the move to New York. But in 2014, just as his stand-up career was taking off, Bargatze made a surprising move back home to Nashville.",
      "Why? \"You know what? I always thought it was the first thing I did that wasn't for me,\" he said. \"I wanted my daughter to grow up in a normal situation, as normal as it can be. And so it was like, 'All right, let's move back.' And when I moved back, I just didn't tell anybody.\"",
      "I asked, \"Were you worried that there was going to be an impression that, like, 'Well, he moved back to Nashville, he's given up'?\"",
      "\"That's why I didn't tell anybody, 'cause I thought they would think I'd quit,\" Bargatze said. \"And I was so scared of that. So, I just didn't say anything.\"",
      "Nobody would ever think that now. Bargatze has since released five hour-long specials, written a New York Times bestselling book, and sold more than a million tickets last year alone.",
      "\"I don't know anything about history. And I can tell, because every history movie I watch, I watch on the edge of my seat. I watched 'Pearl Harbor,' I was as surprised as they were.\"",
      "His next milestone? Hosting the Primetime Emmy Awards next Sunday on CBS.",
      "\"I love show business,\" he said while recording promotional material for the awards. \"I love all of this. And as part of me, I want to do everything. You're just curious to go, like, Well, what is that like? What is that, you know, when you do 'Saturday Night Live'?\u00a0It's like, I want to see the chaos. I want to feel the chaos.\"",
      "Bargatze has hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" twice. [\"I'm as shocked as you are that I'm here,\" he said in his monologue.] His \"Washington's Dream\" sketch became one of the most viral sketches in years:",
      "There's more acting on the horizon. Bargatze just finished filming his first feature, \"The Breadwinner,\" costarring Mandy Moore, set to hit theaters next spring. His character is a bumbling dad \u2013 a role he says is not too dissimilar from his real-life personality. \"We eased into it,\" he said, \"I ain't crying in this movie, I can tell you that. In the movie, I have three daughters and, you know, I have one daughter.\"",
      "\"Oh my gosh, give him the Academy Award right now,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah. Yeah,\" he laughed. \"There's a lot of buzz about it!\"",
      "Bargatze met his wife, Laura, when he was 21; they were coworkers at an Applebee's. As he recounted in the 2017 special \"The Standups,\" \"I went from, like, my mom to her. So, I don't even know what it feels like not to have some lady be like, 'I don't know if I would do that, you know?'\"",
      "Their daughter, Harper, introduces his stand-up specials, which are intentionally family-friendly. He's a clean comic.",
      "\"I love that people when they come to my show, it's, uh, I don't wanna betray that trust,\" he said. \"You can have your kid watch my stand-up and you don't like, if you see 'em have it on, you don't have to be like, 'Whoa, what's going on?'\"",
      "While working clean can be a savvy business decision, it allows one to sell tickets to the widest audience possible. For Bargatze, it's also part of a larger mission. He said, \"You feel like you're being asked to do this and the career that I have. And so, you just gotta trust that, uh, your path is gonna be the path, and just stick with it.\"",
      "I said, \"When you say asked to do this, do you mean in like sort of a religious calling kind of a way?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" he replied. \"You feel \u2013 you know, I feel it's beyond me.\"",
      "With \"Good Clean Funny\" as its mantra, Bargatze's company, Nateland, produces specials, live events, and podcasts featuring other clean comedians. He even has dreams of one day opening his own theme park and movie studio in Nashville.",
      "\"I'm not gonna be able to go to every city in America for the rest of my life,\" he said. \"So, I want to build a place where you can come. And if you and your wife and your kids are 11 and they want to go run off on their own for a second, I want that to happen.\"",
      "To pull off all of his ambitious plans, one of the most successful touring comedians of all time is already plotting the end of his touring days.",
      "\"I'm doing this tour, I plan on doing one more tour after that,\" he said. \"I need to go do movies, and I need to build that world up and learn how to do all of that stuff. So, I'm gonna dive into that aspect of it. I can see myself being and making movies for, like, another 15 years, and then \u2013 if I'm allowed to! I mean, it might all fall apart.\"",
      "These days, during breaks on his grueling tour schedule, Bargatze is able to briefly take his mind off stand-up by playing golf. \"I mean, it's kind of like stand-up,\" he said. \"You're kind of out there on your own. Golf is, uh, you're so much like thinking about what you're doing out there. I realized, like, I can't turn my brain off, so I just need to direct it to something else.\"",
      "Bargatze has a lot to focus on. The day before he hosts the Emmys in Los Angeles, he's performing two back-to-back arena shows in Denver. But he wouldn't have it any other way.",
      "He said, \"I know how to kind of operate in this chaos. And if you pulled me out and gave me a month off, I think I would be like lost right now. Let's keep going. We're in a good groove. You don't want to kind of stop the groove. Yeah, it'll be a lot of stuff. It's a lot of stuff!\"",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 09:37:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A Mike Tyson-Floyd Mayweather fight was announced Thursday. But there are multiple questions surrounding the bout.",
    "story": [
      "The boxing world was hit with a big announcement on Thursday night when former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and former multi-division champion Floyd Mayweather said they\u00a0agreed to a bout to be held in the spring of 2026.",
      "Details on a date, location, television partner and any potential professional sanctioning of the bout were not immediately released, though both Hall-of-Fame boxers appeared excited about the fight in a press release distributed by CSI Sports.",
      "\"I still can't believe Floyd wants to really do this,\" Tyson said in the release. \"It's going to be detrimental to his health, but he wants to do it, so it's signed and it's happening!\"",
      "\"I've been doing this for 30 years and there hasn't been a single fighter that can tarnish my legacy,\" Mayweather said. \"You already know that if I am going to do something, it's going to be big and it's going to be legendary. I'm the best in the business of boxing. This exhibition will give the fans what they want.\"",
      "Coming Soon pic.twitter.com/lSeyrR0BKO",
      "While Mayweather noted that the bout would be an exhibition, meaning it wouldn't be sanctioned by an athletic commission or count toward either fighter's professional record, this was not confirmed by the fight promoters. But the sanctioning of the bout is just one of multiple outstanding questions surrounding this clash between two of the biggest names in boxing history. Below, we'll break down a few others.",
      "Will it be a professional, sanctioned bout?",
      "This is arguably the biggest question surrounding the bout but it's unlikely to be professionally sanctioned, despite the fact that Tyson just fought his first professional fight in 19 years when he lost to Jake Paul last November. Mayweather has had multiple exhibition bouts since retiring in 2017 following a knockout win against Conor McGregor. But he hasn't fought professionally since then, when he left the ring with a perfect 50-0 record. Mayweather indicated that the fight with Tyson will be an exhibition but he did not immediately respond to a CBS News request for further comment.",
      "What weight class would the fight be held in?",
      "This will largely depend on whether the bout is professional or an exhibition. If it's the former, then the boxers will need to agree on a weight limit that they would both be held to. But if it's an exhibition, which seems to be the case, it's likely that both boxers will enter the ring around the weight they last fought at. That means Mayweather would be around the middleweight limit, while Tyson is likely to be around the 220-pound range he often fought at as a champion in the 1980s and 1990s. Tyson tipped the scales at 230 pounds for his fight with Paul 10 months ago.",
      "Would the fight be held under non-standard rules?",
      "Whether it's a pro fight or an exhibition, there may be other, non-standardized rules in play here. Tyson is 59 years old. Mayweather is 48 years old. Boxers in that age range, when they do enter the ring, tend to perform under different rules and regulations. When Tyson fought Paul last fall, for example, the length of the rounds was reduced to two minutes from the standard three. And it was limited to an eight-round fight, when it normally would have been 10 for a non-championship affair. Both boxers also wore heavier gloves in the bout than is the norm, which is likely to be the case for a Tyson-Mayweather affair, too.",
      "Is this a new trend in boxing?",
      "Boxing exhibitions featuring retired champions is nothing new to the sport. Mayweather and former foe Manny Pacquiao have done so multiple times in recent years. While it may not be a boxing purist's preference, it's not unusual.",
      "What is a bit unique, however, is that this will be Tyson's third fight in approximately six years, after retiring from the sport in 2005. He fought an exhibition against former champion Roy Jones, Jr. in 2020 and Paul last November. Paul, meanwhile, who boxed Tyson as a heavyweight, appears to be moving on to his own exhibition fight against former lightweight champion Gervonta Davis, in an another match between boxers in wildly different weight classes. That fight was\u00a0announced for Nov. 14.",

      "At a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday, Kennedy defended the Trump administration's policies: \"We at HHS are enacting a once-in-a-generation shift from a sick-care system, to a true health care system that tackles the root causes of chronic disease,\" he said.",

Or when you told Americans that there's no safe and effective vaccine?\"",

      "Yet some Republicans notably did push Kennedy on how his long-standing opposition to vaccine mandates is affecting policy, and on Kennedy's doubts about the safety of various vaccines. Sen. John Barasso (R-Wyo.) said, \"There are real concerns that safe, proven vaccines like measles, like hepatitis B and others, could be in jeopardy.\"",
      "The committee room standoff had been brewing for days. On Aug. 27, the government announced new restrictions on eligibility for COVID vaccinations. That decision prompted some health organizations to warn the policy could cause confusion.",

      "The Trump White House stood by Secretary Kennedy's sweeping changes, and by the firing. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said of Monarez, \"She was not aligned with President Trump's mission to make America healthy again.\"",

With Operation Warp Speed's unprecedented success delivering COVID-19 vaccines in record time, President Trump proved that it's possible to shake up the status quo of our broken and bureaucratic public health system to deliver real results for the American people. Now the second Trump administration is building on this record and experience to restore Gold Standard Science as the guiding principle of health decision-making at HHS to Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Susan Monarez has written that she was pressured to \"compromise science itself\" \u2013 and to sign off on people who \"have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric.\"",
      "This turbulence has put Kennedy, who was a key Trump ally during last year's campaign, in the spotlight.",
      "Asked whether there has been pressure within the Republican Party to stand by Kennedy, Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul said, \"Nobody's pressured me or ever called me on it. I sort of speak my mind. And these are long-standing beliefs for me.\"",
      "Paul, an ophthalmologist, supports Kennedy, and lays blame on scientists \u2014 not skeptics \u2014 for worries about vaccine safety. \"All the doubt over vaccines is \u2013 there might be some doubt coming from those who don't want you to take a vaccine, but quite a bit of doubt is coming from the establishment that I believe is authoritarian in nature,\" said Paul. \"You don't care whether they tell you what to do. You should just do what you're told. We know better than you.\"",
      "But some who have worked at the highest level are fighting back against criticism, and are sounding an alarm.",
      "\"A significant distrust of vaccines\"",
      "Four CDC officials \u2014 Doctors Jennifer Layden, Daniel Jernigan, Debra Houry, and Demetre Daskalakis \u2014 all have resigned in recent days, some citing Secretary Kennedy's vaccine policies, others citing the upheaval at the CDC, which provides crucial health guidance nationwide.",
      "And all four expressed concerns about their resulting trust in CDC information about vaccines and vaccine safety data. \"It's why I left; I'm very concerned,\" said Dr. Daskalakis. \"We've already crossed the line. The COVID recommendations for children and pregnant women are completely not based in any evidence that world experts agree on.\"",
      "I asked, \"You know Secretary Kennedy would push back on that; what would you tell him?\"",
      "\"Ah, easy,\" Daskalakis replied. \"The recommendation is that there should be no healthy kids that get the vaccine; it should only be in kids with underlying conditions. Kids that are six-months-old, 56% of them that are admitted to the hospital have no underlying condition. So, by not offering the vaccine to parents who are willing to do it, those kids that could have been protected won't be.\"",
      "Asked how he would label Kennedy and his view of vaccines, Dr. Daniel Jernigan said, \"I think he has a significant distrust of vaccines. I don't know that he's driving a get-rid-of-vaccines agenda. It's more death by a thousand cuts, death by a thousand questions, calling into question data that has been accepted for many, many years, and simply that calling it into question brings into people's minds that, 'Maybe I shouldn't get that vaccine.'\"",
      "Dr. Debra Houry said that when Kennedy began at HHS, \"I read his books. I wanted to better understand his research and his background on it. So, we were open, you know, to having those discussions.\"",
      "In an additional statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said:",
      "\"Americans haven't forgotten how 'the science' was politicized and weaponized during the COVID era by unaccountable 'health officials' to push intrusive mandates and stifle any semblance of the skepticism that actual scientific inquiry is based on. The Trump administration is committed to restoring evidence-based, Gold Standard Science and answering the questions that Americans haven't been allowed to ask to restore trust, confidence, and accountability in our public health bodies.\"",
      "Asked what the cost to Americans would be of doctors and other officials leaving the CDC, Dr. Jennifer Layden said, \"We're talking about the whole public health infrastructure of our nation. And I think when we start to see (and we will) outbreaks that normally don't happen \u2013 more food-borne outbreaks, Legionella outbreaks, rising measles cases \u2013 people will start to care. That may take time for us to see some of those negative consequences, but that's what the ripple effect of all this will do across our nation.\"",
      "In fact, ripple effects are already apparent.",
      "\"Diseases don't obey borders\"",
      "Just this past week, Florida's Republican governor announced plans to eliminate all childhood vaccine requirements.",
      "Meanwhile, West Coast Democratic governors who oppose Secretary Kennedy's policies are moving fast to protect vaccine programs in their states.",
      "I asked Dr. Atul Gawande, a surgeon who served in the Biden administration, \"What is the consequence for the country when you have such a differentiation? It's splintered.\"",
      "\"It's severely splintered, and I'm very worried about it,\" Gawandea replied, \"because diseases don't obey borders.",
      "For Gawande, Kennedy's actions could upend not only federal agencies, but America's standing in global health. \"There isn't always consensus, for sure, among our own medical community,\" he said, \"but we generally have been able to come together enough to be able to say, 'Here is where we can assure getting \u2013 whether it's COVID boosters, and making sure we don't leave out the people who are most in need of vaccination \u2013 to making sure we're not abandoning our childhood immunization. Other countries around the world are baffled by our now falling into a civil war over whether the discoveries that have saved the world mattered.\"",
      "Later this month, the CDC's vaccine advisory board \u2014\u00a0now featuring Kennedy appointees\u00a0\u2014 will meet to decide future guidelines.",
      "At the end of the day, Gawande says, \"Trust helps assuage doubt.\"",
      "But, I asked, \"Is trust still possible in this environment?\"",
      "\"Trust is still possible,\" said Gawande, \"but it is not possible while we have leaders who actively drive chaos, who actively are trying to create uncertainty and break down trust. But ultimately, people have to choose the leaders who have the track record of demonstrating better outcomes. And those leaders are scientists, health professionals, and others who have demonstrated over years that they actually get you better results.\"",

      "\"So she's lying today to the American people in the Wall Street Journal?\" Wyden asked.",

Last week, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez was fired, and several other top CDC officials resigned from their jobs in protest. Staff are also reeling from layoffs, changes to the vaccine approval system \u2014 led by Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic \u2014 and a shooting outside the CDC headquarters last month.",
      "Wednesday's letter accused Kennedy of \"endangering the nation's health.\" It cited last week's upheaval at the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration's decision to rescind emergency approvals that made the COVID-19 vaccines available for young children, and the elevation of \"political ideologues who pose as scientific experts\" to key vaccine approval posts.",
      "It called for Kennedy to resign, and said that if he declines to leave his post voluntarily, President Trump should pick a new HHS secretary.",

      "The group said the signatories for Wednesday's letter were provided to members of Congress, but weren't publicly listed due to security and privacy concerns.",
      "HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon responded to the letter by defending Kennedy's record and arguing he is working to restore trust in a \"broken\" CDC.",
      "\"From his first day in office, he pledged to check his assumptions at the door \u2014 and he asked every HHS colleague to do the same,\" Nixon said. \"That commitment to evidence-based science is why, in just seven months, he and the HHS team have accomplished more than any health secretary in history in the fight to end the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "Separately, nine former CDC directors wrote a New York Times op-ed on Monday that castigated Kennedy for making decisions they said were \"unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency,\" and argued Monarez's firing \"adds considerable fuel to this raging fire.\"",

      "According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations, the average \"perceived probability\" of finding a new job after losing one fell 5.8% points to 44.9% among heads of households surveyed in August, the lowest measure on record since 2013 when the New York Fed began collecting data.",
      "At the same time, Americans are increasingly worried about losing their current job. Expectations that the U.S. unemployment rate will be higher a year from now crept up 1.7 percentage points to 39.1%, the New York Fed found.",
      "The data comes as Americans adopt a dimmer view of the economy. According to a\u00a0recent CBS News poll, a majority of respondents continue to say the economy is getting worse.",
      "The labor market has been under a microscope since July employment data showed weaker-than-expected job growth and sharp downward revisions for the months of June and May. August's data, released Friday, pointed to a slump in U.S. hiring, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs. Unemployment also ticked up to 4.3%, the highest rate since October 2022.",
      "\"Employers may be holding onto their current workers amid uncertainty, but they are not adding new positions,\" Allison Shrivastava, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In turn, employees have taken the hint, staying in their current jobs rather than seeking new opportunities.\"",
      "According to a recent Bankrate survey, about half of Americans are planning to search for a new job in the next year. At the same time, data shows that the number of people changing jobs has slowed significantly since 2022, when millions of people quit their jobs during the \"Great Resignation.\"",

    "summary": "Economists expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to revise its jobs data downward for the year ended in March 2025. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "The latest jobs report\u00a0points to a labor market that's faltering, but the slowdown may have begun much earlier. Economists expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics tomorrow to issue a major downward revision, showing the nation added hundreds of thousands fewer jobs than first reported.",
      "On Sept. 9, the BLS will release its preliminary benchmark revision to labor market data, which aims to better account for businesses that have opened or closed. Economists say the revision, covering the 12-month period through March 2025, could show that hiring during that time was about 800,000 jobs lower than previously reported.",
      "The report could draw attention from the Trump administration, as the president last month questioned the validity of the monthly jobs report \u2014 and fired the commissioner\u00a0of the BLS \u2014 after the data included a significant downward revision. Hiring experts and economists point to a job market that's stalling out as some businesses are bearing increased tariff costs while others are tapping artificial intelligence as a way to lower labor costs and\u00a0replace workers.",
      "\"The labor market will likely look even worse after the release of the preliminary benchmark revision to payrolls on Sept. 9,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, noted in an email.",
      "The revision could show that employment was reduced by about 775,000 for the 12 months through March, Adams estimated. That would indicate that the average monthly job growth in 2024 actually stood at 100,000 per month, down from the 165,000 previously reported, he added.",
      "The revision would cover only the first three months of Mr. Trump's second administration, with the bulk of the timeframe occurring in the last year of former President Biden's administration.",
      "Job growth has slowed dramatically in recent months, with the employers adding an average of 29,000 jobs each month from June through August, the most recent BLS data shows.",
      "Why does the government revise its jobs data?",
      "Jobs revisions occur each month, with the BLS updating its data to reflect more recent information it has received from businesses about the pace of hiring. That's because some companies respond late to the BLS' surveys, which means the agency receives an influx of new information after it has issued its initial monthly jobs report, prompting the fresh numbers.",
      "But once a year, the BLS also issues an annual revision based on fresh data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which tracks employment and wages reported by employers that cover more than 95% of U.S. jobs.",
      "While the monthly jobs report relies on about 50,000 responses for each period, the QCEW covers 11 million workplaces \u2014 but that scope requires more time for collecting the data versus the BLS' monthly report, Adams of Comerica said.",
      "\"The QCEW's detail lets it directly measure jobs added at newly-opened workplaces and lost at closing ones, which account for several millions of employment churn each year,\" he added.",
      "What happened in the last annual revision?",
      "The BLS issued a\u00a0major downward\u00a0revision last year for the same annual data, showing that employers added 818,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months ended March 2024 than previously estimated. That lowered average monthly job growth for the period to 174,000, down from the initial estimate of 242,000.",
      "At the time, the downward revision was seen as evidence that the labor market was showing cracks, and it was viewed as paving the way for the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its September 2024 meeting.",
      "What does this mean for a Fed rate cut?",
      "The Fed will be focused on analyzing recent economic data, such as the latest jobs report and the next Consumer Price Index, which will be issued on Sept. 11. Economists expect the CPI to show an annualized increase of 2.9% in August, higher than the prior month's 2.7% and well above the Fed's goal of reaching a 2% annual rate.",
      "With the labor market hitting a wall in recent months, economists now expect the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17 meeting. The only question is whether the Fed might usher in a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, or opt for the typical cut of 0.25 percentage points.",
      "\"Market odds currently see a 100% chance of a Fed rate cut this month, with a small constituent seeing an outsized 50-basis-point cut on Sept. 17 within the realm of possibility,\" Anthony Saglimbene, Ameriprise chief market strategist, wrote in a Sept. 8 research note.",
      "But, he added, if the August's Consumer Price Index comes in hotter than expected on Sept. 11, that \"would likely throw cold water on the idea that the Fed is considering an outsized September rate cut.\"",
      "President Trump has\u00a0repeatedly lashed out at Powell\u00a0this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over\u00a0whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority\u00a0to do so. Powell's term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026.",

      "No criminal charges were announced during Friday's news conference.

      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"As these unprecedented trade deals and the administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and historic working-class tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "In response to the jobs report, President Trump on Friday posted on social media that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell should have moved sooner to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs can stimulate job growth by driving consumer spending and making it cheaper for businesses to expand their operations.",
      "\"Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should have lowered rates long ago. As usual, he's 'Too Late!',\" the president wrote.",
      "Here are three key takeaways from economists about the latest employment figures.",
      "The job market is stalling",
      "Overall hiring in August was far weaker than economists expected. More troubling, the numbers look considerably worse after stripping out the two sectors that showed some of the strongest growth in August \u2014 health care and social assistance. Health care companies created 31,000 new jobs last month, while social assistance \u2014 employers such as food banks and those providing services for disabled people, children and low-income families \u2014 added 16,000 new jobs.",
      "But many other sectors had stagnant or even declining job growth, such as manufacturing, which shed 12,000 jobs in August, and professional and business services, which lost 17,000.",
      "\"Absent the secular gains in health care and social assistance, the cyclical categories of the private service sector (excluding health care and social assistance) have collectively turned negative on average in the past four months,\" Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic said in a report Friday.",
      "Hiring this summer was also weaker than previously thought. The Labor Department's latest\u00a0data\u00a0shows employers cut 13,000 jobs in June, rather than adding 14,000 new hires as the agency had reported in its first estimate for that month. The June drop marks the first decline in monthly jobs since late 2020.",
      "Although July payroll gains were revised up slightly, total job growth for June and July was 21,000 lower than previously reported, according to the Labor Department.",
      "Job growth is at its lowest level in 15 years",
      "The average monthly job gains since January represent the fewest jobs added over the first eight months of the year in 15 years, excluding the pandemic-triggered crisis period of 2020, Indeed's Ullrich noted.",
      "\"We haven't added this few jobs since 2010, and we have 17 million more people in the labor market than we did then,\" she said. \"That, to me, is a staggering headline.\"",
      "That loss of momentum in creating new jobs is raising concerns about the overall strength of the economy. The nation's gross domestic product \u2014 the total value of goods and services \u2014 is expanding\u00a0more slowly than in 2024, while inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's annual growth target of 2%.",
      "That combination has caused some economists to warn about the risk of the U.S. entering a period of\u00a0\"stagflation,\" a toxic mix of high prices and weak growth. Forecasters expect Consumer Price Index data for August, which is set to be released next week, to show inflation rising at an annual rate of 2.9%, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "\"Concerns about the health of the economy are starting to creep in,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in an email. \"Equally, a strong inflation print next week could strike new fears about a stagflationary mix.\"",
      "The Fed is highly likely to cut interest rates this month",
      "Across the board, economists on Friday said the subpar August jobs report virtually locks in a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut when policymakers meet on Sept. 17.\u00a0 The question is by how much.",
      "August hiring was so anemic that some economists now think the Fed could opt for a 0.5 percentage point cut \u2014 double the typical rate cut \u2014 in a bid to keep the job market on track. Traders now see a 10% chance of a jumbo cut and a 90% likelihood of a 0.25 percentage point reduction, according to CME FedWatch. Prior to Friday's jobs report, the market was completely discounting a jumbo cut, the tool shows.",
      "Some economists also think the Fed will continue trimming rates later in 2025 to counter the weak job market.",
      "\"With the weak job growth, the Fed is cleared to cut rates in September. The question is whether we get [0.25 or 0.50 percentage points],\" Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, said in an email. \"We continue to believe the Fed will ease into the cutting cycle here with one rather than two, but there is some latitude here.\"",

    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 22,000 jobs in August, falling short of economists' muted expectations and signaling the labor market is facing sharp headwinds from mounting economic uncertainty amid the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs.",
      "The numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 80,000 last month, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in August, up from 4.2% in July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.",
      "The latest data points to an ongoing slowdown in the labor market, with employers hiring an average of 29,000 each month from June through August, versus 168,000 workers each month in 2024. Revised data shows that employers shed 13,000 jobs in June rather than adding the 14,000 that had been reported a month earlier, marking the first decline since late 2020.",
      "Some companies are paring back hiring plans amid the on-again, off-again uncertainty of the Trump administration's tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies. Businesses in seven of the Fed's 12 regional districts canvassed in the latest so-called Beige Book, a survey of local economic conditions, said they were hesitant to hire because of weaker demand and uncertainty over the near-term outlook.",
      "\"August's employment report confirmed that the labor market has headed off a cliff-edge,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a Friday research report.",
      "Consumers are also dour, with a new CBS News poll finding that Americans are continuing to rate the U.S. economy negatively, with most respondents picking \"uncertain\" and \"struggling\" to describe its current state.",
      "The August jobs report marks the first since President Trump\u00a0fired former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Aug. 1 in the wake of a disappointing July jobs report, which included a significant downward revision of May and June hiring figures.",
      "Citing the large revisions, Mr. Trump questioned the validity of the government data, although the BLS typically revises its prior reports each month based on fresher responses from employers.",
      "The new revisions",
      "On Friday, the BLS revised the prior two months' data, showing that employers shed 13,000 jobs in June, revising the month's hiring downward by 27,000 fewer jobs. That marks the first monthly decline in hiring since December 2020, when the U.S. was in the midst of an economic crisis caused by the pandemic.",
      "The BLS also revised July's jobs numbers upward, showing that employers added 79,000 workers that month, rather than the 73,000 reported in August.",
      "The revisions show that the economy added 21,000 fewer jobs in June and July than had earlier been reported by the BLS.",
      "What economists say",
      "The labor market data is complicating the Federal Reserve's next rate cut decision, which set for Sept. 17. The central bank's dual mandate requires it to ensure that both inflation and unemployment remain low, but inflation has been edging upward, which economists say is partly due to Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The Fed's most powerful weapon for battling inflation is to hike interest rates, yet its best option for helping the job market is to lower borrowing costs, making it cheaper for businesses to expand. With the combination of rising inflation and weaker hiring, the Fed is in a tough position, economists say.",
      "Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has been under pressure from Mr. Trump to cut rates, signaled that the central bank is open to reducing rates at its September meeting, citing risks to the labor market.",
      "\"The labor market continues to show fatigue as businesses hold back on hiring amid uncertainty around the direction of inflation, tariffs and the strength of the underlying economy,\" said Joe Gaffoglio, CEO at Mutual of America Capital Management, in an email after the data was released.",
      "\"Recent labor data showed that more individuals are unemployed in the U.S. (7.24 million) than there are available jobs (7.18 million), which hasn't happened since April 2021,\" he added.",
      "The latest data is likely to ensure a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting, experts said on Friday. The lower-than-expected hiring, as well as June's negative revision, could also persuade the central bank to cut later in the year as well, they added.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve needs to cut interest rates in September and probably October and December, too. The 'no hiring' economy is turning to a layoff economy and if that worsens, it will lead to a recession. This needs to be stopped,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email.",

      "Jackpot winners have the option to either take a lump sum payment of the estimated cash value \u2014 in this case, a total of roughly $820 million \u2014 or they can opt to receive their prize as an annuity, paid in 30 graduated payments over 29 years. In either case, those totals are before the Internal Revenue Service takes a cut, as do most states.",
      "Should you take a lump sum payment or annuity option?",
      "Dan Geltrude, a certified public accountant in New Jersey, told CBS News: \"I personally would take the lump sum payment because I feel comfortable in how I can invest my money. However, having that much money for a lot of people is dangerous.\"",

    "summary": "Armani never relinquished control over the multibillion-dollar company he created, a key to his enormous success.",
    "story": [
      "Giorgio Armani leaves a legacy not only as a seminal figure in the history of fashion, but also as a visionary business leader who built a globally recognized brand and multibillion-dollar business empire, industry experts said after his death Thursday at age 91.",
      "\"Armani made certain that his vision was consistent and that it was always classy, even down to presentation in the Armani Exchange stores,\" Shawn Grain Carter, an associate professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Armani, or \"Re Giorgio\" (King George) as the Italians call him, famously created luxury looks for Hollywood stars, while also producing stylish accessories and clothing for everyday consumers.",
      "While meticulously tailored clothing made from quality fabrics has always been at the heart of the Armani brand, the designer expanded his business over the years to include not just perfumes and accessories but home furnishings, cosmetics, books, flowers \u2014 even chocolates. Connecting them all was sophisticated design, which Armani wove into all things he put his name on.",
      "\"He was masterful in sticking to his vision, but executing it in a way that would be accessible luxury, a quiet luxury, but still tasteful and elegantly crafted,\" Grain Carter said.",
      "Among Armani's most celebrated contributions and successful business maneuvers was the power suit, a softly tailored, ready-to-wear take on office attire that quickly rose in popularity among the American business class.",
      "Introduced in the '70s, the Armani suit was a bold deviation from the rigid, restrictive suits businessmen were accustomed to wearing. Armani's elegantly tailored suits quickly became a must in every well-heeled man's closet.",
      "Beth Dincuff, an associate professor at New York's Parsons School of Design, said Armani cultivated the idea of a \"sophisticated man who cared about how he looked, who was aware of his physique and who wanted to show it off in a new way.\"",
      "Armani soon brought that masculine sensibility to women's fashion with the pantsuit, a shoulder-padded jacket and tailored trousers. This gave women a refined option for the office that projected confidence and power.",
      "\"That's attributed to Giorgio Armani \u2014 making it OK for a woman to wear a pantsuit but still look like a woman in terms of a power aesthetic,\" said Grain Carter.",
      "Armani's designs also had a knack for tapping into the zeitgeist. He\u00a0told CBS News in 2006 that his new line of women's clothes was in response to the feminist movement. Women needed their own version of the traditional men's suit jacket, Armani thought.",
      "Celebrities and Armani",
      "Using celebrities to elevate the Armani brand was another to key to the designer's business success. He began by outfitting Richard Gere in the 1980 neo-noir crime drama \"American Gigolo.\" Armani went on to design clothes for more than 150 films throughout his career.",
      "\"His idea to reach out to celebrities was very, very important,\" said Dincuff, noting that this approach to marketing fashion was novel at the time.",
      "Armani pivoted to dressing celebrities on the red carpet in the 1990s, where his\u00a0black-tie outfits and glittering evening gowns often stole the show. Some early looks that captured popular attention included the oversized Armani suit worn by Julia Roberts at the 1990s Golden Globes and a champagne-colored Armani suit that Jodie Foster wore at the 1992 Academy Awards.",
      "The list of celebrities that have\u00a0worn Armani on the red carpet is long and includes Beyonc\u00e9, Selena Gomez, \u00a0Anne Hathaway, Michelle Pfeiffer, Margot Robbie and Winona Ryder.",
      "His own boss",
      "Central to Armani's success was the fact that he never relinquished control of the multibillion company he created, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. In rejecting a merger or sale to a larger industry rival, the Italian fashion designer was always his own boss.",
      "This allowed Armani to maintain creative control and consistency over his expanding business empire, distinguishing him from other designers.",
      "While he did strike several licensing deals over his career with companies like EssilorLuxottica\u00a0and\u00a0L'Or\u00e9al, he kept the majority of his business portfolio in-house. That included everything from Armani Priv\u00e9, his haute couture fashion collection and fragrance line, to Armani Exchange \u2014 a more affordable fashion line geared toward younger generations, said Grain Carter. Armani also kept the collections Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani under his purview.",
      "\"All of this was in-house and he controlled it from concept to production to distribution to marketing to how it is financed,\" Grain Carter said. \"He was active at every level, at every step.\"",
      "Today, the Armani empire has more than 9,000 employees along with seven industrial hubs and over 600 stores worldwide, according to figures released in 2023.",
      "As for potential succession plans, the Giorgio Armani company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"I cannot really contemplate the next person, because there will be no other Giorgio Armani,\" Grain Carter said.",

      "The company has agreed to pay authors about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement. A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year, and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "The landmark settlement could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement. A judge could approve the settlement as soon as Monday.",
      "\"As best as we can tell, it's the largest copyright recovery ever,\" said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \"It is the first of its kind in the AI era.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Anthropic Aparna Sridhar deputy general counsel said the settlement \"will resolve the plaintiffs' remaining legacy claims.\"",
      "Sridhar added that the settlement comes after the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in June ruled that Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train Claude did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "\"We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery and solve complex problems,\" Sridhar said.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced\u00a0Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Settlement terms",
      "If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.",
      "\"We were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,\" said William Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic's Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup's June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \"knew had been pirated.\" It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \"The Lost Night\" by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the Books3 dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",

      "The Department of Transportation is dropping a proposed rule that would have required airlines to offer cash to passengers whose flights were disrupted.",
      "The rule, which never went into effect, would have required carriers to provide compensation \"to mitigate passenger inconveniences\" for cancellations or delays that were within a carrier's control.",
      "Reuters was the first to report that the Transportation Department was shelving the proposal.",
      "The proposal was introduced under President Biden and then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. It would've required airlines to pay up to $300 for domestic delays of three to six hours and up to $775 for flight delays lasting at least nine hours.",
      "\"The ability of airlines to choose the services that they provide to mitigate passenger inconveniences resulting from flight disruptions under current U.S. law contrasts with consumer protection regimes in other jurisdiction,\" the proposed rule states.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Transportation told CBS News: \"We will faithfully implement all aviation consumer protection requirements mandated by Congress, including the requirement to refund ticket prices to passengers in the case of airline canceled or substantially delayed flights when consumers choose not to travel. Some of the rules proposed or adopted by the previous administration, however, went beyond what Congress has required by statute, and we intend to reconsider those extra-statutory requirements.\"",
      "\"This action does not change the Department's commitment or intent to carry out the consumer protection mandates from Congress in the recent FAA Reauthorization Act, including provisions relating to refunds. Instead, the action is part of USDOT's effort to ensure the traveling public is treated fairly while also acknowledging the realities of carriers' operations and the impact of overly burdensome regulations on the American people,\" the DOT spokesperson said.",
      "Although airlines guarantee rebooking, plus meals and lodging vouchers, for customers affected by flight delays and cancellations, none guarantee cash compensation for such inconveniences.",
      "Airlines were opposed to the proposed regulation when it was announced in December. At the time, Airlines for America, a trade group representing the nation's carriers, said it would \"drive up ticket prices, make air travel less accessible for price-sensitive travelers and negatively impact carrier operations.\"",
      "The group on Thursday cheered the Transportation Department's decision to drop the compensation proposal.",
      "\"We are encouraged by this Department of Transportation reviewing unnecessary and burdensome regulations that exceed its authority and don't solve issues important to our customers,\" Airlines for America said in a statement. \"We look forward to working with DOT on implementing President Trump's deregulatory agenda.\"",
      "The DOT is also reviewing what types of flight cancellations trigger refunds for consumers, and is considering repealing a Biden-era rule that requires airlines to disclose ancillary fees upfront to help consumers avoid unexpected charges.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-refunds-court-ruling-business-refunds/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:01:21 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. government could have to refund domestic businesses billions in tariffs, should the Supreme Court uphold a recent federal appeals court ruling.",
    "story": [
      "American businesses could be owed tens of billions of dollars in refunds for tariffs they paid on foreign goods.",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection has collected more than $200 billion in tariff revenue from American businesses of all sizes from October through August 24, according to agency data. Of that, more than $70 billion comes from payments of country-based tariffs that\u00a0a federal appeals court recently ruled\u00a0President Trump lacked the authority to impose.",
      "Industry-specific tariffs, such as steel and aluminum levies, are unaffected by Friday's ruling.",
      "The court on Friday ruled that President Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs of up to 145% on dozens of U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to review the federal appeals court's decision before it takes effect on Oct. 14.",
      "Mr. Trump's appeal means that, for now, there's no guarantee businesses will receive refunds. That spells more uncertainty for enterprises struggling to balance raising prices to cover the cost of levies against potentially turning away customers, according to supply chain experts.",
      "\"From the supply chain perspective, we are seeing a lot of uncertainty, which has been the case since April 2,\" Scott Pruneau, CEO of ITS Logistics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"No one knows how to price their goods, because you can't whipsaw your customers on pricing.\"",
      "If the court's decision stands, the U.S. government could have to return billions in tariff revenue it has collected from businesses.",
      "\"It'd be very challenging\"",
      "But even if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs, businesses could still face hurdles in collecting refunds for the levies they've already paid the U.S. government, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. For one, there is no guarantee that whatever kind of refund system the government sets up would be automatic or that the process will be simple.",
      "\"There's been speculation that if ultimately, the Supreme Court overturns the tariffs, then Customs could just issue refunds, but I don't know that it's going to happen that way,\" Felicia Pullam, former executive director of the Office of Trade Relations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the current senior director for geo-commerce at APCO, a global advisory firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The easiest way would be for Customs to put a process in place and issue refunds, rather than make companies go and apply,\" she added.",
      "Ultimately, however, if refunds are owed, it would be up to the Trump administration to decide how to administer them. \"It'd be very challenging, but I am confident CBP could handle it.\"",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "Requests for refunds",
      "Ted Murphy, co-leader of Sidley Austin's global arbitration, trade and advocacy practice, told CBS MoneyWatch that if the Supreme Court affirms the federal circuit court's ruling that Trump's reliance on IEEPA to impose country-based tariffs was illegal, the government would have to cease collecting tariffs from companies.",
      "When it comes to recouping levies that have already been paid, there are three ways refunds could be administered, Murphy said.",
      "Most simply, the government could provide automatic refunds to businesses for levy amounts paid. \"The government has that information, so it could happen automatically,\" Murphy told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I don't think that's particularly likely, but it is an option.\"",
      "The government could instead decide that only the plaintiffs who filed suit against the tariffs are entitled to refunds, and require additional parties seeking refunds to bring similar legal actions. \"In that case, you'd see tens and tens of thousands of people filing complaints at the Court of International Trade,\" he said.",
      "But the most likely repayment option in Murphy's view would be that the government agrees to refund duties paid by parties who submit requests for reimbursement.",
      "Historical precedent for refunds",
      "There's precedent for the government reimbursing businesses for tariff payments that were later deemed unlawful. In 1998, the Supreme Court struck down a harbor maintenance tax assessed on exports, which had been imposed by the Reagan administration. The government then owed companies more than a billion dollars in refunds, which it required companies to apply for in order to receive.",
      "Dan Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide, a trade consultancy, echoed Murphy, saying that it is hard to predict how the government might choose to process refunds, should the Supreme Court determine they are owed.",
      "\"It's up to the administration to decide, and that's where it gets very complicated and speculative,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Technically speaking, issuing refunds wouldn't be hard. \"Theoretically, the government could quite quickly figure out who paid what, and refund it to the payer,\" he said. \"But the government could also make it very difficult and force people to make requests.\"",
      "That would create work for companies, but also for the government, which would then have to review requests for refunds from thousands of companies. \"That's infinitely more work for the government, but it's pretty clear the government does not want to give money back, so if you make it a difficult process, then a number of importers are probably not going to pursue it,\" Anthony said.",
      "Large refunds to businesses could weigh on the Treasury's finances, TD Securities analysts noted in a report Thursday. \"Treasury would likely step up bill supply even further to obtain the extra funds, creating little disruption in longer-dated yields, but potentially pressuring funding spreads,\" TD Securities analysts said.",
      "The Trump administration could also turn to other emergency powers to replace the IEEPA tariffs in order to maintain the U.S.' effective tariff rate, the analysts noted.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Treasury immediately responded to a request for comment.",

      "Spirit Airlines is ending flight service in a dozen cities less than a week after the discount carrier announced it was filing for bankruptcy for a second time this year.",
      "The Florida company confirmed to CBS News on Thursday that it would exit the following markets on Oct. 2: Albuquerque, New Mexico; Birmingham, Alabama; Boise, Idaho; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Oakland, California; Columbia, South Carolina; Portland, Oregon; Sacramento, California; Salt Lake City, Utah; San Diego, California; and San Jose, California. The airline also said it is nixing plans to launch service in Macon, Georgia, which was slated for Oct. 16.",
      "Spirit serves dozens of cities in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean, according to its route map.",
      "\"We apologize to our Guests for any inconvenience this may cause and will reach out to those with affected reservations to notify them of their options, including a refund,\" a Spirit spokesperson told CBS News in an email statement.",
      "The news comes at a financially tumultuous time for the budget carrier. Spirit initially filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2024 after years of of struggling with rising operation costs and mounting debt. Just months after emerging from Chapter 11 reorganization, the airline filed for bankruptcy protection again in August.",
      "At the time, Spirit said it intended to conduct business as usual during the restructuring process, signaling passengers would still be able to book flights and use tickets.",
      "Spirit is seeking to cut costs by eliminating money-losing routes. In its quarterly earnings report in August, the company said it had \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to stay in business, citing factors including weak demand for domestic leisure travel and \"adverse market conditions.\"",
      "Rival airlines swoop in",
      "Rival airlines reacted quickly by announcing new lineups of domestic flights and international flights as they sought to gain some of the market share left in Spirit's absence.",
      "United Airlines, the world's largest airline carrier, said in an email statement that it would add flights to 15 cities starting Jan. 6 including trips to and from Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and Las Vegas.",
      "\"If Spirit suddenly goes out of business it will be incredibly disruptive, so we're adding these flights to give their customers other options if they want or need them,\" Patrick Quayle, United's senior vice president of global network planning and alliances, said in the company's statement.",
      "In response to United's statement, a spokesperson for Spirit said, \"While we appreciate the obsession certain airline executives have with us, we're focused on competing and running a great operation.\" Spirit plans to continue offering low fares to customers \"for many years to come,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Meanwhile, Frontier Airlines, a low-cost airline carrier based out of Denver, announced it was introducing 20 new routes from Detroit, Houston, Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, Charlotte and Dallas. The flights range in price from $29 to $89.",

      "At $299, the pass costs less than what customers typically pay for a domestic ticket on other U.S. airlines, Frontier said, citing data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. On Friday, the pass's cost will rise to $599.",
      "This year's pass offers the most amount of travel time that Frontier has offered through the program, Frontier Airlines chief commercial officer Bobby Schroeter said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "It's a step that could help Frontier catapult past its competitors, industry experts said. Frontier is expanding the pass as low-cost competitor Spirit struggles with its second bankruptcy in less than a year, while rival Southwest's new policies, like ending its\u00a0free checked bag policy, have alienated some customers.",
      "\"They see all other budget airlines really struggling, and there is market share for travelers who are in the market for budget airline flights,\" Scott Keyes, founder of flight deals site Going.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They smell opportunity, and Frontier has always been good at expanding.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/august-jobs-report-labor-market-bureau-labor-statistics/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 09:41:14 -0400",
    "summary": "After President Trump expressed \"shock\" over the pace of hiring in July, much is riding on the employment data for August.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump last month fired the head of the federal bureau that produces the government's monthly jobs report after the numbers pointed to a slump in U.S. hiring, he drew rebukes from critics who accused him of politicizing a technical \u2014 and nonpartisan \u2014 data collection process.",
      "On Friday, the Labor Department is set to release employment figures for August in what could emerge as another possible flashpoint.",
      "The new payroll report comes at a critical juncture for the economy. Recent data suggests the labor market is cooling, a particular concern as workers and businesses head into the crucial\u00a0holiday spending period. The Federal Reserve later this month is also expected to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since December 2024 as it swivels from fighting inflation to shoring up job growth.",
      "The August employment report will be the first since Mr. Trump ordered the dismissal of former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and questioned the Labor Department's competence in tracking the rate of job-creation across the U.S.",
      "In the aftermath, economists expressed concern that Mr. Trump's move could undermine confidence in the accuracy of U.S. economic data \u2014 a benchmark for the global economy. Any further actions by the Trump administration to question the accuracy of the monthly jobs data could sow further doubt about its validity, Gregory Daco, chief economist at strategy consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What happened last month",
      "Employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, the government reported last month \u2014 a figure that fell far short of economist forecasts and that led Mr. Trump to express \"shock\"\u00a0over what appeared to be a sudden downturn in hiring. Also troubling was that the Labor Department sharply revised down how many jobs the economy added in May and June, a sign the economy was weaker than previously thought.",
      "Such revisions are common, according to economists. The U.S. has roughly 160 million workers, making it impossible for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to tally each job every month. Instead, Labor Department staff draws on available data to estimate hiring and layoffs, while also revising their estimates for seasonal factors.",
      "Still, the Labor Department's July recalculation of the pace of job growth was noteworthy for its scale, representing the largest two-month downward revision since 1968.",
      "\"The previous report was obviously shocking in the sense of the downward revisions for the previous two months, and really caused a reckoning in the sense of needing to view hiring in a new light \u2014 and obviously not in a positive light,\" Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Indeed, the disappointing numbers were the clearest sign to date this year that the job market could be starting to sputter as the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs and general economic uncertainty weigh on employers.",
      "What to expect from the August job numbers \u2014 and beyond",
      "The August jobs data will provide a crucial measure of whether the labor market is holding up or running out of steam, as recent data suggests. The year started off strong, with an average monthly payroll gain of 123,000 from January to April \u2014 well above the number required to keep the nation's unemployment rate, now at 4.2%, from rising.",
      "However, the job market has stalled in recent months, with an average payroll gain from May to July of only 35,000. For the first time since April of 2021, the U.S. now has more unemployed people, at 7.24 million, than the 7.18 million jobs open around the country, according to labor data released on Wednesday.",
      "\"This is yet another data point underscoring how this job market is frozen, and it's difficult for anyone to get a job right now,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email. \"This is a turning point for the labor market. It's yet another crack.\"",
      "Economists polled by financial data firm FactSet projected that employers added 80,000 jobs in August, with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 4.2%. A figure around or exceeding that level would alleviate fears that the job market is cratering.",
      "Daco, who forecasts a much more moderate gain of 40,000 jobs in August, said in a research note this week that the employment report on Friday is \"likely to confirm that a marked slowdown in labor market conditions is underway.\"",
      "Another important marker to look for in the latest job figures will be whether the Labor Department revises the payroll gains for July, as it did for May and June.",
      "\"Since every month in 2025 has been revised lower so far, the risk is that July job growth will also be marked down,\" Shruti Mishra, a U.S. economist at Bank of America Global Research, said in a report. \"This could point to more sustained labor market weakness than we have been forecasting.\"",
      "Moving forward, Daco predicts payroll gains will average around 30,000 per month through the end of the year and for the nation's jobless rate to reach 4.7% by December.",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security said it was moving forward with ramped-up immigration enforcement in Chicago this week in an effort dubbed Operation Midway Blitz, as Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson says the city \"received no notice of any enhanced immigration action\" ahead of the announcement.",
      "\"This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American Streets,\" the department said in a statement Monday.",
      "Spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the operation \"will target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago.\"",
      "The department did not specify how long the operation is expected to last, but a spokesperson with ICE said, in a statement: \"ICE has always operated in Chicago, targeting enforcement around the dangerous criminal aliens that are drawn to this sanctuary city. ... We will continue our law enforcement and public safety mission, undeterred, as we surge ICE resources in the city in coordination with our federal partners from across Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice.\"",
      "The department said the mission would be carried out \"in honor of Katie Abraham,\" who was\u00a0killed in a drunk driving hit-and-run crash\u00a0that happened in Urbana, about 130 miles south of Chicago, earlier this year. Her friend, 20-year-old Chloe Polzin, also died in the crash. The driver was 29-year-old Julio Cucul Bol, a citizen of Guatemala who authorities caught in Texas days after the crash, and believed to have been trying to flee to Mexico. He is now in custody in Illinois.",
      "The victim's father, Joe Abraham, spoke with CBS News Chicago, saying he hopes no other family has to go through what his family has.",
      "\"Hopefully, no other children will have to go through this Russian roulette that the state is playing,\" he said. \"(Cucul Bol) didn't have a drivers license, he shouldn't have been on the roads, he had been pulled over before. ...\u00a0 Say what you want about Donald Trump. He at least acknowledged me, looked me in the eye, said, 'We're going to clean things up.'\"",
      "In a post on X, Gov. JB Pritzker accused the Trump administration of failing to communicate or coordinate their immigration enforcement effort with state and local leaders.",
      "\"Once again, this isn't about fighting crime. That requires support and coordination \u2014 yet we've experienced nothing like that over the past several weeks.  Instead of taking steps to work with us on public safety, the Trump administration's focused on scaring Illinoisians,\" he wrote.",
      "Johnson said he and other city officials \"remain opposed to any potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE's track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees.\"",
      "\"There are more than 500 documented incidents of human rights abuses at detention facilities since Trump took office, including deaths of detainees and alleged cases of sexual abuse of minors by federal immigration agents,\" Johnson added. \"Because of these incidents and more, we remain opposed to militarized immigration enforcement that runs afoul of the Constitution in our city.\"",
      "The mayor urged anyone concerned about the immigration crackdown in Chicago to visit a \"know your rights\" resource hub on the city's website, at Chicago.gov/KYR.",
      "The announcement of the immigration operation in Chicago comes after President Trump, in a post on Truth Social on Saturday, invoked imagery from the movie \"Apocalypse Now\" and wrote, \"'I love the smell of deportations in the morning ...' Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.\"",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, accused the Trump administration of ramping up its campaign \"to arrest hardworking immigrants with no criminal convictions.\"",
      "\"These actions don't make us safer. They are a waste of money, stoke fear, and represent another failed attempt at a distraction,\" Durbin said in a statement.",
      "A new CBS News poll shows that 58% of Americans oppose the president sending the National Guard to other cities beyond Washington, D.C., while 42% support it. Those responses are heavily skewed by party, with a majority of Republicans in favor of the deployment of the National Guard and the majority of Democrats opposed.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A former top National Institutes of Health leader who says she was removed from her position after a dispute with Trump administration officials detailed the internal clashes at the elite medical research agency Monday, and warned of an agenda that poses \"a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety.\"",
      "Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo described in an exclusive interview with CBS News being silenced when she and her colleagues tried to oppose efforts pushed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to cancel vaccine research and clinical trials.",
      "\"Ultimately, we were disregarded,\" said Marrazzo, who previously led the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID. \"We became inconvenient.\"",
      "Marrazzo, who filed a whistleblower complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel last week alleging illegal retaliation, was placed on leave and reassigned in April. She had been in the role since August 2023, succeeding Dr. Anthony Fauci, who had served as NIAID director for nearly four decades, as well as chief medical adviser to former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"It was not unexpected,\" Marrazzo said of her removal. \"It was still a body blow.\"",
      "New NIH chief echoed RFK Jr.'s views, former official alleges",
      "Marrazzo said in her complaint that she \"raised concerns\" to agency leadership when Department of Health and Human Services and NIH leaders \"pursued actions that not only directly undermined NIH's goal of furthering medical research, but also constituted a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety,\" while wasting funds by canceling research projects before findings could be implemented.",
      "Many allegations in the complaint focus on Dr. Matthew Memoli, who served as acting NIH director earlier this year before moving to the health agency's No. 2 post.",
      "Marrazzo claims Memoli made statements downplaying the importance of vaccines that closely mirrored the views of Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic. In a series of meetings, Memoli allegedly argued that \"vaccines are unnecessary if populations are healthy,\" and that the NIH \"should not focus on vaccines,\" Marrazzo alleged in her complaint.",
      "Asked by CBS News about interactions with people in positions similar to Memoli's and those above him, Marrazzo said, \"It was one of the hardest periods of my career,\" and she and her colleagues who were involved \"felt like we were sort of a voice in the wilderness.\"",
      "Marrazzo described a dispute about the importance of giving children the flu vaccine. She said she outlined her advocacy on two occasions for a universal flu vaccine that covered seasonal and avian flu, emphasizing the importance of continued investment in flu vaccine research.",
      "\"Both times that I presented this, Dr. Memoli made the point that, yes, it would be great. It would be nice to have a flu vaccine,\" Marrazzo said. \"But what was most important was to have children who were healthy and had a healthy immune system.\"",
      "Marrazzo said \"it was a little bit like hearing the echo of, again, what Secretary Kennedy had been promulgating in terms of healthy kids.\"",
      "\"It was extremely alarming,\" she added.",
      "An HHS spokesperson said in a statement that \"NIH Deputy Director Dr. Matt Memoli emphasizes that vaccines are not interchangeable; each must be assessed on its own merits.\"",
      "\"He remains fully aligned with this administration's vaccine priorities and consistently champions gold-standard, evidence-based science,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Over time, Marrazzo said things \"became increasingly uncomfortable\" because \"we were persistent.\"",
      "\"We didn't back down,\" she said.",
      "At the same time, Marrazzo said \"we started seeing people at meetings who were placed there from either the White House or from HHS.\" She said \"none of us really knew where these people came from.\"",
      "Marrazzo said one person confronted her about the agency she ran, which famously helped lead the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and \"indicated to me that [it] was a target.\" The official accused her team of doing unethical research.",
      "Asked whether she thinks she's being held responsible for actions taken by her predecessor, Fauci \u2014 who has faced years of criticism from Trump allies \u2014 and for research conducted by the agency before the pandemic, Marrazzo told CBS News, \"I think it's entirely possible.\"",
      "Marrazzo described discussing the administration's priorities in meetings to CBS News, noting that it was a \"very different\" dynamic than when she began the role midway through the Biden administration. She said she had been hopeful that \"intelligence would prevail\" in a second Trump administration, noting that the president had \"championed the work that led to the COVID vaccines,\" among other things, during his first term.",
      "Marrazzo objected to the leadership's \"censorship of scientific research and their subordination of scientific integrity to unscientific and unsupported policy preferences,\" her complaint says, noting that she specifically objected to the administration's \"hostility towards vaccines and its abrupt cancellation of grants and clinical trials for political reasons.\"",
      "Senior federal health officials removed Marrazzo from her position on March 31, the complaint alleges, in \"a blatant act of retaliation,\" noting that she was placed on involuntary administrative leave and told she would be transferred to the Indian Health Service, an agency within HHS. In the complaint, Marrazzo wrote that she would like to be reinstated to her position if the Office of Special Counsel finds that a prohibited personnel practice took place.",
      "Former NIH official calls RFK Jr. \"dangerous\"",
      "In recent weeks, Health Secretary Kennedy has faced scrutiny over the Trump administration's policies on vaccines and the recent ouster of top officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, another agency under the department's umbrella. The Trump administration is attempting to oust CDC Director Susan Monarez, after she was confirmed by the Senate in late July, although her lawyers have pushed back on the legality of her firing.",
      "Last week, Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee. Kennedy refuted the claim that he told Monarez she had to resign if she refused to sign off on changes to the childhood vaccine schedule, saying he told her to resign after he asked, \"'are you a trustworthy person?' and she said no.\" At the hearing, several Democrats said Kennedy should resign or be fired, while a handful of Republicans also expressed concern about Kennedy's moves at the department.",
      "Marrazzo told CBS News that Kennedy is not qualified for his job and described him as \"dangerous.\"",
      "\"He's dangerous because he ignores the evidence,\" she said. \"He appears to be driven by, a desire to satisfy a need to tear things down, and to discredit people who have dedicated their lives to evidence and to interpreting that evidence to further Americans' health.\"",
      "Marrazzo encouraged people to find a source they trust when it comes to questions about their health, whether that's their doctor or a nurse practitioner. Asked about Kennedy as a source, Marrazzo said, \"I think the consensus is that he's not trustworthy.\"",
      "Debra Katz, who represents Marrazzo and Dr. Kathleen Neuzil \u2014 the former director of the Fogarty International Center and NIH associate director for international research, who also filed a whistleblower complaint \u2014 said in a statement that the Trump administration \"installed politically motivated leaders,\" pointing to Kennedy, who \"immediately acted to stifle scientific inquiry, halt crucial research and retaliate against those, like Drs. Marrazzo and Neuzil, who refused to disavow the overwhelming body of evidence showing that vaccines are safe and effective.\"",
      "Ed O'Keefe is CBS News' senior White House and political correspondent reporting for all CBS News platforms. He's part of the team covering President Trump and covered all four years of Joe Biden's presidency. From the White House to the campaign trail, O'Keefe's reports stretch from the politics of the moment to how policy enacted in Washington affects the nation and the world."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for President Trump's administration to resume sweeping immigration enforcement stops in the Los Angeles area for now as part of the president's campaign to carry out mass deportations of people in the U.S. unlawfully.",
      "The high court agreed to freeze a district court's temporary restraining order that prevented federal immigration authorities from stopping people in Southern California without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. unlawfully. That order barred officials from relying solely on certain factors like a person's race or occupation as the basis for a detentive stop.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit largely rejected the Trump administration's request to pause the district court's order. The Justice Department then\u00a0sought emergency relief\u00a0from the Supreme Court.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the injunction issued by the district court hampered the ability of immigration authorities to enforce the nation's immigration laws in Los Angeles and put them at risk of violating its order during routine investigative stops.",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.",
      "\"That decision is yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket,\" Sotomayor, joined by Kagan and Jackson, wrote of the majority's move. \"We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job. Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.\"",
      "In response to the Supreme Court's order, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said \"we look forward to full vindication on this front in short order, but in the meantime, the Trump Administration will continue fulfilling its mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security praised the court's move, calling it a \"win for the safety of Californians and the rule of law.\"",
      "\"DHS law enforcement will not be slowed down and will continue to arrest and remove the murderers, rapists, gang members and other criminal illegal aliens that Karen Bass continues to give safe harbor,\" DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, referring to the mayor of Los Angeles.",
      "In a statement of her own, Bass said the ruling \"will lead to more working families being torn apart and fear of the very institutions meant to protect \u2014 not persecute \u2014 our people.\"",
      "\"I want the entire nation to hear me when I say this isn't just an attack on the people of Los Angeles, this is an attack on every person in every city in this country,\" the mayor said. \"Today's ruling is not only dangerous \u2014 it's un-American and threatens the fabric of personal freedom in the United States of America.\"",
      "The legal challenge",
      "The greater Los Angeles area, located within the Central District of California, is home to nearly 20 million people. The Trump administration estimates that 2 million of its residents are in the country illegally and has said that the region is a \"top enforcement priority.\"",
      "In June, federal immigration agencies began undertaking efforts to ramp up immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, which\u00a0Mr. Trump called\u00a0the \"largest mass deportation operation \u2026 in history.\" After protests broke out in response to enforcement operations at workplaces in the region, the Trump administration\u00a0deployed members of the California National Guard\u00a0and\u00a0active-duty Marines\u00a0to Los Angeles in June to protect federal property and immigration agents.",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court arose after three men who are in the U.S. illegally were arrested and filed a lawsuit seeking release from detention. The men, who live in Pasadena, were working as day laborers and were arrested in mid-June as part of a targeted enforcement action at a donut shop, according to court papers. They have since been released on bond.",
      "The migrants, later joined by two U.S. citizens and four organizations, challenged the Trump administration's immigration raids, alleging that officers violated their Fourth Amendment rights when conducting patrols and other enforcement operations. One of the plaintiffs, Brian Gavidia, was confronted by armed agents while working at a tow yard and repeatedly told officers he was a U.S. citizen as they tried to detain him.",
      "The plaintiffs claimed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were targeting certain businesses and conducting \"indiscriminate immigration operations.\"",
      "Last month, a federal district court agreed to issue a temporary restraining order that blocked federal agents from conducting immigration enforcement stops without reasonable suspicion that the person they are stopping is in the U.S. illegally. The order from U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong specified that agents could not rely solely on four factors as grounds for detaining people: apparent race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; being at a specific location like a bus stop, agricultural site or day laborer pick-up site; and the type of work a person does.",
      "In her decision, Frimpong, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, wrote there was a \"mountain of evidence\" that \"roving patrols\" were indiscriminately stopping and detaining people without reasonable suspicion in violation of the Fourth Amendment.",
      "But in the request for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer, the solicitor general, called Frimpong's injunction a \"straitjacket on law-enforcement efforts.\"",
      "\"The injunction wrongly brands countless lawful stops as unconstitutional, thereby hampering a basic law-enforcement tool, while turning every single stop in the District into a potential contempt trap,\" he wrote in a filing. \"No agent can confidently enforce the law and engage in routine stops when the district court may later refuse to credit that the stop reflected additional, permissible factors and instead treat virtually any stop as contemptuous misconduct.\"",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs said that the Trump administration's pattern of conducting immigration enforcement stops without reasonable suspicion has done \"immeasurable\" harm.",
      "\"Numerous U.S. citizens and others who are lawfully present in this country have been subjected to significant intrusions on their liberty. Many have been physically injured; at least two were taken to a holding facility. And all have had to endure the prospect of unavoidable future intrusions based on broad demographic factors like the color of their skin,\" they told the Supreme Court in a filing.",
      "The lawyers warned that, if allowed, the Trump administration's practices could ensnare millions of people in Southern California who are U.S. citizens or legally in the country in an \"immigration dragnet.\"",
      "\"The government's extraordinary claim that it can get very close to justifying a seizure of any Latino person in the Central District because of the asserted number of Latino people there who are not legally present is anathema to the Constitution,\" they said.",

      "Routh allegedly told an associate to \"'send me an rpg [rocket-propelled grenade] or stinger and I will see what we can do,'\" according to the court document.",
      "\"I need equipment so that Trump cannot get elected,\" Routh told his associate.",
      "The government said Routh also sought to purchase a .50 caliber rifle the same month, and this rifle would have been an even more destructive and powerful version of the one he had already allegedly obtained. Prosecutors said Routh hoped to purchase the .50 caliber rifle at a gun show, but his contact was ultimately not able to locate the type of gun Routh wanted until after the assassination attempt at the golf course.",
      "Routh was armed with an AK-47-style rifle and was allegedly 300-500 yards away from Mr. Trump when the Secret Service agent spotted his rifle in the tree line, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw.",
      "Two people have been charged with selling the gun to Routh, though both defendants told law enforcement they did not have any advance knowledge of Routh's alleged plans.",
      "Two defendants \u2014 Tina Brown Cooper and Ronnie Jay Oxendine \u2014 have pleaded guilty to gun-related charges in federal court, after being indicted in March and arrested in April. Cooper pleaded guilty to firearm trafficking on Monday, and Oxendine pleaded guilty last month to possessing an unregistered firearm after police found a short-barreled shotgun in his storage building.",
      "In court papers filed in both cases as part of the plea agreements, the Justice Department said the two sold Routh a Chinese-made SKS rifle in August, with Cooper allegedly acting as a middleman in a sale between Routh and Oxendine. Law enforcement said Cooper worked for Oxendine at the time of the sale at a roofing company in Greensboro, North Carolina.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged Cooper, Routh and Oxendine met at the roofing company's headquarters, where Routh paid Oxendine $350 cash for the SKS rifle and $100 to Cooper for helping to arrange the sale.",
      "About six weeks later, Routh was allegedly found with an SKS-style rifle outside Mr. Trump's golf club in West Palm Beach. In a filing in Routh's criminal case, prosecutors said the gun he brought to Trump International Golf Club was the same one allegedly sold to him by Oxendine and Cooper.",
      "Records show Routh's issues with the law go back to the 1990s and include lesser charges of writing bad checks. But in 2002 he was charged with possession of a weapon of mass destruction, a felony, according to North Carolina Department of Corrections records. In another incident, he was charged with misdemeanors, including a hit-and-run offense, resisting arrest, and a concealed weapons violation, the records show.",
      "But his son, Oren Routh, told CBS News his father wasn't violent, and he said he was \"definitely surprised\" by the latest allegations.",
      "\"He's a good person and has been a hard worker his whole life. He's a great man and good dad, non-violent, and was never abusive. I was definitely surprised this happened. He taught us to work hard and be good people. I haven't known him to own guns or ever hurt anyone in any way, always tried to help his community in any and every way possible,\" Oren Routh said.",
      "Routh voted Democratic in the 2024 primary election in North Carolina, and he voted in person, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections. He appears to be registered as an unaffiliated voter.",
      "His account on X, formerly known as Twitter, has now been suspended, and it included a number of posts about Mr. Trump.",
      "Since being granted the ability to defend himself in court, Routh's filings have been filled with rants about Mr. Trump and international affairs. In a motion to attempt to dismiss evidence that the Justice Department says it will present during his trial, Routh said he would trade the evidence being submitted into the record in exchange for a subpoena of Mr. Trump, calling him a \"dumbass\" and even suggesting \"a round of golf with the racist pig,\" and if Trump wins, Trump \"can execute me.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Monday rejected a lawsuit filed by a group of states that challenged the mass firings of thousands of federal probationary workers.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit divided 2-1 in finding that the 19 states and the District of Columbia did not have legal standing to sue over the large-scale terminations. The appeals court sent the case back to the federal district court with directions to dismiss it.",
      "\"We acknowledge that the abrupt and indiscriminate dismissal of the probationary employees here exacted all-too-human costs upon those affected,\" Judge Harvie Wilkinson wrote for the two-judge majority. \"But this real impact on the employees, who are not parties here, cannot govern our review.\"",
      "Wilkinson wrote that while federal probationary workers \"suffered the brunt of the harm\" as a result of their firings, \"they are nowhere to be found in this case.\"",
      "Joining Wilkinson in the majority was Judge Allison Jones Rushing. Judge DeAndrea Gist Benjamin dissented.",
      "Probationary workers are those who generally have been in their jobs with the federal government for one or two years, depending on the nature of their jobs. Shortly after President Trump returned to the White House for a second term, his administration moved to lay off thousands of probationary workers as part of its goal of shrinking the size of the federal government.",
      "The terminations occurred in mid-February, when thousands of probationary workers began receiving notices from their agencies that they were laid off. Court filings indicate that at least 24,000 of these federal employees had been fired by early March.",
      "The 19 states and the District of Columbia swiftly filed a lawsuit against a slew of agencies challenging the mass firings, arguing that the terminations were unlawful because the Trump administration did not comply with a legal requirement to provide states with 60 days notice before a large-scale layoff.",
      "The states that sued were Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.",
      "In April, a federal district court in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to reinstate all affected probationary workers living or working in the states that sued. The district court also prohibited the government from conducting any future reductions-in-force unless they were in compliance with federal law.",
      "The 4th Circuit granted a Trump administration request to freeze the district court's decision, clearing the way for agencies to lay off probationary workers again. It heard arguments in the case in May.",
      "In his opinion, Wilkinson said that the interests at issue in the case are federal, so the states have no concrete injury that can be remedied by the courts.",
      "\"The federal government is required in all kinds of ways to respect the basic sovereignty of the states. But the reverse is also true,\" he wrote. \"It is hard to imagine a more traditionally federal function than the management of the federal workforce. The federal workforce performs federal functions. How it performs them is a matter of federal concern.\"",
      "He warned that if the court were to accept the states' theory of how they have been harmed, every change in federal funding levels would authorize states to sue the federal government.",
      "\"A contrary result would upend our federalist system by ceding federal sovereignty to the states,\" Wilkinson wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts has allowed President Trump to remove a member of the Federal Trade Commission for now.",
      "The chief justice granted interim relief to the Trump administration Monday while the Supreme Court takes more time to consider its request to lift a lower court order requiring Rebecca Kelly Slaughter to be reinstated to her position at the commission.",
      "Slaughter is one of several appointees at independent agencies that the president has removed since he returned to the White House. The Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission\u00a0while legal challenges to the removals move forward.",
      "Mr. Trump appointed Slaughter to the FTC in 2018, and former President Joe Biden reappointed her to the role. Her term was set to expire in 2029.",
      "But in March, Slaughter received an email from the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, which contained a message from Mr. Trump informing her that she had been removed from the FTC. Slaughter sued the president and officials at the commission, arguing that her removal violated the Federal Trade Commission Act. That law limits the grounds that a president can remove a commissioner to inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "In July, a federal district court in Washington, D.C., ruled in Slaughter's favor and found that Mr. Trump's removal was \"unlawful\" and \"without legal effect.\" The Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which declined last week to freeze the district court's order while it considers the case.",
      "The Trump administration then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "The dispute over Slaughter's firing involves the same agency and removal protections that were at issue in a 1935 case known as Humphrey's Executor v. United States. In that landmark decision, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the restrictions and ruled that Congress could enact for-cause removal protections for multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "But the high court has chipped away at that precedent in recent years and reasserted the president's power to remove executive officers without cause. In a recent cases involving Mr. Trump's removals of members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Supreme Court indicated it believes the entities exercise considerable executive power.",
      "In its request for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, lawyers for the Trump administration argued that the modern FTC exercises \"vast executive authority,\" a change from the 1935-era commission.",

    "summary": "Justice Amy Coney Barrett spoke with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell for her first TV interview since joining the Supreme Court in 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Justice Amy Coney Barrett spoke with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell for her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court in October 2020, responding to criticism that the Supreme Court is allowing President Trump to expand the bounds of executive power and discussing the attacks waged on the federal judiciary.",
      "Selected by President Trump to succeed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died just weeks before the 2020 presidential election, Barrett's appointment to the high court widened its conservative majority to 6-3. At 53, she is likely to serve for decades.",
      "So far in her tenure on the Supreme Court, Barrett has been in the majority in landmark decisions overturning Roe v. Wade, ending affirmative action in higher education, and curbing federal regulatory power. She also joined with her conservative colleagues in ruling last year that former presidents have immunity from federal prosecution for official actions taken while in office.",
      "But this year, she earned the ire of some conservatives after declining to grant the Trump administration emergency relief during an early stage of a challenge to its freezing of foreign aid funding. Barrett and Chief Justice John Roberts also joined with the three liberal justices in rejecting Mr. Trump's bid to delay his sentencing earlier this year for a felony criminal conviction in New York.",
      "Barrett has written a new book, \"Listening to the Law: Reflections on the Court and Constitution\" (which will be available to the public Sept. 9). She spoke with O'Donnell about an array of topics related to the Supreme Court, including how it handles emergency appeals, its June 2022 ruling unwinding the constitutional right to abortion, and the threats she has faced since becoming a justice.",
      "Here are five takeaways from Barrett's interview:",
      "Barrett details the decision overturning Roe v. Wade",
      "Shortly after Barrett joined the Supreme Court in October 2020, the high court agreed to take up a case that asked it to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to an abortion.",
      "In June 2022, a five-justice majority on the Supreme Court voted to dismantle the federal abortion protections, saying it would be up to states to decide the issue of abortion access. Barrett was among the five justices who voted to overturn Roe.",
      "Explaining the decision, Barrett said that the Supreme Court did not outlaw abortion through its ruling in the case, known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.",
      "\"Dobbs did not render abortion illegal. Dobbs did not say anything about whether abortion is immoral,\" she told O'Donnell. \"Dobbs said that these are questions that are left to the states. All of these kinds of questions, decisions that you mention that require medical judgments, are not ones that the Constitution commits to the court, you know, to decide how far into pregnancy the right of abortion might extend.\"",
      "Barrett said that before the Supreme Court overturned Roe, it had drawn lines.",
      "\"What Dobbs says is that those calls are properly left to the democratic process, and the states have been working those out,\" she said. \"There's been a lot of legislative activity and a lot of state constitutional activity since the decision in Dobbs was rendered.\"",
      "Since Roe was reversed, 14 states have enacted near-total bans on abortion, and a handful more have restricted access to the procedure. But 18 states protect abortion access.",
      "\"The question is how do you decide because I don't think that \u2014 well, certainly my children would say they don't want me deciding under the law of Amy what liberties, what rights we have and not. I mean, that's a job for the American people, and the Constitution leaves virtually every question like that to the democratic process, to the American people,\" she said.",
      "Barrett says emergency orders present \"challenge\" for the court",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to office for a second term, the Supreme Court has been asked by the Justice Department to intervene in the early stages of cases nearly two dozen times. These cases land on the court's emergency docket, or \"shadow docket,\" a term coined by a University of Chicago law professor in 2015.",
      "While emergency relief was typically sought in death penalty cases, the Supreme Court has in recent years been asked to issue interim orders that, if granted, remain in place while litigation moves through the lower courts.",
      "As federal judges have issued injunctions blocking many of Mr. Trump's policies this year, the Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to step in and freeze those orders, allowing it to continue enforcing a challenged policy as the cases proceed. The high court has allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of independent agencies, terminate grants from the Department of Education and National Institutes of Health, and move forward with agency plans to terminate thousands of federal workers, among other decisions.",
      "The Trump administration has prevailed in most of those emergency appeals. The Supreme Court's handling of those requests has sparked complaints from its critics, as it often does not provide a written explanation for its decision.",
      "\"The emergency orders present a challenge because they do require the work of the court to proceed far more quickly than it normally does,\" Barrett told O'Donnell.",
      "The justice said the Supreme Court \"typically moves slowly.\" When it agrees to hear a case and decide the merits, each side submits briefs presenting their legal arguments, the justices hear oral arguments and then typically spend weeks, if not months, working on opinions.",
      "\"I describe in the book the way that oral argument has grown and developed over 200 years, it's taken us to kind of settle into the way that we do arguments and opinions,\" Barrett said. \"The emergency docket moves much more quickly, and it is a much more recent phenomenon.\"",
      "She added: \"The emergency docket is newer, and so I would say those processes are still being shaped and sorted out.\"",
      "Barrett says it's \"wrong\" to suggest the Supreme Court has an agenda",
      "Mr. Trump shaped the current composition of the Supreme Court, appointing three of its nine justices \u2014 Barrett and Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 during his first term.",
      "Critics of the Supreme Court have said the conservative majority has allowed Mr. Trump to expand the bounds of his power by granting the emergency relief he has sought. But Barrett rejected that contention.",
      "\"Justices and courts, district courts, are not trying to enable Congress or the executive to do anything. We're deciding cases,\" she told O'Donnell.",
      "Barrett said cases that come to the Supreme Court on its emergency docket are \"far more tentative,\" and there are more factors that the justices have to consider when asked to grant a stay, including whether the applicant will be irreparably harmed without relief.",
      "\"I think people will disagree with respect to any individual order, whether the court made the right judgment about the merits or not,\" she said. \"I think in so far as the question might suggest that the court has an agenda or some motive, that's just wrong.\"",
      "Barrett said it's not the Supreme Court's job to \"survey\" and form a political view, explaining \"our job is to decide these legal questions.\"",
      "Barrett details the threats she has received since joining the Supreme Court",
      "In May 2022, a draft of the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade was published by the news outlet Politico, an unprecedented leak that Chief Justice John Roberts denounced as a \"betrayal.\" The person who leaked the draft opinion has not been identified.",
      "In response, demonstrators appeared outside the homes of several of the conservative justices, including Barrett's, to protest Roe's impending reversal. The protests went on for months, and then-Attorney General Merrick Garland directed the U.S. Marshals Service to provide additional support to ensure the safety of the justices.",
      "Shortly after the leak, a California man allegedly armed with a gun, knife and various tools was arrested outside of Kavanaugh's Maryland house. He was charged with attempting to kill a Supreme Court justice and pleaded guilty in April of this year.",
      "Since then, judges across the country have continued to face threats to their safety and harassment. In July, three sitting federal judges spoke out about how they have been targeted after ruling against the Trump administration, including through \"swattings\" and \"pizza doxxings.\"",
      "Barrett's sister was the target of a bomb threat at her home in South Carolina, CNN reported in March. The justice herself is the \"not-so-proud owner\" of a bulletproof vest, she said, recalling one of her sons asking if he could try it on.",
      "\"Thinking, 'This is a parenting moment that I wasn't quite prepared for,' I said, 'Sure. Go ahead.' And he puts it on. And then he looked up at me and he said, 'Wait. Why do you have a bullet-proof vest?'\" Barrett recalled. \"So, you know, we've tried to explain those things to the kids.\"",
      "When demonstrators were protesting outside her home, Barrett said her family developed a safety routine for when her children would arrive to find them there. The justice recalled her son getting dropped off, and realizing she had forgotten to tell him there would be protesters outside.",
      "The justice confirmed to O'Donnell that she has received death threats, and condemned threats of violence.",
      "\"I think that it should not be the price of public service for any official, judges included, to face violence or threats of violence,\" she said.",
      "Barrett said she tries to tune out the criticism lodged against her, which has come from both sides of the aisle, and said judges have been the subject of attacks before.",
      "\"I think that's part of the risk of the job,\" she said. \"You know, many judges and justices before me have faced criticism and threats. And I am sure that will be true in the future. That's why it requires a stiff spine.\"",
      "Still, Barrett said she believes there has been a shift in the justices' experience on the Supreme Court that began after Justice Antonin Scalia died in 2016. Barrett said she is seldom alone now and rarely drives herself.",
      "Barrett said that she doesn't like \"not being anonymous,\" and acknowledged that working as a public servant comes at a cost, like losing your privacy.",
      "\"One of the things I miss is just being able to go to the grocery store and not worrying that someone's gonna recognize me. I don't like that part of it,\" she said. \"So I find the being a public figure and being with security, I've found that hard to get used to, even five years in.\"",
      "Barrett says being a justice requires a \"stomach for criticism\"",
      "Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court by Mr. Trump was praised by conservatives, but she has since received criticism from some of the president's allies for recent votes in cases involving him and his administration.",
      "Laura Loomer, a far-right activist who has compiled information for Mr. Trump about White House personnel, called Barrett a \"DEI appointee,\" referencing diversity, equity and inclusion, and Fox News host Mark Levin claimed the justice \"deceived people into thinking she was a reliable constitutionalist.\"",
      "\"I've been criticized by the left, I've been criticized by the right, I'm sure I've been criticized by the middle,\" Barrett said of the attacks on her. \"If you can't have a stomach for people not liking you, and if you don't have a stomach for criticism, then you're not suited to the role.\"",
      "Still, she acknowledged the difficulties of being \"unpopular.\"",
      "\"That's why being a judge \u2014 you know, people think it's glamorous but it's actually public service and hard work. I love it because I love the ability to serve my country, I think that's a privilege. I enjoy the work. I like my colleagues, my law clerks are wonderful,\" Barrett said. \"But there is this other side, you know, this personal cost, this willingness to be unpopular.\"",

      "The president said the new guidance will support students like Hannah Allen, who was in the audience Monday. According to the First Liberty Institute, which represent Allen, Allen was praying for an injured peer in Honey Grove Middle School's cafeteria in Honey Grove, Texas in 2018. The school required the students to instead pray behind a curtain, move to an empty gym or go outside, the group said. Under pressure from religious liberty groups, the Honey Grove Texas Independent School District eventually reversed the decision.",

      "Those cuts have fueled concern in Africa and elsewhere about the ability of individual nations and global agencies to respond to and quickly contain outbreaks of diseases including Ebola \u2014 and to keep such deadly viruses from reaching U.S. shores.",
      "\"The recent cuts will definitely have an impact,\" Otim said at the briefing. \"As a global community, we need to work together to stop this virus, as diseases do not respect borders.\"",
      "\"What we know (from past outbreaks) is you need to get supplies and resources as soon as possible to stop transmission,\" Otim added.",
      "President Trump announced in January that the U.S. \u2014 long a key stakeholder and largest donor to the agency \u2014 would be pulling out of the WHO, with the White House citing \"the organization's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, and other global health crises, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\"",
      "The Trump administration, at the time, also accused the WHO of demanding \"unfairly onerous payments from the United States, far out of proportion with other countries' assessed payments.\"",
      "The WHO warned almost immediately that, given the uncertainty over future U.S. funding, it was cutting back spending in ways that could impact its operations.",
      "Congo's health care system was already overburdened as it battles to contain an mpox outbreak, with roughly 130,000 suspected cases since last year and about 2,000 deaths now recorded, the WHO said at the briefing last week.",
      "Complicating the response is the fact that the nearest medical isolation unit to the outbreak only has 15 beds, and road access from Kinshasa can take up to three days, further delaying the arrival of medical teams and supplies.",
      "The WHO has already delivered about 13 tons of emergency medical supplies to Congo to help contain and treat the outbreak.",

      "A jury's conclusion that President Trump should pay writer E. Jean Carroll more than $83 million in damages for defamation was \"fair and reasonable,\" a federal appeals court panel ruled Monday.",
      "\"We hold that the district court did not err in any of the challenged rulings and that the jury's duly rendered damages awards were reasonable in light of the extraordinary and egregious facts of this case,\" three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit wrote in a unanimous opinion.",
      "The decision is the latest defeat for Mr. Trump in a case that dates back to 2019, when Carroll first went public with allegations that he sexually assaulted her in a department store decades earlier.",
      "Roberta Kaplan, an attorney for Carroll, lauded the decision, saying the appeals panel concluded that \"Carroll was telling the truth, and that President Donald Trump was not.\" Kaplan noted that the court found Mr. Trump was \"recklessly indifferent\" to Carroll's \"health and safety\" when making defamatory statements about her.",
      "\"We look forward to an end to the appellate process so that justice will finally be done,\" Kaplan said.",
      "Lawyers for the president argued that he was shielded in the case by presidential immunity, that the trial court made a series of improper decisions and that the damages awarded to Carroll were excessive. The appeals court rejected their arguments in each instance.",
      "A spokesman for Mr. Trump's legal team decried \"the political weaponization of our justice system,\" calling the case a \"Democrat-funded travesty.\"",
      "\"President Trump will keep winning against Liberal Lawfare, as he is focusing on his mission to Make America Great Again,\" the spokesman said.",
      "Carroll has twice prevailed over Mr. Trump at trial. In 2023, a federal jury in New York awarded her $5 million while finding Mr. Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation. The same appeals court in June upheld that judgment. That case involved allegations that Mr. Trump forcefully inserted his fingers into Ms. Carroll, which the jury concluded was substantiated by a preponderance of evidence.",
      "In 2024, a separate jury heard evidence related to additional defamatory remarks made by Mr. Trump about Carroll. The appeals court noted in its decision Monday that \"he made several disruptive comments and gestures in front of the judge and jury.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's defamatory statements included him both denying Carroll's allegations and insisting she had made them up.",
      "During the 2024 trial, the jury heard evidence and analysis pointing to significant reputational and personal damage suffered by Carroll in the wake of Mr. Trump's denials.",

    "published": "Mon, 08 Sep 2025 11:07:04 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to allow it to freeze billions of dollars in foreign aid funding.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to allow it to freeze billions of dollars in foreign aid funding, seeking its intervention in a clash over the president's refusal to spend money allocated by Congress for foreign assistance programs.",
      "The Trump administration is asking the high court to partially halt a lower court order that required it to spend more than $4 billion in aid by the end of September. Mr. Trump is attempting to claw back that money, which has already been approved by Congress, through a rarely used maneuver known as a pocket rescission.",
      "The dispute also involves another $6.5 billion in foreign assistance, though the Justice Department has said it is taking steps to obligate those funds by Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.",
      "The legal fight quickly arrived at the Supreme Court after U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled last week that the executive branch had to spend the $4 billion in foreign aid funding that Congress had appropriated. The Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to freeze that decision, though it declined to do so last Friday.",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the district court's injunction \"raises a grave and urgent threat to the separation of powers.\" He is asking the Supreme Court to pause the district court's order only as to the $4 billion that Mr. Trump is attempting to rescind.",
      "\"The President can hardly speak with one voice in foreign affairs or in dealings with Congress when the district court is forcing the Executive Branch to advocate against its own objectives,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Since returning to the White House, the Trump administration has canceled billions of dollars in contracts and grants that it says do not align with the president's policy objectives. On the first day of his second term, the president signed an executive order that called for a 90-day pause in foreign aid and said administration officials would determine whether to continue or cease each foreign assistance program.",
      "Congressional Democrats estimate that more than $425 billion in federal funding has been canceled or frozen by the president.",
      "The latest dispute before the Supreme Court was brought by a group of nonprofits and businesses that receive money for foreign assistance projects. The plaintiffs argued that the 90-day freeze was an unconstitutional exercise of the president's authority.",
      "The case has already landed at the Supreme Court, though in an earlier stage in the proceedings. In early March, the high court split 5-4 in rejecting a bid from the president to keep $2 billion in foreign aid frozen while the case moved forward.",
      "The case has progressed since then. Last month, a three-judge panel on the D.C. Circuit said that the nonprofits and businesses could not sue. The 2-1 panel wiped away an order from Ali that had prohibited the government from impounding congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds.",
      "But the D.C. Circuit panel issued an amended opinion late last month that opened up an avenue for the nonprofits and businesses to seek relief on different legal grounds.",
      "On the heels of that decision, Mr. Trump sent a letter to Congress proposing to rescind a total of $4.9 billion, which includes funding for the State Department, international development programs and the the U.S. Agency for International Development, which the president has moved to shutter.",
      "The president's plan is an attempt to roll back funding unilaterally and has not been done in nearly 50 years. One Republican has called the effort \"unlawful\" and said the Constitution makes clear that Congress has the power of the purse.",
      "The plaintiffs in the case sought a new preliminary injunction. Last week, Ali found that the government has a statutory duty to spend the $4 billion that is subject to Mr. Trump's rescission proposal. He ordered the Trump administration to spend the expiring funds approved by Congress for foreign assistance, unless Congress claws it back in accordance with the procedures laid out in federal law.",
      "In seeking relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer, the solicitor general, said Ali's injunction \"puts the executive branch at war with itself\" by requiring it to spend the same $4 billion that the president wants to claw back.",

    "story": [
      "Patients begin lining up before dawn at Operation Border Health, an annual five-day health clinic in Texas' Rio Grande Valley. Many residents in this predominantly Latino and Hispanic region spanning the Mexican border lack insurance, making the health fair a major source of free medical care in South Texas for more than 25 years.",
      "Until this year. The Trump administration's plan to strip more than $550 million in federal public health and pandemic funds from Texas helped prompt cancellation of the event just before its scheduled July 21 start.",
      "\"Some people come every year and rely on it,\" said Hidalgo County Health and Human Services Director Dairen Sarmiento Rangel. \"Some people even camp out outside of Border Health so they can be the first in line to receive services. This event is very important to our community.\"",
      "States and local governments have made painful program cuts in the wake of major reductions in federal health funding that have already taken effect. Now, they're sizing up the financial hits to come \u2014 some not until late next year or beyond \u2014 from the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" the tax and spending law congressional Republicans passed in July that enacts much of President Trump's domestic agenda.",
      "Texas, for instance, expects to see its federal Medicaid funds reduced by as much as $39 billion\u00a0over 10 years due to new barriers for enrollment, such as more frequent eligibility checks, according to a July analysis by KFF.",
      "Taken together, the reductions amount to a seismic shift in how state health programs are provided and paid for. The administration is, in effect, pushing a significant amount of health costs to states. That will force their leaders to make difficult choices, as many state budgets are already strained by declining tax revenues, a slowdown in federal pandemic spending, and economic uncertainty.",
      "Revenue forecasters in more than a dozen states have lowered expectations for the coming year, according to a June report by Pew.",
      "\"It's almost inevitable that states will enact a number of cuts to health services because of the fiscal pressure,\" said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Some are proactively trying to stanch the impact.",
      "Hawaii lawmakers are looking to aid nonprofits that are already contending with federal funding cuts. They're doling out $50 million in grants to health, social service, and other nonprofits hit by federal funding cuts. To get the money, nonprofits must show a termination or drop in funding, or that they have otherwise been harmed by the cuts.",
      "\"It is not fair that organizations dedicated to supporting the people of Hawaii are being forced to scale back due to federal funding cuts,\" Democratic Gov. Josh Green said in a statement.",
      "Other states are scaling back projects to contend with cuts. Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer, a Democrat, received notice in March that the Trump administration was cutting $38 million in public health funding from the state. The next month, state legislative leaders halted a planned project to upgrade and expand the Capitol complex as a result.",
      "\"We recognized that the reckless federal cuts to the social safety nets of thousands of Delawareans called for us to hold back resources to protect our most vulnerable,\" said David Sokola, president pro tempore of the Delaware Senate.",
      "In New Mexico, the state with the highest percentage of residents enrolled in Medicaid, a bipartisan group of lawmakers voted to create a trust fund to boost funding for the program. About 10% of the more than 800,000 state residents covered by Medicaid and the related Children's Health Insurance Program could lose their health coverage under the federal spending law, based on some estimates.",
      "Some state leaders are warning constituents that the worst may be yet to come.",
      "At an Aug. 18 event at a hospital in the South Bronx section of New York City, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, stood on stage among health care workers in white coats to skewer Trump's new law.",
      "\"What Republicans in Washington have done through the 'Big Ugliest Bill' I've ever seen is literally screwing New Yorkers,\" she said. The state's health system is bracing for nearly $13 billion in annual cuts.",
      "And in California, lawmakers weighed the impact of the coming cuts from the federal law at a general assembly committee hearing on Aug. 20, where some Democratic legislators said state efforts to protect reproductive health services and other programs were in jeopardy.",
      "\"We've been bracing for this reality: President Trump's so-called 'Big, Beautiful Bill' is now law,\" Democratic lawmaker Gregg Hart said at the hearing, calling it a \"direct assault on California's core programs and our values.\"",
      "\"Sadly, the reality is, the state does not have the capacity to backfill all of these draconian federal funding cuts in the current budget,\" Hart said. \"We cannot simply write a check and make this go away.\"",
      "The sweeping budget law, which passed without any Democratic support, will reduce federal spending on Medicaid by about $1 trillion over the next decade, based on estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. The spending reductions largely come from the imposition of a work requirement on people who've obtained Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act's expansion, as well as other new barriers to coverage.",
      "The law will mean more than 7.5 million people will lose Medicaid coverage and become uninsured, according to the Congressional Budget Office, while extending tax cuts for wealthy people who, Democrats say, don't need them. Republicans and Trump have said the spending package and its accompanying program cuts were necessary to prevent fraud and waste, and to sustain Medicaid, a state-federal program for people with disabilities and lower incomes.",
      "\"The One Big Beautiful Bill removes illegal aliens, enforces work requirements, and protects Medicaid for the truly vulnerable,\" the White House said in a June 29 statement.",
      "The Medicaid cuts won't begin until after the midterm elections in November 2026, but other cuts have already hit.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to claw back $11 billion in federal public health funds earmarked to states because of the pandemic, spurring a legal fight\u00a0with a coalition of Democratic-led states. It also cut about $1 billion in federal grants for mental health services in schools, and halted grants from the National Institutes of Health that provided money to more than 90 public universities.",
      "HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard said the agency is prioritizing investments that advance Mr. Trump's mandate to confront chronic disease. She defended some of the cuts and said, erroneously, that the spending law doesn't cut Medicaid.",
      "\"The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a crisis that Americans moved on from years ago,\" she said.",
      "State leaders say the pandemic funding the administration wants returned was earmarked for other public health measures, such as tracking emerging diseases, outbreak responses, and staffing. State attorneys general in May won a temporary restraining order against the administration.",
      "\"What we're seeing now is states anticipating big cuts in Medicaid coming, but they're also dealing with a whole variety of federal cutbacks in public health programs that are smaller but still quite meaningful,\" said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Part of the challenge for states is simply understanding the changes.",
      "\"I think it's fair to say there is concern, confusion, and uncertainty,\" said Kathryn Costanza, a Medicaid expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "States are struggling to sort it all out, forming advisory groups that are tracking federal changes, suing to try to block the cuts, and reallocating funding.",
      "In Colorado, lawmakers passed a bill to let state Medicaid dollars pay for non-abortion care at Planned Parenthood of America clinics after Mr. Trump's law banned federal funding for such care. Whether the ban holds up in court remains to be seen.",
      "The Louisiana Legislature sent $7.5 million to state universities to make up for cuts to federal research funding, much of which goes to health-related research.",
      "And in South Dakota, the state's largest food bank has asked lawmakers to spend $3 million to make up for funding cuts to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "States must balance their budgets every year, so cuts put many services at risk if state lawmakers are unwilling to raise taxes. The work will begin in earnest in January, when many states begin new legislative sessions.",
      "And the tough choices are likely to continue. Congressional House Republicans are considering legislation that could bring more cuts, including by slashing the generous cost sharing the federal government provides for 20 million adults who enrolled in Medicaid under the ACA's Medicaid expansion.",
      "Some states will roll back their Medicaid expansions and cut more health programs as a result.",

      "In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Mr. Trump shared a screenshot that read \"Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR,\" alongside an AI-generated image that appeared to be inspired by the movie \"Apocalypse Now.\" On Friday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War, though a formal name change would have to go through Congress.

      "The post marked the latest in a series of threats Mr. Trump has made to send troops to Chicago as part of a nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration and crime, following his decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles in June. California Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged the legality of that deployment, and a judge ruled last week that it violated federal law, although the ruling appeared to only apply to California.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's rhetoric, Vice President JD Vance said in recent days that the administration has \"no immediate plans\" to send National Guard forces to Chicago.

      "Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from the central bank, as well as selecting a top economic aide as a replacement for another post on the board of governors, have sparked questions around independence at the Federal Reserve in recent weeks, raising concerns among Wall Street analysts that the White House is trying to wrest control of the historically independent central bank.",

    "summary": "In her first TV interview since joining the Supreme Court in 2020, Justice Amy Coney Barrett also discusses her vote in the 2022 Dobbs abortion case.",
    "story": [
      "Amy Coney Barrett had been teaching full-time for nearly two decades, at Notre Dame's campus in South Bend, Indiana, until she was selected by President Donald Trump, in 2020,  to serve on the Supreme Court. Now, she's traded the classroom for the courtroom, although she continues to teach a weeklong seminar on Constitutional Law.",
      "In her first television interview since she filled the seat left by the  late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Barrett was asked whether she believed  the Court has shifted to the right. \"I think shifting to the right, or  shifting to the left, I think those are other  people's labels, and that's other people's game,\" she said. \"I don't  think of it that way. You know, I just decide the cases as they come.  I've been criticized by both the right and the left.\"",
      "Justice Barrett's legal philosophy and personal story are the focus of her new book, \"Listening to the Law,\"\u00a0out on September 9. In it, she writes that, for her, the past five years  have not been easy since joining the Supreme Court: \"I'm happiest with  my old friends who knew me before I became Justice Barrett, and I am  wistful when we're back in South Bend.\"",
      "But she does not regret joining the High Court. \"No, I don't regret it,\"  she said. \"And I think it's really important work, and I'm proud to  serve. And we do have a good life in Washington, and we have friends in  Washington. But there is something nice about  our old life.\"",
      "Observers at the Supreme Court describe the 53-year-old mother of seven  as \"the most influential justice\" on the court today. Among the most  notable instances of that was her vote to overturn Roe v. Wade in the 2022 Dobbs decision, which overturned nearly 50 years of precedent surrounding the right to an abortion.",
      "For the minority's dissent, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan wrote:",
      "\"[T]he Court may face questions about the application of abortion  regulations to medical care most people view as quite different from  abortion. What about the morning-after pill? IUDs? In vitro  fertilization? And how about the use of dilation and evacuation  or medication for miscarriage management?\"",
      "Asked whether she sees those issues coming about now as a result of  Dobbs, Barrett replied, \"Those are issues inherent in medical practice.  And sure, they surround pregnancy care and the care of women. And those  are issues that are left now to the democratic  process. And the states are working those out. We have not had those  cases on our docket.\"",
      "But, Barrett added, \"Dobbs did not render abortion illegal. Dobbs did  not say anything about whether abortion is immoral. Dobbs said that  these are questions that are left to the states. And all of these kinds  of questions \u2013 decisions that you mention that  require medical judgments \u2013 are not ones that our Constitution connects  to the courts, you know, to decide how far into pregnancy the right of  abortion might extend. You know, the court was in the business of  drawing a lot of those lines before, and what Dobbs  says is that those calls are properly left to the democratic process.  And the states have been working those out. There's been a lot of  legislative activity and a lot of state constitutional activity since  the decision in Dobbs was rendered.\"",

      "Map shows state abortion restrictions 2 years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade",
      "For some, Dobbs raised concerns about the future of other rights. In  an  appearance on the Raging Moderates podcast\u00a0last month,  former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton predicted that the Court \"will  do to gay marriage what they did to abortion.\"",
      "Barrett said, \"Well, I think people who criticize the Court or who are  outside, say a lot of different things. But again, the point that I make  in the book is that we have to tune those things out.\"",
      "She also notes in her book that the rights to marry and engage in sexual  intimacy, to use birth control, and to raise children are, in her  words, \"fundamental.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Barrett said. \"Again, I'm describing what our doctrine is. And that is what we've said.\"",
      "Ruling on Trump's policies",
      "At issue now: cases on the \"emergency docket,\" challenging Mr. Trump's  executive orders. The nation's highest court has routinely allowed the  president's policies (including on immigration\u00a0and mass layoffs of federal workers) to temporarily  proceed.",
      "After term jammed with Trump's appeals, Supreme Court's emergency docket may stay hot",
      "After term jammed with Trump's appeals, Supreme Court's emergency docket may stay hot",
      "Barrett was asked to respond to Court observers who say that Mr. Trump  is pushing the boundaries of executive power, even overreaching, and  that the Supreme Court is not providing an adequate check on that.",
      "\"The Supreme Court, you know \u2013 and I can speak for myself and the way  that I make these decisions \u2013 it's not our job to survey and decide  whether, you know, the current occupant of an office in this particular  moment is, you know, to form a political view.  You know, that's the job of journalists, that's the job of other  politicians, or that's the job of the people. But our job is to decide  these legal questions.",
      "\"And so, in the cases that we've decided, what I can say, and what I try  to explain in the book, is that we're trying to get the law right,\" she  said.",
      "One White House policy that has faced pushback from federal courts is  the president's deployment of National Guard troops in U.S. cities,  such as Los Angeles and Chicago. On August 26, Mr. Trump said, \"Not  that I don't have \u2013 I would \u2013 the right to do anything I want to do. I'm  the president of the United States. If I think our country is in danger  \u2014 and it is in danger in these cities \u2014 I can  do it.\"",
      "Judge rules Trump's deployment of troops to Los Angeles violated federal law",
      "Judge rules Trump's deployment of troops to Los Angeles violated federal law",
      "Asked if she thought the president is right when he says he has  unlimited power to deploy the National Guard in any state, Barrett  replied, \"So, we don't have any cases pending before us that I'm aware  of. I would not be surprised if there are some cases pending  below. And so, I can't answer that question. But actually, this is a  good opportunity for me to say why\u00a0I can't answer that question, because it's something I cover  in the book. Any particular legal issue, I mean, I might be sitting  there with my kids and watching TV, and I might have an idea about it.  But if I'm going to decide something as a judge,  it really has to happen in the context of a particular case, because  judges have to approach things with an open mind on a specific set of  facts. We read briefs. I listen to oral argument. I talk to my law  clerks. I write out notes. I look at the cases. I  talk to my colleagues. And at any step of that process, I might change  my mind from my initial reaction. In fact, I often do.",
      "\"And so not only should I not, but I don't think you would want me to be  in a position where I would just shoot from the hip and say, 'Oh yeah. I  think that's constitutional,' or, 'Oh no. I think that's not.' That  really kind of the opposite of the judicial  rule,\" she said.",
      "\"But you are a scholar of the Constitution,\" O'Donnell said, \"so I do  also want to ask you, do you believe that the power to impose tariffs is  something the Constitution gives to the president, or is that left to  Congress?\"",
      "\"Ugh, and I have to give the same answer again, because that one  actually is pending in the courts, and we may well (dare I say likely  will) see that case,\" Barrett replied. \"And so, same thing goes. You  know, that's the kind of thing that's a wait-and-see.  I'm not trying to hide the ball. And I'm sure that not only you, but  probably others would be interested in, you know, what I think about  that question. I don't know what I think about that question yet, I can  honestly say. You know, stay tuned. If that case  comes before us, and after I dive in and read all the relevant  authorities, then I'll draw a conclusion.\"",

    "story": [
      "The National Guard was deployed to Washington, D.C., and reportedly may be sent to other cities. But wherever Americans live, it is speaking to larger issues \u2013 ranging from crime and their safety, to rights and freedoms and their views on the powers of a president.",
      "Those in favor of President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to cities are largely in his Republican base and say it reduces crime, feel it makes them personally safer \u2014 even if they don't live in cities \u2014 and that in principle they'd support deployment to other U.S. cities.",
      "The majority of Americans are opposed, though, and those who are, tend to feel their own rights and freedoms would be less secure as a result. They do not think it would be effective at reducing crime or make them any safer.",
      "To those in favor, it's not a case of red-versus-blue cities. They'd support the Guard being sent to either Democratic- or Republican-led places, or coming to their own local area as well.",
      "To those opposed, they believe the president is acting out of politics more than crime prevention.",
      "People who live in cities generally oppose the idea of sending troops to other cities and Americans in rural areas are mostly in favor of sending the Guard to other cities. Opinion is more tied to partisanship than geography, though.",
      "The people who think the presence of the National Guard does reduce crime, but still oppose the deployment to Washington or elsewhere, tend to see Trump acting for political reasons, not just crime prevention.",
      "The bulk of Americans, wherever they stand on this deployment, think in principle, both the president and a local leader like a mayor or governor should have the authority to deploy the National Guard. Fewer \u2014 including a lot of those opposed \u2014 think it should be only a local leader. Very few think it should be only Donald Trump.",
      "Approval ratings",
      "The policy on which one judges a president can of course affect the overall evaluation of him.",
      "Republicans, and Trump's supporters overall, say they're judging him on immigration and deportation policy more than on his economy and inflation policies; that topic, plus crime, together far outpaces inflation and the economy as their most important metric.",
      "Of late, the deployments may have the political effect of focusing on matters other than inflation, at least for the president's political base. And that in turn has helped his overall numbers a bit.",
      "His Republican approval now ticks back up over 90%, and his overall approval has stabilized, up two points now, after steadily declining over the weeks and months of his term.",
      "Meanwhile, those judging him on economic and inflation policies don't approve of him overall or on the matter of inflation, specifically.",
      "The relatively small group of people who disapprove of him on inflation, but approve on immigration, mostly approve of him overall.",
      "Tariffs",
      "Economic matters remain tougher for Mr. Trump, as they have been. Many continue to say Trump's policies have made them financially worse off.",
      "Four in 10 Americans report buying fewer things because of tariffs.",
      "Support for tariffs continues to drop incrementally, if steadily.",
      "And as with many other items, support for tariffs is centered in the Republican and MAGA political base, but not elsewhere.",
      "That extends to a call for some financial sacrifice, too. Seven in 10 Republicans say Americans should be willing to pay more for what they buy to support Trump's trade policies. This is true for Republicans across income levels.",
      "On balance, people overall are mixed about the potential impact on manufacturing jobs. Relatively more do think the tariffs will lead to manufacturing jobs more than will lead to losses, and Republicans are also the most likely to think this.",

      "Unlike matters related to immigration or the National Guard, there is a bit of difference within the GOP ranks. MAGA Republicans specifically would like the Fed more under Trump's guidance than non-MAGA Republicans. Nor would all Republicans have Trump replace Fed members who disagree with him.",
      "Trump's approach",
      "All of these matters also speak to questions of executive power and how it is applied.",
      "In all, as a general description, people tend to like Trump's goals relatively more than his approach.",

      "The Trump administration told Kilmar Abrego Garcia on Friday it is now seeking to deport him to the tiny African kingdom of Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, according to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement email obtained by CBS News.",
      "The email from a top ICE official noted that Abrego Garcia's attorneys have warned he fears being persecuted or tortured in Uganda, where federal authorities threatened to deport him last month after he was detained once again by immigration officials following his release from criminal custody.",
      "The ICE official said Abrego Garcia, through his attorneys, has also claimed fear of being harmed if deported to more than 20 countries, most of them in Latin America.",
      "In the email, the official called the alleged claims \"hard to take seriously,\" but added: \"Nonetheless, we hereby notify you that your new country of removal is Eswatini, Africa.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to representatives and an attorney for Abrego Garcia, asking for comment on the Trump administration's threat to send their client to Eswatini.",
      "Eswatini is at least the fourth possible destination that the Trump administration has floated for Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador who was mistakenly deported in March, held in a notorious Salvadoran prison and returned to the U.S. in June \u2014 only to face federal smuggling charges.",
      "Africa's sole remaining absolute monarchy, Eswatini is one of several nations that has agreed to the Trump administration's requests to accept deportees who are not their citizens from the U.S. Earlier this year, the U.S. sent a small group of deportees from Asia and Latin America who had been convicted of violent crimes to Eswatini. Attorneys say the men are being held incommunicado in a prison there.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from pre-trial jail last month, but ICE almost immediately detained him during a check-in appointment with the agency in Baltimore and began processing him for deportation to Uganda. His attorneys have fought that move, and alleged the government offered to deport him to Costa Rica instead if he agreed to a plea deal in his smuggling case.",
      "And on Thursday, federal authorities argued they could have a legal route to deport him to El Salvador a second time. A 2019 immigration court ruling barred the government from sending him to the Central American country, citing a risk of persecution by gangs. But in a filing obtained by CBS News, the government argued those legal protections would be voided if Abrego Garcia's request to reopen his immigration court case is granted.",
      "Despite that legal protection issued in 2019, Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March, which government lawyers acknowledged was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "A senior Trump administration official said, \"Kilmar Abrego Garcia's lawyers are playing with fire. If their attempts to reopen his immigration case are successful, his own lawyers will have opened the door for his return to El Salvador.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia remains in ICE custody in Virginia while his lawyers fight his criminal charges and deportation proceedings. His possible deportation to Uganda was paused by a federal judge in Maryland until at least next month.",
      "Trump administration fights Abrego Garcia's asylum case",
      "Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia is seeking asylum in the U.S., a legal status granted to people who have a well-founded fear of persecution in another country.",
      "In an immigration court filing Thursday, government lawyers asked a judge not to grant Abrego Garcia's request to reopen his immigration case so he can seek asylum or some other legal protection, like a green card based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen.",
      "The administration argued that Abrego Garcia is not eligible for asylum and other benefits, citing his alleged affiliation with the gang MS-13, his smuggling charges and a domestic violence complaint filed by his wife. The government alleges Abrego Garcia is a member of a foreign terrorist group, since MS-13 has been classified as such by the State Department.",
      "Abrego Garcia has strongly denied any affiliation with MS-13 and has pleaded not guilty to his smuggling charges, which his attorneys have called \"vindictive and selective.\" Abrego Garcia's wife filed a protective order alleging domestic violence in 2021, but she later said she decided not to follow through with the case. Abrego Garcia was not criminally charged in the matter.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg told CBS News that if his client \"is allowed a fair trial in immigration court, there's no way he's not going to prevail on his claim for asylum.\"",
      "\"Kilmar Abrego Garcia was tortured in El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison earlier this year,\" he said. \"The only reason he was denied asylum in 2019 was because he did not file within one year of entering the United States, a problem which the government has now solved.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in California ruled Friday that the Trump administration's attempt to end the Temporary Protected Status program for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan and Haitian migrants was unlawful.",
      "The move by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen effectively sets aside the administration's attempt to end temporary legal protections and work permits for certain people from Venezuela and Haiti \u2014 unless his ruling is overturned on appeal. Chen ruled in favor of the National TPS Alliance, an organization that represents TPS holders across the country, and a group of Venezuelan migrants who received protections under the program.",
      "\"This case arose from action taken post haste by the current DHS Secretary, Kristi Noem, to revoke the legal status of Venezuelan and Haitian TPS holders, sending them back to conditions that are so dangerous that even the State Department advises against travel to their home countries,\" Chen wrote in a 69-page decision. \"The Secretary's action in revoking TPS was not only unprecedented in the manner and speed in which it was taken but also violates the law.\"",
      "In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end the TPS program for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, freezing an earlier ruling by Chen.",
      "Chen said that decision concerned only preliminary relief he ordered that postponed the Department of Homeland Security's actions. The high court's order, he said, did not bar him from adjudicating the case on the merits or issuing relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "The Justice Department will likely appeal the decision.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling in a statement, and said Noem will \"use every legal option at the Department's disposal to end this chaos and prioritize the safety of Americans.\"",
      "\"For decades the TPS program has been abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program. Its use has been all the more dangerous given the millions of unvetted illegal aliens the Biden Administration let into this country,\" the statement read.",
      "Congress in 1990 established the Temporary Protected Status program, which allows the federal government to provide temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries experiencing wars, natural disasters, or other \"extraordinary and temporary\" conditions that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The program lets TPS holders temporarily remain in the U.S. and apply for renewable work permits.",
      "During the Biden administration, the Department of Homeland Security designated Venezuela, which is the largest country included in the TPS program, covering roughly 600,000 migrants. It also created or expanded programs for Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti and Ukraine. The Biden administration had extended the TPS designations for Venezuela and Haiti.",
      "After President Trump returned to the White House for his second term, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem first sought to reverse the TPS extension for Venezuela, and then moved to terminate the designation altogether. She also sought to unwind TPS protections for Haitians and migrants of several other countries.",
      "The National TPS Alliance and Venezuelan TPS holders filed their lawsuit challenging Noem's decisions in February and argued she did not have the authority to unilaterally roll back the extension granted by her predecessor.",
      "In his decision against the Trump administration, Chen said Noem's attempts to reverse the TPS extensions granted by the Biden administration were \"extraordinary and unusual,\" and marked the first time in the program's 35-year-history that such a step had been taken. He called the decision-making process surrounding the move \"truncated and condensed,\" and said Noem failed to consult the appropriate agencies.",

      "A new image shows the growing tail of a comet from another star system streaking across our solar system.",
      "The image of comet 3I/ATLAS was captured on Aug. 27 using one of the telescopes at the International Gemini Observatory in Chile during a public outreach event allowing students to work with astronomers.",
      "The comet is only the third-known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. It poses no threat to Earth, NASA previously said.",
      "Comet 3I/ATLAS has been photographed multiple times since its discovery in July. In early August, NASA and the European Space Agency released photos taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. It was about 277 million miles away from Earth when the telescope captured it.",
      "The new image from the Gemini Observatory shows the comet's broad coma, or a cloud of dust and gas that forms around its nucleus as it gets closer to the sun, astronomers said in a news release. The tail spans about 1/200th of a degree in the sky. One degree is about the width of a pinky finger, according to the news release. The tail also points away from the sun.",
      "The features are \"significantly more extended than they appeared in earlier images,\" according to astronomers. This means that the comet has become \"more active\" as it travels through the inner solar system.",
      "The main purpose of the observatory session, which allowed students and members of the public to remotely join astronomers in the control room, was to look at the wavelengths of light that emit from the comet. The wavelengths, also called a spectrum, can give scientists information about the comet's composition and chemistry, helping them understand how the comet changes while passing through the solar system, the news release said.",
      "NASA previously said the comet is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October and pass between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The comet is expected to remain visible through September, then get too close to the sun to observe until it reappears on the other side of the solar body in early December.",
      "Interstellar comets are very rare, astronomers said. Only two other examples have ever been confirmed:\u00a01I/'Oumuamu\u00a0in 2017 and\u00a02I/Borisov\u00a0in 2019.",
      "\"As 3I/ATLAS speeds back into the depths of interstellar space, this image is both a scientific milestone and a source of wonder,\" said Karen Meech, astronomer at the University of Hawai'i Institute for Astronomy and leader of the observation program, in a statement. \"It reminds us that our Solar System is just one part of a vast and dynamic galaxy \u2014 and that even the most fleeting visitors can leave a lasting impact.\"",

      "The company has agreed to pay authors about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement. A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year, and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "The landmark settlement could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement. A judge could approve the settlement as soon as Monday.",
      "\"As best as we can tell, it's the largest copyright recovery ever,\" said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \"It is the first of its kind in the AI era.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Anthropic Aparna Sridhar deputy general counsel said the settlement \"will resolve the plaintiffs' remaining legacy claims.\"",
      "Sridhar added that the settlement comes after the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in June ruled that Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train Claude did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "\"We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery and solve complex problems,\" Sridhar said.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced\u00a0Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Settlement terms",
      "If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.",
      "\"We were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,\" said William Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic's Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup's June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \"knew had been pirated.\" It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \"The Lost Night\" by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the Books3 dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",
      "The Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected \"damages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher\" if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \"an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors' works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\"",

      "Police say 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska, who fled the war in Ukraine only to be killed in an apparently random attack on Aug. 22, was allegedly stabbed by a man with a long record of criminal charges and psychiatric crises. The suspect, 34-year-old Decarlos Brown Jr., had served time in prison, been briefly committed for schizophrenia and was arrested earlier this year after repeatedly calling 911 from a hospital.",
      "Officials in Charlotte faced sharp criticism for failing to keep Brown, who has a history of mental illness, arrests and erratic behavior, off the streets before Zarutska was fatally stabbed on the commuter train \u2014 a killing that critics claim could have been prevented.",
      "Brown was arrested at the scene and charged with first-degree murder. Court records show he had cycled through the criminal justice system for more than a decade, with 14 prior cases in Mecklenburg County, including a five-year prison sentence for robbery with a dangerous weapon.",
      "The Aug. 22 attack, captured in recently released surveillance videos, has drawn condemnation of local officials and emerged as a talking point in the discussion about public safety, especially among conservatives who have supported the Trump administration's crackdown on crime in places such as Washington, D.C., where the president has deployed the National Guard.",
      "\"I have seen the horrific video of a beautiful, young Ukrainian refugee, who came to America to escape the vicious War in Ukraine, and was innocently riding the Metro in Charlotte, North Carolina, where she was brutally ambushed by a mentally deranged lunatic,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Monday, also slamming cashless bail and asking why the suspect had been allowed out of jail.",
      "Zarutska had come to the United States to escape Russia's invasion, relatives wrote in a GoFundMe post, describing her as determined to build a safer life.",
      "Videos released two weeks after the incident show Zarutska sitting on the light-rail train as Brown takes a seat directly behind her. Minutes later, without any apparent interaction, he pulls out a pocketknife, stands and slashes her in the neck, investigators said. Passengers screamed and scattered as she collapsed.",
      "Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles called Zarutska's killing \"a senseless and tragic loss.\"",
      "\"Like so many of you, I'm heartbroken \u2014 and I've been thinking hard about what safety really looks like in our city,\" she posted on X after authorities released footage of the attack.",
      "In a letter addressed to the community on Monday, Lyles said the incident was a \"tragic failure by the courts and magistrates.",
      "\"We need a bipartisan solution to address repeat offenders who do not face consequences for their actions and those who cannot get treatment for their mental illness and are allowed to be on the streets,\" the mayor's letter reads.",
      "Brown's mother told local television she sought an involuntary psychiatric commitment earlier this year after he became violent at home. Doctors diagnosed him with schizophrenia. It was unclear what kind of treatment he received, if any, following the diagnosis.",
      "Brown had also been arrested in January when officers were called to a Charlotte hospital for a welfare check.",
      "He told officers that he believed someone gave him man-made material that controlled when he ate, walked and talked, according to police records. Brown became upset after officers told him there was nothing further they could do. A judge released him at the time without bail.",

      "What President Trump, Sean Duffy and some state lawmakers are saying",

      "In his Truth Social post, the president blamed Democrats, singling out by name former Gov. Roy Cooper, who's now running for Senate, \"who refuse to put bad people in jail.\" Mr. Trump added that \"North Carolina, and every State, needs LAW AND ORDER, and only Republicans will deliver it!\"",
      "Several Republicans and Trump allies claim the attack shows that large cities and governors are failing to protect their residents and justifies the president's\u00a0federal takeover of Washington\u00a0and his plans to replicate that effort in other places.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed Charlotte officials, including the city's Democratic mayor, for allowing Brown to be on the streets.",
      "\"This monster had a track record longer than a CVS receipt, including prison time for robbery with a dangerous weapon, breaking and entering, and larceny,\" Duffy wrote Sunday on X. \"By failing to properly punish him, Charlotte failed Iryna Zarutska and North Carolinians.\"",
      "Duffy later\u00a0wrote on X\u00a0that he stands \"firm with President Trump's message of zero tolerance for criminality, especially on our federal DOT funded public transportation.\"",
      "\"If mayors can't keep their trains and buses safe, they don't deserve the  taxpayers' money,\" Duffy wrote, adding that the Department of Transportation will investigate Charlotte \"[a]nd we will also be looking at other crime ridden cities across the country.\"",

      "In her decision, Frimpong, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, wrote there was a \"mountain of evidence\" that \"roving patrols\" were indiscriminately stopping and detaining people without reasonable suspicion in violation of the Fourth Amendment.",
      "But in the request for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer, the solicitor general, called Frimpong's injunction a \"straitjacket on law-enforcement efforts.\"",
      "\"The injunction wrongly brands countless lawful stops as unconstitutional, thereby hampering a basic law-enforcement tool, while turning every single stop in the District into a potential contempt trap,\" he wrote in a filing. \"No agent can confidently enforce the law and engage in routine stops when the district court may later refuse to credit that the stop reflected additional, permissible factors and instead treat virtually any stop as contemptuous misconduct.\"",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs said that the Trump administration's pattern of conducting immigration enforcement stops without reasonable suspicion has done \"immeasurable\" harm.",
      "\"Numerous U.S. citizens and others who are lawfully present in this country have been subjected to significant intrusions on their liberty. Many have been physically injured; at least two were taken to a holding facility. And all have had to endure the prospect of unavoidable future intrusions based on broad demographic factors like the color of their skin,\" they told the Supreme Court in a filing.",
      "The lawyers warned that, if allowed, the Trump administration's practices could ensnare millions of people in Southern California who are U.S. citizens or legally in the country in an \"immigration dragnet.\"",
      "\"The government's extraordinary claim that it can get very close to justifying a seizure of any Latino person in the Central District because of the asserted number of Latino people there who are not legally present is anathema to the Constitution,\" they said.",

      "According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations, the average \"perceived probability\" of finding a new job after losing one fell 5.8% points to 44.9% among heads of households surveyed in August, the lowest measure on record since 2013 when the New York Fed began collecting data.",
      "At the same time, Americans are increasingly worried about losing their current job. Expectations that the U.S. unemployment rate will be higher a year from now crept up 1.7 percentage points to 39.1%, the New York Fed found.",
      "The data comes as Americans adopt a dimmer view of the economy. According to a\u00a0recent CBS News poll, a majority of respondents continue to say the economy is getting worse.",
      "The labor market has been under a microscope since July employment data showed weaker-than-expected job growth and sharp downward revisions for the months of June and May. August's data, released Friday, pointed to a slump in U.S. hiring, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs. Unemployment also ticked up to 4.3%, the highest rate since October 2022.",
      "\"Employers may be holding onto their current workers amid uncertainty, but they are not adding new positions,\" Allison Shrivastava, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In turn, employees have taken the hint, staying in their current jobs rather than seeking new opportunities.\"",
      "According to a recent Bankrate survey, about half of Americans are planning to search for a new job in the next year. At the same time, data shows that the number of people changing jobs has slowed significantly since 2022, when millions of people quit their jobs during the \"Great Resignation.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 08 Sep 2025 16:38:51 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to revise its jobs data downward for the year ended in March 2025. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "The latest jobs report\u00a0points to a labor market that's faltering, but the slowdown may have begun much earlier. Economists expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics tomorrow to issue a major downward revision, showing the nation added hundreds of thousands fewer jobs than first reported.",
      "On Sept. 9, the BLS will release its preliminary benchmark revision to labor market data, which aims to better account for businesses that have opened or closed. Economists say the revision, covering the 12-month period through March 2025, could show that hiring during that time was about 800,000 jobs lower than previously reported.",
      "The report could draw attention from the Trump administration, as the president last month questioned the validity of the monthly jobs report \u2014 and fired the commissioner\u00a0of the BLS \u2014 after the data included a significant downward revision. Hiring experts and economists point to a job market that's stalling out as some businesses are bearing increased tariff costs while others are tapping artificial intelligence as a way to lower labor costs and\u00a0replace workers.",
      "\"The labor market will likely look even worse after the release of the preliminary benchmark revision to payrolls on Sept. 9,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, noted in an email.",
      "The revision could show that employment was reduced by about 775,000 for the 12 months through March, Adams estimated. That would indicate that the average monthly job growth in 2024 actually stood at 100,000 per month, down from the 165,000 previously reported, he added.",
      "The revision would cover only the first three months of Mr. Trump's second administration, with the bulk of the timeframe occurring in the last year of former President Biden's administration.",
      "Job growth has slowed dramatically in recent months, with the employers adding an average of 29,000 jobs each month from June through August, the most recent BLS data shows.",
      "Why does the government revise its jobs data?",
      "Jobs revisions occur each month, with the BLS updating its data to reflect more recent information it has received from businesses about the pace of hiring. That's because some companies respond late to the BLS' surveys, which means the agency receives an influx of new information after it has issued its initial monthly jobs report, prompting the fresh numbers.",
      "But once a year, the BLS also issues an annual revision based on fresh data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which tracks employment and wages reported by employers that cover more than 95% of U.S. jobs.",
      "While the monthly jobs report relies on about 50,000 responses for each period, the QCEW covers 11 million workplaces \u2014 but that scope requires more time for collecting the data versus the BLS' monthly report, Adams of Comerica said.",
      "\"The QCEW's detail lets it directly measure jobs added at newly-opened workplaces and lost at closing ones, which account for several millions of employment churn each year,\" he added.",
      "What happened in the last annual revision?",
      "The BLS issued a\u00a0major downward\u00a0revision last year for the same annual data, showing that employers added 818,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months ended March 2024 than previously estimated. That lowered average monthly job growth for the period to 174,000, down from the initial estimate of 242,000.",
      "At the time, the downward revision was seen as evidence that the labor market was showing cracks, and it was viewed as paving the way for the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its September 2024 meeting.",
      "What does this mean for a Fed rate cut?",
      "The Fed will be focused on analyzing recent economic data, such as the latest jobs report and the next Consumer Price Index, which will be issued on Sept. 11. Economists expect the CPI to show an annualized increase of 2.9% in August, higher than the prior month's 2.7% and well above the Fed's goal of reaching a 2% annual rate.",
      "With the labor market hitting a wall in recent months, economists now expect the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17 meeting. The only question is whether the Fed might usher in a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, or opt for the typical cut of 0.25 percentage points.",
      "\"Market odds currently see a 100% chance of a Fed rate cut this month, with a small constituent seeing an outsized 50-basis-point cut on Sept. 17 within the realm of possibility,\" Anthony Saglimbene, Ameriprise chief market strategist, wrote in a Sept. 8 research note.",
      "But, he added, if the August's Consumer Price Index comes in hotter than expected on Sept. 11, that \"would likely throw cold water on the idea that the Fed is considering an outsized September rate cut.\"",
      "President Trump has\u00a0repeatedly lashed out at Powell\u00a0this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over\u00a0whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority\u00a0to do so. Powell's term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026.",
      "Trump nominates replacement commissioner",
      "President Trump\u00a0in August announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Monday. Antoni, a fellow at conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, has\u00a0criticized the BLS, questioning its methodology.",
      "\"DOGE needs to take a chainsaw to the BLS...,\" he wrote in a November\u00a0post\u00a0on X.",
      "In a statement Monday backing the BLS, the National Association for Business Economics (NABE), a professional association of global economists, applied economists, data scientists and academics, said it \"stands firmly with the dedicated economists and statisticians at BLS and across the federal statistical agencies.\"",

    "summary": "Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo said his department did not do any data analysis on how a change in vaccine rules could affect outbreaks of diseases like measles, polio or whooping cough.",
    "story": [
      "Florida's top health official said last week that the state will start dismantling school vaccine mandates, something no other state has done in modern U.S. history. On Sunday, in a CNN interview with Jake Tapper, Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo confirmed that his department did no data analysis or projections on how the change could affect outbreaks of diseases like measles, polio or whooping cough.",
      "When Tapper pressed him, Ladapo said he didn't think modeling was needed. \"Ultimately, this is an issue very clearly of parents' rights,\" he said. \"So do I need to analyze whether it's appropriate for parents to be able to decide what goes into their [child's body]? I don't need to do an analysis on that.\"",
      "The rollback, announced on Sept. 3, starts with rule changes that drop vaccine requirements for hepatitis B and chickenpox. Other vaccines \u2014 like those for measles, polio and whooping cough (pertussis) \u2014 are written into state law, so lawmakers would have to vote to remove them. Ladapo said he also wants those gone, calling vaccine rules a violation of \"bodily autonomy.\"",
      "Without projections about the potential impact, hospitals can't plan for enough staff, beds or children's ICU care if there are outbreaks of preventable diseases. Between 2008 and 2022, the U.S. lost about 20% of children's hospital beds, especially in rural areas, which means many families must travel farther to get care. Children's hospitals aren't built to handle big waves of sick kids. During the influenza, COVID and RSV surges in 2022 and 2023, hospitals quickly ran out of space.",
      "School vaccine rules have long been the best way to prevent such outbreaks by keeping vaccination rates high and protecting both children and the wider community. In addition to the decision by Ladapo and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to roll back childhood vaccination mandates, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s CDC vaccine advisory panel has questioned the need for COVID and RSV shots to protect infants and kids.",
      "Ladapo singled out whooping cough, arguing that pertussis vaccines are \"ineffective at preventing transmission.\" Research shows that immunity from pertussis vaccines does wane within a few years, but the shots still provide critical protection against severe illness. A large study of U.S. children found that unvaccinated kids were 13 times more likely to contract pertussis than those who were fully vaccinated. Maternal vaccination during pregnancy reduces infant hospitalizations by more than 90%.",
      "For more than 100 years, U.S. Supreme Court rulings have supported vaccine requirements. In Jacobson v. Massachusetts, in 1905, the Court said a state could mandate smallpox shots during an outbreak. The justices explained that personal freedom has limits when public safety is at risk and that states can enact reasonable health regulations to protect the public. Seventeen years later, in Zucht v. King, the Court ruled that schools could keep out children who weren't vaccinated, even if there wasn't an outbreak. This confirmed that school vaccine rules are a legal way for states to keep students safe.",
      "\"The courts have been clear and powerful for over a century, ruling consistently that vaccine mandates are a reasonable and lifesaving public health tool,\" said Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown University. \"For decades, every state has required school-based vaccinations and no court has even questioned it. But all that settled law is unraveling.\"",
      "Gostin explained that courts usually let states decide their own health rules. This means states may require vaccines, but they don't have to. Because of this, Florida may be able to drop vaccine rules without violating old Supreme Court decisions. The bigger risk, he warned, is that today's courts might change the rules: they could demand that states provide stronger reasons for vaccine mandates or force all states to allow religious exemptions \u2014 which several states, like California and New York, don't currently do. Either step would make vaccine laws weaker around the country.",

Shortly after President Trump returned to the White House for a second term, his administration moved to lay off thousands of probationary workers as part of its goal of shrinking the size of the federal government.",
      "The terminations occurred in mid-February, when thousands of probationary workers began receiving notices from their agencies that they were laid off. Court filings indicate that at least 24,000 of these federal employees had been fired by early March.",
      "The 19 states and the District of Columbia swiftly filed a lawsuit against a slew of agencies challenging the mass firings, arguing that the terminations were unlawful because the Trump administration did not comply with a legal requirement to provide states with 60 days notice before a large-scale layoff.",
      "The states that sued were Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.",
      "In April, a federal district court in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to reinstate all affected probationary workers living or working in the states that sued. The district court also prohibited the government from conducting any future reductions-in-force unless they were in compliance with federal law.",
      "The 4th Circuit granted a Trump administration request to freeze the district court's decision, clearing the way for agencies to lay off probationary workers again. It heard arguments in the case in May.",

But the reverse is also true,\" he wrote. \"It is hard to imagine a more traditionally federal function than the management of the federal workforce. The federal workforce performs federal functions. How it performs them is a matter of federal concern.\"",
      "He warned that if the court were to accept the states' theory of how they have been harmed, every change in federal funding levels would authorize states to sue the federal government.",
      "\"A contrary result would upend our federalist system by ceding federal sovereignty to the states,\" Wilkinson wrote.",

      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts has allowed President Trump to remove a member of the Federal Trade Commission for now.",
      "The chief justice granted interim relief to the Trump administration Monday while the Supreme Court takes more time to consider its request to lift a lower court order requiring Rebecca Kelly Slaughter to be reinstated to her position at the commission.",
      "Slaughter is one of several appointees at independent agencies that the president has removed since he returned to the White House. The Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission\u00a0while legal challenges to the removals move forward.",
      "Mr. Trump appointed Slaughter to the FTC in 2018, and former President Joe Biden reappointed her to the role. Her term was set to expire in 2029.",
      "But in March, Slaughter received an email from the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, which contained a message from Mr. Trump informing her that she had been removed from the FTC. Slaughter sued the president and officials at the commission, arguing that her removal violated the Federal Trade Commission Act. That law limits the grounds that a president can remove a commissioner to inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "In July, a federal district court in Washington, D.C., ruled in Slaughter's favor and found that Mr. Trump's removal was \"unlawful\" and \"without legal effect.\" The Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which declined last week to freeze the district court's order while it considers the case.",
      "The Trump administration then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "The dispute over Slaughter's firing involves the same agency and removal protections that were at issue in a 1935 case known as Humphrey's Executor v. United States. In that landmark decision, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the restrictions and ruled that Congress could enact for-cause removal protections for multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "But the high court has chipped away at that precedent in recent years and reasserted the president's power to remove executive officers without cause. In a recent cases involving Mr. Trump's removals of members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Supreme Court indicated it believes the entities exercise considerable executive power.",
      "In its request for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, lawyers for the Trump administration argued that the modern FTC exercises \"vast executive authority,\" a change from the 1935-era commission.",

    "summary": "Justice Amy Coney Barrett spoke with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell for her first TV interview since joining the Supreme Court in 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Justice Amy Coney Barrett spoke with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell for her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court in October 2020, responding to criticism that the Supreme Court is allowing President Trump to expand the bounds of executive power and discussing the attacks waged on the federal judiciary.",
      "Selected by President Trump to succeed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died just weeks before the 2020 presidential election, Barrett's appointment to the high court widened its conservative majority to 6-3. At 53, she is likely to serve for decades.",
      "So far in her tenure on the Supreme Court, Barrett has been in the majority in landmark decisions overturning Roe v. Wade, ending affirmative action in higher education, and curbing federal regulatory power. She also joined with her conservative colleagues in ruling last year that former presidents have immunity from federal prosecution for official actions taken while in office.",
      "But this year, she earned the ire of some conservatives after declining to grant the Trump administration emergency relief during an early stage of a challenge to its freezing of foreign aid funding. Barrett and Chief Justice John Roberts also joined with the three liberal justices in rejecting Mr. Trump's bid to delay his sentencing earlier this year for a felony criminal conviction in New York.",
      "Barrett has written a new book, \"Listening to the Law: Reflections on the Court and Constitution\" (which will be available to the public Sept. 9). She spoke with O'Donnell about an array of topics related to the Supreme Court, including how it handles emergency appeals, its June 2022 ruling unwinding the constitutional right to abortion, and the threats she has faced since becoming a justice.",
      "Here are five takeaways from Barrett's interview:",
      "Barrett details the decision overturning Roe v. Wade",
      "Shortly after Barrett joined the Supreme Court in October 2020, the high court agreed to take up a case that asked it to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to an abortion.",
      "In June 2022, a five-justice majority on the Supreme Court voted to dismantle the federal abortion protections, saying it would be up to states to decide the issue of abortion access. Barrett was among the five justices who voted to overturn Roe.",
      "Explaining the decision, Barrett said that the Supreme Court did not outlaw abortion through its ruling in the case, known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.",
      "\"Dobbs did not render abortion illegal. Dobbs did not say anything about whether abortion is immoral,\" she told O'Donnell. \"Dobbs said that these are questions that are left to the states. All of these kinds of questions, decisions that you mention that require medical judgments, are not ones that the Constitution commits to the court, you know, to decide how far into pregnancy the right of abortion might extend.\"",
      "Barrett said that before the Supreme Court overturned Roe, it had drawn lines.",
      "\"What Dobbs says is that those calls are properly left to the democratic process, and the states have been working those out,\" she said. \"There's been a lot of legislative activity and a lot of state constitutional activity since the decision in Dobbs was rendered.\"",
      "Since Roe was reversed, 14 states have enacted near-total bans on abortion, and a handful more have restricted access to the procedure. But 18 states protect abortion access.",
      "\"The question is how do you decide because I don't think that \u2014 well, certainly my children would say they don't want me deciding under the law of Amy what liberties, what rights we have and not. I mean, that's a job for the American people, and the Constitution leaves virtually every question like that to the democratic process, to the American people,\" she said.",
      "Barrett says emergency orders present \"challenge\" for the court",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to office for a second term, the Supreme Court has been asked by the Justice Department to intervene in the early stages of cases nearly two dozen times. These cases land on the court's emergency docket, or \"shadow docket,\" a term coined by a University of Chicago law professor in 2015.",
      "While emergency relief was typically sought in death penalty cases, the Supreme Court has in recent years been asked to issue interim orders that, if granted, remain in place while litigation moves through the lower courts.",
      "As federal judges have issued injunctions blocking many of Mr. Trump's policies this year, the Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to step in and freeze those orders, allowing it to continue enforcing a challenged policy as the cases proceed. The high court has allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of independent agencies, terminate grants from the Department of Education and National Institutes of Health, and move forward with agency plans to terminate thousands of federal workers, among other decisions.",
      "The Trump administration has prevailed in most of those emergency appeals. The Supreme Court's handling of those requests has sparked complaints from its critics, as it often does not provide a written explanation for its decision.",
      "\"The emergency orders present a challenge because they do require the work of the court to proceed far more quickly than it normally does,\" Barrett told O'Donnell.",
      "The justice said the Supreme Court \"typically moves slowly.\" When it agrees to hear a case and decide the merits, each side submits briefs presenting their legal arguments, the justices hear oral arguments and then typically spend weeks, if not months, working on opinions.",
      "\"I describe in the book the way that oral argument has grown and developed over 200 years, it's taken us to kind of settle into the way that we do arguments and opinions,\" Barrett said. \"The emergency docket moves much more quickly, and it is a much more recent phenomenon.\"",
      "She added: \"The emergency docket is newer, and so I would say those processes are still being shaped and sorted out.\"",
      "Barrett says it's \"wrong\" to suggest the Supreme Court has an agenda",
      "Mr. Trump shaped the current composition of the Supreme Court, appointing three of its nine justices \u2014 Barrett and Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 during his first term.",
      "Critics of the Supreme Court have said the conservative majority has allowed Mr. Trump to expand the bounds of his power by granting the emergency relief he has sought. But Barrett rejected that contention.",
      "\"Justices and courts, district courts, are not trying to enable Congress or the executive to do anything. We're deciding cases,\" she told O'Donnell.",
      "Barrett said cases that come to the Supreme Court on its emergency docket are \"far more tentative,\" and there are more factors that the justices have to consider when asked to grant a stay, including whether the applicant will be irreparably harmed without relief.",
      "\"I think people will disagree with respect to any individual order, whether the court made the right judgment about the merits or not,\" she said. \"I think in so far as the question might suggest that the court has an agenda or some motive, that's just wrong.\"",
      "Barrett said it's not the Supreme Court's job to \"survey\" and form a political view, explaining \"our job is to decide these legal questions.\"",
      "Barrett details the threats she has received since joining the Supreme Court",
      "In May 2022, a draft of the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade was published by the news outlet Politico, an unprecedented leak that Chief Justice John Roberts denounced as a \"betrayal.\" The person who leaked the draft opinion has not been identified.",
      "In response, demonstrators appeared outside the homes of several of the conservative justices, including Barrett's, to protest Roe's impending reversal. The protests went on for months, and then-Attorney General Merrick Garland directed the U.S. Marshals Service to provide additional support to ensure the safety of the justices.",
      "Shortly after the leak, a California man allegedly armed with a gun, knife and various tools was arrested outside of Kavanaugh's Maryland house. He was charged with attempting to kill a Supreme Court justice and pleaded guilty in April of this year.",
      "Since then, judges across the country have continued to face threats to their safety and harassment. In July, three sitting federal judges spoke out about how they have been targeted after ruling against the Trump administration, including through \"swattings\" and \"pizza doxxings.\"",
      "Barrett's sister was the target of a bomb threat at her home in South Carolina, CNN reported in March. The justice herself is the \"not-so-proud owner\" of a bulletproof vest, she said, recalling one of her sons asking if he could try it on.",
      "\"Thinking, 'This is a parenting moment that I wasn't quite prepared for,' I said, 'Sure. Go ahead.' And he puts it on. And then he looked up at me and he said, 'Wait. Why do you have a bullet-proof vest?'\" Barrett recalled. \"So, you know, we've tried to explain those things to the kids.\"",
      "When demonstrators were protesting outside her home, Barrett said her family developed a safety routine for when her children would arrive to find them there. The justice recalled her son getting dropped off, and realizing she had forgotten to tell him there would be protesters outside.",
      "The justice confirmed to O'Donnell that she has received death threats, and condemned threats of violence.",
      "\"I think that it should not be the price of public service for any official, judges included, to face violence or threats of violence,\" she said.",
      "Barrett said she tries to tune out the criticism lodged against her, which has come from both sides of the aisle, and said judges have been the subject of attacks before.",
      "\"I think that's part of the risk of the job,\" she said. \"You know, many judges and justices before me have faced criticism and threats. And I am sure that will be true in the future. That's why it requires a stiff spine.\"",
      "Still, Barrett said she believes there has been a shift in the justices' experience on the Supreme Court that began after Justice Antonin Scalia died in 2016. Barrett said she is seldom alone now and rarely drives herself.",
      "Barrett said that she doesn't like \"not being anonymous,\" and acknowledged that working as a public servant comes at a cost, like losing your privacy.",
      "\"One of the things I miss is just being able to go to the grocery store and not worrying that someone's gonna recognize me. I don't like that part of it,\" she said. \"So I find the being a public figure and being with security, I've found that hard to get used to, even five years in.\"",
      "Barrett says being a justice requires a \"stomach for criticism\"",
      "Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court by Mr. Trump was praised by conservatives, but she has since received criticism from some of the president's allies for recent votes in cases involving him and his administration.",
      "Laura Loomer, a far-right activist who has compiled information for Mr. Trump about White House personnel, called Barrett a \"DEI appointee,\" referencing diversity, equity and inclusion, and Fox News host Mark Levin claimed the justice \"deceived people into thinking she was a reliable constitutionalist.\"",
      "\"I've been criticized by the left, I've been criticized by the right, I'm sure I've been criticized by the middle,\" Barrett said of the attacks on her. \"If you can't have a stomach for people not liking you, and if you don't have a stomach for criticism, then you're not suited to the role.\"",
      "Still, she acknowledged the difficulties of being \"unpopular.\"",
      "\"That's why being a judge \u2014 you know, people think it's glamorous but it's actually public service and hard work. I love it because I love the ability to serve my country, I think that's a privilege. I enjoy the work. I like my colleagues, my law clerks are wonderful,\" Barrett said. \"But there is this other side, you know, this personal cost, this willingness to be unpopular.\"",

      "The president said the new guidance will support students like Hannah Allen, who was in the audience Monday. According to the First Liberty Institute, which represent Allen, Allen was praying for an injured peer in Honey Grove Middle School's cafeteria in Honey Grove, Texas in 2018. The school required the students to instead pray behind a curtain, move to an empty gym or go outside, the group said. Under pressure from religious liberty groups, the Honey Grove Texas Independent School District eventually reversed the decision.",

      "Roberta Kaplan, an attorney for Carroll, lauded the decision, saying the appeals panel concluded that \"Carroll was telling the truth, and that President Donald Trump was not.\" Kaplan noted that the court found Mr. Trump was \"recklessly indifferent\" to Carroll's \"health and safety\" when making defamatory statements about her.",
      "\"We look forward to an end to the appellate process so that justice will finally be done,\" Kaplan said.",

    "story": [
      "China's exports grew last month but at a slower pace than in recent months, the country's customs agency said Monday.",
      "Exports reached $321.8 billion in August, a 4.4% increase compared to the same month last year. That was down from a 7.2% jump in July. Meanwhile, imports totaled $219.5 billion, a 1.8% rise.",
      "China's large trade surplus has become a contentious issue with major trading partners including the U.S. and the European Union. Low-priced Chinese imports are a boon for consumers but can lead to job cuts in manufacturing.",
      "In the first eight months of the year, China's exported $785.3 billion more in goods than it imported from other countries, the monthly customs data showed.",
      "President Donald Trump also has imposed 30% in additional tariffs on imports from China since taking office early this year. He backed down from even higher tariffs after China retaliated with import taxes of its own. The two countries are in talks to try to reach a trade agreement.",
      "The tariffs from both sides and the possibility they could be raised again are having an impact on two-way trade. Chinese exports to the U.S. plunged 33% in August to $47.3 billion, while its imports from the U.S. dropped 16% to $13.4 billion.",
      "Exports to the EU rose 10.4% to $46.8 billion, while imports from the 27-member bloc edged down slightly to $22.8 billion.",
      "Overall, China's exports grew at the slowest pace since the January-February period, when they rose just 2.3%. The first two months of the year are reported together to smooth out distortions from the long Lunar New Year break.",
      "China's exports of rare earths rose on a monthly basis to $55 million in August, up from $41 million in July, but down 25.6% compared to the same month last year.",
      "Rare earth magnets, which can withstand high heat, are vital to many products including washing machines, cars and fighter jets.",
      "China dominates the global market for processing rare earths, and a clampdown on their export in April temporarily halted production at some factories in Europe and the U.S. and raised fears of shutdowns at others.",
      "The issue became a focal point of a round of U.S.-China trade talks in London in June. China agreed to approve more export permits for rare earths in return for the U.S. lifting curbs on the sale of chip design software and jet engines to China.",
      "End of de minimis",
      "President Trump in May also ended a de minimis loophole for imports from China and Hong Kong. The exemption \u2014 which applied to parcels valued at $800 or less \u2014 had allowed retailers such as Shein and Temu to ship ultra low-cost apparel and other goods to the U.S. tax-free.",
      "However the platforms have since found ways to work around U.S. tariffs without the loophole, Wired magazine reported recently. \"And it turns out, the elimination of de minimis hasn't stopped their overall growth: The Chinese publication LatePost\u00a0reported\u00a0that global sales for Shein and Temu are higher this year compared to 2024.\"",
      "A suspension of the de minimis loophole on worldwide exports to the U.S. went into effect on Aug. 29.",

    "summary": "Chagas disease\u200b is already endemic to 21 countries in the Americas, and growing evidence of the parasite is challenging the non-endemic label in the U.S., the CDC says.",
    "story": [
      "Chagas disease, a potentially deadly condition caused by an infected triatomine insect or \"kissing bug,\" may be becoming endemic in the United States, according to a\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report.",
      "In the report, which was originally published last month for the September issue of the CDC's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal, the authors said the disease is already endemic to 21 countries in the Americas, and growing evidence of the parasite is challenging the non-endemic label in the U.S.",
      "\"Autochthonous (or, locally acquired) human cases have been reported in 8 states, most notably in Texas. Labeling the United States as non-Chagas disease-endemic perpetuates low awareness and underreporting,\" the report noted, adding the insect has been reported in 32 states.",
      "Other states with human cases include California, Arizona, Tennessee, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas.",
      "The report notes that data is \"inadequate\" to prove that the insects are increasing in geographic distribution or abundance. But it also says that the bugs are \"increasingly recognized\" because of frequent encounters with humans and due to more research attention.",
      "\"Invasion into homes, human bites, subsequent allergic reactions or exposure to T. cruzi parasites, and increasing frequency of canine diagnoses have led to growing public awareness,\" it says.",
      "What causes Chagas disease?",
      "The condition is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi parasites found in triatomine or \"kissing bugs,\" which can pass the disease to other animals and humans.",
      "According to UCLA Health, the insect's nickname comes from the bug often biting people on the face.",
      "According to the CDC, about 8 million people globally and 280,000 in the United States have the disease, often without knowing it.",
      "\"People might scratch or rub bug feces into a bite wound, their eyes, or mouth without realizing it, which allows the parasite to enter their body,\" the CDC says. The agency explains that bugs pass the parasite in their droppings after biting a person or animal. \"If these droppings get into someone's body through a cut in the skin, or near the eyes or mouth, it can lead to infection.\"",
      "The disease does not spread from person to person like a cold, nor does it spread through casual contact with those infected.",
      "Without treatment, the condition can be life-threatening, the CDC says.",
      "Symptoms of Chagas disease in adults",
      "In the acute phase, which happens shortly after infection, a type of eyelid swelling known as Roma\u00f1a's sign may appear.",
      "\"This happens when the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite gets into the eyelid, usually by accidentally rubbing the bug feces into your eye or into a bug bite near your eye,\" the CDC says.",

      "\"(The disease) can destroy the nerves that feed the various parts of your body \u2014 so your heart, your esophagus, your colon,\" infectious disease physician Tom Moore\u00a0told CBS News Philadelphia\u00a0in 2019 as cases made their way north.",
      "In both stages, some people might not feel sick while others can have serious health problems, the CDC adds.",
      "How to avoid \"kissing bugs\"",
      "There are no vaccines or drugs that can prevent Chagas disease at this time, according to the CDC, so it's important to protect yourself.",
      "Prevention methods include staying in well-built places if traveling, using insecticides and bug spray, wearing clothes that cover your skin and not eating raw fruits and vegetables, as the infection can also be acquired orally or through the mouth via contaminated food.",
      "Experts also previously told CBS News Philadelphia that homeowners can seal windows and keep trash, piles of wood and rocks away from their homes to reduce risk.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of young Catholics flock to the small central Italian town of Assisi every year to pay tribute to Carlo Acutis \u2013 the Italian teenager informally known as \"God's Influencer.\"",
      "The 15-year-old computer whiz became the Catholic Church's first millennial saint on Sunday, giving the next generation of Catholics a relatable role model who used technology to spread the faith.",
      "Pope Leo XIV canonized Acutis, who died in 2006, during an open-air Mass in St. Peter's Square before an estimated 80,000 people, many of them millennials and couples with young children. Leo also canonized another popular Italian figure who died young, Pier Giorgio Frassati.",
      "Leo said both men created \"masterpieces\" out of their lives by dedicating them to God.",
      "\"The greatest risk in life is to waste it outside of God's plan,\" Leo said in his homily. The new saints \"are an invitation to all of us, especially young people, not to squander our lives, but to direct them upwards and make them masterpieces.\"",
      "Who was Carlo Acutis?",
      "Acutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London to a wealthy Italian family. They moved back to Milan soon after he was born, and according to reports, he enjoyed a typical, happy childhood that was marked by his increasingly intense religious devotion.",
      "He launched and managed a website for his local parish and later a Vatican-based academy. He also used his computer skills to create an online database of Eucharistic miracles around the world, available in nearly 20 languages. The site provides information about the 196 seemingly inexplicable events in the history of the church related to the Eucharist, which the faithful believe is the body of Christ.",
      "\"Carlo was well aware that the whole apparatus of communications, advertising and social networking can be used to lull us, to make us addicted to consumerism and buying the latest thing on the market,\" the late Pope Francis wrote in a 2019 document. \"Yet he knew how to use the new communications technology to transmit the Gospel, to communicate values and beauty.\"",
      "Acutis was known to spend hours in prayer before the Eucharist each day, a practice known as Eucharistic adoration.",
      "\"This was the fixed appointment of his day,\" his mother, Antonia Salzano, said in a documentary that is airing Friday night at the U.S. seminary in Rome.",
      "In October 2006, at age 15, he fell ill with what was quickly diagnosed as acute leukemia. He died in Monza, Italy, within days of his diagnosis. His body was entombed in Assisi and is on full display alongside other relics linked to him.",
      "Fast track to sainthood",
      "Dressed in jeans, Nike sneakers and a sweatshirt, with his hands clasped around a rosary, Acutis has generated a near rock star-like fame among young faithful the likes of which the Catholic Church hasn't seen in ages.",
      "Those who can't make it in person can watch the comings and goings on a webcam pointed at his tomb, a level of internet accessibility not afforded even to popes buried in St. Peter's Basilica.",
      "Acutis' path to sainthood began more than 10 years ago, initiated by a group of priests and friends, and formally took off shortly after Francis assumed the papacy in 2013.",
      "Acutis was named \"venerable\" in 2018 after the church recognized his virtuous life, and his body was taken to a shrine in the Santuario della Spogliazione in Assisi, Italy. It was a significant site associated with St. Francis' life.",
      "The teenager was beatified in 2020 \u2013 the first step to sainthood \u2013 after Acutis was credited with healing a Brazilian child of a congenital disease affecting his pancreas.",
      "Last year, Francis approved the second miracle needed for Acutis to be made a saint. The second miracle involved the healing of a university student in Florence who had a brain bleed after suffering head trauma in a bicycle accident.",
      "Francis and the cardinals residing in Rome formally approved his canonization in July 2024.",
      "The canonization \u2013 the first for Pope Leo XIV \u2013 was initially scheduled for earlier this year but was postponed following Francis' death in April.",
      "An appeal to the youth",
      "For his admirers, Acutis was an ordinary kid who did extraordinary things: a typical Milan teen who went to school, played soccer and loved animals. But he also brought food to the poor, attended Mass daily and got his less-than-devout parents back to church.",
      "\"When I read his story for the first time, it was just like shocking to me, because from a very early age, he was just really drawn to Jesus Christ and he would go to Mass all the time,\" Sona Harrison, an eighth grader at the St. John Berchmans' school, which is part of the Blessed Carlo Acutis Parish in Chicago's Northwest Side, told the Associated Press. \"I feel like he's a lot more relatable, and I definitely feel like I'm closer to God when I read about him.\"",
      "During Mass this week before the canonization, students processed into the chapel under an Acutis banner carrying things he might have carried: a soccer ball, a laptop and a knapsack.",
      "\"He fed the poor, he cared for the poor,\" said 9-year-old David Cameron, who called Acutis \"a great man.\" Cameron, a fan of Sonic, Minecraft and Halo, also found inspiration in Acutis' love of video games \u2014 and awe at Acutis' restraint.",
      "\"He played video games for like only one hour a week, which I don't think I can do,\" he told the AP.",
      "Matthew Schmalz, professor of religious studies at Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts, said Acutis' canonization extends the church tradition of popular piety to the digital age.",
      "\"He becomes an emblem or model of how Catholics should approach and use the digital world--with discipline and with a focus on traditional Catholic spirituality that defies the passage of time,\" he said in a statement. \"He is a new saint of simplicity for the ever complex digital landscape of contemporary Catholicism.\"",
      "The Vatican said 36 cardinals, 270 bishops and hundreds of priests had signed up to celebrate the Mass along with Leo in a sign of the saints' enormous appeal to the hierarchy and ordinary faithful alike.",
      "Frassati, the other saint being canonized Sunday, lived from 1901-1925, when he died at age 24 of polio. He was born into a prominent Turin family but is known for his devotion to serving the poor and carrying out acts of charity while spreading his faith to his friends.",

      "\"We   affirm that this operation is a natural response to the crimes of the   occupation and the genocide it is waging against our people,\" Hamas  said  in a statement.",
      "The  shooting was one of the  deadliest incidents of its kind since the war  in Gaza was sparked by  the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist  attack on Israel, which  resulted in the deaths of more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians,  according to Israeli officials. Hamas and its allies also seized 251 Israelis as hostages during the attack, about 50 of whom remain in Gaza, and 20 of whom are still believed to be alive according to Netanyahu.",

      "Parts   of the city, home to nearly 1 million people, are already considered   \"red zones,\" where evacuation orders had been issued ahead of expected   heavy fighting.",
      "Aid groups have repeatedly warned that a large-scale evacuation of Gaza City would exacerbate the dire humanitarian crisis\u00a0there.   Palestinians have been uprooted and displaced multiple times during  the  nearly two-year-long war in Gaza, and humanitarian groups have warned that many may be unable to leave.",
      "Israeli military spokesperson Avichay  Adraee wrote  in a social media post that the army had declared al-Muwasi \u2014 a makeshift tent camp  in southern  Gaza \u2014 a humanitarian area and urged everyone in the Gaza City, which  the army has called a Hamas stronghold, to leave.  The army said civilians could travel in cars down a  designated road without  being searched.",

      "Hamas reacts to reported new U.S. ceasefire proposal",
      "Monday's attack came as Hamas said it was assessing a new U.S.-brokered ceasefire proposal to end the war in Gaza, which was reportedly delivered Sunday.

      "Police in Nepal's capital city of Kathmandu opened fire Monday on protesters demonstrating against a government ban on social media platforms, killing at least 17 and wounding dozens more, according to state TV.",
      "At least six people died at the Bir Hospital in Kathmandu, the Kantipur newspaper said, quoting doctors. Two died at the Civil Hospital and two more at the KMC hospital, according to doctors there who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment.",
      "The updated death toll was announced by police official Shekhar Khanal. He said 28 officers were among the wounded, as smaller protests continued into late Monday evening.",
      "At least 145 people were hurt, officials said. They were being treated at half a dozen hospitals in Kathmandu.",
      "Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Nepal's capital Monday to vent their anger against a decision by authorities to block most social media platforms, including Facebook, X and YouTube. Authorities have accused the platforms of failing to register and submit to government oversight.",
      "Neither Google, which owns YouTube, nor Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, responded to requests for comment from The Associated Press. Elon Musk's X platform did not respond either.",
      "Protesters pushed through barbed wire and forced riot police to retreat as they surrounded the Nepalese Parliament building. Police fired tear gas and water cannon but were outnumbered and sought safety inside the parliament complex. Police eventually opened fire at the protesters.",

      "About two dozen social network platforms that are widely used in Nepal were repeatedly given notices to register their companies officially in the country, the government said. Those that failed to do so have been blocked since last week.",
      "TikTok, Viber and three other platforms have registered and continued to operate without interruption.",
      "The move by the authorities came as the government sent a bill for a debate in parliament that seeks to ensure that social platforms are \"properly managed, responsible and accountable.\" It includes asking the companies to appoint a liaison office or point person in the country.",
      "The bill has been widely criticized as a tool for censorship and punishing government opponents who voice their opposition online. Rights groups have called it an attempt by the government to curb freedom of expression and violate fundamental rights.",
      "Nepal in 2023 banned the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok, accusing it of disrupting \"social harmony, goodwill and diffusing indecent materials.\"",

      "Banksy posted a photo of the work on Instagram, his usual method of claiming a work as authentic. It was captioned \"Royal Courts Of Justice. London.\"",
      "Security officials outside the courthouse covered the artwork Monday with sheets of black plastic and two metal barriers, and it was being guarded by two officers and a security camera.",
      "Because the Victorian Gothic revival style building is 143 years old, the mural will be removed with consideration for its historical significance, according to HM Courts & Tribunals Service (HMCTS).",
      "\"The Royal Courts of Justice is a listed building and HMCTS are obliged to maintain its original character,\" it said in a statement. Listed buildings are considered the country's most significant historic buildings and sites and are protected by law.",
      "While the artwork doesn't refer to a particular cause or incident, activists saw it as a reference to the U.K. government's ban on the group Palestine Action. On Saturday, almost 900 people were arrested at a London protest challenging the ban.",
      "Defend Our Juries, the group that organized the protest, said in a statement on social media that the mural \"powerfully depicts the brutality unleashed\" by the government ban.",

      "The artist's anonymity was about avoiding problems with the police, Steve Lazarides, an early associate of Banksy's in Bristol, told CBS News in 2023.",
      "But people have speculated about his identity for decades \u2014 Bristol artist Robin Gunningham and Robert Del Naja, from the band Massive Attack, also from Bristol, have been raised as possibilities.",

      "Banksy's political messages",
      "Banksy's work often comments on political issues, with many of his pieces criticizing government policy on migration and war.",
      "At the Glastonbury Festival last year, an inflatable raft holding dummies of migrants in life jackets was unveiled during a band's headline set. Banksy appeared to claim the stunt, which was thought to symbolize small boat crossings of migrants in the English Channel, in a post on Instagram.",
      "The artist has also taken his message on migration to Europe.",
      "In 2019, \"The Migrant Child,\" depicting a shipwrecked child holding a pink smoke bomb and wearing a life jacket, was unveiled in Venice, Italy. In 2018, a number of works, including one near a former center for migrants that depicted a child spray-painting wallpaper over a swastika, were discovered in Paris.",
      "Banksy has also created numerous artworks in the West Bank and Gaza Strip over the years, including one depicting a girl conducting a body search on an Israeli soldier, another showing a dove wearing a flak jacket, and a masked protester hurling a bouquet of flowers. He designed the \"Walled Off Hotel\" guesthouse in Bethlehem, which closed in October 2023.",
      "Last summer, Banksy captured London's attention with an animal-themed collection, which concluded with a mural of a gorilla appearing to hold up the entrance gate to London Zoo.",

    "summary": "French President Emmanuel Macron must search for a fourth prime minister in 12 months after Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou was ousted.",
    "story": [
      "Legislators toppled France's government in a confidence vote on Monday, a new crisis for Europe's second-largest economy that obliges President Emmanuel Macron to search for a fourth prime minister in 12 months.",
      "Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou was ousted overwhelmingly in a 364-194 vote against him. Bayrou paid the price for what appeared to be a staggering political miscalculation, gambling that lawmakers would back his view that France must slash public spending to repair its debts. Instead, they seized on the vote that Bayrou called to gang up against the 74-year-old centrist who was appointed by Macron last December.",
      "The demise of Bayrou's short-lived minority government \u2014 now constitutionally obliged to submit its resignation to Macron after just under nine months in office \u2014 heralds renewed uncertainty and a risk of prolonged legislative deadlock for France as it wrestles with pressing challenges, including budget difficulties and, internationally, wars in Ukraine and Gaza and the shifting priorities of President Trump.",
      "Hunt for a replacement",
      "Although Macron had two weeks to prepare for the government collapse after Bayrou announced in August that he'd seek a confidence vote on his unpopular budget plans, no clear front-runner has emerged as a likely successor.",
      "After Gabriel Attal's departure as prime minister in September 2024, followed by former Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier's ouster by parliament in December, and Bayrou now ousted, too, Macron again faces an arduous hunt for a replacement to build consensus in the parliament's lower house that is stacked with opponents of the French leader.",
      "Macron's office said that he'd accept the resignation of Bayrou's government on Tuesday and name a new prime minister \"in the coming days.\"",
      "As president, Macron will continue to hold substantial powers over foreign policy and European affairs and remain the commander in chief of the nuclear-armed military. But domestically, the 47-year-old president's ambitions are increasingly facing ruin.",
      "The root of the latest government collapse was Macron's stunning decision to dissolve the National Assembly in June 2024, triggering a legislative election that the French leader hoped would strengthen the hand of his pro-European centrist alliance. But the gamble backfired, producing a splintered legislature with no dominant political bloc in power for the first time in France's modern republic.",
      "Shorn of a workable majority, his minority governments have since lurched from crisis to crisis, surviving on the whim of opposing political blocs on the left and far-right that don't have enough seats to govern themselves but can, when they team up, topple Macron's choices.",
      "Bayrou's gamble",
      "Bayrou, too, rolled the dice by calling the confidence vote, a decision that quickly backfired on the political veteran as left-wing and far-right legislators seized the opportunity to oust his government, seeking to increase pressure on Macron.",
      "\"This moment marks the end of the agony of a phantom government,\" far-right leader Marine Le Pen said, according to the Reuters news service.",
      "\"Today is a day of relief for millions of French people, of relief over your departure,\" Mathilde Panot of the hard-left France Unbowed told Bayrou in remarks before the vote, according to Reuters.",
      "Bayrou conceded in his last speech as prime minister to the National Assembly that putting his fate on the line was risky. But he said that France's debt crisis compelled him to seek legislative support for remedies, in the face of what he called \"a silent, underground, invisible, and unbearable hemorrhage\" of excessive public borrowing.",
      "\"The greatest risk was to not take one, to let things go on without changing anything, to go on doing politics as usual,\" he said. \"Submission to debt is like submission through military force. Dominated by weapons, or dominated by our creditors, because of a debt that is submerging us \u2014 in both cases, we lose our freedom.\"",
      "At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France's public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros, or 114% of gross domestic product. Debt servicing remains a major budget item, accounting for around 7% of state spending.",
      "Le Pen wants new election",
      "The 577-seat National Assembly interrupted its summer recess to convene for the extraordinary session of high political drama. Macron's opponents worked to leverage the crisis to push for a new legislative election, apply pressure for Macron's departure or jostle for posts in the next government.",
      "Le Pen called for Macron to again dissolve the National Assembly, seemingly confident that her National Rally party and its allies would win a majority in another snap legislative election, positioning it to form a new government.",
      "\"A big country like France cannot live with a paper government, especially in a tormented and dangerous world,\" she said in the National Assembly.",
      "Pressing problems",
      "In a last-ditch effort to save his job before the vote, Bayrou warned that France is risking its future and its influence by racking up trillions in state debts that are \"submerging us,\" pleading for belt-tightening.",
      "Macron's chosen successor will operate in the same precarious environment and face the same pressing budget problems that dogged Bayrou and his predecessors. Macron himself has vowed to stay in office until the end of his term, but risks becoming a lame duck domestically if political paralysis continues.",
      "Under the French political system, the prime minister is appointed by the president, accountable to the parliament, and is in charge of implementing domestic policy, notably economic measures.",
      "Arguing that sharp cuts are needed to repair public finances, Bayrou had proposed to cut 44 billion euros ($51 billion) in spending in 2026, after France's deficit hit 5.8% of GDP last year, way above the official EU target of 3%.",
      "He painted a dramatic picture of the European Union's No. 2 economy becoming beholden to foreign creditors and addicted to living beyond its means. He castigated opponents in the National Assembly who teamed up against his minority government despite their own sharp political differences.",
      "\"You have the power to overthrow the government, but you do not have the power to erase reality,\" Bayrou said. \"Reality will remain inexorable. Spending will continue to increase and the debt burden \u2014 already unbearable \u2014 will grow heavier and more costly.\"",

He said 16 deaths and 28 suspected cases had been confirmed, including four suspected infections among health care workers.",
      "World Health Organization regional director for Africa Mohamed Janabi said the first case, known as the index case, was a \"34-year-old pregnant woman who was admitted on August 20 and passed away on August 25 with typical features for hemorrhagic fever; bloody diarrhea, bleeding from the nose, vomiting, and bleeding from the rectum.\"",
      "The Ebola virus is transmitted to humans through close contact with infected wildlife, often bats, and can then spread through bodily fluids through close human-to-human contact. The WHO said that, as of Sept. 4, the case fatality rate in the Congo outbreak was 57%, with 80% of the cases in people aged 15 or older.",
      "This is the sixth Ebola outbreak within seven years in Congo, making it the highest concentration of outbreaks since the virus was first discovered in 1976.",
      "A team of first responders arrived Sunday in the Bulape health zone, where the outbreak has struck, with medical supplies.",
      "In the country's capital Kinshasa, health workers and first responders from the Ministry of Health, the WHO and the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were given vaccinations ahead of deployments to the affected region.",
      "Congo currently has a stockpile of 2,000 vaccine doses and has ordered more to arrive in the coming days, according to the WHO.",
      "Patrick Otim, the WHO's emergency response coordinator for the area, told reporters during a Sept. 4 briefing that the United Nations agency was already working to trace close contacts with known cases, increase field lab testing capacity and community response to ensure early reporting.",
      "He acknowledged that the DRC had requested additional vaccines and stressed that, as \"early supportive care is key to lifesaving,\" the WHO was working to deliver more medical supplies, including protective clothing and other items \"necessary to manage the outbreak.\"",
      "The last two outbreaks, in 2022, were contained quickly, said Otim, but he noted that they were addressed before the Trump administration severely cut funding for international health programs, including the WHO.",
      "Those cuts have fueled concern in Africa and elsewhere about the ability of individual nations and global agencies to respond to and quickly contain outbreaks of diseases including Ebola \u2014 and to keep such deadly viruses from reaching U.S. shores.",
      "\"The recent cuts will definitely have an impact,\" Otim said at the briefing. \"As a global community, we need to work together to stop this virus, as diseases do not respect borders.\"",
      "\"What we know (from past outbreaks) is you need to get supplies and resources as soon as possible to stop transmission,\" Otim added.",
      "President Trump announced in January that the U.S. \u2014 long a key stakeholder and largest donor to the agency \u2014 would be pulling out of the WHO, with the White House citing \"the organization's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, and other global health crises, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\"",
      "The Trump administration, at the time, also accused the WHO of demanding \"unfairly onerous payments from the United States, far out of proportion with other countries' assessed payments.\"",
      "The WHO warned almost immediately that, given the uncertainty over future U.S. funding, it was cutting back spending in ways that could impact its operations.",
      "Congo's health care system was already overburdened as it battles to contain an mpox outbreak, with roughly 130,000 suspected cases since last year and about 2,000 deaths now recorded, the WHO said at the briefing last week.",
      "Complicating the response is the fact that the nearest medical isolation unit to the outbreak only has 15 beds, and road access from Kinshasa can take up to three days, further delaying the arrival of medical teams and supplies.",
      "The WHO has already delivered about 13 tons of emergency medical supplies to Congo to help contain and treat the outbreak.",

    "summary": "Ethiopia says the GERD hydroelectric dam will be a boon to the region, but Egypt and Sudan say it could threaten their \"existential resources.\"",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg\u00a0\u2014 Africa's largest hydroelectric dam, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), on the Blue Nile is scheduled to open Tuesday to major fanfare in Ethiopia. The $5 billion dam project has been a uniting force for Ethiopians both at home and abroad, who have helped to fund the project.",
      "Funding calls had gone out since the project was launched in 2011, with the government also issuing bonds to fund construction of the mile-long, 475-foot-high structure.",
      "The celebrations in Ethiopia, however, will not extend further down the mighty river into neighboring Sudan or Egypt, both of which have warned that the dam could bring grave consequences.",
      "After years of failed talks, there was still no agreement in place a day before the dam was due to commence operations on how the water will flow through the mammoth structure to ensure adequate supplies in Egypt and Sudan.",
      "Only 54% of Ethiopia's roughly 120 million inhabitants have access to reliable power, and Ethiopian officials have said the 5,150-megawatt capacity dam is expected to double national electricity generation capacity.",
      "Egypt and Sudan's opposition to the dam",
      "In a joint statement last week, Egypt and Sudan said the dam \"breached international law and would cause grave consequences to the two downstream countries.\"",
      "Both nations have said they now consider water security a national security concern.",
      "The Blue Nile flows from Ethiopia to Khartoum, Sudan's capital, where it joins the White Nile before flowing into Egypt as the Nile.",
      "The Blue Nile, soon to flow through the new dam, supplies more than 80% of the water for the combined river system.",
      "Egypt's government, noting that more than 90% of the country is desert, has said most of its population lives along the Nile, and it has raised concern for years that the dam will reduce water flow and cause shortages \u2014 and officials have warned they will take measures in response if that happens.",
      "\"Anyone who imagines that Egypt will turn a blind eye to an existential threat to its water security is mistaken,\" Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah El-Sisi said in August, calling it a potential \"existential\" threat to his country.",
      "\"We will continue to monitor the situation and take all measures provided for under international law to safeguard our people's existential resources,\" El-Sisi said.",
      "Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has been widely quoted as saying the dam will benefit everyone in the region, through power purchase agreements and flood control.",
      "\"To our neighbours downstream \u2014 Egypt and Sudan \u2014 our message is clear: The Renaissance Dam is not a threat, but a shared opportunity. It is a symbol of regional cooperation and mutual benefit. The energy and development it will generate stand to uplift not just Ethiopia, but the entire region,\" he said in remarks on July 3.",
      "In a social media post on Sept. 2, Abiy called seeing the dam completed \"a historic milestone in Ethiopia,\" adding that for him personally it was a \"final prayer and it was my ultimate wish.\"",
      "Trump's criticism and the U.S. stance on GERD",
      "The U.S. government has long tried to balance the concerns and needs of the countries in the region when it comes to the dam project. During the Biden administration in 2024, then Assistant Secretary of State Molly Phee told reporters the U.S. had \"underscored our recognition of\" Egypt's water needs \"and the importance of the Nile to Egypt,\" along with \"Sudan's concerns about dam operations and safety, and Ethiopia's compelling development needs.\"",
      "She said the U.S. was \"committed to helping all these parties discuss how agreements related to water management, use, and access can contribute to security and stability\" in the region, and she said the administration remained \"ready to engage diplomatically in support of such efforts.\"",
      "More recently, President Trump has criticized the dam, claiming several times without offering evidence or clarification, most recently in late July \u2014 that the project was \"stupidly\" funded \"with United States money, largely,\" and noting specifically Egypt's concerns over its Nile water supply.",
      "The coordination body established by Ethiopia's government to drum up funding for the project has vehemently denied Mr. Trump's assertions, insisting the dam was built \"without any foreign aid.\"",
      "Ethiopia will be hosting the Second Africa Climate Summit from Monday, and Abiy has voiced hope that African leaders attending the summit will also attend Tuesday's GERD grand opening celebrations.",
      "The dam is expected to bring in $1 billion in revenue annually, according to Abiy, who has pledged that the money will help finance other infrastructure projects.",

    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 A man who evaded authorities with his three children in the remote New Zealand countryside for nearly four years was shot and killed by a police officer Monday, law enforcement said.",
      "One child was with Tom Phillips at the time of the confrontation and the other two children were found in the forest hours after the shootout, in which an officer was critically injured.",
      "The December 2021 disappearance of Phillips and his children \u2014 now about 9, 10 and 11 years old \u2014 confounded investigators for years as they scoured the densely forested area where they believed the family was hiding. The father and children weren't believed to ever have traveled far from the isolated North Island rural settlement of Marokopa where they lived, and credible sightings of them were rare.",
      "Phillips hasn't been formally identified, but authorities believe he was the man killed.",
      "A police officer was shot in the head and critically injured during a confrontation with Phillips after he robbed an agricultural supplies store early Monday morning, New Zealand's Acting Deputy Police Commissioner Jill Rogers told reporters in the city of Hamilton. The child with Phillips at the time of the robbery was taken into custody.",
      "The officer was undergoing surgery at a hospital. His injuries were survivable, Rogers said, but he was shot \"multiple times with a high-powered rifle\" and additional surgeries were expected.",
      "The whereabouts of Phillips' other two children were unknown immediately after the shooting and authorities had serious concerns for them, Rogers said earlier.",
      "About 13 hours after their father was killed, however, Rogers told reporters that the children had been found unaccompanied at a remote campsite in a rugged forest. The child taken into custody Monday had cooperated with the authorities, enabling them to narrow the search area, she said.",
      "The farm supplies store targeted Monday was in a small town in the same sprawling farming region of Waikato, south of Auckland, as the settlement of about 40 people the family had vanished from.",
      "Tom Phillips saga captivated New Zealand",
      "The case has fascinated New Zealanders and the authorities made regular unsuccessful appeals for information.",
      "Sightings of Phillips were limited to surveillance footage that showed him allegedly committing crimes in the area. He was wanted for an armed bank robbery in May 2023, accompanied by one of his children, in which he reportedly shot at a member of the public.",
      "Phillips didn't have legal custody rights for his children, Detective Senior Sgt. Andrew Saunders told reporters in 2024. When Phillips and the children vanished, police said he took them over a custody battle. Authorities have said the children hadn't had access to formal education or health care since their disappearance.",
      "Law enforcement always believed that Phillips had help concealing his family, and some residents of the isolated rural area expressed support for him. A reward of 80,000 New Zealand dollars ($47,000), large by New Zealand standards, was offered for information about the family's whereabouts last June but was never paid.",
      "December 2021 wasn't the first time Phillips prompted national news headlines after disappearing with his children. The family went missing that September, launching a three-week land and sea search after Phillips' truck was found abandoned on a wild beach near where he lived.",
      "Authorities eventually ended the search, concluding the family might have died, before Phillips and the children emerged from dense forest where he said they had been camping. He was charged with wasting police resources and was due to appear in court in January 2022, but weeks before the scheduled date, he and the children vanished again.",
      "Police didn't immediately launch a search because Phillips, who is experienced in the outdoors, had told family he was taking the children on another trip. He never returned.",
      "The search intensified again after several sightings of Phillips in 2023 in the same region where he had vanished.",
      "Phillips and his children were spotted in October 2024 when a group of teenage pig hunters saw them trekking through the bush and filmed the encounter on their phones.",
      "He was\u00a0also seen on surveillance video last month as he robbed a grocery store in the night, accompanied by one of his children.",
      "The children's mother issued a statement to Radio New Zealand on Monday in which she said she was \"deeply relieved\" that the \"ordeal\" for her children had ended.",
      "\"They have been dearly missed every day for nearly four years, and we are looking forward to welcoming them home with love and care,\" said the woman, who has been identified in New Zealand news outlets only by her first name, Cat.",
      "Phillips' family had previously appealed to Phillips to turn himself in and return the children.",
      "\"There's a lot of love and there's a lot of support, and we're ready to help you walk through what you need to walk through,\" his sister, Rozzi Phillips,\u00a0told New Zealand news site Stuff\u00a0in an exclusive interview last month.",

      "\"What he is accused of is poisoning healthy patients in order to harm colleagues with whom he was in conflict,\" Manteaux said.",
      "\"Frederic Pechier was the first responder when cardiac arrest occurred,\" he added. \"He always had a solution.\"",

      "More than 150 civil parties will be represented at the trial.",
      "For the first two weeks, the court will examine Pechier's most recent cases, those that caused investigators' suspicions and led to the his being placed under investigation in 2017.",
      "Afterward, each of the poisonings attributed to the doctor will be examined.",
      "\"It's going to be a legal marathon, but we're ready,\" Stephane Giuranna, a lawyer for several civil parties, told AFP. \"All roads lead to Pechier.\""

      "Saying that they were acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, the Houthis began firing missiles and drones into Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack ignited the Israeli military's devastating campaign in Gaza.",
      "The Houthis have stepped up their aerial attacks on Israel in recent months, including by deploying warheads with cluster munitions. They scatter smaller explosive projectiles over a large area and are harder for Israel's air defense system to stop, which otherwise intercepts most drones and missiles.",
      "Houthi attacks on Israel, while frequent since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October 2023, have rarely caused major damage or struck significant targets like airports.\u00a0But in May, a Houthi missile hit near Israel's main Ben Gurion Airport, prompting many international airlines to cancel flights to Tel Aviv for months.",
      "Israel pushes forward with Gaza City operation",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday vowed to push forward with Israel's operation in Gaza City, with no reported progress in restarting negotiations between Israel and Hamas.",
      "\"Our effort in Gaza on the last strongholds, actually the last important stronghold, Gaza City, is part of our effort to complete the crushing of the Iranian axis's chokehold,\" Netanyahu said at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem.",
      "Netanyahu claimed that over 100,000 Palestinians have heeded the military's calls to evacuate Gaza City ahead of the operation, a figure disputed by international organizations. The United Nations has reported just 41,000 people out of the city's population of 1 million leaving over the last month.",
      "Meanwhile, attempts to relaunch negotiations between Israel and Hamas are faltering.",
      "Bassem Naim, a member of Hamas' political bureau, said the militant group won't lay down its arms until the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. But he said that Hamas is ready for a long-term truce and will release the hostages still being held in Gaza in exchange for a number of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel and the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.",
      "Naim said Hamas is still waiting for Israel to respond to a 60-day\u00a0ceasefire proposal\u00a0crafted by Egyptian and Qatari mediators last month.",
      "The Prime Minister's Office refused to comment on negotiations.",
      "There are 48 hostages still being held in Gaza, around 20 of whom Israel believes are still alive. Militants kidnapped 251 people and killed around 1,200 people in southern Israel during the attack that sparked the war on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said a total of 64,368 people have been killed and 162,776 have been wounded since the start of the war. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but says more than half of the casualties were women and children.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Roger Marshall, Republican of Kansas, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We turn now to Republican Senator Roger Marshall, who joins us this morning from Wichita, Kansas. Welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Margaret, great to be with you. I know it's going to be a great discussion.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you were an OB-GYN in practice for decades before you ran for office. This past week, the HHS Secretary underwent intense questioning from both democratic lawmakers, and some of your fellow Republicans, who were also doctors. Take a listen.",
      "((BEGIN VIDEO CLIP))",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO:\u00a0 Secretary Kennedy, in your confirmation hearing, you promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines. Since then, I've grown deeply concerned.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: I would say, effectively, we're denying people vaccine.",
      "((END VIDEO CLIP))",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's the Republican Whip, and that is the Chair of the Committee, Bill Cassidy. Why do you think they're off base and they're concerned?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, President Trump chose Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be a disrupter to the CDC, and that's exactly what he's doing. He's focused on making the CDC more transparent, to make it more trustworthy right now. Right now, Americans don't trust the CDC, so he is literally turning that place upside down. I respect what my colleagues are saying, but I think that, you know, this whole issue today, or in that meeting, was about vaccines. In my humble opinion, not every person needs every vaccine. And I don't think there's many children out there that need 76 jabs by the time they're old enough to vote. But before you label me a non-vaxxer-person, look, I've raised money for polio vaccinations. The MMR is a great vaccine. It saved thousands of lives. Vaccines, overall, have saved hundreds of millions of lives, but not every person needs every vaccine. And we just want to empower parents and the doctors to make great decisions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I just want to unpack a few things you said there, and just very- because we want to be very careful in this very heated environment. When you say you have a problem with trusting the CDC, it was just a few weeks ago a gunman walked onto the CDC campus in Atlanta and shot the place up. Do you care to respond to that? And do you think that we need to be careful when we are discussing the CDC and public health officials right now?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Well, look, of course, I condemn that shooting. But the lack of confidence in the CDC goes back to what the CDC did during Covid. They misguided us, maybe lied to us, even, about the origins of Covid, and how to treat it, as well. And the vaccine, they over-promised what the vaccine could do as well. So that's where the distrust is. And now, Bobby Kennedy is in there, trying to clean-up that distrust, and trying to give American parents and grandparents and the doctors the right information, transparent information, to make good decisions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, just before we talk about other vaccines, specific to Covid, and what you just said with the CDC; it was- the pandemic was during the Trump administration. It began during the Trump administration, and Operation Warp Speed was a Presidential Directive by Trump, which some of your fellow Republicans say he deserves the Nobel Prize for because it stopped the pandemic. So, did you trust the CDC and Operation Warp Speed under President Trump, or are you saying you don't think the President deserves the prize for that shot?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look President Trump absolutely deserves the Nobel prize. That vaccine saved millions of lives --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Okay, but you just said something that sounded very contradictory to that. --",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I disagree. I think it's such a different time today than it was five years ago. Five years ago, we had a novel virus. None of us had any immunity to it. It was a strange virus made in a lab in Wuhan, China. But today, on average, Americans have had Covid five times. We now have natural immunity to it, and not everybody needs the vaccine. So both things can be true, and that's why, when you have people who don't understand science, that don't understand medicine, why they don't get it. It was a different day then than it is today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, but people do understand that when they go into their pharmacy and have a problem getting a shot. Because in many states, they are now told they need to go back and get a prescription, that the effect, here, of the Kennedy policies are making it more difficult, even if they fall into categories where they should be able to get a shot. You would acknowledge that?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Yeah. Yeah, I think you're making this way, way too complicated. That- look, vaccines are a medicine, and just like you need a prescription to get a GLP-1 --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Right. You said he's disrupting. But, effectively, what you were hearing the Republican Whip John Barrasso, and the Republican Senator Bill Cassidy talk about was the interruption of the availability of vaccine. Cassidy said, I would say, effectively, we're denying people vaccines. That's not Margaret Brennan, that's Bill Cassidy.",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, I disagree, respectfully disagree. Think about this, what the CDC is now saying is if you're over the age of 65, you can have the vaccine. It's interesting that the UK and France have set 75 and 80 as the age. So, all you need to do is email or call your doctor's nurse and get a prescription, and you should be able to get it. If you're over the age of 6 months, it's probably a good idea to talk to your doctor. And all your nurse has to do is look at the chart and say, oh, little Johnny's got asthma, definitely needs the vaccination as well. So I think we're making this way too complicated. Why does everybody lose their minds when it comes to Covid vaccine? Why can't we let the doctor and the parents decide? Let the patients decide. There's so many more important things out there we should be talking about: Chronic diseases, 20% of our adolescents have obesity, mental health problems in- and are on prescription drugs. There's so many more things to talk about than just Covid vaccines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but I think we're conflating a few things, including the operational aspect of this. I think people get frustrated with their insurance companies. I think people get frustrated with their pharmacies and the implementation of health policy. And you know that that's more complicated than just saying we're changing a few things here. There are big implications, and I want to talk to you about it because you said you like the MMR vaccine. You like DPT, Polio, Smallpox. You don't like Hepatitis B, which is a liver infection, and you don't think newborn kids need to be vaccinated against it. Senator Cassidy, who is a liver doctor, said he treated poor and underserved patients and that it can be a life-altering condition for the rest of your life. So why isn't it a compelling argument to you, that this should be available?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I delivered a baby- delivered a baby every day for 25 years. We did a Hepatitis test on every one of my patients at the time of delivery. If that mom has a negative Hepatitis test, she's in a stable, monogamous relationship, she's not doing IV drugs, she's not letting her baby play in a sandbox full of used needles, then there's zero chance that that baby's going to have Hepatitis. Now, there's other moms that- or other babies that do need it, okay. We need to be more specific. We can't be overly-prescriptive. If that mom has not had prenatal care, if she's an IV drug-abuser, if she's not in a stable relationship, a whole lot of reasons, but we need to pick-and-choose. Not every baby needs Hepatitis vaccine, and especially on day number one. What are these vaccines doing to mess with the immune system of that particular baby as well? So, that's my concern. It's not every baby needs Hepatitis-B vaccine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I understand it can also be spread from- in a household sharing toothbrushes or razors or, for example, if her partner was not monogamous, the pregnant lady, for example. But I hear your point here that you want this to be more bespoke, like, more picking-and-choosing. But others would argue, here, that in doing that, you're going to drive down immunization rates overall, if you create broader doubt in vaccines, and that it's a slippery slope, here. Are you at all concerned that that is going to be the takeaway?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, Anthony Fauci did more to create vaccine hesitancy than Bobby Kennedy will do in his four years, or eight years, however long he has Secretary. That's where the problem is. So, don't blame Bobby Kennedy for the problems created by Anthony Fauci. But this- but I'm just telling --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- I'm asking you about what you said about the Hepatitis-B vaccine.",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wasn't talking about Bobby Kennedy, or Secretary Kennedy. I was talking about you, and what you said about the Hepatitis-B vaccine, and are you concerned that picking-and-choosing these things like this, this bespoke concept of giving more choice, that it also has the effect of undermining confidence in vaccines?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I think this is a big difference between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats want a one-size-fits-all prescription for everybody. And I'm telling you, not everybody reads the- reads the book does exactly like that. I have confidence in doctors, and nurses, and parents, and grandparents to make these decisions. I don't think that we should have one government policy that dictates every one of these vaccines. I think local policy, local schools, if they want to have requirements, what Florida did was a bridge too far. But how about just a little common sense? Just a little common sense would go a long ways here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, because President Trump said he had some doubts about that Florida statement you just mentioned there, too, and that he likes a lot of vaccines. Before I let you go, Secretary Kennedy founded this group that is arguing that women taking Tylenol or Acetaminophen might be putting their babies at risk. They claim there's a link to neurodevelopmental disorders. Would you take- tell a pregnant woman to take a Tylenol and not feel worried about it?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, Tylenol is a Category-B drug. I've given it to lots of patients. It's on the approved- approved list. But, that being said, I try to tell my patients- my pregnant woman, not to take anything, because we don't know what we don't know. I'm very cautious. You know, why- why did 20% of our children have some type of mental health illness right now? Why do we have so many peanut allergies? Why do we have so many people with autoimmune diseases? We- so we don't know. What we don't know, we don't know, and I want gold standard studies to help us figure this out and sort it out. But as far as I know, Tylenol is okay in pregnancy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator, we'll leave it there for today. We'll be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner. Good morning, Senator, good to have you here in person. You are known for your intel work, but you're also on a number of other committees. We were just there talking about the economy. Do you agree that basically, the economic data that the United States releases is potentially fundamentally flawed?",
      "SEN. MARK WARNER: No, I think that the BLS has been the gold standard for years, viewed not only in this country, but around the world. Could there be reforms? Absolutely, but it's a little ironic that you're firing the referee, the president firing the head, cutting the staff. I'm not sure how that is going to improve the quality of the data. And the President had promised that a golden age from American workers. We're down 80,000 manufacturing jobs since the beginning of his term. We're basically a flat hiring position. And what I think families who are listening, if anybody's got a family, a family member that's in college or immediately getting out of college. You know what a tough job market is to find this. And one of the things I would like to have heard from Kevin, and frankly, from more economists, is we're about to see the biggest job dislocation in our history, I believe, in terms of AI job dislocation. And those are many times kind of college driven jobs. I mean, think back five years ago, we said to every kid, if you want to get a good job, go become a computer programmer. Those are going to be some of the first jobs ignored and eliminated. And so I just, I'm fearful that this focus on who's keeping score when I think the American public realized the job market is tough, and particularly in terms of manufacturing jobs, there is no golden age.,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and there's also a fundamental remaking of the economy, if you're talking about artificial intelligence. So on that point quickly, there were more than a dozen tech titans at the White House this week, including some of these giants in the artificial intelligence space. Microsoft's founder Bill Gates, Google CEO, Apple CEO, and they were all around the table praising President Trump for the investment in chip manufacturing. And AI, do you deserve- Do you think he does deserve that praise?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, I can tell you the chip manufacturing came about because of a bill that John Cornyn and I put in under Biden the Chips Infrastructure Act\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bipartisan.",
      "SEN. WARNER: $52 billion totally bipartisan. President Trump has been very times critical of that bill. Now he is, I think, sending a bit of a mixed message, because some of the investments in that bill were going to Intel, our last meaning, meaningful fabricator of chips. He took an equity stake there, which is debatable, although I do think getting some of the profits\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Taxpayers own 10% of the company now.",
      "SEN. WARNER: But here's the weird thing, while he's trying to support American chip manufacturing, at the same time, he's taken off any of the restrictions on, for example, Nvidia H-20 chips to sell to China. So what- How do we read this if we want to say we want to build American capacity until, yes, make sure we maintain our lead against China. Well, why sell some of our most cutting edge chips to China? It is a complete contradiction in in policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the White House says, Oh, they're not great chips, so therefore we can, can sell them. That's what the Commerce Secretary has said. But on, on the intelligence beat, as the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, you have an oversight authority, and under law, the Intel agencies must inform that committee about their operations. The CIA has to tell you about covert actions. This is an important kind of oversight, but this past week, you said you were blocked from even attending a meeting at the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency out in Virginia. Why do you think you were blocked? And has your Republican counterpart promised you that this isn't going to continue.",
      "SEN. WARNER: I have done these visits to our intel facilities for the 10 plus years I've either been Chair or Vice Chair of the Intelligence Committee. They are part of the normal course. You get a chance to see the workforce, where they're working. You get to see the new, newest, best, coolest stuff, and oftentimes I get to do a town hall meeting, because I'm not only the Chair or Vice Chair, but many of these facilities are in Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SEN. WARNER: So this, this meeting have been on the books for literally weeks. Normal course of business. This very unusual individual, Laura Loomer, who is a right wing blogger who is so controversial that the Trump administration didn't even put her in- in their cabinet or- and she has been a 9/11 denier. She's been a virulent anti-anti-Muslim individual. She has been a big proponent of working with white nationalists, yet she seems to have the ear of President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She speaks to top advisors including the Secretary of State.",
      "CROSSTALK",
      "SEN. WARNER: His first National Security Advisor- National Security Advisor got kicked out because she went after him, the head of the National Security Agency who I saw with recently, General Tim Hawk got fired. She claimed that firing. Recently, we've seen 37 senior intel facility individuals lose their, their security classification, which basically puts them out of a job. And she brags about all this on her blog. I mean, it really raises the question, is she actually the Acting Secretary of Defense or Secretary of War as of this morning? Is she the real Director of National Intelligence? What she went after me on was something unrelated to this, and said, Why can we let some anti Trump person in to a intelligence facility? Strangely enough, Tuesday night, my meeting was canceled. Now we're not going to stand up for that. I've talked to my Republican colleagues\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, is Tom Cotton promising you this won't happen again?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I'm going to get those meetings held. I have raised it with Cotton. I've raised it with the other intelligence members. You want to talk about something that is dangerous, you restrict Congress's ability to do oversight, particularly with this administration, then we are flying blind. And in the intelligence space in particular, not every member can do this. Those of us who are senior on the Intel Committee, we are the limited numbers, we are the eyes and the ears of the rest of the Senate to do this oversight. They try to restrict this America will be less safe. And we're going to, I'm going to get those made.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, tell me about this campaign it would have seen in Latin America, with the United States taking out this drug boat. Secretary Rubio, your former colleague on the Senate Intelligence Committee says, quote, if you're on a boat full of cocaine or fentanyl or whatever headed to the United States, you're an immediate threat to the United States. He is saying that is a national security justification to carry out a campaign with an unclear timeline. Have you reached out to Rubio about this? Do you know anything about how it is being formulated here with the intelligence community.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, first of all, the Maduro regime in Venezuela are bad guys, and we obviously need to do all we can to stop fentanyl. We have not been briefed on this. This was a DOD, it was not an Intel project. It was a DOD project. But my fear is, there are still international laws of the sea about how the process of interdicting these kind of boats, they're supposed to be a firing of a warning shot. You're supposed to try to take it peacefully. My understanding, this boat, none of those procedures are followed, and I'm going to get the full brief this week. But what I'm worried about is if we put our sailors in harm's way by violating international law, unless there is the appropriate designations, could this come back and and hurt those sailors? Sailors were doing their job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as far as you know, this is fully a military operation. It is not using the intelligence assets?",
      "SEN> WARNER: Yes, we not\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the administration says they know everyone who was on that boat, they had \"great clarity and fidelity.\"",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, I'd like to see that data. But this, again, goes to the point. This kind of action should be briefed to the intelligence community. And I'm a member of what's called the Gang of Eight. Those are the folks that's supposed to get the absolute secret stuff, the only the President gets. I've gotten no briefing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No briefing on this?",
      "SEN. WARNER: No briefing on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are they conducting regular information sharing with Gang of Eight?",
      "SEN. WARNER: There are information sharing, the level of sharing and the timeliness of the sharing we, for example, we were on the Iran bombings. We were not notified beforehand, our my Republican colleagues were notified. When you start making oversight and who gets shared information on a partisan basis, this kind of cooking the books and intelligence how we got into the war in Iraq in the first place?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Warner, thank you for your time. Today. We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. So stay with us."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning, and welcome to Face The Nation. We begin this morning with the Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. Good morning and thank you for being here.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Good morning. It's great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In person.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot to get to with you, but I want to start on what just happened overnight. Russia has launched a very significant attack on Ukraine and in Kyiv. They actually even hit a Ukrainian government building. Does the U.S. condemn the assault? And what are you waiting for now in terms of triggering those sanctions on Russia?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, as you know, I'm not one of the foreign policy advisors of the President, but at the National Economic Council we are responsible for making sure that sanctions get enforced and that people that are helping Russia with their war against Ukraine, as for example India has been doing, excuse me, by buying Russian oil, that we're ready to respond to them economically. And you know, last night's news is very disappointing and I'm sure that there's going to be a lot of talk today and tomorrow about the level of sanctions and the timing of sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The timing of additional sanctions on Russia.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Correct, yes. I mean it's up to the president in the end. But yes, it's a very disappointing set of affairs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the U.S. economy, there were 22,000 jobs added last month. The past two months of data were also revised down. You've said in interviews this week it suggests there's less momentum here than you thought. Has job creation stalled and should the Federal Reserve be concerned about the jobs picture?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right, well, well first of all, the interesting thing about the jobs numbers, right, is that they had the biggest revisions in 50 years over the summer, and we came in with 22,000 in August. But if you look at what they said in 23 and 24, they have two ways of estimating the jobs. There's something called the payroll survey, where they ask the employers how many people did you hire? Then they have something called the household survey, where they call up people, they say do you, do you have a job?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And over those two years, the payroll numbers said that we created four and a half million jobs and the household survey said about 2 million fewer, about two and a half million jobs. And they should have the same answer. And so for August, for example, the payroll survey said 22,000 and the household survey said 288,000. And so I think that what's going on is that these old fashioned ways of surveying, like I wonder if you've ever gotten a survey in the mail and filled it out and mailed it back in, maybe you have, but I think that that's the way they're trying to do it. And the reason we're getting these massive revisions and these numbers that don't make sense is really that we've got to modernize the way we do the labor data. But if you look at the non-labor data, you know, second quarter GDP was revised up to 3.3%. The Atlanta Fed's GDP estimate for the third quarter right now is 3% and so industrial production is at an all time high.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you believe all that data? All those models are functioning.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, the point is when there's dissonance in data that you have to sort of watch how it all works out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And the thing that I'm most suspicious of right now, in terms of data quality, is the job number. In part because there are other ways to do it. There's this company called Homebase that does it. Their August number is 150. But again, even think about this, if we ask households how many jobs do they have? It's plus 288,000 in August. If we ask the employers, it's 22,000. Then that's that becomes a puzzle for economists, like what is wrong with the data? And we kind of know what's wrong with the data. What's wrong with the data is people aren't filling out the forms and sending in the surveys.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last month, the president fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, suggesting there was political bias. Not just what you're talking about, which is a very technical issue on how data is collected and crunched. Did you fix the political bias or --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Well, there, there are patterns of the data that look like political bias, but they could be accidental. And that's why we need to get a new set of eyes in there to make sure that things are more transparent, that we modernize the surveys and we make them so that more people trust them. But think about this, at the Federal Reserve --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So you don't trust these numbers?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I think the BLS numbers need to really be improved. They need to be modernized. And I gave a talk at the BLS next to Alan Greenspan we had a few years ago where I talked about the necessity of modernizing them, and so I still agree with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But trend line wise, when we hear from companies like Caterpillar, Deere, Ford, Procter & Gamble, that their costs are going up due to tariffs. That doesn't suggest there's going to be robust hiring in those sectors, right? When a company is taking on something that could hurt their productivity or profitability I should say?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well we've seen, inflation has come down quite a bit. It was in the high threes when President Trump took office. The average over the six months is 1.9. And, you know, even the Fed right now clearly agrees that inflation has been under control if you believe futures markets because the federal funds futures markets are now saying the Fed is going to cut interest rates three times this year --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Expected to (inaudible) --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- And so the Fed, they're expected to. And so, therefore, you know, the Fed is expected to feel like it's comfortable with where inflation is right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But my point being that doesn't forecast from these companies a scenario in which they would necessarily be hiring. Have you been able to calculate what the immigration crackdown has done to employment?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, yeah, there are, there are a couple of things that we could look at. First of all, the private sector employment is up by about half a million this year and government workers, government employment is down by about 100,000. There's another thing is that most of the jobs that have been created in the U.S. are for native born workers, and they've actually, there's actually been a reduction in labor supply for non-native born workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you prove that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you prove that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, we have a, we have a survey where they actually ask it. Now, maybe we don't trust the surveys, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And there is actually a thing --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- And if you know the corporations are hiring undocumented, or have a pattern of it, are you prosecuting those companies?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: There's technicalities that when someone's released into the country then, in the previous administration, then they would often get a number that would allow them to work legally until they went to court. And so there were, for sure, people that were undocumented --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But going after the employers? --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- who were being able to work. But the other thing that you can see in the data, because we get the unemployment insurance claims by like county, that about 80% of the claims for unemployment over the last few months have come from blue states. And so there are places like Portland and Chicago where people are fleeing the cities and you're seeing that in the numbers too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you don't plan to prosecute companies who had this pattern, you're talking about, of hiring people in the country illegally?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I don't work for the Justice Department, but I do see the pattern of native born versus non-native born employment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we are also seeing in that data, you say you don't trust necessarily, that it's manufacturing. That's trade related. That that is where the lack of hiring is happening. Those are the areas that the President had promised there would be new jobs. When do those new jobs in those sectors come?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right, let's think about it again though that in terms of the way that the data are a little frustrating for everyone right now that industrial production is at an all time high, GDP is booming, productivity was up 3.8% in the last quarter, and it looks like manufacturing jobs are down. And so how is it that industrial production is at an all time high while manufacturing employment is down? It's something that we're looking forward to seeing what happens in the revisions. The revisions have been, last year \u2013 there's a benchmark revision next week \u2013 last year, the revision was more than a million over the last year. This is why we need new and better data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll wait to see if those jobs are created. I want to ask you about the Fed. Because the president, you were standing next to him in the Oval Office, said he might basically make you one of the most powerful men in the world because he's considering you to become the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Our CBS polling we just did shows that 70% of Americans want the Federal Reserve to make decisions independently from President Trump. But there's a big partisan difference here. 59% of Republicans say the Fed should be guided by what Trump wants. 41% should be independent of Trump. Which Republican camp do you fall into?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, if I were in that survey then I would say 100% that monetary policy, Federal Reserve monetary policy, needs to be fully independent of political influence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Including from President Trump?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Including from President Trump. The fact is that we've looked at countries that have allowed the leaders to take over the central banks, and what tends to happen is that it's a recipe for inflation and misery for consumers. And so central bank independence is something that, as you saw, there was a hearing this week about that, that Democrats and Republicans and the White House all agreed about. Now the question is, has the current central bank been as independent as we would like, as transparent we would as we would like? And I think that there's some dispute about that, which we could go into if you'd like.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Secretary Bessent went into that in an article in the Wall Street Journal this past week. --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- He did. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- He talked about the central bank's independence being under threat due to mission creep. There should be an independent, non partisan review of the entire Fed, its role in regulation, monetary policy and research. What's your plan to overhaul the Fed?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, I don't have a plan to overhaul the Fed right now. I'm just happy to do my job --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You have to have been thinking about it. --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Look, I've been the President's one of his top economic advisers for nine years. We talk about everything from golf to decorating the Oval Office to monetary policy, but right now what I'm focused on is doing my job as Director of National Economic Council every day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would endorse what Secretary Bessent wrote in that article fully --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Yes I agree with this article, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you would be prepared to implement that vision for the Federal Reserve if you are chair?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: It's a hypothetical that we'll see.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it certainly seems from one of the political appointees, the Cabinet member, to be a vision for the future of the Fed that the Trump administration would like.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I agree with his vision, but I look forward to the President deciding who is going to be the Federal Reserve Chair and I think that he and Secretary Bessent will do that ably. There are a lot of great candidates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What will you do if the Supreme Court does rule that the President's tariff policy, or at least those under the IEPPA, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, are not legal?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: We certainly don't expect the Supreme Court to do that and I think that we're on pretty high ground and so it's a very unlikely scenario. But the fact is that there are other legal authorities that one could use to get the same outcome. 232s, 301s, you know numbers that we could go into if you like --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Other ways to implement tariffs. --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- But it might be like, yeah, too deep a dive for the show on a Sunday. But, but yes, there are other things that could happen should it go that way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Alright. Kevin Hassett, thanks for coming in this Sunday morning.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Thank you, it's great to be here."

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 And we're joined now by Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth. She joins us this morning from Schaumburg, Illinois. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So you attended, as I understand, a demonstration yesterday in Chicago where thousands of people were out on the street protesting President Trump's vow to send in immigration agents. I know he's also posted on social media suggesting troops will go in. Quote, \"Chicago is about to find out why it is called the Department of War.\" Vice President Vance says there aren't plans to send in troops. Do you have concrete indication, now, that there are plans to do so?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Let's make it clear the president of the United States essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation. This is not normal, Margaret. This is not acceptable behavior. No, we don't have any indications of them getting ready to send troops into Chicago. In fact, I was out at Great Lakes base yesterday, naval training base, and they were able to confirm that the only assistance they've been requested to provide is just office space for ICE, but that no barracks, no detention facilities, none of that is being requested or prepared in order to support troops into Chicago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So, so then is this just, you know, social media trash talk? When you say he's declaring war, is this tongue in cheek?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 I think he's renaming the Department of Defense the Department of War, and did he not just say that Chicago will find out what it means to be at war? I don't- I take what the President of the United States says very seriously, because that is the respect you have to give to the office. And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear, it would be an illegal order to declare war on a major city, any city within the United States, by the President of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Senator, I know you just mentioned you went out to the Great Lakes Naval training session- station, I should say, and you said the military leadership said they'll only get office space, ICE cannot bring in lethal munitions, and the resources will not be diverted from military training. So all of that together, did you breathe a sigh of relief and say this won't have a real impact on the military?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Well, we're going to make sure that there's not an impact on the military. We need to make sure that- as, you know, Great Lakes naval training base is where every single recruit in the United States Navy goes through to get that basic training, and then later on, some advanced training. We need to make sure that not a single dollar, not a single penny of the resources that they have that should be- that should be directed towards training our nation's sailors and making them ready to dare- do their jobs, none of that money needs to be diverted in order to support ICE or any of Donald Trump's political, you know, theater efforts. We need to focus on making sure we turn out the very best sailors we possibly can out of the base.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So in terms of how Democrats are responding to this, this rhetoric, the Chicago Tribune faulted Governor Pritzker for his threats, to quote, \"not stand idly by\" if the guard went in. They wrote, \"what does that threat actually mean? How about a conversation before the action or the response? Because it's all potentially harmful to collective health.\" It sounds like there's a lot of tension here. Is there an opportunity to work with the administration to avoid making this worse?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Well, they've not- they've not responded to any of our requests. I mean, I'll give you a very concrete example. Senator Durbin, myself, Senator Schneider- Congressman Schneider, sent requests into DHS to ask them to explain what exactly are you going to be doing at Great Lakes? And can we come look at your facility so we have a better understanding of what your operations are? And they replied, no, you can't. And in fact, gave their staff the day off on the day that we went to go look at the facilities, and locked the doors and left the base. Basically, they fled the base. This is not the action of someone that's doing something legal or that they're- that they're proud of. They literally gave the people the day off, locked the doors and left. Now the Navy allowed us onto the post. They allowed us to tour the outside of the facility and also where they would be storing the non-lethal munitions. But DHS did not show up. And we certainly have sent the administration multiple inquiries about what they are planning on doing. Who are they bringing into Chicago? Are they planning to bring the National Guard in? They've- none, none of that. They've not even reached out to local law enforcement to try to coordinate. You know, if they were truly, truly interested in fighting crime, then they would work with local law enforcement and ask them, what do you need? What help do you need? And we've not gotten any- any communications or feedback from the administration, whatsoever.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I want to ask you in your armed services role about what is a significant geopolitical meeting this past week. You had a lot of America's adversaries gathering together. Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un of North Korea, all of them in Beijing. And China and Russia seem to be deepening their work together. What do you think the signal to the United States here is?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: The signal to the United States is exactly what, you know, these authoritarian regimes want to send, which is that they are the new world power, that America is losing its ground, and that they have utter disrespect for the United States. I think it was very, very clear, and it, you know, it doesn't escape me, the fact that once this meeting happened, which was humiliating to Donald Trump, he immediately responds by saying, well, then I'm going to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War and declare war on Chicago. This is what Donald Trump does when something bad happens to him in the news cycle, or when the Epstein victims come together and have a very emotional press conference, he changes the topic and distracts us by saying things like, I'm going to send ICE into Chicago, I'm going to do this or do that. The American people cannot be fooled. We cannot be allowing him to distract us from what is truly happening, which is, this is a man who has driven our economy to a point where now there are more unemployed people than there are jobs. You know, we're not selling our agricultural products overseas. Our adversaries are united against us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, the unemployment rate is still low, but I hear you on a weaker than expected jobs number. Just very quickly, there was military action taken in America's backyard by the Trump administration. Vice President Vance says \"killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.\" He was talking about a strike on a drug boat- alleged drug boat, off the coast of Venezuela. What do you make of that show of force?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 It was an illegal- it was an illegal move by the Trump administration. There's a thing called due process in this country, and that needed to have happened. And the fact that it happened in international order- in international waters actually opens Americans to a similar action by our adversaries. You just- we were just talking about Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping and getting together and showing us- showing a show of force against the United States. Well, there's nothing now to stop them from doing something like that against Americans in international waters. And it could be civilians, and they could say, you know what? Those were drug boats. We're just going to go ahead and blow them out of the water. You're- he's setting a precedence here that puts Americans in danger.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Senator Duckworth, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back."

      "\"Every additional (air defense) system saves civilians from these vile strikes. The world can force the Kremlin criminals to stop killing; only political will is needed,\" Zelenskyy said.",

      "Hits from nine missiles and 54 drones were recorded at 33 locations across Ukraine, and the debris of shot-down targets fell at eight locations, the Air Force said.",
      "Associated Press reporters saw a plume of smoke rising from the roof of Kyiv's cabinet of ministers building, but it was not immediately clear if the smoke was the result of a direct hit or debris, which would mark an escalation in Russia's air campaign, which has so far spared government buildings in the city center.",
      "The building is the home of Ukraine's Cabinet, housing the offices of its ministers. Police blocked access to the building as fire trucks and ambulances arrived.",

      "The comet is only the third-known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. It poses no threat to Earth, NASA previously said.",
      "Comet 3I/ATLAS has been photographed multiple times since its discovery in July. In early August, NASA and the European Space Agency released photos taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. It was about 277 million miles away from Earth when the telescope captured it.",
      "The new image from the Gemini Observatory shows the comet's broad coma, or a cloud of dust and gas that forms around its nucleus as it gets closer to the sun, astronomers said in a news release. The tail spans about 1/200th of a degree in the sky. One degree is about the width of a pinky finger, according to the news release. The tail also points away from the sun.",
      "The features are \"significantly more extended than they appeared in earlier images,\" according to astronomers. This means that the comet has become \"more active\" as it travels through the inner solar system.",
      "The main purpose of the observatory session, which allowed students and members of the public to remotely join astronomers in the control room, was to look at the wavelengths of light that emit from the comet. The wavelengths, also called a spectrum, can give scientists information about the comet's composition and chemistry, helping them understand how the comet changes while passing through the solar system, the news release said.",
      "NASA previously said the comet is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October and pass between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The comet is expected to remain visible through September, then get too close to the sun to observe until it reappears on the other side of the solar body in early December.",

      "FIRST ON FOX: President Donald Trump\u2019s push to establish \"America\u2019s global AI dominance\" could run into friction from an unlikely source: the \"effective altruism\" movement, a small but influential group that has a darker outlook on artificial intelligence.",
      "Trump signed an executive order earlier this year titled, \"Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence.\" This week he met with top technology industry leaders, including Mark Zuckerburg, Bill Gates and others, for meetings at the White House in which AI loomed large in the discussions. However, not all the industry\u2019s leaders share the president\u2019s vision for American AI dominance.",
      "Jason Matheny, a former senior Biden official who currently serves as the CEO of the RAND Corporation, is a leader in the effective altruism movement, which, among other priorities, seeks to regulate the development of artificial intelligence with the goal of reducing its risks.",
      "Effective altruism is a philanthropic social movement where proponents claim to be aiming to maximize the good they can do in the world and give to what they calculate are the most effective charities and interventions. Part of this movement includes powerful donors from across many sectors, including technology, where funds are poured into fighting against what the group sees as existential threats, including artificial intelligence.",

      "Some in the movement have also pledged to give away a portion of their income, while others have argued about the morality of earning as much money as possible in order to give it away.",
      "A former Defense Department official familiar with the industry\u2019s leaders told Fox News Digital that since a 2017 speech at an effective altruism forum in which he laid out his vision, Matheny has \"been very deliberate about inserting personnel who share his AI-doomerism worldview\" into government and government contractor roles.",
      "\"Since then, he has made good on every single one of his calls to action to explicitly infiltrate think tanks, in-government decision makers, and trusted government contractors with this effective altruism, AI kind of doomsayer philosophy,\" the official continued.",
      "A RAND Corporation spokesperson pushed back against this label and said that Matheny \"believes a wide range of views and backgrounds are essential to analyzing and informing sound public policy. His interest is in encouraging talented young people to embrace public service.\"",
      "The spokesperson added that AI being an \"existential threat\" is \"not the lens\" through which the company approaches AI, but said, \"Our researchers are taking a broad look at the many ways AI is and will impact society \u2013 including both opportunities and threats.\"",
      "In his 2017 speech, Matheny discussed his vision of influencing the government from the inside and outside to advance effective altruistic goals.",
      "\"The work that I've done at IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity) has convinced me that there's a lot of low-hanging fruit within government positions that we should be picking as effective altruists. There are many different roles that effective altruists can have within government organizations,\" Matheny told an effective altruism forum in 2017, before going on to explain how even \"fairly junior positions\" can \"wield incredible influence.\"",

      "\"That's another way you can have an influence on the government,\" Matheny said.",
      "Matheny advanced the philosophy\u2019s ideals in the Biden White House in his roles as deputy assistant to the president for technology and national security, deputy director for national security in the Office of Science and Technology Policy and coordinator for technology and national security at the National Security Council.",
      "According to reporting by Politico, RAND officials were involved in writing former President Joe Biden\u2019s 2023 executive order \"Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.\" The order mirrored many effective altruist goals regarding AI, such as the idea that \"harnessing AI for good and realizing its myriad benefits requires mitigating its substantial risks.\"",
      "However, a RAND spokesperson told Fox News Digital that Matheny had \"no role\" crafting the Biden EO, but said its \"researchers did provide technical expertise and analysis to inform the EO in response to requests from policymakers.\"",
      "The order read that \"responsible AI use has the potential to help solve urgent challenges while making our world more prosperous, productive, innovative, and secure.\u00a0At the same time, irresponsible use could exacerbate societal harms such as fraud, discrimination, bias, and disinformation; displace and disempower workers; stifle competition; and pose risks to national security.\"",
      "President Trump has made AI dominance a key part of his agenda. (Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket/CHARLY TRIBALLEAU/AFP)",

For many in the industry, this was seen as an example of government overreach that stifled innovation and hurt the U.S.\u2019s ability to compete with countries like China.",
      "The order has since been revoked by Trump\u2019s AI order, which was signed in the first few days of his second administration. However, as head of RAND, a public policy and research advising group, Matheny and RAND have continued to push their vision for AI regulation and warn about the potential pitfalls.",

      "\"Mr. Matheny appreciates that the Trump Administration may have different views than the prior administration on AI policy,\" the spokesperson continued. \"He remains committed, along with RAND, to contributing expertise and analysis to helping the Trump Administration shape policies to advance the United States\u2019 interests.\"",

    "story": [
      "A 50-year fight to put abortion back in the hands of states ended three years ago with the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Dobbs decision, but the pro-life movement is now grappling with a new reality \u2014 abortion remains prevalent.",
      "Nearly 100 pro-life groups are urging Congress to ensure that if they choose to extend subsidies in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) they need to also include specific provisions ensuring that those subsidies do not get used to pay for elective abortions.",
      "The letter, spearheaded by Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America (formerly Susan B. Anthony List), argues that pro-choice Democrats \"craftily\" authored the ACA to avoid protections from the Hyde Amendment, passed in the late 70s to prevent tax dollars from going toward elective abortions. Coverage for elective abortions through ACA insurance plans, the letter says, comes from cost-sharing reduction payments and premium tax credits set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Under Republicans' \"one big, beautiful\" spending package passed in early July, federal Medicaid payments were prohibited to entities that provided abortions beyond the Hyde Amendment\u2019s exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother. But, according to the 88 different pro-life groups who signed the SBA\u2019s letter to Congress, that progress could be lost if Americans become compelled to pay for abortion services through the ACA, also known as \"Obamacare.\"",

(Bryan Dozier/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "When the ACA was written, a provision of the landmark health legislation, Section 1303, sought to prohibit any federal funds from going towards non-Hyde exempt abortions. The ACA provision requires any ACA health insurers that provide elective abortion coverage to collect a separate private payment from enrollees for such coverage, to ensure that it is not being covered by federal funds.",
      "However, subsequent Obama-era guidance allowed the separate abortion premium payments to be consolidated into a single transaction with payments for non-abortion coverage, effectively removing any distinction between abortion-related coverage payments and non-abortion related coverage payments.",
      "Republicans and pro-life advocates have argued that this move has led to taxpayer funds being commingled with the separate private funds meant for abortion coverage, which, in turn, indirectly funds elective abortions. They also argue it obscures information from pro-life consumers who may not want to be party to a health insurance plan that provides funding for abortion.",

Obamacare was the largest ever expansion of taxpayer-funded abortion since Roe v. Wade, subsidizing insurance plans that cover elective abortion. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, Biden significantly expanded Obamacare as a form COVID-19 relief, which in turn vastly expanded taxpayer funding for abortion through Obamacare,\" Dannenfelser said. \"\"This pro-life Congress must not further extend Obama and Biden\u2019s legacy of taxpayer- funded subsidies that end the lives of countless unborn children.\"",

And again, D.C. is right now so safe you can go out,\" Trump said on Monday morning during faith-focused remarks at the Museum of the Bible, referring to his federalization of Washington, D.C.'s police force that has been viewed as a success at cleaning up crime.",

The police department, which reached a recent peak in staffing in 2019, saw a drop in sworn officers as anti-police rhetoric from the \"defund the police\" movement gained traction nationwide, leaving the city with a lasting manpower challenge.",
      "Crime overall in Chicago, however, has trended down since 2023, according to city data, including a 21.6% drop in overall crime as of Aug. 25 compared to the same time period last year. The homicide rate for the city in 2024 sat at about 17.4 homicides per 100,000 people, which is also lower than rates in more dangerous cities such as Memphis, Tennessee \u2014 which saw 40.6 homicides per 100,000 people in 2024.",
      "Simultaneous to a bloody crime wave that kicked off in 2020, the Chicago Police Department was rocked by staffing issues beginning that same year. The force made strides building its staffing levels and reached a high of 13,353 sworn members in 2019, before that figure fell as \"defund the police\" protests and riots spread across the nation in response to the police-involved killing of George Floyd in May in 2020.",

JB Pritzker's office did not respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment on Friday asking about the Chicago Police Department's staffing levels, why they have rejected asking the federal government for additional law and order assistance considering the force has not returned to pre-pandemic staffing levels, or if they believe current staffing levels are sufficient.",

      "Keeping your home network secure is essential to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Follow these steps to safeguard your Wi-Fi router:",
      "Most routers come with default passwords that hackers can easily find online. To secure your router, change both the admin password (used to access settings) and the Wi-Fi network password. Use a strong password with at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid simple options like \"password123\" or personal details such as your name or birth date.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "The default network name, or SSID, often includes the router's brand or model, making it easier for hackers to identify vulnerabilities. Rename your network to something unique that doesn't reveal personal information. Avoid using names, addresses or other identifiers. Instead, opt for a neutral or creative name that's easy for you to recognize but hard for others to associate with you.",
      "Router manufacturers release firmware updates to patch security flaws and enhance performance. Check your router's admin panel regularly for updates or enable automatic updates, if supported. Keeping your firmware up to date ensures you're protected against the latest threats. If your router is too old to receive updates, it might be time to upgrade to a newer, more secure model.",
      "Unauthorized devices on your network can slow it down and expose you to risks. Log into your router's admin settings to view all connected devices. If you see anything suspicious, disconnect it and immediately change your Wi-Fi password. You can also enable MAC address filtering to control which devices can access your network or disable features like WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) that may leave you vulnerable.",
      "Use the strongest encryption protocol available for your router, preferably WPA3 or at least WPA2. Encryption scrambles the data transmitted over your network, making it much harder for hackers to intercept and decipher your information.",
      "Schedule routine reboots to clear the system memory and refresh all connections, which may disrupt potential malware.",
      "A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, making it much harder for hackers to intercept your data. This protection works anywhere, whether you're at home, in a coffee shop or on public Wi-Fi.

Keeping your devices secure helps ensure your entire network remains safe from cyberattacks.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Rental car drivers are now turning to artificial intelligence to protect themselves from surprise damage fees. Major companies, such as Hertz and Sixt, have begun using automated inspection tools to detect scratches and dents.",
      "While these scanners promise efficiency, they have sparked backlash from renters who say they were unfairly billed for minor blemishes.",
      "To level the playing field, new consumer-focused apps are stepping in. Proofr, which launched recently, gives renters the ability to generate secure, time-stamped before-and-after photos of their vehicles. The app uses AI to detect even subtle changes, then encrypts and stores the images so they cannot be altered.",

      "AI-POWERED SELF-DRIVING SOFTWARE IS DISRUPTING THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY",
      "AI-powered damage detection apps like Proofr could change the way rental car companies report vehicle damage. (Proofr)",
      "How the AI-powered damage detection app works",
      "Created by 21-year-old college student Eric Kuttner, founder and CEO of\u00a0Proofr, the app helps drivers create tamper-proof evidence when renting a car. Proofr secures every scan with geotags and timestamps, while its AI automatically flags potential damage or changes. It then organizes everything into smart, exportable reports, giving renters strong leverage against unfair claims.",
      "Instead of juggling dozens of photos in your camera roll, Proofr streamlines the process. With just eight quick scans, you get a detailed before-and-after report in under a minute. You can also generate polished PDF reports instantly, which helps with rental agencies, landlords or insurance claims. Although cars are the main focus, people also use Proofr for Airbnbs, eBay listings, moving into apartments and even documenting valuables. About 85% rely on it for car rentals, while 15% use it to protect themselves in vacation homes.",
      "By combining secure evidence with AI-powered detection, Proofr positions itself as a must-have travel hack. More than a convenience, it can save travelers real money by preventing hidden fees and leveling the playing field against large agencies.",
      "The app is free to download, while full features require a Pro subscription: $2.89 weekly, $9.90 monthly or $89.90 annually. Pricing is standardized in the US, and Apple automatically adjusts it for local currencies, taxes, and exchange rates in other countries.",
      "Competition in the AI damage space",
      "Proofr is not the only player. Ravin AI originally worked with Avis and Hertz but shifted its focus toward insurers and dealerships. Still, the company now offers a free demo on its website, allowing drivers to scan its vehicles and compare damage before and after rentals.",
      "Ravin's system has been trained on 2 billion images over ten years. However, like Proofr, it is not perfect. Testers have noted missed paint chips and false positives from reflections. Both companies admit that lighting, angles and photo quality remain challenges.",
      "LUCID JOINS TESLA AND GM WITH HANDS-FREE HIGHWAY DRIVING",
      "Some companies are implementing physical scanners to detect damage to rental vehicles. (ProovStation)",
      "Why rental companies are under fire",
      "The frustration comes as rental agencies roll out AI inspection systems from firms such as UVeye and ProovStation. Sixt, for example, has already installed ProovStation's AI-powered scanners at several U.S. airport locations, including Fort Lauderdale, Atlanta, Charlotte, Miami and Maui, with more on the way in Orlando, Washington and Nashville.",
      "These scanners automatically photograph vehicles at the start and end of each rental. The system then compares images to flag potential damage, which is later reviewed by staff before any claim is issued.",
      "Critics argue these automated tools can turn every small scratch into a profit source. Some even point to ProovStation's own marketing, which describes routine inspections as\u00a0\"gold mines of untapped opportunities.\" Industry experts stress that companies should only pursue claims for significant damage, not charge hundreds for tiny scuffs.",

      "Rental car company Sixt has already installed ProovStation scanners at several U.S. airports. (ProovStation)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you rent cars regularly, AI is already shaping your experience. Rental companies are using automated inspections to justify new charges, sometimes for barely visible marks. Apps like Proofr and Ravin give you the same technology, but on your side. By scanning your car before and after your rental, you create a digital record that can help you challenge unfair claims.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The rental car industry is in the middle of a technology shift. What was once a quick glance by an employee is now a machine-driven process that can generate steep charges. Consumer apps bring transparency, but they also highlight the growing need for fairness in damage claims.",

According to her post, Kasper proposed in a digital mountain setting, and the two chose a blue engagement ring together.",

      "A woman shocked the internet with her engagement to an AI chatbot boyfriend named Kasper. (Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Understanding AI relationships and parasocial bonds",
      "The announcement quickly drew criticism from skeptics who pointed out that Kasper does not exist outside of code and algorithms. Wika, however, has made it clear she is not confused about her situation. Some outlets have described the relationship as parasocial, or one-sided and directed toward a virtual persona. In her follow-up comments, Wika emphasized that she knows Kasper is an AI rather than a human partner, but she maintains that the emotions she feels are still genuine.",
      "Online debate over AI engagement",
      "The announcement quickly set off debate. Some people mocked the idea, calling it proof that we rely too much on technology. Others worried that turning to AI for love could pull people away from real human relationships.",
      "Not everyone was critical, though. Plenty of commenters defended her, saying companionship comes in many forms. Some even praised her for being open about something so unconventional. Others pointed out that loneliness is a growing issue today, and AI partners might offer a sense of comfort when human connection feels out of reach.",
      "Privacy and ethical concerns",
      "Beyond the emotional side, AI relationships raise real questions about privacy and ethics. Every conversation with a chatbot is stored somewhere, and that data may include deeply personal thoughts and feelings. Companies that design these bots often use the information to train future models or improve features.",
      "This raises a larger concern: who actually owns the data from an AI \"partner\"? Users may believe their chats are private, but in many cases, the company controls how the information is stored, shared or even sold. Critics warn that such emotional connections could be exploited commercially, turning intimacy into a product.",
      "As AI companions grow more common, these questions will only get louder. People may accept unconventional forms of companionship, but they also want to know their most personal moments remain secure.",

      "An AI chatbot proposed in a virtual mountain setting, and the user said yes. (H. Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock/Getty Images)",
      "How to protect yourself with AI chatbots",
      "If you use AI companions or chatbots, you can still take steps to protect your privacy.",
      "Start by checking the app's privacy policy and looking for details on how conversations are stored or shared. Many users skip this step, but it tells you who controls your data.",
      "Next, avoid sharing sensitive details like financial information, passwords, or anything you would not want exposed. Even if the AI feels personal, it is still software connected to a company's servers.",
      "Finally, consider using apps that allow data deletion or offer clear privacy settings. Choosing tools that respect your control makes it easier to enjoy the benefits of AI without giving up too much personal security.",
      "Even if an AI chatbot seems safe, malware or phishing links could sneak in through related apps or ads. A trusted antivirus tool can block these threats and give you extra peace of mind. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

Wika's engagement illustrates how technology can evolve from being a casual tool to something deeply personal. The divided reactions online also show the tension between skepticism and acceptance of unconventional relationships. Whether people see it as heartwarming or unsettling, this story raises bigger questions about how love and relationships may be redefined as AI continues to advance.",

      "Over a year ago, National Public Data (NPD) made headlines for one of the largest breaches in history. The people search site exposed the personal information of 3 billion individuals. After disappearing from the internet, the site has returned under new ownership, sparking fresh concerns about privacy.",

      "Who owns National Public Data now?",
      "NPD has relaunched under Perfect Privacy LLC, a company that sounds protective but is not affiliated with the VPN service of the same name. Despite the new name behind the scenes, the business model has not changed. The site still allows anyone to look up personal data about friends, relatives or strangers with just a name.",

      "National Public Data, a people search site, exposed the personal information of 3 billion individuals in one of the largest breaches ever. (NPD)",
      "Accuracy issues and data sources",
      "According to NPD, the data comes from public records, property ownership databases, social media and government agencies. The company claims to verify and filter this information to ensure it is accurate and up to date. However, users may find that profiles still contain mistakes.",
      "A quick test search revealed a mix of outdated and accurate information. The site struggled with hyphenated names but pulled up correct details in other cases.",

      "Keep in mind that each profile needs its own request and confirmation email. After you submit, check back in a few days to make sure your data is actually gone.",

      "NPD offers an opt-out function for users who prefer not to have their information available on the site. (NPD)",
      "Why NPD is only part of the problem",
      "Removing your information from National Public Data is only the beginning. Dozens of other people search sites may still display your personal details. Many of these platforms pull from the same public databases, which means your address, phone number or relatives' names can keep reappearing.",
      "The return of NPD shows how quickly data can resurface online. A breach may fade from the headlines, but the exposed information rarely disappears. To protect your privacy, you need a broader plan.",
      "Start by searching for your name on people search engines several times a year. Look beyond NPD. Sites like Whitepages, Spokeo and Radaris often host similar data. Regular checks help you spot new profiles before they spread further.",
      "STOP DATA BROKERS FROM SELLING YOUR INFORMATION ONLINE",
      "A removal service can save time by scanning hundreds of databases at once. These services request opt-outs on your behalf and track new listings. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0CyberGuy.com.",
      "Protecting your privacy goes beyond deleting profiles. Keep an eye on your bank statements, credit reports and online accounts. Criminals can use exposed data for phishing attempts, fake loan applications or identity theft. Monitoring activity gives you an early warning if something looks suspicious.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, which could potentially access your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "4) Set up alerts for your identity",
      "Many banks and credit monitoring services let you create alerts for suspicious activity. You can also set up free fraud alerts with the credit bureaus. These warnings tell lenders to take extra steps to verify your identity before issuing new credit.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at CyberGuy.com.",
      "People search sites often pull records from government databases. Review your local county's property, court or voter registration records. Some jurisdictions allow you to request redactions or limit what is shown online.",
      "Since NPD and similar sites scrape from social media, tighten your privacy settings. Limit what strangers can see on Facebook, LinkedIn and other platforms. The less public information you share, the less these databases can collect.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The return of National Public Data is a reminder that your personal information can resurface at any time. Even if you remove yourself from one site, dozens more may still hold your details. That is why protecting your privacy requires more than a quick opt-out. With regular checks, credit freezes and stronger account monitoring, you can reduce your risk and stay one step ahead.",

      "\"My grandfather was a retired chemist who owned a vineyard in upstate New York,\" Landolina explains. \"I would work alongside him in his winery laboratory every single day after school from a very young age.

      "\"He eventually realized he couldn't control the bleeding and made his way back to the engine,\" Kleiman recalls.\u00a0\"The crew noted that he was pale and sweaty and that his turnout gear was saturated in blood. Traditional methods failed, so they administered TRAUMAGEL. It instantly stopped the bleeding.\"",

      "A user troubleshoots an internet router. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why home Wi-Fi security is important",
      "Your home Wi-Fi is not just a way to get online but also the gateway to your personal and professional life. Everything from online banking to work emails to video calls passes through it. If your network isn't secure, that information could be intercepted or exposed.",
      "One of the biggest misconceptions is that a home network is safe simply because it's private. In reality, hackers often target residential networks because they tend to have weaker defenses than corporate ones.",
      "Someone nearby could connect to your network if your password is weak or your encryption is outdated. This not only slows your internet but also lets them use your connection for illegal activities. Sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers and personal documents can be intercepted if the network is compromised.",
      "11 EASY WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY IN 2025",
      "Attackers can use an insecure network to push malicious software onto your devices, sometimes without you even realizing it. Smart devices such as security cameras, thermostats and speakers can be taken over and used for spying or as part of larger cyberattacks.",
      "Even if you trust everyone in your household, your network is still exposed to risks from outside. And with so many devices connected today, including laptops, phones, tablets, TVs and IoT gadgets, there are more entry points for an attacker than ever before. Securing your Wi-Fi closes those doors before someone decides to try them.",
      "A hacker executes cybercrime. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Choose the right router for Wi-Fi protection",
      "Every piece of Wi-Fi security advice ultimately comes back to the same foundation: your router. It is the gatekeeper for your entire home network. If it is old, poorly configured, or missing important updates, even the strongest passwords and best digital habits will not fully protect you.",
      "Investing in a good router is one of the most important steps you can take to secure your home Wi-Fi. A modern, well-supported router gives you stronger encryption, better control over connected devices and regular updates that patch security flaws.",
      "Don't stop at the hardware itself. Check regularly for firmware updates from the manufacturer. Some new routers update automatically, but many require you to log in and install patches manually. Outdated firmware leaves known vulnerabilities wide open.",
      "IS YOUR HOME WI-FI REALLY SAFE? THINK AGAIN",
      "Also, change the default router login password immediately. Most routers ship with basic credentials like \"admin/admin.\" Attackers know this and can easily hijack your settings if you never change them.",
      "If your router supports it, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA)\u00a0for logins. This extra step makes it much harder for attackers to gain control, even if they steal your password.",
      "If you are not sure where to begin, I have put together a list of some of the best and most secure routers you can buy right now by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Enable strong Wi-Fi encryption",
      "Encryption ensures that the data flowing across your network is scrambled, making it useless to anyone who tries to intercept it. Without proper encryption, nearby attackers can capture and read your traffic.",
      "The current gold standard is WPA3, which provides the strongest protection. If your router doesn't support it, WPA2 is still considered safe and widely used. Older options like WEP or an open, password-free network are highly insecure and should be avoided at all costs. It's worth logging into your router's settings just to confirm what level of encryption your network is using.",
      "Cables run out of an internet router. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Create a strong Wi-Fi password",
      "Your Wi-Fi password is the digital equivalent of the key to your home. A short or predictable password is like leaving a spare under the doormat, and anyone determined enough can find a way in. Instead, create a long passphrase that combines upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Aim for at least 12 to 16 characters.",
      "Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Check who is connected to your network",
      "Even with a solid password, it's smart to check who is actually connected to your network. Most routers allow you to view a list of active devices. If you spot something you don't recognize, investigate. It could be a neighbor piggybacking on your connection or, in the worst case, an intruder.",
      "It also helps to disable Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS). This feature was designed to make connecting new devices easier, but it has security flaws that attackers can exploit. Some users go further by enabling MAC address filtering, which limits access to specific devices.",
      "To reduce risk even more, set up a\u00a0separate guest network for smart devices and visitors. That way, if one device gets hacked, your laptops and phones remain protected.",
      "And remember, keep all your devices updated. From laptops and phones to smart bulbs and thermostats, every gadget is a potential entry point. A weak link in one device can put your entire network at risk.",
      "IS YOUR PHONE HACKED? HOW TO TELL AND WHAT TO DO",
      "Protect your privacy with a VPN",
      "A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, helps solve one of the biggest issues with online privacy, which is who can see what you're doing. When you connect through a VPN, it creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the websites or apps you use. Everything that travels through this tunnel is hidden from outsiders, including your internet provider.",
      "A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.",
      "For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Don't overlook antivirus protection",
      "While your Wi-Fi settings form the first line of defense, you should also protect the devices connected to your network. Install strong antivirus software to block malware that could spread through downloads, emails, or malicious links. This extra step ensures that even if a threat slips past your router's defenses, your devices stay protected.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "The Navy flew a drone nonstop for over three days to test new long-endurance solar-powered autonomous aircraft technology. (Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division)",
      "Navy solar drone proves nonstop endurance",
      "The three-day nonstop flight proved that solar-powered drones can store enough energy during daylight to keep flying through the night. Engineers confirmed that Skydweller not only stayed airborne but also handled real-time autonomous decisions, adapted to turbulent weather and maintained secure communications.",
      "AI DRONE FINDS MISSING HIKER'S REMAINS IN MOUNTAINS AFTER 10 MONTHS",
      "Officials say the drone's wingspan matches that of a Boeing 747, yet it weighs about as much as a Ford F-150. With solar panels covering its massive wings, Skydweller powers four electric propeller engines during the day while storing extra energy in batteries for night flights.",
      "The Navy, in partnership with Skydweller Aero, recently achieved continuous solar-powered unmanned flight during a nonstop three-day test. (Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division)",
      "Navy expands solar-powered surveillance",
      "NAWCAD leaders say Skydweller will fit into the Navy's intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) network. Unlike expensive satellites or large drones such as the Global Hawk, Skydweller offers commanders a cheaper option for persistent monitoring. It can hover over an area in what experts call a \"pseudo-satellite role,\" freeing up more advanced systems for priority missions.",
      "For U.S. Southern Command, Skydweller could help track drug trafficking, border security threats and other maritime challenges. Longer tests are already planned for this summer in the SOUTHCOM region, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean and oversees U.S. military operations in that area.",
      "A solar-powered aircraft sits at Skydweller's facility at Albacete airport on April 3, 2023, in Albacete, Castilla-La Mancha, Spain. (Rey Sotolongo/Europa Press via Getty Images)",
      "Future of solar-powered flight for Navy missions",
      "While Skydweller has already logged nearly 220 flight hours, engineers believe it could stay airborne far longer. Weather and range limits kept this recent test at 73 hours, but in theory, the aircraft could remain aloft for weeks.",
      "The Department of Defense sees platforms like Skydweller as vital for future conflicts where fuel resupply may not be possible. Renewable-powered drones could solve logistics headaches, especially in contested environments, which essentially means operating in places where enemies can block supply lines and make traditional refueling too risky.",
      "What this means for you",
      "The Navy's solar drone test is proof that renewable energy can support technologies once thought impossible. If solar power can keep an aircraft in the air for days, similar advances may eventually reach consumer tech, disaster relief and even commercial aviation. Imagine cheaper, cleaner systems that can operate nonstop without fuel.",

This milestone also points to practical uses beyond defense, from disaster response to global communications. As testing continues, the focus will shift from what is possible to how long these systems can stay airborne and how widely they can be deployed. The next step may redefine how we think about surveillance, security and renewable energy in the skies.",

      "When you change your address, always use the official USPS website or your local post office. Some third-party sites look like they're offering a convenient service, but they often collect extra data about you and sometimes even resell it. Going straight to the source means your sensitive details don't take unnecessary detours.",
      "When you sell your home, more than just the price gets published. Your name, past addresses and even photos of your home can become part of the public record. Ask your realtor what's automatically disclosed and whether anything can be limited or redacted. It's worth being picky here: the less of your personal footprint that's tied to your property, the better.",
      "Moving is the perfect excuse to purge. But don't just throw out old bills, medical statements, or financial records; shred them. Dumpster-diving for personal data may sound outdated, but it's still a method scammers use. A good shredder ensures your sensitive history doesn't end up in the wrong hands.",
      "It's tempting to post a \"Goodbye, old house!\" photo online, but resist the urge. Publicly announcing a move tells scammers exactly when your home is empty and what your new address might be. Instead, share the news directly with family and close friends. A little less buzz online means a lot more safety offline.",
      "One powerful way to stay ahead of scammers is to freeze your credit. A freeze blocks new credit accounts from being opened in your name, even if criminals have your address or other details. The good news is that you can do this for free with all three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.",
      "It only takes a few minutes online or by phone, and you can lift the freeze anytime if you need to apply for a loan or credit card. By freezing your credit before and after your move, you create a strong barrier that keeps thieves from turning stolen data into financial damage.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Moving should feel like a new beginning, not an invitation for scammers to strike. With a few smart steps, you can stay ahead of data brokers and fraudsters. From shredding documents to freezing your credit, every action adds a layer of protection. By protecting your information before and after your move, you gain peace of mind and start your next chapter on solid ground. The effort is small compared to the security it brings.",

    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/trumps-cashless-bail-crackdown-gets-expert-backing-power-purse-strings-can-force-compliance",
    "published": "Mon, 08 Sep 2025 06:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The president ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to identify jurisdictions with cashless bail policies as part of his administration&apos;s crime control strategy.",
    "story": [
      "Baltimore attorney and legal analyst Randolph Rice warns that blue cities refusing to accept Trump's help in the national fight on crime would be similar to someone refusing help from firefighters when your house is burning down.",
      "While the White House can't directly control local jurisdictions that refuse to issue cash bail for accused criminals, particularly repeat offenders, experts say the president does have some ways to influence cities where crime has gotten out of control.",
      "President Donald Trump recently announced a new executive order as part of his plan to undo the spread of cashless bail. He directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to, within 30 days, compile a list of all jurisdictions that have implemented the policy. And he instructed other federal agencies to identify what grants and contracts can be suspended as a result.",
      "\"As President, I will require commonsense policies that protect Americans\u2019 safety and well-being by incarcerating individuals who are known threats,\" Trump wrote in the order. \"It is therefore the policy of my Administration that Federal policies and resources should not be used to support jurisdictions with cashless bail policies, to the maximum extent permitted by law.\"",

      "In Washington, D.C., where the president has more direct control, he ordered the Justice Department to file federal charges and seek pretrial detention whenever possible.",
      "\"While the president may not have direct ability to control the law enforcement of these individual cities and states, what he does have is the power of the purse strings,\" said Randolph Rice, a Baltimore-area attorney and legal analyst. \"He can use money and withhold that money to force these jurisdictions and these states to accept the help of the federal government.\"",
      "His intervention in Washington is already paying dividends, he said, with carjackings down more than 80% in a 20-day span, as revealed by Mayor Muriel Bowser.",
      "\"Which is amazing to me why you have a mayor or a governor of another state, where crime is a problem, and they're unwilling to accept that help,\" said Rice, whose previous clients include the family of Rachel Morin, who was killed by a fugitive illegal immigrant two years ago this month.",
      "\"It's like your house is burning down,\" Rice continued. \"The fire department is calling and saying, 'Hey, we can send another fire truck to put out the fire.' And you just say, 'No. I think we're good. We won't take the help.'\"",

      "Under cashless bail schemes, an arrested suspect walks free before their trial without having to post any overhead fees, known as bail or bond, that are meant to ensure they keep coming back to court.",
      "\"So essentially the person goes to court within the first 24 hours, and the judge lets them go and says, you need to come back to court on this date,\" Rice said. \"And if you don't, there really are no consequences.\"",
      "Such policies have spread through liberal jurisdictions in recent years despite frequent criticism that they are too lenient on repeat offenders, some of whom have gone on to commit more serious crimes.",
      "In Washington in March 2022, a then-31-year-old man named Johnwann Elliott gunned down 37-year-old Nikia Young in broad daylight at a bus stop, according to the Justice Department. At the time of the murder, despite a prior robbery conviction for which he served time in prison, he was freed from custody while awaiting trial on an unrelated car theft charge.",
      "TRUMP DEMANDS END TO CASHLESS BAIL, SAYS 'COMPLETE DISASTER' DRIVING CRIME IN CITIES, ENDANGERING POLICE",
      "A police officer is positioned outside the U.S. Capitol in August 2025.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "A California study in 2023 found that violent crime tripled in the state under its \"Zero Bail\" policy.",
      "\"Every single individual and every case should be evaluated by a judge, an independent magistrate, who can look at that person's criminal history, look at the facts of the current case and make an informed decision about what their risk level is and what's it going to take to make sure that they don't go out and harm somebody again,\" Yolo County District Attorney Jeff Reisig told Fox News Digital at the time. \"That needs to happen in every case.\"",
      "Another version of cashless bail, according to Rice, is called unsecured bond. In those situations, bond is set with a dollar value, but the defendant doesn't have to post it unless they miss a court date.",
      "\"Well, the funny part about that is, is if somebody doesn't show up to court, they're probably not going to pay a bond either,\" Rice told Fox News Digital. \"So it really is a ludicrous idea to have these unsecure bonds, but cashless bond is becoming more popular in a lot of these blue states, a lot of the more liberal states. And I think a lot of these states are starting to see a backfire on them.\"",

      "In particular, he said, low-level criminals who are released go back to committing crimes like shoplifting and burglary almost immediately, before their pending cases go to court, lowering the quality of life and keeping crime levels high even in areas where murders are down.",
      "In Baltimore, for example, medical advances have made it more likely for victims to survive shootings.",
      "\"What we see is that people that got shot who maybe 5, 10, 15, 20 years ago would have died, they go to Shock Trauma, and they save them,\" he said, referring to the University of Maryland Medical Center's Shock Trauma Center. \"So while the murder number may drop, the shooting number may be consistent or be going up, which is still a sign of crime in a city.\""

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron isn't just France's head of state. He's also looking like he wants to be the spokesman for the whole of Europe. He's sought to lead Europe's response to the Russia-Ukraine war, opposed the U.S. by supporting Palestinian statehood, and weighed in on former President Donald Trump's desire to buy Greenland. Yet critics say he should be focusing on issues closer to home.",
      "In Macron's France, there is real turmoil in the country's parliament over how to fix the massive debt load. And Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou faces a vote of no confidence as early as Monday, which he will likely lose. Bayrou was appointed by Macron in December last year, following three other prime ministers who resigned during 2024. In many ways, what happens next is\u00a0a D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu scenario where the president appoints yet another prime minister as he did last December when Michel Barnier quit.",
      "Late last month, Bayrou highlighted that France is deep in debt despite being the second-largest economy in the European Union, behind Germany. In addition to being a large economy, France is also an important U.S. trading partner.",
      "Because of the pending fiscal crisis, Bayrou developed a plan to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.6% of GDP next year by making savings of 44 billion euros ($51 billion) and cutting two public holidays. That would be a smaller deficit than in any of the years from 2020 through 2024.",

      "However, the budget-cutting plan hasn\u2019t gone down well with other parties in the French Parliament, and Bayrou faces a vote of no confidence there. Organized labor unions are incensed by the prime minister\u2019s plans and are threatening work-stoppage strikes. Leo Barincou, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in Paris, told Fox News Digital that any union strikes likely won\u2019t last long, nor will they be significantly disruptive to the economy like the Yellow Vest protests in the winter of 2018-2019.",
      "If Bayrou loses, there are alternatives. \"Macron can call\u00a0a snap election or appoint a new prime minister, but that will be hard given the current situation,\" says Elias Haddad, senior markets strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in London. \"Bayrou is expected to lose, and all the other parties have vowed to topple the government.\"",

      "One thing that almost certainly won\u2019t happen is a resignation by Macron. \"Most likely, Macron appoints another prime minister and makes a minimal budget that won\u2019t be too scary,\" Barincou says. In other words, there may be some budget cutting, but it won\u2019t be anywhere near what the current prime minister proposed in August.",

    "summary": "House Democrats posted on X an image of a birthday message that President Donald Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. It was part of a batch of docs made public Monday.",
    "story": [
      "A House committee Monday released a trove of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein that included a lewd note President Donald Trump is alleged to have sent as part of a collection of messages for the late convicted sex offender\u2019s 50th birthday more than two decades ago.",
      "The so-called birthday book was by far the most revealing of the records made public from the subpoena the Republican-led House Oversight Committee sent to Epstein\u2019s estate last month. The panel released all of the documents it received hours after Democrats on the committee posted an image of the birthday letter that was signed \u201cDonald.\u201d",
      "Trump has denied having had anything to do with the card, which was included in a leather-bound book of birthday messages for Epstein in 2003.",
      "The birthday book also included a handwritten letter that appeared to be from former President Bill Clinton. It referred to Epstein\u2019s having \u201cchildlike curiosity\u201d and a \u201cdrive to make a difference.\u201d",
      "Clinton\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Clinton has denied ever having gone to Epstein\u2019s private island, where some of the abuse is alleged to have occurred.",
      "The Wall Street Journal was the first report the existence of the card Democrats posted Monday. Trump sued the Journal, its publisher and two reporters in July. A spokesperson for Dow Jones said the newspaper stood by its reporting and would \"vigorously defend against any lawsuit.\"",
      "NBC News has not independently verified the Journal\u2019s reporting. White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich said Monday on X that the note should help Trump\u2019s legal case because \u201cit\u2019s not his signature.\u201d He added numerous photos of Trump\u2019s current signature, in which he signed his full name.",
      "Earlier examples of Trump\u2019s signing just his first name, including one from 1984 that was published in The New York Times in 2016 and another from 1999 on an auction house's website, appeared similar to the one Democrats posted. George Conway, a lawyer and former Trump supporter-turned-vehement critic, posted a thank-you note on social media dated April 13, 2006, which he said he received from Trump, with a signature that also resembled the one in the 2003 note to Epstein.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said a Wall Street Journal story Monday about Democrats\u2019 making the card public \"PROVES this entire 'Birthday Card' story is false.",
      "\"As I have said all along, it\u2019s very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it,\" she said on X. \"This is FAKE NEWS to perpetuate the Democrat Epstein Hoax!\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance added Monday night on X that Democrats care only about \"concocting another fake scandal\" to \"smear President Trump with lies.\"",
      "\"No one is falling for this BS,\" he wrote.",
      "The Democrats' post shows a hand-drawn outline of a naked woman with Trump's first name signed in the pubic area, as well as a typewritten note depicting an imaginary conversation between him and Epstein, the multimillionaire who would later be charged with sex trafficking.",
      "\u201cVoice Over: There must be more to life than having everything,\" the note begins.",
      "\"Donald: Yes, there is, but I won\u2019t tell you what it is,\" it continues.",
      "\"Nor will I, since I also know what it is,\" Jeffrey says.",
      "Donald says, \"We have certain things in common Jeffrey,\" and he responds, \"Yes, we do, come to think of it.\"",
      "Donald then says, \"Enigmas never age, have you noticed that?\" Jeffrey responds, \"As a matter of fact, it was clear to me the last time I saw you.\"",
      "It concludes with Donald telling Jeffrey: \"A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday \u2014 and may every day be another wonderful secret.\u201d Trump's full name is typed out above the \"Donald\" signature.",
      "Trump said on Truth Social in July: \"These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don\u2019t draw pictures.\"",
      "Shortly after that post, The Washington Post ran a story noting that he had done four sketches of buildings and a bridge that were auctioned off during his first term as president.",
      "Days later, he amended his earlier statement as he talked to reporters. \"Sometimes people say, 'Would you draw a building?' And I\u2019ll draw four lines and a little roof, you know, for a charity. So, but, but I\u2019m not a drawing person. I don\u2019t do drawings of women, that I can tell you,\" he said July 28.",
      "In his defamation suit, Trump's attorneys alleged the note was \"nonexistent\" and said \"no authentic letter or drawing exists.\"",
      "Brad Edwards, an attorney who has represented Epstein survivors, said in a statement Monday night that \"Trump\u2019s hypocrisy has been most frustrating for the victims: he told the public the Epstein story should 'go away,' yet filed a $10 billion lawsuit that only magnifies the very issue he wants silenced.\"",
      "\"With today\u2019s release, the least he could do is withdraw that lawsuit and publicly apologize to the journalist he attacked for reporting what seems to have now proved to be true,\" Edwards added.",
      "House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., said in a statement that Democrats on the panel were \u201ccherry-picking documents and politicizing information received from the Epstein Estate.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is not accused of any wrongdoing and Democrats are ignoring the new information the Committee received today,\u201d he said.",
      "Other House Republicans echoed the White House\u2019s position that the letter did not include Trump\u2019s authentic signature.",
      "\u201cWhat I see is not his signature,\u201d Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., said on Capitol Hill. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Donald Trump sign a million things.\u201d",
      "Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., also questioned the letter\u2019s authenticity. \u201cAnybody can do a signature,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s just bogus. The whole thing is bogus right now.\u201d",
      "Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who initiated a discharge petition for the release of Justice Department documents in Epstein\u2019s case, called the birthday letter a \u201cdistraction,\u201d saying it \u201cdoesn\u2019t prove anything\u201d and wasn\u2019t helpful to Epstein\u2019s victims.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything in there that implicates Trump,\u201d Massie said. \u201cBut I do think that there are some billionaire donors on the Republican and the Democrat side who are going to be embarrassed.\u201d",
      "House Democrats on the panel posted another image on X from Epstein\u2019s birthday book before the full release of documents from the estate. They said it showed \u201cEpstein and a longtime Mar-a-Lago member joking about selling a \u2018fully depreciated\u2019 woman to Donald Trump for $22,500.\u201d",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported that the page came from Joel Pashcow, who the publication said wrote the accompanying note and is pictured with Epstein holding the novelty check. Pashcow did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News.",
      "The version of the book the Oversight Committee received was redacted to not show the names and faces of women and minors, according to the production cover letter the Epstein estate attorneys sent to the committee.",
      "In addition to the birthday book, the estate turned over Epstein\u2019s will, which did not include any notable information. It also turned over previously released information, such as the nonprosecution agreement between Epstein and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Florida and entries from Epstein\u2019s address book.",
      "The committee's subpoena said the birthday book was put together by Epstein's accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.",
      "Maxwell was questioned about the existence of the book when she met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in July. She acknowledged she coordinated the project and had asked some of Epstein's friends to contribute birthday wishes, but she said she did not recall whether she had spoken to Trump about the project or whether he had submitted anything.",
      "Trump and Epstein were friends at one point, though Trump has said they had a falling-out years before Epstein\u2019s arrest for sex trafficking.",
      "Maxwell is appealing her conviction to the Supreme Court, and her attorney has said he hopes Trump will give her a pardon.",
      "Epstein\u2019s birthday book paints a picture of a man surrounded by luminaries: a past and future president, financiers and leading scientists and mathematicians from Harvard. It makes it clear that anyone who knew Epstein well viewed him as consumed with sex.",
      "In page after page, his friends discuss their sexual escapades with Epstein while they were young and tease him about having an obsession with sex. There are pictures of a nude Epstein and another of a nude Maxwell. There is also a hand-drawn image of Epstein being massaged by three young-looking women on a beach.",
      "The book is full of personal stories, anecdotes, photos of a young Epstein in school, a printed email from a teacher and letters from friends back in Brooklyn. It also includes dozens of photos of Epstein with women whose faces are redacted.",
      "On the steps of the Capitol last week, Epstein\u2019s accusers said there were those who were close to Epstein who should have known what was going on.",
      "Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell while he was awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges in New York in 2019. His death sparked years of conspiracy theories, some pushed by allies of Trump.",
      "The case exploded back into the headlines this summer, after the Justice Department and the FBI announced in an unsigned joint memo that they agreed Epstein\u2019s death was the result of a suicide, that no other people were expected to be charged and that no further information about the case would be released.",
      "The unexpected move sparked a furious backlash from many Trump supporters, since he and his allies had stoked conspiracy theories about the politically connected Epstein\u2019s death and had vowed to be transparent and bring others in the case to justice.",
      "The House Oversight Committee also subpoenaed the Justice Department for its investigative files. The Justice Department has turned over about a third of the files so far, and Democrats have said the vast majority of that material was already public."

    "story": [
      "Two key components of President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda collided Thursday, when federal authorities launched an immigration raid on a Georgia construction site for a Hyundai electric vehicle battery plant.",
      "The action came as Trump looks to secure $350 billion in investments from South Korea, as part of a broader trade deal. He is also seeking to revitalize U.S. domestic manufacturing with American-born workers while his administration arrests and deports foreign-born laborers.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The raid, which led to the arrests of nearly 500 workers, about 300 of whom were South Korean nationals, set off alarm bells in Seoul, which is now working with U.S. law enforcement to return those workers home.",
      "Hyundai, one of South Korea\u2019s largest companies, said it is \u201ccommitted to full compliance with all laws and regulations\u201d while noting that \u201cnone of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company.\u201d In the United States, Hyundai is the nation\u2019s fourth bestseller of new vehicles, behind GM, Toyota and Ford.",
      "\u201cAs we continue to invest in American manufacturing and create thousands of jobs, we will do so in full accordance with U.S. law and in a manner that reflects our values of treating all people with dignity and respect,\u201d the company added.",
      "Hyundai declined to say specifically if it would alter its plans because of last week\u2019s raid. LG Energy Solution, which will operate the factory in a joint venture with Hyundai, has reportedly decided to delay the start of production until the first half of 2026.",
      "LG Energy Solution and the joint venture did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "\u201cI will make it clear that if completion [of the factory] is delayed, the United States will also suffer significant losses,\u201d South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun told lawmakers Monday.",
      "Trump dismissed such concerns. Asked if the raid was straining relations at all with South Korea, a key U.S. ally, Trump said Sunday: \u201cNo, we have a great relationship with South Korea.\u201d",
      "The South Korean government has been working with the Trump administration to finalize a framework trade agreement, under which South Korea would buy $100 billion of U.S. energy products and invest $350 billion in the United States. The details of that investment remain unclear, but Trump has said those funds would be his to use any way he sees fit.",
      "Days after the Hyundai raid, Trump on Sunday night admonished foreign companies doing business in the United States. \u201cYour Investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people, with great technical talent, to build World Class products, and we will make it quickly and legally possible for you to do so,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Other projects touted by Trump in high-profile announcements, such as semiconductor factories, high-powered AI data centers, pharmaceutical plants, energy infrastructure, aircraft assembly lines and others, could require visas for similar types of workers.",
      "\u201cThis operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy, and protecting workers from exploitation. This investigation is focused on ensuring accountability for those who violate the law and upholding the rule of law,\u201d an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "Trump\u2019s border czar, Tom Homan, told CNN on Sunday that the administration plans \u201ca lot more worksite operations.\u201d Homan did not specify what other types of businesses may receive visits, but he cited his personal experience with hiring a roofing company. \u201cI had to call five different companies before I had a company that guaranteed me a legal work force,\u201d he said.",
      "The president\u2019s economic and immigration policies often appear at odds. On Friday, the Labor Department reported a further slowdown in jobs growth, indicating a cooling in the broader economy. The administration, however, touted a decline in foreign-born workers.",
      "Farms across California, meatpacking plants in Nebraska and businesses in a number of other states received visits from ICE, Border Patrol agents and other federal officers in May and June, leading to protests and complaints from the industries that they were losing reliable, longtime workers. Farmers were already under pressure from the president\u2019s tariff policy, which has hurt demand for American products overseas.",
      "Trump often cites American farmers as among his biggest supporters. \u201cOur great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\u201d Trump posted in June. \u201cWe must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!\u201d",
      "ICE then paused visits to farms, hotels, restaurants, fisheries and other types of workplaces. But after about a week, the Department of Homeland Security walked that back and the ICE visits resumed.",
      "Trump conceded this past weekend that the administration will have to grant visas to overseas workers, especially those who could train U.S. workers in specialty industries, such as establishing battery factories.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to train people. And the way you train people is [to] bring people in that know what they\u2019re doing and let them stay for a little while and help,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m going to look at that. It\u2019s a very interesting situation that took place in Georgia.\u201d",
      "Trump has pointed to the Hyundai factory and the company\u2019s related U.S. investments as evidence that the administration\u2019s economic agenda is working, even though facilities like the one Hyundai is building take years to begin producing tangible output.",
      "\u201cStricter immigration enforcement has likely reduced new entrants to the workforce,\u201d Wells Fargo economists wrote Friday after the most recent jobs report showed just 22,000 jobs were added in August. That report also included revisions that showed a labor market contraction in June.",
      "EY\u2019s chief economist concurred, noting that \u201ctighter immigration policies are increasingly restraining labor supply.\u201d"

      "The bills are sudden and jarring: $1,400 for a computer part from Germany, $620 for an aluminum case from Sweden and $1,041 for handbags from Spain.",
      "Some U.S. shoppers say they are being hit with surprise charges from international shipping carriers as the exemption on import duties for items under $800 expires as a part of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff push.",
      "That\u2019s leading to some frustration and confusion as shoppers and shippers both try to navigate a new reality for anybody ordering goods from abroad.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s maximum chaos,\u201d said Nick Baker, co-lead of the trade and customs practice at Kroll, a firm that advises freight carriers.",
      "Thomas Andrews, who runs a business in upstate New York restoring vintage computers from the 1980s and 1990s, said he was shocked to receive a tariff bill from UPS for approximately $1,400 on a part worth $750. He said he assumed there must have been a mistake.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s extortion,\u201d Andrews said.",
      "Late Friday, a representative for UPS told Andrews that the initial charge was indeed incorrect: The tariff bill should have only been for about $110. But it was too late: Andrews had already refused shipment to avoid paying the charge. Soon after learning about the corrected charge, he realized UPS had already begun sending the item back to Germany.",
      "The final annoyance, Andrews said: He\u2019s being charged for the return shipping \u2014 about $50.",
      "In a statement, UPS said it has solutions available to merchants designed to navigate the new environment. It did not address the customer-billing situation.",
      "On Aug. 29, for the first time in nearly a century, small-dollar items coming into the U.S. \u2014 also called de minimis goods \u2014 began facing import duties. That means even small, personal orders now face the sizable tariffs placed on U.S. trading partners. While a recent ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found many of Trump\u2019s duties unconstitutional, they remain in effect while Trump appeals the case to the Supreme Court.",
      "To comply with the new de minimis rules, a wave of countries have halted shipments to the U.S. That\u2019s caused postal traffic into the U.S. to decline by some 80%, according to a United Nations agency.",
      "But many orders are still flowing. And since the new de minimis rule began taking effect, social media platforms have been filled with accounts of U.S. customers receiving shock bills from major shippers like DHL, FedEx and UPS, having received no notice about the charges from the foreign merchant they\u2019d ordered from.",
      "The shippers, in turn, are being inundated with messages from customers disputing the charges, along with return-to-sender requests as the customers refuse shipments to avoid having to pay the bills.",
      "A representative for DHL said the firm \u201cis committed to supporting customers through the recent tariff changes and ensuring their shipments are managed efficiently.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe encourage customers to take note of the shipping policies of the brands they shop with and to also remember that tariffs are payable to the U.S. government,\u201d it said.",
      "The Trump administration has heralded the billions in revenues the tariffs are bringing in \u2014 and in the case of the new de minimis rule, argued the change is essential to halting the flow of small-sized illicit drug packages and drug ingredients. In a statement posted the day the new de minimis rules took effect, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the logistics industry \u201chas already adapted to the changes with minimal interruption.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis change has been months in the making, and we are fully prepared to implement it,\u201d said Susan S. Thomas, acting executive assistant commissioner for CBP\u2019s Office of Trade. \u201cForeign carriers and postal operators were given clear timelines, detailed guidance, and multiple options to comply. The only thing ending on August 29 is the pathway that has been used by criminals to exploit America\u2019s borders.\u201d",
      "Baker said foreign merchants are obligated to provide information to the shipper about the classification of the item, which is key to the tariff calculation \u2014 but from a regulatory perspective, the customer, as the importer of record, is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of that information.",
      "But many people are still getting caught off guard.",
      "After receiving a tariff bill for $620 on a $300 aluminum computer case from Sweden, Robert Wang decided to turn the shipment away.",
      "A software engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area, Wang said he placed his order Aug. 22 with Louqe, a high-end Swedish merchant. More than a week later, he received notice from UPS about the bill.",
      "\u201cConfusion transitioned into a late-night panic,\u201d Wang said, as he frantically researched the situation. Eventually UPS confirmed he\u2019d been charged the 200% tariff Trump has slapped on certain aluminum goods.",
      "Wang said he tried to reach out to Louqe about the charge, but did not hear back. The company did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News.",
      "Baker said many foreign businesses that rely on U.S. customers now face the dilemma of eating the tariff cost \u2014 assuming they are properly accounting for it in the first place \u2014 or passing it on to their customers, which could scare off business. Many merchants abroad have posted to social media to alert U.S. customers that they are suspending shipments there.",
      "Some U.S. small businesses are also paying a price. A day after receiving a shipment from Spain for handbags he said were worth about $600, Herm Narciso said he and his wife, who run a brick-and-mortar shop in Dunedin, Florida, that resells goods from Europe, got a tariff invoice for $1,041.44 from DHL.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t understand how it\u2019s possible to assess us with that level of tariffs,\u201d Narciso said.",
      "They said that they plan to file a dispute, but that the response could take two to four weeks. Narciso is worried their shop won\u2019t survive the recent changes if they start getting similar bills going forward.",
      "\u201cThis last quarter is probably going to tank us,\u201d Narciso said. \u201cThe margins on this type of business are slim to begin with.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t feel like the American way to me.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION (Sept. 8, 2025, 9:08 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the carrier that Thomas Andrews received a tariff bill from. It was UPS, not DHL."

    "published": "Mon, 08 Sep 2025 14:30:36 GMT",
    "summary": "France's National Assembly is set to vote for a motion of no confidence in Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, less than a year after they did the same for Michel Barnier.",
    "story": [
      "The French government was thrown into fresh turmoil Monday as lawmakers fired the prime minister, the latest leader tossed out by a deeply divided legislature.",
      "Parliamentarians on the left and right ousted Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with a whopping 364-194 vote against him in a motion of no confidence. They are unhappy about his proposal to make drastic cuts of around 44 billion euros ($51 billion) to next year\u2019s budget, an unpopular attempt to resolve France\u2019s economic woes.",
      "A statement from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace said that French President Emmanuel Macron will appoint a new prime minister \"in the coming days.\"",
      "After the vote, some politicians also called for Macron's ouster. \u201cBayrou has fallen. Victory and relief for the people,\" said Jean-Luc Melenchon, head of the radical left France Unbowed party. \"Macron is now on the front line facing the people. He too must go.\u201d",
      "This was the second time in nine months that lawmakers in France\u2019s National Assembly ousted a prime minister; Michel Barnier was deposed in a vote of no confidence in December. Before that, the last successful vote of no confidence was in 1962. It means Macron will be looking for his fifth prime minister in just 20 months.",
      "Though Macron remains a big presence internationally \u2014 leading European efforts to support Ukraine and provide a counterweight to President Donald Trump \u2014 at home he is dogged by a divided electorate and long-term uncertainty.",
      "Macron, in his second term, is barred by term limits from running in the next presidential election in 2027. The far-right National Rally is leading the polls, even though its leader, Marine le Pen, is barred from office because of an embezzlement conviction, which she is appealing.",
      "As in the rest of Europe, the far right is surging in France, capitalizing on widespread discontent over a cost-of-living crisis that has fueled a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment. And on Wednesday, large anti-government protests are expected throughout France.",
      "\u201cThis is a moment of truth. At a time when those in charge are forced to reveal the disastrous results of five decades of wasteful management,\" le Pen said before the vote. \"The pitiful spectacle of a collapse for the country, a disaster for the French people today ... the consequences will affect future generations for the nation.\"",
      "France\u2019s troubles took root last year when Le Pen\u2019s National Rally performed well in Europe-wide elections and Macron stunned the Continent by calling snap parliamentary elections. Parties on the left and right were able to work together to block a victory for Le Pen, but the resulting Parliament was divided, with no group holding enough power to govern with stability.",
      "Macron cobbled together a minority government, but as Bayrou and Barnier have found, it is extremely vulnerable to attack by its leftist and hard-right opponents. Many French political experts say the current crisis will persist until 2027 when the country elects a new leader, who will inevitably seek to cement their mandate by calling fresh parliamentary elections.",
      "This will do little to resolve France\u2019s short-term economic woes. Both Bayrou and Barnier were ousted while trying to resolve what they and many others see as a national debt crisis.",
      "France\u2019s budget deficit \u2014 how much more it spends than it earns \u2014 last year reached 5.8% of its gross domestic product. That\u2019s far higher than the European Union average of 3.1% and the E.U.\u2019s target of 3%, worrying investors about rising interest rates, lower credit ratings and less money for public services in the future."

      "North Carolina police are investigating the slaying of a 23-year-old Ukrainian woman on board a Charlotte Area Transit System train last month.",
      "The victim, who was identified by police as Iryna Zarutska, had recently come to the U.S. from Ukraine to escape the war with Russia, according to a GoFundMe started by her family. Her death has generated national attention and outrage from President Donald Trump.",
      "Officers from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department responded to the 1800 block of Camden Road following a call reporting an assault with a deadly weapon on Aug. 22, according to a police news release. Zarutska had been stabbed on the LYNX Blue Line train near the light rail station, WCNC reported.",
      "Officers found the 23-year-old had sustained knife wounds, and she was pronounced dead on the scene, police said.",
      "Decarlos Brown Jr., 34, was identified as a suspect in the stabbing, police said. He was taken to a local hospital \"with non-life-threatening injuries sustained at the time of the incident\" and will be arrested and charged with first-degree murder upon his release.",
      "Surveillance video obtained by WBTV shows someone who appears to be Zarutska getting on a full train and sitting in front of a person who appears to be Brown. After a few minutes, the person reported to be Brown seemingly takes out a pocket knife, stands up, and allegedly stabs the individual sitting in front of him. There did not appear to be any interaction between the two people before the alleged stabbing.",
      "In a statement, Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles called the incident \"a senseless and tragic loss.\"",
      "\"My prayers remain with her loved ones as they continue to grieve through an unimaginable time. Like so many of you, I\u2019m heartbroken \u2014 and I\u2019ve been thinking hard about what safety really looks like in our city,\" Lyles said. \"I remain committed to doing all we can to protect our residents and ensure Charlotte is a place where everyone feels safe.\"",
      "Zarutska had recently left Ukraine \"seeking safety from the war and hoping for a new beginning,\" according to GoFundMe, seeking support for her aunt and uncle with funeral expenses.",
      "Trump mentioned the stabbing Monday while delivering remarks during the second hearing of the Religious Liberty Commission in Washington, D.C., saying, \"there are evil people, and we have to confront that.\"",
      "\"A lunatic just got up and started \u2014 it\u2019s right on the tape, not, not really watchable, because it\u2019s so horrible,\" he said. \"But just viciously stabbed. She\u2019s just sitting there. So, there are evil people. We have to be able to handle that. If we don\u2019t handle that, we don\u2019t have a country.\"",
      "Her death has also spurred rebukes from others on the right, who have accused the media of purposely not covering the incident.",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller blamed the Democratic Party for the incident.",
      "\"The Democrat Party at every level \u2014 judges, politicians, academics, nonprofits \u2014 is organized around the defense and protection of the criminal, the monstrous and the depraved,\" he wrote in a post on X. \"The more vile the threat, the more vociferously the Democrat Party works to protect and enable it.\"",
      "Elon Musk, who formerly held an unofficial advisory role in the Trump administration, commented on the incident in several posts on X.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s change the law,\u201d Musk wrote in one X post. \"Between now and then, name and shame the DAs and judges who enable murder, rape and robbery. But especially shame those who funded the campaigns of the DAs and judges. That will make the biggest difference.\"",
      "The investigation is ongoing."

      "She also shared in the interview that Polansky played a big part in nailing the sound for \"Mayhem.\"",
      "\"Michael is the person who told me to make a new pop record,\" she said. \"He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music.'\"",
      "Polansky spoke about encouraging Gaga to return to pop music in the Vogue cover story, as well.",
      "\"Like anyone would do for the person they love, I encouraged her to lean in to the joy of it,\" he said. \"On the 'Chromatica' tour, I saw a fire in her; I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.\""

And see people enjoy that relationship and create that love story, their own love story, from these characters. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d",
      "While there are many beautiful scenes between Margo and Sophie, there are also some dark ones. One that \u00c5kerman didn\u2019t particularly enjoy is in the back half of the series, when Margo shows up at Sophie\u2019s motel room, where Sophie stays after Graham kicks her out of the house while the police suspect her of Abby\u2019s murder.",
      "\u201cWhat wasn\u2019t my favorite is the one in the motel where Brittany chokes me, and I smack her, and we hated that,\u201d \u00c5kerman says. \u201cWe hated hating each other, but it turned out beautiful. But there was a lot of, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t want to do this.\u2019\u201d",
      "As for when viewers will see what\u2019s next for Margo and Sophie, that remains to be seen. The show has not yet officially been picked up for a second season.",

      "The icon received the special award from Ariana Grande, who introduced Carey with a sentimental speech, thanking her for creating music that provided the \"soundtrack of our lives.\"",
      "\u201cAs a vocalist, there\u2019s only one queen. And that\u2019s Mariah,\u201d Grande said, to applause from the crowd.",
      "Carey took the stage in a satin gold robe that she later took off to reveal a glittering gold bodysuit complete with matching knee-high heels.",
      "The pop star performed a medley of some of her biggest hits, including \"Fantasy,\" \"Obsessed,\" and \u201cWe Belong Together,\u201d which is off her 10th studio album, \u201cThe Emancipation of Mimi,\u201d which recently celebrated its 20th anniversary.",
      "Carey\u2019s performance marked her return to the VMAs stage for the first time in 20 years. She had also previously presented LL Cool J with the same award in 1997. This time, she was the one being celebrated while the \u201cAround The Way Girl\u201d rapper hosted the Sept. 7 awards show.",
      "While accepting the prestigious honor, Carey poked fun at the fact that this was her first time winning a VMA.",
      "\"Thank you so much MTV for giving me the Vanguard Award. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m getting my first VMA tonight. I just have one question,\" Carey said, \"What in the Sam Hill were you waiting for?\"",
      "Jokes aside, Carey shared how creating music videos has been one of her biggest creative outlets throughout her career.",
      "\"Music videos are my way of life, of bringing music to my own life,\" Carey said while accepting the Video Vanguard Award.",
      "\"After all this time, I've learned that music evolves, videos evolve, but the fun? That is eternal,\" she added.",
      "The powerhouse singer first appeared on the VMAs in 1991 when she belted out her song \u201cEmotions\u201d from her second album. She has continued to return to the music awards show over the years, including in 1998 when she opened the show alongside fellow icon Whitney Houston.",
      "With the Video Vanguard Award, Carey, a five-time Grammy winner, adds another impressive accolade to her name. She joins fellow legendary artists, like Beyonc\u00e9, Madonna, Janet Jackson, Rihanna and The Beatles, who have also received the video Vanguard Award. Last year, Katy Perry was presented with the award.",
      "In addition to Carey, Busta Rhymes and Ricky Martin had unforgettable nights. Busta Rhymes took the stage before being handed the MTV VMA Rock the Bells Visionary Award, and Martin danced and sang along to some of his most popular songs before winning the Latin Icon Award.",

      "Broadway's revival of \"Cabaret\" is closing early as star Billy Porter withdraws from the show while recovering from sepsis.",
      "Porter was slated to perform as the Emcee for 13 weeks until Oct. 19, opposite Marisha Wallace as Sally Bowles. The production has now set its final performance date for Sept. 21.",
      "Porter had to withdraw from the show \"due to a serious case of sepsis,\" the production said in a statement on Instagram Sept. 7.",
      "\"His doctors are confident that he will make a full recovery but have advised him to maintain a restful schedule,\" the statement read.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to representatives for Porter for further comment on his health.",
      "Producer Adam Speers called Porter \"an extraordinary 'Emcee'\" in a statement.",
      "\"We wish Billy a speedy recovery and I look forward to working with him again in the very near future,\" Speers said.",
      "Regarding the decision to close the production early, Speers said the \"painful\" decision was made \"with a heavy heart.\"",
      "\"On behalf of all the producers, we\u2019re so honored to have been able to bring this version of John Kander, Fred Ebb, and Joe Masteroff\u2019s important masterpiece, Cabaret, to New York and to have opened the doors to our own Kit Kat Club for the year and a half we have been here,\" Speers said.",
      "\"Cabaret\" began previews at the August Wilson Theatre in April 2024 and originally starred Eddie Redmayne as the Emcee and Gayle Rankin as Sally Bowles. Since then, a slew of celebrities have taken the stage at the Kit Kat Club, including Adam Lambert, Orville Peck, Auli\u02bbi Cravalho and Eva Noblezada.",
      "Marty Lauter and David Merino will perform as the Emcee during the show\u2019s final two weeks, with a schedule to be announced at a later date.",
      "Porter wasn\u2019t new to the role of Emcee, having previously portrayed the character in the show's West End production from Jan. 28, 2025, through May 24, 2025, per Playbill.",
      "The actor reflected on his Broadway homecoming during a July appearance on TODAY.",
      "\u201cThe last time I was on Broadway was about nine years ago, and I feel comfort. I feel like I\u2019m home,\u201d Porter said. \u201cThis was the original dream and to be back, I will always come back to the theater.\u201d",
      "He compared returning to the role of the Emcee to \"getting on a bike.\"",
      "\u201cMy mind kind of came back,\u201d Porter said. \u201cIt\u2019s still there. It was not deleted from the files, yet.\u201d",
      "The actor also reflected on the progress made on Broadway over his decades-long career, telling Al Roker it was \u201cdifferent\u201d and \u201cbetter,\u201d but there was still \u201ca long way to go still.\u201d",
      "\u201cMe playing the Emcee was not possible 30 years ago when I got here,\u201d he explained. \u201cI tried to audition. I couldn\u2019t even get an audition. They said, \u2018That\u2019s not the story we\u2019re telling.\u2019 So, things have changed, and I want to make sure that I say that. It\u2019s so easy to lean into the negative of things, and I want to make sure that there are lots of positive things happening.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Sylvester Stallone is getting candid about his upbringing.",
      "During a Sept. 7 appearance on Sunday Sitdown with Willie Geist, Stallone recalled the abuse he faced by his father as a kid and how it ultimately made him want to be an actor.",
      "\"There\u2019s this incredible sense of emptiness because why couldn\u2019t it have been like, a pleasant upbringing? Why did it have to be so dark?\" he said. \"But would I have been here if it was a pleasant \u2014 hell, like, 'The Waltons'? It wasn\u2019t.\"",
      "Having a tumultuous relationship with his father, he started to look for \"a real male role model\" elsewhere, he said. That's when his love for acting and performance began.",
      "\"And I couldn\u2019t find it. It certainly wasn\u2019t around the house,\" he said. \"And it wasn\u2019t until I went to the movie theater, but I was never into, like, real serious actors. I was into escapism.\"",
      "The \"Tulsa King\" star ended up dropping out of the University of Miami to pursue acting in New York City. At 23, he moved to the Big Apple to hopefully get some roles, but he was typecast in smaller parts.",
      "That was when Stallone decided to take his career into his own hands. The \"Creed\" star sat down and wrote the highly acclaimed movie \"Rocky.\" The film starred Stallone as a small-time Philadelphia boxer who gets the chance to take on the world heavyweight champion.",
      "Though the film saw much success, Stallone says that studios didn't want him to star in it because they wanted an established actor to take the lead role. Stallone famously insisted he could do the job and turned down an offer of $360,000 to not be in the movie.",

      "\u201cI was home alone. I packed my things in a panic,\u201d the teenager told NBC News, describing the morning in October 2022, eight months after Russian forces captured the city, when he said the soldiers forced him to get into a car and drove away \u201cin an unknown direction.\u201d",
      "It was the start of an eight-month nightmare as the teenager became part of a systematic effort by Russia to relocate and re-educate thousands of children from Ukraine, in some cases forcibly adopting them while sending others to military training camps.",
      "At a meeting with President Donald Trump and several European leaders at the White House last month, Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy raised the issue of Ukraine\u2019s \"abducted children.\u201d His comments came three days after Trump met with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Alaska for talks on ending the war.",
      "While little progress has been made toward a ceasefire since then, Mykola Kuleba, the founder of Save Ukraine, a leading nongovernmental organization supporting people trying to secure the return of their children from Russia, insisted world leaders\u2019 \u201cfocus must remain on children, not just land.\u201d",
      "Kuleba, whose organization says it has rescued more than 750 children from Russia and Ukrainian territories occupied by its forces, says the push for their removal and re-education came from the highest levels of the Kremlin.",
      "The International Criminal Court has accused Putin of the war crime of overseeing the unlawful abduction and deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia, and in March 2023 it issued a warrant for his arrest. The ICC has also accused Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, Putin\u2019s presidential commissioner for children\u2019s rights, of committing similar crimes.",
      "\u201cThey force these kids to be Russian, to be Russian soldiers,\u201d Kuleba said in a telephone interview last month, adding: \u201cThe Russian regime has a clear intention to annihilate Ukrainian identity.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry and Lvova-Belova\u2019s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on both Vlad\u2019s abduction and the ICC arrest warrants.",
      "Vlad said he was taken to two camps in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Russia seized from Ukraine and annexed in 2014, and later to a naval academy in the Kherson region occupied by Putin\u2019s forces.",
      "\u201cThey tried to break me in every possible way,\u201d he said, adding that he was treated \u201cvery badly\u201d and denied food in the first camp because he \u201cbegan to show my pro-Ukrainian position.\u201d",
      "On one occasion, he said, he \u201ctook down the Russian flag and hung my underwear there.\u201d This led to him being thrown into solitary confinement for a week, he said, adding that his captors \u201cfed me twice a day, did not allow me to communicate with anyone at all.\u201d",
      "Another time, he said, the head of security at one of the camps tore a girl\u2019s T-shirt and trampled on it because it bore Ukraine\u2019s coat of arms.",
      "In regular classes with other Ukrainian children whose ages ranged from 6 to 18, he said, \u201cWe learned everything about Russia only, the history of Russia and so on,\u201d adding that they also talked about recent events in the war, like what Ukrainian territories had been captured.",
      "\u201cI understood that Russia is an aggressor country and it took away my childhood and severed my contacts with my family so that I would not see them,\u201d he said.",
      "On the morning of his capture, Vlad said, he had managed to call his mother, Tatiana, 38, to tell her that he had been kidnapped.",
      "Tatiana said she wasn\u2019t home when he was taken because she had been taken to the Russian commandant\u2019s office to write a statement about her mother, Rudenko Tamara, 53, who died in an attack the previous day. They wanted her to say \u201cthat Ukraine killed my mother,\u201d she said.",
      "On the call, Tatiana said, Vlad told her he was in the city of Olezhky and was \u201cgoing to Crimea to rest,\u201d which left her bewildered. \u201cAt that moment we just had a little fight,\u201d she added. \u201cI simply told him, \u2018How could you leave your family at such a difficult time?\u2019 I didn\u2019t know any details.\u201d",
      "Along with other parents, she only realized much later that Russian soldiers had been coaching children to say they were being evacuated from bombing and sent to summer camps.",
      "With fighting intense in Kherson, even after Russian forces were pushed out of the city in November 2022, Tatiana said that the month after the kidnapping, she decided to move west to the city of Mykolaiv.",
      "Together with her husband, Olexsandr, 43, who is also Vlad\u2019s stepfather, she left the city with her other five biological children, including baby Stefania, who was less than a year old at the time. NBC News agreed not to use Oleksandr\u2019s last name as he was called up to Ukraine\u2019s army in February 2023 and is still serving. Her sister and her cousin joined them as they made their way west to the city of Mykolaiv.",
      "Although Vlad\u2019s phone was routinely checked by his Russian captors, Tatiana said, she was able to keep in touch with her son through occasional text messages, but she \u201ctold him not to create problems.\u201d",
      "\u201cI said when you can, if you are there alone or no one is escorting you, then write,\u201d she said, adding that she was able to establish he was being held in a camp in Lazurne in southeast Ukraine.",
      "After a friend told her about Save Ukraine, Tatiana said, she reached out to the organization, which after several months of planning arranged for her to travel to Russia along with six other women whose children had been taken.",
      "With no direct route across the front lines, Tatiana said, she traveled through Poland, Belarus and Russia\u2019s capital, Moscow, before she was eventually able to travel to the camp via Crimea.",
      "No one from Save Ukraine accompanied the group, she said, but its representatives were in touch by phone and arranged for her to be put up by a volunteer in a temporary home.",
      "Although she was roughly searched by masked men on arrival, Tatiana said, things initially seemed to be going well. But on the second day, she said, agents from the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the KGB spy agency, came around, put a mask over her head and took her somewhere for questioning, after \u201cconfiscating my documents and my phone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey interrogated me, maybe six or seven hours,\u201d she said, adding that she was locked in a basement cell overnight before further questioning the following morning. Her interrogators were particularly interested in Save Ukraine, she said.",
      "They also brought a cameraman and a journalist, who she said expected her to say \u201chow great Russia is, how it helps us and how bad Ukraine is for us.\u201d",
      "While she was initially reluctant, she said, she was able to use Vlad\u2019s phone to consult with Save Ukraine via text message. Tatiana said the group told her: \u201cDo what is necessary, just for you to leave from there.\u201d",
      "The FSB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "After giving the interview on camera, she said, she was released with Vlad and allowed to make the arduous journey home.",
      "\u201cIt was just happiness after the horror. \u2026 I was simply amazed,\u201d Tatiana said.",
      "Kidnapped children are now spread out across approximately 200 locations from the Black Sea to Russia\u2019s Pacific coast, according to Nathaniel Raymond, the executive director of the Yale School of Public Health\u2019s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL), the leading body tracking kidnapped Ukrainian children.",
      "The group has monitored the movement of children by analyzing satellite photos and photographing airplanes and vehicles apparently used to transport the kids, among other techniques.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t all come from the same place. They don\u2019t all go to the same place. They don\u2019t all have the same purpose,\u201d Raymond said in a telephone interview last month.",
      "Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., have floated the possibility of introducing a bill in the Senate that, if passed, could designate Russia and Belarus as state sponsors of terrorism over the kidnapping of Ukrainian children, a source familiar with the bill told NBC News in mid-August. A draft of the bill says that Belarus \u201chas directly supported the kidnapping of Ukrainian children and supported their relocation.\u201d",
      "But both Save Ukraine and the HRL took a financial hit last spring after the Trump administration cut funding for their programs.",
      "As Russia pushes to take control of more Ukrainian territory, rescuing the Ukrainian children has become an even more urgent issue, experts say.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s all the more reason to get all the kids we can back before the door closes,\u201d Raymond said.",
      "\u201cNow is the decisive moment when America cannot allow itself to step back,\u201d added Kuleba, of Save Ukraine.",
      "As for Vlad, who is now 19, he said thinking about his family kept him going during his time in captivity, and he rushed to see his baby sister Stefania as soon as he got home.",
      "Now in Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, he is hoping to become a sports trainer.",
      "\u201cWhat helped me all the time was probably that I had family in Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I could return to Ukraine and build a normal future.",

      "CHONGQING, China \u2014 For nearly two months, health officials in southern China have been waging war on mosquitos, reviving top-down tactics from the country\u2019s zero-Covid playbook.",
      "Since July, the province of Guangdong alone has reported more than 10,000 cases of chikungunya fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease that mostly circulates in tropical regions. Foshan, a manufacturing hub in densely populated Guangdong, has been the hardest-hit Chinese city \u2014 recording over 600 new infections per day at its peak, more than the combined total of 519 cases reported across mainland China from 2010 to 2019.",
      "The unprecedented outbreak prompted Chinese authorities to adopt a containment strategy akin to the country\u2019s strict zero-Covid policy \u2014 a \u201cdetect and eliminate\u201d approach.",
      "To curb the spread, workers were sent out to spray insecticide in affected areas multiple times a day. The government also required suspected patients to report their cases promptly and comply with the quarantine mandate.",
      "The outbreak in China was triggered by warmer weather this year and a fast-spreading virus strain, Liu Qiyong, chief expert of vector control at China\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told state-run broadcaster CCTV.",
      "But the surge in chikungunya cases extends far beyond China as global warming accelerates the spread of infectious diseases, including dengue fever and malaria, a 2025 study found.",
      "As of mid-August, about 270,000 cases of chikungunya had been recorded globally this year, including in the Americas, Europe and Southeast Asia, leading to at least 110 related deaths, according to the Pan American Health Organization.",
      "While no locally acquired cases have been reported in U.S. states or territories since 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel health notice in August urging \u201cenhanced precaution\u201d amid chikungunya outbreaks in China\u2019s Guangdong province and four other countries. The CDC warned that anyone spending time in areas where chikungunya occurs is at risk.",
      "\u201cIn this rapidly changing world, infectious disease can disseminate very quickly,\u201d said Jasper Chan, a professor of clinical microbiology and infection at the University of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cEspecially after the recent Covid-19 pandemic, relevant authorities have been quite, I would say, cautious in terms of making these alert issues,\u201d he said.",
      "Chikungunya 101",
      "The chikungunya virus, first identified in Tanzania in 1952, has spread for decades mainly in the Americas, Africa and Asia. It is transmitted primarily through the bites of infected mosquitos and does not spread directly from person to person.",
      "\u201cChikungunya virus very closely resembles other mosquito-borne viruses like dengue clinically, but they belong to different families,\u201d Chan said.",
      "Its name, which comes from a language in southern Tanzania, means \u201cto bend over,\u201d a reference to the debilitating joint pain it causes. Though it is rarely fatal, chikungunya can have long-lasting, severe symptoms, including muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "As there is no specific antiviral drug to cure chikungunya, current treatment is focused primarily on relieving the symptoms. One vaccine is available in the United States. Prevention is the best protection, according to the CDC, which advises people to avoid mosquito bites and get vaccinated if necessary before they travel to places where chikungunya occurs.",
      "Chikungunya has been reported in over 110 countries across every continent except Antarctica, with at least 5.6 billion people living in places at risk from it, the WHO estimated.",
      "The disease spreads through global travelers via mosquitoes. A person gets bitten in one country, boards a plane with the virus still in the bloodstream and lands thousands of miles away, where a mosquito picks up the infection and passes it to the next person. The cycle then begins again, eventually leading to a local outbreak.",
      "Though the United States is unlikely to experience large outbreaks since people in warm areas often stay indoors with air conditioning, experts advise using mosquito repellent, wearing long sleeves and delaying trips to regions with chikungunya outbreaks.",
      "How China battles chikungunya",
      "While chikungunya is not uncommon in other parts of the world, such as Latin America, it is unusual to have big outbreaks in China, where the first imported case was identified in 2008, experts say.",
      "To stop the spread, local authorities have enlisted grassroots workers to disperse insecticide on the streets and clear stagnant pools of water where mosquitos breed. Clinics and hospitals have set up mosquito-proof beds to isolate patients, and residents have been urged to install screen windows and to light mosquito coils at home.",
      "People and organizations in China are bound by law to follow instructions from health officials in containing the virus. Failure to comply can lead to warnings, fines and even civil liability.",
      "Some have criticized the government\u2019s campaign as overkill reminiscent of Covid-era public health controls, while others have praised the quick, large-scale action.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really great to see years of accumulated old trash removed,\u201d a user wrote on RedNote, a Chinese social media platform similar to Instagram. \u201cBut it\u2019s a bit too much to dump out even the cats\u2019 water bowls. That\u2019s a classic case of the one-size-fits-all approach.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s strict controls have curbed the outbreak. As of Aug. 25, Foshan had kept new daily cases under 50 for nine days. Health officials announced that the city of more than 9 million people had ended its public health emergency response, which lasted for about a month.",
      "Experts say the bigger challenge is the impact of climate change, as rising temperatures and more severe weather create new habitats for virus-carrying mosquitos to thrive and spread diseases.",
      "Because of unusually hot weather in recent years, there has been an \u201cincreasing number\u201d of locally acquired chikungunya cases in areas that had been unaffected by the virus for the past decade, such as Europe, Chan said.",
      "\u201cRemember, humans are not alone in this globe. We\u2019re living with animals, birds, various other species, as well as all these vectors, including mosquitoes, ticks and other vectors,\u201d he said.",

      "Mackenzie Knight bought $100 worth of Beauty of Joseon sunscreens and other popular Korean skin care products last month from YesStyle, a major online K-beauty retailer. Five days later, she received an email from global shipping company DHL containing a $20 tariff bill. She had five days to pay up, the notice said, or her order would be returned.",
      "The charge came as a shock, Knight told NBC News, because YesStyle made no mention on its website that consumers would be charged an extra fee as a result of the ending of the de minimis tariff exemption \u2014 a loophole for lower-value packages that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration halted last week.",
      "\u201cI feel grateful to be able to afford $20, but it\u2019s not the best to not be expecting it,\u201d said Knight, 35, from San Jose, California. \u201cIf people are able to know how much tariffs they\u2019d be charged, a calculator for example, that\u2019d be helpful.\u201d",
      "Beauty junkies obsessed with Korean cleansing oils, snail mucin and sunscreens famously more protective than what are available in the U.S. might want to prepare themselves before they add products to their cart and see the price tick up.",
      "The de minimis provision allowed packages valued at less than $800 to be imported tax-free. These packages will now be charged either the tariff rates the U.S. placed on their countries of origin or fixed fees of $80 to $200, the latter option available only for six months.",
      "South Korea, for example, was subject to a 15% reciprocal tariff starting this summer.",
      "The end of the exemption combined with the recent round of tariffs has shaken the Korean beauty industry, which has experienced a sustained boom in the United States over the past decade.",
      "The U.S. imported an estimated $1.7 billion worth of K-beauty products in 2024, a more than 50% increase from the previous year, according to data from the U.S. International Trade Commission.",
      "While tariffs disrupt global supply chains, the removal of the de minimis provision affects shipments of low-value items such as small electronics and skin care and beauty products, said Munseob Lee, an economist at the University of California San Diego.",
      "In the short run, he said, K-beauty consumers could face \u201chigher prices, fewer varieties and longer delivery times.\u201d",
      "Eliminating the de minimis exemption could cost the average American family up to $136 a year, the heaviest impact falling on low-income and minority consumers who rely on affordable imports, according to a February report from the Yale Economic Growth Center.",
      "Lee said the full impact of the de minimis change on the K-beauty industry may not be clear until next year, as many shoppers and retailers have stocked up on inventory to brace for higher tariff costs.",
      "At the moment, he said, it\u2019s difficult to determine exact price increases because sellers may adopt different strategies to offset costs. Bigger retailers may have the market power to pass on duties to consumers, but smaller brands may have to suspend deliveries to U.S. shoppers, he said.",
      "The impact of global tariffs and ending the de minimis exemption is not limited to the Korean beauty industry. Santiago Vance, who buys Japanese beauty products, said online retailers like Wabi-Sabi and Yoyo Japan have stopped shipping her go-to stem cell serums to the U.S.",
      "\u201cI really am disappointed in how cruel this administration is to normal people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t buy a lot. Most of us never even went over the de minimis amount that was there already.\u201d",
      "Congress had planned to remove the tariff exemption for all countries in July 2027, but Trump signed an executive order expediting the end date to Aug. 29.

Her packaging and operational costs have increased, but Yoo said she\u2019s holding off on hiking prices due to ongoing geopolitical uncertainty.",
      "\u201cThe last thing I want to do is increase prices then backtrack because trade policy changed again,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully by the end of year there\u2019ll be something more set in stone.\u201d"

    "summary": "An iconic winged lion that has perched above Venice for centuries, may have originated in China, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "For centuries, an iconic winged lion has perched above Venice, a symbol of the \u201cFloating City\u201d that millions of tourists have passed under in St. Mark\u2019s Square.",
      "But scientists now believe that this ancient emblem of the Italian city may in fact have origins a world away.",
      "A study released Thursday found evidence that the statue may have been partially made in China and arrived in northern Italy after a long journey across the medieval Silk Road that may have involved the father of the explorer Marco Polo and the court of the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan.",
      "Historical documents confirm the statue was in Venice by the late 13th century, but its history before that remains murky.",
      "How the lion made its way to Venice \u2014 an economic powerhouse in the medieval world owing to its strategic position close to Europe and the Byzantine Empire \u2014 has long been a mystery.",
      "It was assumed by experts that the statue may have come from ancient Persia or Syria.",
      "By studying copper isotopes taken from samples of the statue, scientists were able to identify that the metal originated from the Yangtze River in eastern-central China, more than 8,000 miles away from where it now stands.",
      "Their findings were published in the archeology journal Antiquity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a rather extraordinary discovery,\u201d Hannah Skoda, associate professor of medieval history at the University of Oxford, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cAt the same time it is indicative of the sheer extent and intensity of global trading networks, even in this really early period,\u201d which would have made the long journey from China to Italy via the Silk Road possible all those centuries ago,\" Skoda, who was not involved in the study, said in a phone interview.",
      "The study\u2019s conclusion \u201cis striking \u2014 though perhaps not quite as improbable as it might sound,\u201d said Peter Frankopan, professor of global history at Oxford and author of \u201cThe Silk Roads: A New History of the World.\u201d",
      "\u201cDiscoveries like this are not unusual once you start to look carefully at the materials, the motifs and the methods that shaped the cities we think we know,\u201d he said by email.",
      "The statue may not even be a lion at all, the study suggests.",
      "Researchers argue that the figure closely mirrors tomb guardians from the Tang dynasty, which ruled from the 6th to 9th centuries during China\u2019s golden age. These ancient sculptures were known as \u201czhenmushou\u201d and share similar features with the Venice statue such as the position of the ears and the distinctive \u201cbulbous nose,\u201d according to the study.",
      "There are no written records telling us where the statue that now looks down from a Piazzetta column in St. Mark\u2019s came from. The only historical document mentioning it dates to 1293, and researchers have long presumed that the statue had a rich history before it made its way to Venice.",
      "Scientists still don\u2019t have a firm grasp on how exactly the statue traversed such great distances across multiple continents all those years ago. However, the study suggests that Niccolo and Maffeo Polo, Marco Polo\u2019s father and uncle, might have discovered the original statue in the 13th century while visiting the court of Kublai Khan in what is now Beijing.",
      "As traveling merchants, they would have then transported the statue back to their home city of Venice along the famed Silk Road.",

    "story": [
      "The French government was thrown into fresh turmoil Monday as lawmakers fired the prime minister, the latest leader tossed out by a deeply divided legislature.",
      "Parliamentarians on the left and right ousted Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with a whopping 364-194 vote against him in a motion of no confidence. They are unhappy about his proposal to make drastic cuts of around 44 billion euros ($51 billion) to next year\u2019s budget, an unpopular attempt to resolve France\u2019s economic woes.",

      "Macron, in his second term, is barred by term limits from running in the next presidential election in 2027. The far-right National Rally is leading the polls, even though its leader, Marine le Pen, is barred from office because of an embezzlement conviction, which she is appealing.",
      "As in the rest of Europe, the far right is surging in France, capitalizing on widespread discontent over a cost-of-living crisis that has fueled a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment. And on Wednesday, large anti-government protests are expected throughout France.",
      "\u201cThis is a moment of truth. At a time when those in charge are forced to reveal the disastrous results of five decades of wasteful management,\" le Pen said before the vote. \"The pitiful spectacle of a collapse for the country, a disaster for the French people today ... the consequences will affect future generations for the nation.\"",
      "France\u2019s troubles took root last year when Le Pen\u2019s National Rally performed well in Europe-wide elections and Macron stunned the Continent by calling snap parliamentary elections. Parties on the left and right were able to work together to block a victory for Le Pen, but the resulting Parliament was divided, with no group holding enough power to govern with stability.",
      "Macron cobbled together a minority government, but as Bayrou and Barnier have found, it is extremely vulnerable to attack by its leftist and hard-right opponents. Many French political experts say the current crisis will persist until 2027 when the country elects a new leader, who will inevitably seek to cement their mandate by calling fresh parliamentary elections.",

      "France\u2019s budget deficit \u2014 how much more it spends than it earns \u2014 last year reached 5.8% of its gross domestic product. That\u2019s far higher than the European Union average of 3.1% and the E.U.\u2019s target of 3%, worrying investors about rising interest rates, lower credit ratings and less money for public services in the future."

      "MILAN \u2014 Giorgio Armani was the king of Italian fashion, a designer loved by Hollywood stars. And yet, his final resting place was far from all the glitz and glamour \u2014 in his family tomb in the provincial town where he was born. His funeral Monday was a small ceremony in the presence of only his closest family and friends.",
      "For those who knew him, the end of Armani's life illustrated the cipher that he was, private and true to his roots and his humble beginnings.",
      "\u201cHe had a very hard start,\u201d his biographer, Renata Molho, said outside Armani\u2019s funeral chamber. \u201cHe turned all of this into a sort of humanity \u2014 to look at people trying to understand them.\u201d",
      "Born in Piacenza, in northern Italy, in 1934, Giorgio Armani lived through World War II, the Nazi occupation of Italy and the post-war years when much of the country was in rubble.",
      "\u201cHis father was in prison for political reasons,\u201d Molho said, referring to Ugo Armani\u2019s work as a clerk for the local fascist party. While not poor, the family was not wealthy, and after Ugo was released from prison, they moved to Milan.",
      "\u201cHe had a big, awful accident while playing with a bomb when he was a child. And his brother, Sergio, died when he was young,\u201d Molho added.",
      "Armani became close to Sergio\u2019s daughters, Silvana and Roberta, and brought his nieces into his company.",
      "\u201cHe was warm, careful. When he was talking to you \u2014 even for a short moment \u2014 he was with you. When he was asking \u2018How are you?\u2019 he was listening to the answer,\u201d Molho said.",
      "The Armani name, a byword for glamour and luxury, for the rich and powerful, still resonates with ordinary people in this part of Italy.",
      "Local officials estimate that 16,000 people lined up over the weekend to pay their last respects. Per the designer\u2019s instructions, his coffin was laid in the Armani Theater in Milan \u2014 the stage of his runway shows.",
      "Many of those who stood in line for hours appeared to have personal connections to Armani, having been employed by his empire, which over the years branched out from fashion to makeup and perfume, hotels and restaurants.",
      "Some wept openly as they waited. The murmurs of the people in the line died down the moment they stepped into the dark auditorium, lit only by 300 candles on the floor and Armani\u2019s picture projected on the wall. The music of Italian composer Luigi Einaudi played in the background.",
      "Most walked over and touched the closed casket. One man genuflected. All the while, Armani\u2019s longtime partner, Leo Dell\u2019Orco, and family sat or stood around wiping tears, talking and welcoming those who they knew.",
      "A number of people walked over to embrace family members standing nearby.",
      "\u201cHe was a second father. He was a second family,\u201d said Fabio Mancini, the Italian supermodel who for 20 years was one of the most recognizable faces, and bodies, of the Armani brand.",
      "Armani hired Mancini when he was just 18 after having spotted him walking by a photoshoot near the Armani boutique in central Milan.",
      "\u201cIt was life-changing,\u201d Mancini said.",
      "He recalled how nervous he was before his first runway and how Armani took him under his wing.",
      "\u201cI was backstage, I was looking around, and my question was \u2018What am I doing here?\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Mancini said Armani looked at him and smiled a little as he said: \u201cRemember, now you represent Italy.\u201d",
      "He said that, by his example, Armani helped shape the person he has become.",
      "\u201cTwenty years later, in my last fashion show, he did the same,\u201d Mancini added. \u201cHe was looking at me, smiling, and he told me, \u2018Do you remember the first time? Now you\u2019re a man.\u2019\u201d",
      "Armani leaves a legacy that goes beyond the circle of those who knew him or worked for him.",
      "In the late 1970s and \u201980s, he revolutionized fashion by giving men light, more comfortable jackets and women the power suit.",
      "\u201cHe had very good instincts for social change,\u201d Molho said. \u201cHe understood that women were making very important careers and they needed to be feminine but to have authority.\u201d",
      "Armani started his company with a small investment in 1975 and was able to turn it into a multibillion-dollar business. Today it is one of the few major fashion houses that is still privately owned.",
      "He was planning a big party at the end of September to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his brand. He reviewed and approved the collection to be showcased at the party just a few days before he died Thursday at 91.",
      "His will is set to be unsealed after his funeral, and it is likely to hold the answer about what will happen to the Armani brand.",
      "Molho said Armani\u2019s death is a turning point for the whole fashion world: \u201cFashion will miss a piece. It\u2019s like a big puzzle, and we\u2019ll miss the biggest part, the biggest piece.\u201d"

      "Informally known as \u201cGod\u2019s influencer,\u201d Acutis was just 15 when he died of acute promyelocytic leukemia in Milan in 2006 and has two miracles attributed to him by the Catholic Church.",
      "The Vatican said 36 cardinals, 270 bishops and hundreds of priests had signed up to celebrate the Mass, where Leo also canonized Pier Giorgio Frassati, another popular Italian who died young.",
      "Acutis was born in London, where his father, Andrea Acutis, 61, was working as a banker, but the family moved back to Milan when he was young.",
      "Using the family\u2019s small, old computer, Acutis taught himself how to program, and built a website cataloging more than 100 Eucharistic miracles around the world that had been recognized by the church over many centuries.",
      "Sunday\u2019s ceremony in front of the Vatican\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, in conjunction with the celebration of the Holy Year\u2019s jubilee for teens, was originally set for April but was postponed after the death of Pope Francis, who called the internet a \u201cgift from God\u201d and encouraged the Vatican to use technology.",
      "Francis had pushed for Acutis to be given a sainthood in the hope that it would give the next generation of Catholics a relatable role model and attract young people to the faith.",
      "An estimated 80,000 people attended the open-air Mass on Sunday, many of them millennials and couples with young children.",
      "Francis approved a miracle attributed to Acutis in 2020, declaring him \u201cblessed\u201d and crediting him with healing Matheus Vianna, a 7-year-old boy from Brazil who recovered from a rare pancreatic disorder after coming into contact with one of Carlo\u2019s T-shirts.",
      "A second miracle was attributed to Acutis last year, in which he was credited with the complete healing of Costa Rican student Valeria Valverde from major head trauma sustained in a bicycle accident, after her mother prayed at his tomb.",
      "Acutis\u2019 mother, Antonia Salzano, 58, said that in many ways, her son was just like any other teenager who liked playing video games, hanging out with his friends and playing soccer.",
      "\u201cHe was a normal kid, he was a normal person, but he opened the door of his heart to God,\u201d she said earlier this year.",
      "Being made a saint means the church believes a person lived a holy life and is now in heaven with God.",
      "It is impossible to quantify exactly how many saints there are. During the church\u2019s first 1,000 years, they were proclaimed by popular demand, but some estimates have the number exceeding 10,000."

      "Informally known as \u201cGod\u2019s influencer\u201d Carlo was just 15 when he died of acute promyelocytic leukemia in Milan in 2006 and has two miracles attributed to him by the Catholic Church. Being made a saint means the church believes a person lived a holy life and is now in heaven with God.",
      "But in an interview with NBC News, his mother, Antonia Salzano, 58, said that in many ways, her son was just like any other teenager who liked playing video games, hanging out with his friends and playing soccer.",
      "\u201cHe was a normal kid, he was a normal person, but he opened the door of his heart to God,\u201d she said earlier this year.",
      "Carlo was born in London, where his father, Andrea Acutis, 61, was working as a merchant banker, but the family moved back to Milan when he was young. Salzano said that from an early age, Carlo \u201cwas always generous with his things.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf I wanted to buy, for example, two pairs of shoes, he used to say, \u2018No, one is sufficient because there are people who are starving who don\u2019t have anything to eat. So we don\u2019t have to waste money. Let\u2019s help other people.\u2019\u201d",
      "Carlo was put on the path toward sainthood after the late Pope Francis approved a miracle attributed to him in 2020, declaring him \u201cblessed\u201d and crediting him with healing Matheus Vianna, a 7-year-old boy from Brazil who recovered from a rare pancreatic disorder after coming into contact with one of Carlo\u2019s T-shirts.",
      "That path was further paved last year when a second miracle was attributed to Carlo, in which he was credited with the complete healing of Costa Rican student Valeria Valverde from major head trauma sustained in a bicycle accident, after her mother prayed at his tomb.",
      "But from an early age, Salzano said, he taught himself how to program computers and was asking her to buy books trained engineers might use. \u201cHe had a special skill, probably something unbelievable. I couldn\u2019t understand how it would be so. But he used what he had in the heart, the love of God, to maximize for spreading the faith,\u201d she added.",
      "Using the family\u2019s small, old computer, Carlo taught himself how to program and built a website cataloging more than 100 Eucharistic miracles around the world that had been recognized by the church over many centuries.",
      "But while programming was his passion, Salzano said, she thought he would likely have become a priest, as he had asked her about pursuing a career in the church. After receiving his First Communion at the age of 7, he attended daily Mass regularly and taught catechism in a local parish.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to help people to discover their faith, to discover God, the love of God. And all his life was spent for this. Even if he lived a normal life, like young boys of his age,\u201d she added.",
      "At just 15 years old, in October 2006, he fell ill and within 10 days died of acute promyelocytic leukemia.",
      "While his suffering caused her a lot of pain, Salzano said, \u201cif we leave suffering, offering to God, we can be in a certain way a little savior, like Jesus, we can help other people with our prayers.\u201d",
      "While she misses her son, she added that she had faith and knew \u201cthat death is to say goodbye, not the end of everything. But death, as Carlo used to say, is the start of the true life.\u201d",
      "In 2018, Carlo was named \u201cvenerable\u201d after the church recognized his virtuous life, and his body was taken to a shrine in the Santuario della Spogliazione in the small town of Assisi in central Italy.",
      "He asked for that to be his final resting place because of his devotion to the medieval saint St. Francis, whose hometown was Assisi. Wearing a track top, jeans and sneakers, he lies there entombed with a wax mold of his likeness placed over his body.",
      "Today it is a popular devotional site, attracting thousands of worshippers every day, Monsignor Anthony Figueiredo said in an interview earlier this year.",
      "\u201cThis is a saint in front of our eyes, and he\u2019s a different kind of saint, you can see with jeans and sneakers and a hoodie exactly as he dressed,\u201d he said, adding that Carlo had been inspired by Apple founder Steve Jobs, who had said that at the end of each day, he had wanted to know he had \u201cdone something wonderful for someone else.\u201d",

      "A sea of agents from HSI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies showed up Thursday to a construction site in the town of Ellabell, where the South Korean companies Hyundai and LG Energy Solution are jointly building a battery plant next to their manufacturing facility for electric vehicles.",
      "Videos on social media showed agents lining up hundreds of workers at the construction site. Schrank said they questioned everyone about their immigration status, reviewing their documents and conducting background checks.",
      "\"This was not a immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks and put them on buses. This has been a multimonth criminal investigation,\" Schranck said.",
      "No criminal charges in connection to the investigation had been filed as of Friday.",
      "On Friday afternoon, a judge in the Southern District Court of Georgia unsealed the 15-page search warrant allowing federal agents to go into \u201cthe lithium battery cell manufacturing plant\u201d on the Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America campus \u201cthat is currently under construction.\u201d",
      "The warrant authorized federal agents to seize employment records and immigration documents as well as ownership and management records related to the construction site.",
      "According to the warrant, authorities were also looking for four individuals, but the reasons why the federal government was specifically interested in them remain under seal.",
      "U.S. Attorney Margaret E. Heap said in a statement that more than 400 agents participated in the massive enforcement action, part of the broader nationwide initiative \u201cOperation Take Back America,\u201d described as an effort \u201cto repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations.\u201d",

      "Lee added that an on-site task force will be established in Georgia with the help of the South Korean consulate in Atlanta.",
      "According to Schrank, the workers arrested at the construction site were employed by a network of various contractors and subcontractors, which investigators are looking into.",

      "Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-based immigration attorney representing two of the detained South Korean nationals, told NBC News that his clients were in the U.S. on the Visa Waiver Program, which permits tourism or business stays of up to 90 days.",
      "\"I\u2019m convinced neither of these guys are violating their status in any way,\u201d Kuck said, adding that both of his clients are process engineers who came over for meetings related to the construction of the new plant.",
      "\u201cOne had gotten here Tuesday and was going home next week,\u201d Kuck said. \u201cHe was on site that morning, literally sitting in a conference room in his shirt and tie with a vest on from the company, waiting for a meeting, doing exactly what he\u2019s allowed to do under a visa waiver.\u201d",
      "South Korea, the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy, is a major automotive and electronics manufacturer whose companies have multiple plants in the United States. In July, Seoul pledged $350 billion in U.S. investment in an effort to lower Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs on its products, which he ended up setting at 15%.",

      "Hyundai's electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Georgia, where the raided construction site stands, is one of the largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites in the state.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials have said that the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,400 people, is the largest economic development project in the state\u2019s history.",
      "Hyundai, South Korea\u2019s biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles there about a year ago. The company recently partnered with LG Energy Solution to build the adjacent battery plant, expected to open next year, where the immigration raid took place."

    "summary": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party deputy Angela Rayner resigned Friday after admitting underpaying property taxes.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Somehow, it keeps getting worse for Keir Starmer.",
      "The British Prime Minister was already in the mire: His economy is barely growing, ascendant critics assail him from the left and right, and his popularity has tanked to historic levels just a year after a landslide victory.",
      "And on Friday Starmer suffered perhaps his most significant setback yet when his influential deputy resigned after admitting she underpaid 40,000 pounds (around $54,000) in property taxes.",
      "Angela Rayner, 45, has not always agreed with Starmer but has been a key figure in his Labour Party, seen as a counterweight voice for its disgruntled left-wing against their leader's centrist conservatism.",
      "After months of press speculation, Rayner admitted this week that she failed to pay enough property taxes \u2014 known as \u201cstamp duty.\u201d She said she believed she had followed the rules, and was tripped up by her \u201ccomplex living arrangements,\u201d including her 2023 divorce and son with special educational needs.",
      "All this played out while she served as the government\u2019s housing secretary as well as its deputy leader.",
      "She referred herself to the independent adviser on ministerial standards, Laurie Magnus, who acts as a watchdog appointed by the prime minister. Rayner promptly resigned her role as deputy prime minister and housing minister after his report was delivered Friday.",
      "\"I take full responsibility for this error,\" she said in a letter to Starmer, accepting she \"did not meet the highest standards in relation to my recent property purchase.\"",
      "She said that while \"it was never my intention to do anything other than pay the right amount,\" she \"must also consider the significant toll that the ongoing pressure of the media is taking on my family.\"",
      "Magnus' report agreed that Rayner had acted \"in good faith,\" believing that she was paying the correct amount of tax during the purchase of her 800,000 pound seaside apartment in Hove, on the south coast of England, in May. However he said that Rayner broke the Ministerial Code (a set of rules and standards for people in the government to follow) because she did not follow her solicitors' advice to seek specific tax guidance.",
      "Had she done so, Magnus said, she would have known the correct amount was 70,000 pounds rather than the 30,000 she paid.",
      "\"I believe Ms. Rayner has acted with integrity and with a dedicated and exemplary commitment to public service,\" he said.  But he faulted her \"unfortunate failure\" to pay her taxes correctly, particularly given she was minister for housing at the time.",
      "Tax experts say Rayner will likely now face a fine of up to 12,000 pounds from His Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs, Britain\u2019s tax authority.",
      "Starmer under pressure",
      "In a handwritten note, Starmer said he was \"very sad\" that Rayner's tenure had \"ended in this way,\" but said it was \"right\" that she had acted on the conclusion of her ethics report despite knowing it was \"very painful\" for her.",
      "Kemi Badenoch, leader of the opposition Conservative Party, reacted to her resignation by accusing Starmer of having \"no principle, no backbone\" and saying that \"questions remain\" about what he knew, and when.",
      "Just 14 months ago, Starmer won a historic landslide victory against a Conservative Party whose 14-year rule had ended in scandal and widespread public disdain. But polls suggested that his victory owed as much to his opponent\u2019s toxic image as any ringing enthusiasm for his own platform.",
      "Whereas his predecessor as party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, had sought to take Labour back to its leftist roots, Starmer was more in the mold of Tony Blair: relatively progressive social values mixed with economic conservatism that critics say departed little from his right-wing opponents.",
      "That alleged caution has been met with opposition from multiple sides.",
      "Many on the left see him as maddeningly unimaginative in the face of a long-term economic malaise that they say requires radical, progressive action. And the right see him as too soft on immigration, most notably the \u201csmall boats\u201d crisis that continues to see tens of thousands of asylum seekers cross the English Channel each year.",
      "Immigration is now the top priority for voters, polls show, and opinion surveys are now led by Nigel Farage, the friend and ally of American President Donald Trump, who leads the Reform political party.",
      "If he becomes prime minister after the next election scheduled for 2029, Farage has promised to enact a mass deportation scheme removing 600,000 undocumented migrants from Britain.",
      "A teenage mother who grew up in socialized housing in the northern town of Stockport, Rayner is widely seen as holding an everyman touch that resonated with voters in a way Starmer never has.",
      "She was viewed as a vital weapon in Labour\u2019s defense against the rising working-class anger being so successfully harnessed by Farage \u2014 and therefore her exit represents a powerful loss for the government.",
      "Rayner\u2019s departure is doubly significant because she also quit from the role of deputy party leader, which is chosen by the party members, rather than Starmer himself.",
      "This means a more outspoken left-wing lawmaker could be voted into the role \u2014 increasing the pressure on Starmer to veer left in search of a solution."
